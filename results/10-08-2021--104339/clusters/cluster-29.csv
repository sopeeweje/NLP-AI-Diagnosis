"AmplideX DeepNet, a new paradigm for deep learning analytical tools in the molecular diagnostic space Project Summary  An extensible analysis platform will be developed to accurately perform the automated genotyping of PCR/capillary electrophoresis (CE) traces for multiple disease-associated short tandem repeater (STR) assays. This study will evaluate the feasibility of developing generalizable and adaptive molecular analysis models, and will ultimately establish a new paradigm for deep learning analytical tools in the molecular diagnostic space.  Advanced machine learning strategies will be applied to interpret genotypes of inherited disorders caused by genetically unstable STR DNA sequences. STRs have traditionally been difficult to investigate due to their length (on the order of kilobases) and low sequence complexity, which elude detection by traditional and next- generation sequencing technologies. However, advances in PCR/CE technology have enabled the amplification and fragment sizing of STR DNA fragments, advancing clinical research and diagnostic test development for several neurodegenerative disorders, such as fragile X syndrome and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Despite these advances, the analysis of PCR/CE data from assays targeting STRs remains a manual, burdensome, and subjective process. There is a clear need to create a system that can scale with the development of new assays, and the proposed approach utilizes modern breakthroughs in artificial intelligence to fulfill that need.  This method will leverage recent advances in representation learning to establish a generalized and adaptive framework for automated PCR/CE annotation that can scale to new assays and improve automatically with the inclusion of new data. The project will benefit from Asuragen’s experience in optimizing repeat-primed chemistries to develop and commercialize multiple high performance assays including the AmplideX PCR/CE FMR1 kit. Importantly, the proposed modeling strategy will borrow-strength across multiple established PCR/CE assays and generalize to future PCR/CE assays for novel STR disease associated biomarkers. This system will be paramount to enabling a continuous learning platform wherein computationally-assisted annotation of PCR/CE assays can be continuously improved and integrated in to clinical research tools and diagnostics. Project Narrative  We are developing AmplideX DeepNet, an artificial intelligence-based analysis system that can accurately perform computationally-assisted analysis of molecular diagnostic assays. The proposed system will build upon recent breakthroughs in artificial intelligence to allow it to easily adapt to new assays and to continue to improve. The system will be applied to assays for several disorders, including fragile X syndrome, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), myotonic dystrophy, and Huntington’s disease, and will provide a number of benefits over current analysis methods by reducing turn-around time for assay results and assuring reproducible reporting between operators and labs.","AmplideX DeepNet, a new paradigm for deep learning analytical tools in the molecular diagnostic space",9678895,R43GM128498,"['Alleles', 'American', 'Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automated Annotation', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'C9ORF72', 'Capillary Electrophoresis', 'Chemistry', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'FMR1', 'FMR1 repeat', 'Fragile X Syndrome', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Hand', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Heritability', 'Huntington Disease', 'Interruption', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical Genetics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular Analysis', 'Myotonic Dystrophy', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Nucleotides', 'Pathogenicity', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Quality Control', 'Reagent', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Short Tandem Repeat', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'analysis pipeline', 'analytical tool', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'clinical diagnostics', 'cohort', 'computer framework', 'deep learning', 'design', 'diagnostic assay', 'experience', 'frontotemporal lobar dementia-amyotrophic lateral sclerosis', 'heuristics', 'human-in-the-loop', 'improved', 'instrumentation', 'learning progression', 'learning strategy', 'medical schools', 'molecular diagnostics', 'nervous system disorder', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'research and development', 'success', 'tool']",NIGMS,"ASURAGEN, INC.",R43,2019,269217,-0.001809974586050687
"Machine learning approaches for improved accuracy and speed in sequence annotation Summary/Abstract Alignment of biological sequences is a key step in understanding their evolution, function, and patterns of activity. Here, we describe Machine Learning approaches to improve both accuracy and speed of highly- sensitive sequence alignment. To improve accuracy, we develop methods to reduce erroneous annotation caused by (1) the existence of low complexity and repetitive sequence and (2) the overextension of alignments of true homologs into unrelated sequence. We describe approaches based on both hidden Markov models and Artificial Neural Networks to dramatically reduce these sorts of sequence annotation error. We also address the issue of annotation speed, with development of a custom Deep Learning architecture designed to very quickly filter away large portions of candidate sequence comparisons prior to the relatively-slow sequence-alignment step. The results of these efforts will be incorporated into forks of the open source sequence alignment tools HMMER, MMSeqs, and (where appropriate) BLAST; we will also work with community developers of annotation pipelines, such as RepeatMasker and IMG/M, to incorporate these approaches. The development and incorporation into these widely used bioinformatics tools will lead to widespread impact on sequence annotation efforts. Narrative Modern molecular biology depends on effective methods for creating sequence alignments quickly and accurately. This proposal describes a plan to develop novel Machine Learning approaches that will dramatically increase the speed of highly-sensitive sequence alignment, and will also address two significant sources of erroneous sequence annotation, (i) the presence of repetitive sequence in biological sequences, and (ii) the tendency for sequence alignment algorithms to extend alignments beyond the boundaries of true homology. The proposed methods represent a mix of applications of hidden Markov models and Artificial Neural Networks, and build on prior success in applying such methods to the problem of sensitive sequence annotation.",Machine learning approaches for improved accuracy and speed in sequence annotation,9887588,R01GM132600,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Consumption', 'Custom', 'DNA Transposable Elements', 'Data Set', 'Deletion Mutation', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Error Sources', 'Evolution', 'Foundations', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Industry Standard', 'Insertion Mutation', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Label', 'Letters', 'Licensing', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Masks', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular Biology', 'Network-based', 'Nucleotides', 'Pattern', 'Pilot Projects', 'Proteins', 'Repetitive Sequence', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Statistical Models', 'Takifugu', 'Work', 'annotation  system', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'bioinformatics tool', 'computing resources', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'density', 'design', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'markov model', 'neural network architecture', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'software development', 'statistics', 'success', 'tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MONTANA,R01,2019,286435,-0.008702125079370564
"Evidence Extraction Systems for the Molecular Interaction Literature Burns, Gully A. Abstract  In primary research articles, scientists make claims based on evidence from experiments, and report both the claims and the supporting evidence in the results section of papers. However, biomedical databases de- scribe the claims made by scientists in detail, but rarely provide descriptions of any supporting evidence that a consulting scientist could use to understand why the claims are being made. Currently, the process of curating evidence into databases is manual, time-consuming and expensive; thus, evidence is recorded in papers but not generally captured in database systems. For example, the European Bioinformatics Institute's INTACT database describes how different molecules biochemically interact with each other in detail. They characterize the under- lying experiment providing the evidence of that interaction with only two hierarchical variables: a code denoting the method used to detect the molecular interaction and another code denoting the method used to detect each molecule. In fact, INTACT describes 94 different types of interaction detection method that could be used in conjunction with other experimental methodological processes that can be used in a variety of different ways to reveal different details about the interaction. This crucial information is not being captured in databases. Although experimental evidence is complex, it conforms to certain principles of experimental design: experimentally study- ing a phenomenon typically involves measuring well-chosen dependent variables whilst altering the values of equally well-chosen independent variables. Exploiting these principles has permitted us to devise a preliminary, robust, general-purpose representation for experimental evidence. In this project, We will use this representation to describe the methods and data pertaining to evidence underpinning the interpretive assertions about molecular interactions described by INTACT. A key contribution of our project is that we will develop methods to extract this evidence from scientiﬁc papers automatically (A) by using image processing on a speciﬁc subtype of ﬁgure that is common in molecular biology papers and (B) by using natural language processing to read information from the text used by scientists to describe their results. We will develop these tools for the INTACT repository but package them so that they may then also be used for evidence pertaining to other areas of research in biomedicine. Burns, Gully A. Narrative  Molecular biology databases contain crucial information for the study of human disease (especially cancer), but they omit details of scientiﬁc evidence. Our work will provide detailed accounts of experimental evidence supporting claims pertaining to the study of these diseases. This additional detail may provide scientists with more powerful ways of detecting anomalies and resolving contradictory ﬁndings.",Evidence Extraction Systems for the Molecular Interaction Literature,9772541,R01LM012592,"['Area', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Burn injury', 'Classification', 'Co-Immunoprecipitations', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Consult', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Database Management Systems', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'European', 'Event', 'Experimental Designs', 'Experimental Models', 'Gel', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Graph', 'Image', 'Informatics', 'Institutes', 'Intelligence', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Weight', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Paper', 'Pattern', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Privatization', 'Process', 'Protein Structure Initiative', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Reading', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Scientist', 'Source Code', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Taxonomy', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Typology', 'Western Blotting', 'Work', 'base', 'data modeling', 'experimental study', 'human disease', 'image processing', 'learning strategy', 'open source', 'optical character recognition', 'protein protein interaction', 'repository', 'software systems', 'text searching', 'tool']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2019,264255,-0.00904027807458019
"Image-guided robot for high-throughput microinjection of Drosophila embryos PROJECT SUMMARY This proposal is submitted in response to the NIH Development of Animal Models and Related Biological Materials for Research (R21) program. The proposal develops an image-guided robotic platform that performs the automated delivery of molecular genetic tools and non-genetically encoded reagents such as chemical libraries, fluorescent dyes to monitor cellular processes, functionalized magnetic beads, or nanoparticles into thousands of Drosophila embryos in a single experimental session. The proposed work builds on recent engineering innovations in our collaborative group which has developed image-guided robotic systems that can precisely interface with single cells in intact tissue. The two Specific Aims provide for a systematic development of the proposed technologies. AIM 1 first engineers a robotic platform (‘Autoinjector’) that can scan and image Drosophila embryos in arrays of egg laying plates. We will utilize machine learning algorithms for automated detection of embryos, followed by thresholding and morphology analysis to detect embryo centroids and annotate injection sites. In AIM 2, we will utilize microprocessor-controlled fluidic circuits for programmatic delivery of femtoliter to nanoliter volumes of reagents into individual embryos. We will quantify the efficacy of the Autoinjector by comparing the survival, fertility, and transformation rates of transposon or PhiC31-mediated transgenesis to manual microinjection datasets. Finally, we will demonstrate the efficient delivery of sgRNAs and mutagenesis in the presence of Cas9. This project fits very well within the goals of the program by engineering a novel tool for producing and improving animal models. The Autoinjector will accelerate Drosophila research and empower scientists to perform novel experiments and genome-scale functional genomics screens that are currently too inefficient or labor intensive to be conducted on a large scale and may additionally enable other novel future applications. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal develops a technology platform that will enable automated microinjection of molecular genetic tools and non-genetically encoded tools such as chemical libraries, fluorescent dyes, functionalized magnetic beads, or nanoparticles, into thousands of Drosophila embryos in a single experimental session.

"Integrated Instrument for non-natural aptamer generation Project Summary DNA and RNA aptamers are a useful class of synthetic affinity reagents. However, their performance can be greatly improved through the site-specific incorporation of chemically modified, ‘non-natural’ nucleotides that provide a greater chemical repertoire to enable superior aptamer affinity and specificity. Because a broad spectrum of chemical functional groups can be incorporated, non-natural aptamers offer the exciting potential for targeting molecules for which the generation of monoclonal antibodies remains difficult, such as small- molecule drugs, metabolites and carbohydrates. Unfortunately, the access to non-natural aptamers is severely limited. This is because the process of generating non-natural aptamers is technically challenging and limited to a few specialized laboratories. The goal of this project is to develop an integrated instrument, the Non-Natural Aptamer Array (N2A2) that eliminates these bottlenecks and enable rapid and facile non-natural aptamer discovery at virtually any research laboratory. The N2A2 will be built on a modified version of a benchtop commercial sequencer (Illumina MiSeq), and will perform every stage of non-natural aptamer discovery— including sequencing, screening and binding measurements—as part of a single work-flow. There are three main innovative aspects of our N2A2 system. First, our approach will entirely eliminate the need for polymerase engineering, and thus allows us to incorporate virtually any chemical functional group through click chemistry. Second, N2A2 will enable us to directly obtain the binding affinity (Kd) of ~10^7 aptamers directly in complex samples (e.g. cell lysate or serum), thereby resulting in aptamers with high-specificity. Finally, we will develop a machine-learning (ML) approach to identify key motifs (“k-mers”) and predict novel sequences with potentially higher affinity and specificity that can be tested using the N2A2 instrument. We believe this powerful combination of massively parallel, sequence-linked binding measurements with ML-based predictions will allow us to explore sequence space that is currently inaccessible to traditional in vitro selection methods, and enable us to discover aptamers with superior performance. The success of this project will produce an integrated instrument that greatly streamlines and accelerates the discovery of non-natural aptamers for a wide range of targets in complex media. The instrument is based on a commercially available sequencer and we will make all software available to the public. In this way, we believe the N2A2 instrument could broadly expand access to robust, high quality, custom affinity reagents for biomedical research and clinical diagnostics. Project Narrative We will develop an integrated instrument that simplifies the discovery of non-natural aptamer reagents for a wide range of molecules that are difficult to target using conventional antibody reagents. The access to these custom reagents will accelerate biomedical research and clinical diagnostics.",Integrated Instrument for non-natural aptamer generation,9705993,R01GM129313,"['Affinity', 'Algorithms', 'Antibodies', 'Binding', 'Biomedical Research', 'Carbohydrates', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Chinese Hamster Ovary Cell', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Directed Molecular Evolution', 'Engineering', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'In Vitro', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Research', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monoclonal Antibodies', 'Nucleotides', 'Opioid', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Polymerase', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Reagent', 'Reproducibility', 'SLEB2 gene', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'System', 'Testing', 'Tyrosine', 'Work', 'analysis pipeline', 'aptamer', 'base', 'clinical diagnostics', 'functional group', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'machine learning algorithm', 'novel', 'scaffold', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'success', 'virtual']",NIGMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,314000,-0.011383586305577939
"Software for Antibody Epitope Prediction Accurate epitope prediction is important for the development of antibody-based therapies. When multiple new antibodies are discovered against the whole antigen, their epitopes and, therefore, potential novelty and mechanism of action are usually unknown Site-directed mutagenesis, the routine method for epitope mapping, requires testing a large number of mutants since any part of the antigen can potentially form an epitope The goal of this proposal is developing methodology and software for the accurate computational prediction of discontinuous B-cell epitopes based on the structure of an antigen and the structure or sequence of an antibody. Our starting point is PIPER, a protein-protein docking program licensed by Acpharis from Boston University. PIPER is the docking engine in the software packages BioLuminate by Schrodinger and the CyrusBench Suite of Cyrus Biotechnology, as well as in the public server ClusPro. PIPER has a special option for antibody-antigen docking, and has been used for epitope prediction. However, in its present form the software generally results in a high number of putative epitopes, and more accurate prediction requires substantial experimental efforts, e.g., by site-directed mutagenesis. We will modify PIPER to maximize the information available from the docking by generating a large ensemble of low energy docked structures and calculating a contact map rather than discrete docked structures. The number of potential epitopes will be further reduced by a template-based approach based on vector contact maps to characterize antibody-antigen interfaces. We also explore predicting the epitope based on models of the CDR regions. Generating large ensembles of docked structures with a large variety of CDR conformations will reduce the sensitivity of the method to inevitable modeling and docking uncertainty. By increasing the reliability of the predicted epitopes, we expect to reduce or even to eliminate the need for mutagenesis experiments. Finally, we will develop a machine- learning algorithm for the mapping of amino acid composition of CDR regions into epitope composition, a method that can be used when only the antibody sequence available and structure prediction is uncertain due to the lack of suitable templates. When multiple new antibodies are discovered against a whole antigen, their epitopes and, therefore, potential novelty and mechanism of action are usually unknown. Computational software tools can significantly reduce experimental efforts required for epitope determination by guiding experimental efforts toward most probable epitope locations. We propose new computational capabilities based on protein-protein docking and machine learning, which are specifically designed to improve the accuracy of epitope prediction.",Software for Antibody Epitope Prediction,9845171,R43GM134769,"['Address', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Amino Acids', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Binding Sites', 'Antibody Therapy', 'Antigen-Antibody Complex', 'Antigens', 'B-Lymphocyte Epitopes', 'Base Sequence', 'Biotechnology', 'Boston', 'Collection', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Crystallization', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Docking', 'Epitope Mapping', 'Epitopes', 'Goals', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Mutagenesis', 'Probability', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Scheme', 'Site-Directed Mutagenesis', 'Software Tools', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'Surface Antigens', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'Universities', 'Vertebral column', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'design', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mutant', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'vector']",NIGMS,"ACPHARIS, INC.",R43,2019,149999,-0.025715736312336705
"Selective Whole Genome Amplification - Enabling Microbial Population Genomics Microbial population genetic research has been crucial for understanding pathogen dynamics, virulence, host specificity, and many other topics; in many cases uncovering unexpected and transformative biological processes. However, conventional population genetic analyses are limited by the quantity of sequence data from each sample. The temporal, spatial, and evolutionary resolution of techniques that rely on single gene sequences or multi-locus sequence typing are often insufficient to study biological processes on fine scales, precisely the scales at which many evolutionary and mechanistic process occur. Population genomics offers a vast quantity of sequence information for inferring evolutionary and ecological processes on very fine spatial and temporal scales, inferences that are critical to understanding and eventually controlling many infectious diseases. The promise of population genomics is tempered, however, by difficulties in isolating and preparing microbes for next-generation sequencing. We have developed the selective whole genome amplification (SWGA) technology to sequence microbial genomes from complex biological specimens without relying on labor-intensive laboratory culture, even if the focal microbial genome constitutes only a miniscule fraction of the natural sample. The primary hindrance to popular adoption of SWGA for microbial genomic studies is not its effectiveness in producing samples suitable for next-generation sequencing but in the upfront investment needed to develop an effective protocol to amplify the genome of a specific microbial species. Identifying an SWGA protocol that consistently results in selective and even amplification across the target genome is currently hindered by computationally-inefficient software that can evaluate a very limited set of the potentially effective solutions. Further, this software uses marginally-effective optimality criteria as there is currently only a limited understanding of the true criteria that result in highly-selective and even amplification of a target genome. As a result, SWGA protocol development is currently costly in both time and resources. A primary goal of the proposed research is to identify the criteria that result in optimal SWGA by analyzing next- generation sequencing data with advanced machine learning techniques. These optimality criteria will be integrated into a freely-available, computationally-efficient swga development program that will reduce the upfront investment in SWGA protocol development, thus allowing researchers to address medically- and biologically-important questions in any microbial species. In the near term, this project will also generate effective SWGA protocols for four microbial species which can be used immediately to address fundamental questions in evolutionary biology, disease progression, and emerging infectious disease dynamics. From a global disease perspective, this work is imperative as the majority of microbial species cannot easily be cultured and are in danger of becoming bystanders in the genomics revolution that is currently elucidating evolutionary processes and molecular mechanisms in cultivable microbial species. Addressing many of the major outstanding questions about pathogen evolution will require analyses of populations of microbial genomes. Although population genomic studies would provide the analytical resolution to investigate evolutionary and mechanistic processes on fine spatial and temporal scales – precisely the scales at which these processes occur – microbial population genomic research is currently hindered by the practicalities of obtaining sufficient quantities of genomes to analyze. We propose to develop an innovative, cost-effective, practical, and publically-available technology to collect sufficient quantities of microbial genomic DNA necessary for next-generation microbial genome sequencing.",Selective Whole Genome Amplification - Enabling Microbial Population Genomics,9699440,R21AI137433,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Characteristics', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Coupling', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Effectiveness', 'Emerging Communicable Diseases', 'Evolution', 'Foundations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Research', 'Genome', 'Genomic DNA', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Investigation', 'Investments', 'Laboratory culture', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Metaphor', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Microbial Genome Sequencing', 'Microsatellite Repeats', 'Molecular', 'Organism', 'Population', 'Population Analysis', 'Population Genetics', 'Process', 'Program Development', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Shapes', 'Specificity', 'Specimen', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Virulence', 'Work', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'design', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic approach', 'host-microbe interactions', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'microbial', 'microbial genome', 'next generation', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'prevent', 'protocol development', 'vector', 'whole genome']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R21,2019,186101,-0.006254508283429442

Reactome is a curated, open access biomolecular pathway database that can be freely used and redistributed by all members of the biological research community. It is used by clinicians, geneti- cists, genomics researchers, and molecular biologists to interpret the results of high-throughput experimental studies, by bioinformaticians seeking to develop novel algorithms for mining knowledge from genomic studies, and by systems biologists building predictive models of normal and disease variant pathways.

"DNA Sequencing Using Single Molecule Electronics PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  Progress in DNA sequencing has occurred through multiple stages of disruptive new technologies being introduced to the field, each of which has increased sequencing capabilities by lowering costs, improving throughput, and reducing errors. The goal of this research project is to investigate a new, all-electronic sequencing method that has the potential to become the next transformative step for DNA sequencing. This new method is based on single DNA polymerase molecules bound to nanoscale electronic transistors, a hybrid device that transduces the activity of a single polymerase molecule into an electronic signal.  The goal of this research project is to determine whether these hybrid polymerase-transistors are truly applicable to DNA sequencing and the competitive environment of advanced sequencing technologies. To answer this question, the project teams the scientists who have developed the devices with Illumina, Inc., a worldwide leader in the DNA sequencing market. The experiments proposed here build on encouraging preliminary results, first to demonstrate accurate DNA sequencing and second to evaluate whether the new technique could become a competitive challenge to other sequencing methods. The interdisciplinary team will combine state-of-the-art techniques from protein engineering, nanoscale fabrication, and machine learning to customize polymerase's activity and its interactions with the electronic transistors. If successful, nanoscale solid-state devices like transistors provide one of the best opportunities for increasing sequencing capabilities while decreasing sequencing costs, so that DNA sequencing can become a standard technique in health care and disease treatment. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Over the past two decades, DNA sequencing has transformed from a heroic, nearly impossible task to a routine component of modern laboratory research. The field of DNA sequencing has improved tremendously through a strategy of modifying and monitoring polymerases, a key enzyme at the heart of many DNA sequencing technologies. This proposal is motivated by developments in the field of single-molecule electronics, which provide an entirely new mode for listening to the activity of single polymerase molecules. This electronic method is very different from the biochemical, optical, or nanopore-based techniques currently in use, and it has inherent advantages that could provide exciting possibilities for DNA sequencing. The project will tailor single-molecule electronics for the specific purpose of DNA sequencing and determine whether this strategy could lead to a new generation of sequencing technology.",DNA Sequencing Using Single Molecule Electronics,9766330,R01HG009188,"['Affect', 'Base Pairing', 'Biochemical', 'Carbon', 'Charge', 'Collaborations', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'DNA sequencing', 'DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Electronics', 'Enzyme Kinetics', 'Enzymes', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Heart', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Laboratory Research', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Massive Parallel Sequencing', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modernization', 'Modification', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Mutation', 'Nanotechnology', 'Noise', 'Nucleotides', 'Optics', 'Performance', 'Polymerase', 'Protein Engineering', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Reading', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Route', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Single-Stranded DNA', 'Site', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Transistors', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'competitive environment', 'cost', 'enzyme activity', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'molecular modeling', 'nanoelectronics', 'nanopore', 'nanoscale', 'new technology', 'novel', 'response', 'scale up', 'single molecule', 'single walled carbon nanotube', 'solid state']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-IRVINE,R01,2019,468098,0.003731182395274102
"Sci-Score, a tool suite to support Rigor and Transparency NIH and Journal Guidelines Project​ ​Summary While standards in reporting of scientific methods are absolutely critical to producing reproducible science, meeting such standards is tedious and difficult. Checklists and instructions are tough to follow often resulting in low and inconsistent compliance. Scientific journals and societies as well as the National Institutes of Health are now actively proposing general guidelines to address reproducibility issues, particularly in the reporting of methods,​ ​but​ ​the​ ​trickier​ ​part​ ​is​ ​to​ ​train​ ​the​ ​biomedical​ ​community​ ​to​ ​use​ ​these​ ​standards​ ​to​ ​effectively. To support new standards in methods reporting, especially the RRID standard for Rigor and Transparency of Key Biological Resources, we propose to build Sci-Score a text mining based tool suite to help authors meet the standard. Sci-Score will provide an automated check on compliance with the RRID standard already implemented by over 100 journals including Cell, Journal of Neuroscience, and eLife and other Rigor and transparency standards put forward by the NIH. The innovation behind Sci-score is the provision of a score, which can be obtained by individual investigators or journals. This score reflects an aspect of quality of methods reporting. We posit that the score will serve as a tool that investigators can use to compete with themselves​ ​and​ ​each​ ​other,​ ​the​ ​way​ ​they​ ​currently​ ​compete​ ​on​ ​metrics​ ​of​ ​popularity,​ ​i.e.,​ ​the​ ​H-index. In Phase I of this project and before, our group has successfully developed a text mining algorithm that can detect antibodies, cell lines, organisms and digital resources (all 4 RRID types) and has created a preliminary score. We propose to extend this approach to all research inputs, like chemicals and plasmids that are requested as part of Cell press’ STAR Methods (http://www.cell.com/star-methods)​. We also propose to build a set of algorithms to detect whether authors discuss the major sources of irreproducibility outlined by NIH, including investigator blinding, proper randomization and sufficient reporting of sex and other biological variables. Resource identification along with other quality metrics will be used to score the quality of scientific methods section text. If successful, the tool could be used by editors, reviewers, and investigators to improve the​ ​quality​ ​of​ ​the​ ​scientific​ ​paper. Our Phase II specific aims include 1) enhancing and hardening the core natural language processing pipelines to recognize a broader range of sentences in near real time; 2) building a set of modular tools that will be provided for different groups of users to take advantage of the text mining capability we develop in aim 1. At the end of Phase II, we should have a commercially viable product that will be able to be licensed to serve the needs​ ​of​ ​the​ ​publishers​ ​and​ ​the​ ​broader​ ​research​ ​community. Standards​ ​for​ ​scientific​ ​methods​ ​reporting​ ​are​ ​absolutely​ ​critical​ ​to​ ​producing​ ​reproducible​ ​science,​ ​but​ ​meeting such​ ​standards​ ​is​ ​difficult.​ ​Checklists​ ​and​ ​instructions​ ​are​ ​tough​ ​to​ ​follow​ ​often​ ​resulting​ ​in​ ​low​ ​and​ ​inconsistent compliance.​ ​To​ ​support​ ​new​ ​standards​ ​in​ ​methods​ ​reporting,​ ​especially​ ​the​ ​RRID​ ​standard​ ​for​ ​Rigor​ ​and Transparency,​ ​we​ ​propose​ ​to​ ​build​ ​​Sci-Score​​ ​a​ ​text​ ​mining​ ​based​ ​tool​ ​suite​ ​to​ ​help​ ​authors​ ​meet​ ​the​ ​standard.

"An automated pipeline for macromolecular structure discovery in cellular  electron cryo-tomography SUMMARY – OVERALL Cellular cryo-tomography has emerged as a critical tool for the visualization and structural study of the molecular nanomachines at the heart of cellular function. Although the basic electron cryo-tomography technique has been used for several decades, the technology is being revolutionized by recent advances in sample preparation, electron cryo-microscopy hardware, improved capabilities for automatic data collection, direct electron detection imaging devices, and phase plate technologies. Combined, these advances led to the ability to generate extraordinarily large numbers of cellular cryo-tomograms of exquisite quality. In principle, such large data sets offer insights into cellular variation in disease states as well as better insights into basic cellular function, opening new possibilities for studying the underpinnings of health and disease at the finest possible level, potentially leading to completely new diagnostics for cancer and other cell-altering diseases. However, collection of cellular data is now at a far faster rate than can currently be analyzed with existing methods, producing a serious barrier to progress: to match the data production rates of a single laboratory, at least 50 experienced scientists would need to handle the data analysis. The primary goal of this Program Project is to establish quantitative and highly automated tools for the reconstruction and interpretation of highly complex cellular tomographic data. We have assembled a highly synergistic team of PIs with complimentary expertise in cutting-edge computational and experimental electron microscopy techniques to achieve this goal through collaborative efforts. Project 1 (Hanein & Penczek) focuses on development and implementation of tomogram quality assessment and validation techniques and on experimentally guided optimization of data collection strategies. Project 2 focuses on automatic tomographic reconstruction technology, extraction of various features from the tomograms, and the analysis of distribution patterns derived from the extracted features. Project 3 focuses on development of quantitative tools for tomogram annotation through deep learning and sub-tomogram alignment as well as interactive visualization tools. The set of highly automated tools developed in this Program Project will permit us to interpret 5–10x as much data as is possible using existing methods, greatly expanding the types of cellular variations we can effectively study. NARRATIVE Cellular cryo-tomography has emerged as a critical tool for the visualization and structural study of the molecular nanomachines at the heart of cellular function and—with recent instrumental advances—it is now possible to image hundreds of cells per months, enabling collection of cellular data at a far faster rate than can currently be analyzed.

"The next generation of RNA-Seq simulators for benchmarking analyses Abstract: RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq) has established itself as the primary method for studying transcription in basic research, with an emerging role in the clinic – currently upwards of 5,000 publications using the technology are indexed in PubMed. However, the interpretation of RNA-Seq requires several complex operations including alignment, quantification, normalization and statistical analyses of various types. Since its inception a large number of algorithms have appeared for each step, creating a very confusing landscape for investigators. In order to determine the best analysis practices, numerous benchmarking studies have emerged which leverage real RNA-Seq data made from well-studied RNA samples, such as the Genetic European Variation in Health and Disease (GEUVADIS) consortium data. These valuable RNA-Seq datasets contain the biases and errors introduced by sequencing biochemistry—factors that any analysis method must account for and overcome. However, the utility of such datasets for benchmarking analysis methods is limited by the fact that we do not know the underlying truth (e.g. the true number of RNA molecules from each transcript in the original sample). Therefore researchers tend to rely heavily on simulated data, since we know everything about the true composition of these samples. There are dozens of DNA simulators aimed at benchmarking applications such as variant calling. And while the need for simulators is just as strong in RNA analysis, there are only a scant few RNA-Seq simulators available. Furthermore, the available RNA- Seq simulators are based on simplifying assumptions that greatly restrict their utility for benchmarking anything but the most upstream steps in the analysis pipeline (e.g. alignment). The further downstream the analysis method is, the more accurately the true nature of real data and its technical biases need to be modeled in order to draw meaningful conclusions. For example, no simulator generates data from a diploid genome, which would be necessary to evaluate allele specific quantification. Given our extensive experience with RNA-Seq analysis and transcriptomics in general, and our success at building the BEERS simulator, and our track record of authorship on all comprehensive RNA-Seq aligner benchmarking studies published to date, we are ideally situated to develop the next generation of open-source RNA-Seq simulator which aims to model all sources of technical variability. Furthermore, the simulator will model biological variability with an empirical approach based on using real data to configure the simulator’s parameters, which is a natural problem for machine learning. There are eleven steps in RNA-Seq library preparation which introduce bias, all of which will be modeled by the software in an object-oriented modular framework. Project Narrative: There have been many algorithms developed for every step of the RNA-Seq analysis pipeline with no easy way to compare between them. Simulated data are useful for this purpose, but to date there are very few RNA-Seq simulators available and all make too many simplifying assumptions to be used for anything but the most upstream steps in the pipeline, e.g. alignment. We propose to develop the next generation of open-source RNA-Seq simulator, which will capture all of the biochemical processes in a modular fashion and model all of the sources of technical variation.",The next generation of RNA-Seq simulators for benchmarking analyses,9730605,R21LM012763,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Authorship', 'Basic Science', 'Benchmarking', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Process', 'Biochemical Reaction', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'DNA', 'DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diploidy', 'Disease', 'Enzymes', 'European', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Guanine + Cytosine Composition', 'Health', 'In Vitro', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Nature', 'Output', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Protocols documentation', 'PubMed', 'Public Domains', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'RNA', 'RNA Splicing', 'RNA analysis', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sequencing Biochemistry', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Transcript', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analog', 'analysis pipeline', 'base', 'biochemical model', 'design', 'digital', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'indexing', 'next generation', 'open source', 'operation', 'power analysis', 'success', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R21,2019,181125,-0.04359756894877002
"3D temperature control to study biological processes Project Summary Temperature control technology is necessary for a broad range of biologically relevant processes including organ-on-chip operation, biomolecular kinetics, cell growth, studying gene function with temperature-sensitive mutations, cancer cell resistance to hyperthermia treatments, protein crystallization, and DNA analysis. Most biosensing devices lack the needed temperature measurement accuracy and precise temperature control to understand the thermal mechanisms of these processes. For example, temperature variations of 0.2°C can activate heat shock proteins, increasing the resistance of cancer cells to thermal ablation treatment, but reported temperature accuracies are often near ±1°C. This proposal aims to revolutionize the biomedical temperature measurement and control ecosystem by developing technology, models, and validated devices capable of microscopic, spatially resolved temperature sensing and control at ±0.1°C accuracy (10x better than what is used in most biosensing systems). Microfluidics is a promising technology for an extremely broad range of biomedical applications that notably lacks the necessary temperature accuracies and spatial temperature control to effectively study biothermal mechanisms. This proposal intends to impact human health by developing disruptive temperature control tools to accelerate biomedical innovation in thermally sensitive processes. Our group recently demonstrated the capacity to measure temperature at a single point with fluorescent dyes, achieving a ±0.05°C noise floor by using machine learning techniques. We have also 3D printed a cell-based genotype and phenotype assay device with cell growth chambers, monoliths for mRNA capture & fluorescence measurement, and integrated pumps and valves in a volume of only 2.2 mm × 2.2 mm × 1 mm. Aims 1 and 2 of this proposal will build on these successes by developing 3D printing technologies that easily incorporate complex temperature sensing, heating, and cooling channels, coupled with multi-physics/CAD models to rapidly iterate through the prototype development cycle. These advances will be used in Aim 3 to construct a microscopically temperature-controlled chip to measure DNA melt curves to determine the zygosity of a Factor 5 Leiden. This will show that the technology can detect the subtle difference in melting temperature that is undetectable by most PCR machines, as a proof-of-concept before the technology can be applied to other biological process. The overall objective of these studies is to develop a suite of affordable technologies researchers can use to understand biothermal mechanisms to lay the foundation for advances in disease diagnosis, treatment, and prevention. Project Narrative The instruments we use to study the effects of temperature on biological processes are less accurate than humans’ own ability to perceive temperature changes. The proposed research will develop improved microscopic temperature sensing & control technologies and demonstrate them by performing DNA analysis in a 3D printed device. Because the technology is cheap and accurate, it will be widely accessible to any lab, increasing our ability to understand the fundamental role biothermal processes have in disease occurrence, diagnosis, and treatment.",3D temperature control to study biological processes,9732034,R15GM132868,"['3-Dimensional', '3D Print', 'Automation', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Biomedical Research', 'Biosensing Techniques', 'Blood specimen', 'Cells', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Crystallization', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'DNA analysis', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Ecosystem', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Factor Analysis', 'Factor V', 'Floor', 'Fluorescence', 'Fluorescent Dyes', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Genotype', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Heat Stress Disorders', 'Heat shock proteins', 'Heating', 'High temperature of physical object', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Hyperthermia', 'Institution', 'Kinetics', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Messenger RNA', 'Microfluidic Analytical Techniques', 'Microfluidic Microchips', 'Microfluidics', 'Microscopic', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Physics', 'Plant Resins', 'Prevention', 'Printing', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Pump', 'Quantum Dots', 'Reagent', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Shapes', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Source', 'Spatial Distribution', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Temperature Sense', 'Testing', 'Thermal Ablation Therapy', 'Thermometry', 'Thermoreceptors', 'Thromboembolism', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Venous', 'Work', 'base', 'biological systems', 'cancer cell', 'career', 'cell growth', 'computer science', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'experience', 'gene function', 'graduate student', 'hyperthermia treatment', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'instrument', 'melting', 'new technology', 'operation', 'organ on a chip', 'prototype', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'success', 'tool', 'undergraduate student']",NIGMS,BRIGHAM YOUNG UNIVERSITY,R15,2019,439058,-0.02731875121790019
"High-Throughput De Novo Glycan Sequencing Glycosylation fulfills important physiological functions, including protein folding, embryogenesis, cell adhesion, pathogen recognition, and immune response. The multifaceted roles glycosylation plays derive from the presence of a range of glycan epitopes, where a small structural variation can have a profound impact on functions. Further, a glycome consists of many closely related structures, with their relative amounts determined by metabolic conditions in a cell- and growth-specific manner. Altered glycosylation is linked to many diseases, including cardiovascular, pulmonary, neurological and autoimmune disorders, and cancer. Thus, there is a clear need for analytical methods that can rapidly identify and quantify the many glycoforms in a glycome from different health and disease states. Finally, no genome-predicted glycan database exists due to the unscripted nature of glycan biosynthesis, and discovery of new glycan structures must be achieved by de novo methods. Although tandem mass spectrometry-based biopolymer sequencing has been the major catalyst to the recent rapid advance of 'omics, the prevailing collisionally activated dissociation method often fails to provide sufficient glycan structural detail at the MS2 level, whereas the MSn approach lacks the speed, sensitivity, and quantitative potential for high-throughput glycome analysis. We have recently developed an electronic excitation dissociation (EED) method that can yield rich structural information in a single stage of MS/MS analysis. However, the impact of EED on glycomics research is currently limited by its poor accessibility, insufficient coupling to on-line glycan separation methods, and difficulty in interpretation of complex glycan EED tandem mass spectra. Here, we propose to develop an integrated approach that combines EED with on-line liquid chromatography (LC) separation and a novel bioinformatics tool to achieve high-throughput, de novo, and comprehensive glycome characterization. We will explore the potential of EED for analysis of glycans in various derivatized forms, study their fragmentation behaviors, and establish fragmentation rules for the development of bioinformatics software. We will optimize conditions for efficient coupling of EED to reversed-phase, and porous graphitic carbon LC, and develop an LC-EED-MS/MS approach for simultaneous characterization and quantitation of glycan mixtures. We will implement EED on a Q-TOF instrument to improve its access to the glycoscience community. Finally, we will develop and rigorously test the performance of a novel bioinformatics software that can rapidly and accurately determine each glycan's structure from its tandem MS spectra. The proposed algorithm is fundamentally different from most existing software, in that it no longer relies solely on glycosidic and cross-ring fragments for topology and linkage analysis, but rather adopts a machine learning approach that considers the contexts of various types of fragment peaks, and the spectral features associated with different linkage configurations and structural motifs. The availability of such a high-throughput, de novo glycan sequencing tool will have an immense impact on many biomedical research fields, as glycosylation plays critical roles in almost all biological pathways. High-Throughput De Novo Glycan Sequencing Project narrative Characterization of glycans from biological sources requires sensitive and high-throughput analytical methods that can separate and identify each glycoform in a complex mixture. We propose to develop an HPLC-EED- MS/MS method for comprehensive glycome characterization.

"Accelerating Multi-modal Biomarker Discovery in Translational Research with Cloud Data Integration Project Summary/Abstract Cytobank is the leading cloud-based platform for analysis and storage of single cell flow and mass cytometry data, technologies that are essential for investigating the interplay between the immune system and disease conditions including cancer. There are numerous data analysis steps between raw data and insight especially for many single-cell technologies, where the data analysis is complex, highly expert-driven and/or reliant on novel computational methodologies. Cytobank already makes major contributions (1) centralizing single-cell cytometry data, (2) providing data analysis traceability that removes knowledge sharing complexities, and (3) establishing a platform that increases access to cutting edge algorithms and makes complex machine learning methods easy for biologists to use. However, as the amount, complexity, and different types of single cell data and other associated data increases and the number of workflows and single-cell algorithms to analyze the data also increases, the need for open and easy access to existing and new tools and secure, complete storage of the workflows and the resulting data has increased to the point of being critical for supporting basic and translational research collaborations and enabling them to efficiently achieve their objectives including biomarker discovery and development. The proposed project significantly extends the capabilities of the Cytobank platform. This will benefit the community by (1) enabling scalable and secure access to a number of new single-cell data analysis tools that will result in new automated workflows, and (2) enable more efficient cross platform knowledge generation with increased meta-analysis capabilities across experiments and data types. The potential of this project is that thousands of scientists around the world will be able to more easily leverage additional single-cell cytometry, transcript, and other data in their translational research data analysis including automating analysis that has primarily been dominated by expert-driven annotation, thus providing a central repository and knowledge management framework that will accelerate biomarker discovery and precision medicine. Project Narrative Single-cell biology and Immunotherapy are exploding and generating larger and more complex datasets in combination clinical trials. To take full advantage of these revolutions, the iteration and dissemination of advanced single-cell data analysis algorithms (many of whose development was funded by the NIH) needs to scale at the same rate as single-cell data generation technologies are scaling, and multi-omics data analysis and visualization must be integrated and automated. This project will greatly accelerate scientific research, transparency, and reproducibility by significantly lowering the barrier to perform complex data analysis of multiple types of high-dimensional data, providing the biomedical research community with access to powerful tools needed in immuno-oncology, autoimmunity and other high-impact disease areas.",Accelerating Multi-modal Biomarker Discovery in Translational Research with Cloud Data Integration,9672504,R44GM117914,"['Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Autoimmunity', 'B-Cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia', 'Basic Science', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cytometry', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Follicular Lymphoma', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Generations', 'Immune System Diseases', 'Immune system', 'Immunologic Monitoring', 'Immunology', 'Immunooncology', 'Immunotherapy', 'Information Resources Management', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Multiomic Data', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Regimen', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Sharing', 'Resources', 'Scientist', 'Secure', 'System', 'Target Populations', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Toxic effect', 'Transcript', 'Translational Research', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'anti-cancer', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'biomarker development', 'biomarker discovery', 'biomarker validation', 'clinically actionable', 'cloud based', 'cost effective', 'cytokine', 'data integration', 'data management', 'data visualization', 'experimental study', 'high dimensionality', 'immunotherapy trials', 'improved', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'multidimensional data', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'personalized medicine', 'population based', 'precision medicine', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'relapse prediction', 'repository', 'response', 'single cell analysis', 'single cell technology', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'synergism', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor']",NIGMS,"CYTOBANK, INC.",R44,2019,652516,-0.003376891022980973
"Multiscale Modeling of Enzymatic Reactions and Firefly Bioluminescence Abstract Enzyme functionality is a critical component of all life systems. Whereas advances in experimental methodology have enabled a better understanding of factors that control enzyme function, critical components of the reaction space such as highly unstable intermediates and transition states are best accessed for evaluation through computational simulations. Similarly, computational methodology continues to provide a key resource for probing excited-state processes such as bioluminescence. Combined ab initio quantum mechanical molecular mechanical (ai-QM/MM) simulations are, in principle, the preferred choice in the modeling of both processes. But ai-QM/MM modeling of enzymatic reactions is now severely limited by its computational cost, where a direct ai-QM/MM free energy simulation of an enzymatic reaction can take 500,000 or more CPU hours. Meanwhile, ai-QM/MM modeling of firefly bioluminescence is also hindered by the computational accuracy, where it has yet to produce quantitatively correct predictions for the bioluminescence spectral shift with site-directed mutagenesis. The goal of this proposal is to accelerate ai-QM/MM simulations of enzymatic reaction free energy and to improve the quality of ai-QM/MM-simulated bioluminescence spectra, so that ai-QM/MM simulations can be routinely performed by experimental groups. This will be achieved via a) using a lower-level (semi-empirical QM/MM) Hamiltonian for sampling; b) an enhancement to the similarity between the two Hamiltonians by calibrating the low-level Hamiltonian using the reaction pathway force matching approach, in conjunction with several other methods. The expected outcomes of this collaborative effort include: a) advanced methodologies for accelerated reaction free energy simulations and accurate bioluminescence spectra predictions, which will be released through multiple software platforms; b) a fundamental understanding of reactions such as Kemp elimination and polymerase-eta catalyzed DNA replication; c) a deeper insight into the role of macromolecular environment in the modulation of enzyme catalytic activities or bioluminescence wavelengths, which can further enhance our capability of designing new enzymes and bioluminescence probes. Narrative This project aims to develop quantum-mechanics-based computational methods to more quickly model enzymatic reactions and more accurately model bioluminescence spectra. It will lead to reliable and efficient computational tools for use by the general scientific community. It will facilitate the probe of enzymatic reaction mechanisms and the computer-aided design of new bioluminescence probes.",Multiscale Modeling of Enzymatic Reactions and Firefly Bioluminescence,9864664,R01GM135392,"['Adopted', 'Biochemical Reaction', 'Bioluminescence', 'Calibration', 'Communities', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computer-Aided Design', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA biosynthesis', 'DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase', 'Electrostatics', 'Environment', 'Enzymes', 'Evaluation', 'Fireflies', 'Free Energy', 'Freedom', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Hour', 'Ions', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanics', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multienzyme Complexes', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Polymerase', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quantum Mechanics', 'Reaction', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Site-Directed Mutagenesis', 'System', 'Temperature', 'Thermodynamics', 'Time', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'design', 'experimental group', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'multi-scale modeling', 'mutant', 'quantum', 'simulation', 'theories']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF OKLAHOMA NORMAN,R01,2019,269849,-0.010297015345535109
"Integrative approach to studying LncRNA functions ABSTRACT  Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play regulatory roles in biological cell process and disease development. It has been emerging as a key regulator of diverse cellular processes. Great efforts have been made towards investigation of lncRNA functions with both experimental determination and theoretical modeling, leading to a rudimentary understanding of this class of RNAs. However, all of these cannot keep pace with the fast growth of diverse genetic data and urgent request of individual lncRNA function annotation, which is inhibited by the tremendous amount of lncRNAs and expensive experimental cost. This propose aim to address this issue by providing efficient and user-friendly tools for key lncRNA discovery and lncRNA function annotation. To do so, we will develop a unique bioinformatics and Systems Biology integrated approach, ISSNLncFA system, which enables the integration of all sorts of omics data and a comprehensive understanding of lncRNA functions.  We propose three specific aims for the ultimate lncRNA function annotation: (1) To develop a novel Co- Modules-based LncRNA Function Annotation (CoMoLncFA) model to detect key lncRNAs and to annotate lncRNA functions at post transcription level as lncRNA-PCG co-modules, lncRNA-pathways association network and lncRNA’s triplets (lncRNA-miRNA/TF-PCG) by considering the expression profiles of lncRNA, protein coding genes and miRNAs and transcript factors, and integrating the curated protein-protein interactions and biological pathways. (2) To develop a novel Structure-based LncRNA-protein Function Annotation (STRULncFA) model to characterize lncRNAs identified from Aim 1 by using their primary sequences and secondary structures for detecting lncRNA-protein functional relations; and to further reveal the regulatory roles and mechanism of these lncRNAs by determining the binding sites in both lncRNA and protein. (3) To experimentally validate the identified abnormal lncRNAs and their cellular products, to validate the identified lncRNA-protein interacting pairs and the predicted binding sites, and to develop software tools and an environment for functional annotation of lncRNAs, use these tools to evaluate the overall proposed approach, and apply them to identify lncRNA functions that may be involved in cell states, species, diseases and cancers and build lncRNA function databases.  We believe that we will build the models, tools and databases, and make them available to the public in a timely fashion. Our achievements will lead to a complete understanding of lncRNA functions and regulatory roles in cell and disease states. Moreover, our models and tools will be feasibly transformed to other function annotation tasks and disease studies with appropriate changes, and thus will move forward the general function annotation community and disease-related drug or therapy development. Project Narrative The ISSNLncFA software package will allow the investigators to characterize the LncRNA functions by integrating RNA-Seq, micorRNA-Seq, and together with protein and RNA structure data with systems biology approaches. As a prototype to test our system, we aim to use this system to study myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs). Although MDS is used as the prototype of disease for this proposal, the system developed will be applicable to multiple diseases with complex phenotypes.",Integrative approach to studying LncRNA functions,9751927,R01GM123037,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Architecture', 'Binding Sites', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Breast', 'CD34 gene', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 22', 'Chronic Disease', 'Code', 'Colorectal', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dysmyelopoietic Syndromes', 'Embryonic Development', 'Environment', 'Enzymes', 'Evaluation', 'Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomic Imprinting', 'Growth', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hematopoietic stem cells', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Liver', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Network-based', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'Transcript', 'Triplet Multiple Birth', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Work', 'X Chromosome', 'base', 'chromatin modification', 'chromatin remodeling', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'gene function', 'genomic data', 'high throughput technology', 'learning network', 'next generation', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'protein function', 'protein protein interaction', 'prototype', 'scaffold', 'software development', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'tool development', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'user-friendly']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R01,2019,302225,-0.043056249447254474

"Advanced computational methods in analyzing high-throughput sequencing data Sequencing technologies have become an essential tool to the study of human evolution, to the understanding of the genetic bases of diseases and to the clinical detection and treatment of genetic disorders. Computational algorithms are indispensible to the analysis of large-scale sequencing data and have received broad attention. However, developed several years ago, many mainstream software packages for sequence alignment, assembly and variant calling have gradually lagged behind the rapid development of sequencing technologies. They are unable to process the latest long reads or assembled contigs, and will be outpaced by upcoming technologies in terms of throughput. The development of advanced algorithms is critical to the applications of sequencing technologies in the near future. This project will address this pressing need with four proposals: (1) developing a fast and accurate aligner that accelerates short-read alignment and can map megabase-long assemblies against large sequence collections of over 100 gigabases in size; (2) developing an integrated caller for small sequence variations that is faster to run, more sensitive to moderately longer insertions and more accessible to biologists without extended expertise in bioinformatics; (3) developing a generic variant filtering tool that uses a novel deep learning model to achieve human-level accuracy on identifying false positive calls; (4) developing a new de novo assembler that works with the latest nanopore reads of ~100 kilobases in length and may achieve good contiguity at low coverage. Upon completion, the proposed studies will dramatically reduce the computational cost of data processing in most research labs and commercial entities, and will enable the applications of long reads in genome assembly, in the study of structural variations and in cancer researches. Computational algorithms are essential to the analysis of high-throughput sequencing data produced for the detection, prevention and treatment of cancers and genetic disorders. The proposed studies aim to address new challenges arising from the latest sequencing data and to develop faster and more accurate solutions to existing applications. The success of this proposal is likely to unlock the full power of recent sequencing technologies in disease studies and will dramatically reduce the cost of data analyses.",Advanced computational methods in analyzing high-throughput sequencing data,9693291,R01HG010040,"['Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Characteristics', 'Chromosomes', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Dependence', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Evolution', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genome', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Large-Scale Sequencing', 'Length', 'Mainstreaming', 'Maps', 'Medical Genetics', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Performance', 'Population Genetics', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Production', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Running', 'Seeds', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Site', 'Speed', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'bioinformatics tool', 'cancer therapy', 'computerized data processing', 'contig', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep sequencing', 'design', 'experimental study', 'genome analysis', 'high throughput analysis', 'improved', 'indexing', 'light weight', 'mammalian genome', 'nanopore', 'novel', 'open source', 'preservation', 'programs', 'success', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'whole genome']",NHGRI,DANA-FARBER CANCER INST,R01,2019,397125,-0.024120876993419856
"Computational Methods for Next-Generation Comparative Genomics PROJECT SUMMARY Recent advances in regulatory genomics, especially 3D genome organization in cell nucleus, suggest that existing methods for cross-species comparisons are limited in their ability to fully understand the evolution of non-coding genome function. In particular, it is known that genomes are compartmentalized to distinct compartments in the nucleus such as nuclear lamina and nuclear speckles. Such nuclear compartmentalization is an essential feature of higher-order genome organization and is linked to various important genome functions such as DNA replication timing and transcription. Unfortunately, to date no study exists that directly compares nuclear compartmentalization between human and other mammals. In addition, there are no computational models available that consider the continuous nature of multiple features of nuclear compartmentalization and function, which is critical to integrate genome-wide functional genomic data and datasets that measure cytological distance to multiple compartments across species. In this project, we will develop novel algorithms and generate new datasets to directly address two key questions: (1) How to identify the evolutionary patterns of nuclear compartmentalization? (2) What types of sequence evolution may drive spatial localization changes across species? The proposed project represents the first endeavor in comparative genomics for nuclear compartmentalization. Our Specific Aims are: (1) Developing new probabilistic models for identifying evolutionary patterns of nuclear compartmentalization. (2) Identifying genome-wide evolutionary patterns of nuclear compartmentalization in primate species based on TSA-seq and Repli-seq. (3) Developing new algorithms to connect sequence features to nuclear compartmentalization through cross-species comparisons. Successful completion of these aims will result in novel computational tools and new datasets that will be highly valuable for the comparative genomics community. Integrating the new computational tools and unique datasets will provide invaluable insights into the relationship between sequence evolution and changes in nuclear genome organization in mammalian species. Therefore, the proposed research is expected to advance comparative genomics to a new frontier and provide new perspectives for studying human genome function PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because the outcome of the project is expected to enhance the analyses of nuclear genome organizations across primate species to better understand genome function and human biology. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to NIH’s mission that seeks to obtain fundamental knowledge that will help to improve human health.",Computational Methods for Next-Generation Comparative Genomics,9765970,R01HG007352,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Crete', 'Cytology', 'DNA Insertion Elements', 'DNA Replication Timing', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Evolution', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Biology', 'Human Genome', 'Imagery', 'Knowledge', 'Lamin Type B', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Nature', 'Nuclear', 'Nuclear Lamina', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Primates', 'Psyche structure', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Models', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Untranslated RNA', 'base', 'comparative genomics', 'computerized tools', 'frontier', 'functional genomics', 'genetic variant', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'insight', 'mental function', 'next generation', 'novel', 'predictive modeling']",NHGRI,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,433604,-0.029205791851797665
"Bioinformatics Tools for Circadian Biology Circadian rhythms are fundamental for understanding biology: they date back to the origin of life, they are found in virtually every species from cyanobacteria to mammals, and they coordinate many important biological functions from the sleep-wake cycle, to metabolism, and to cognitive functions. Circadian rhythms are equally fundamental for health and medicine: modifications in diet have been linked to modification in circadian rhythms at the molecular level; disruptions of circadian rhythms have been linked to health problems ranging from depression, to learning disorders, to diabetes, to obesity, to cardiovascular disease, to cancer, and to premature ageing; finally, a large fraction of drug targets have been found to oscillate in a circadian manner in one or several tissues, suggesting that a better understanding of circadian oscillations at the molecular level could have direct applications to precision medicine, for instance by optimizing the time at which drugs are taken.  To better understand circadian oscillations at the molecular level, modern high-throughput technologies are being used to measure the concentrations of many molecular species, including transcripts, proteins, and metabolites along the circadian cycle in different organs and tissues, and under different conditions. However, the informatics tools for processing, analyzing, and integrating the growing wealth of molecular circadian data are not yet in place.  This effort will fill this fundamental gap by developing and disseminating informatics tools that will enable the collection, integration, and analyses of this wealth of information and lead to novel and fundamental insights about the organization and regulation of circadian oscillations, their roles in health and disease, and their future applications to precision medicine. Specifically, through a close collaborations between computational and experimental scientists, this effort will: (1) Bring the power of deep learning methods to bear on the analyses of omic time series to determine, for instance, which molecular species are oscillating, their characteristics (period, phase, amplitude), and to predict the time/phase associated with a measurement taken at a single time point; (2) Develop Cyber-TC, an extension of the widely used Cyber-T software, for the differential analysis of circadian omic time series and expand MotifMap, a widely used genome-wide map of regulatory sites to better understand circadian regulation; and (3) Develop Circadiomics, an integrated database and web portal as a one-stop shop for circadian data, annotations, and analyses. All data, software, and results will be freely available for academic research purposes and broadly disseminated through multiple channels to benefit both the circadian community and the broader bioinformatics community. Circadian rhythms are fundamental for biology and medicine. Modern high-throughput technologies are revealing how the concentrations of many molecular species, including transcripts, proteins, and metabolites oscillate with the day and night cycle in almost every species, tissue, and cell. In close collaboration with biologists, this project will develop the informatics tools that will enable the collection, integration, and analyses of this wealth of information and lead to novel and fundamental insights about the organization and regulation of circadian oscillations, their roles in health and disease, and their future applications to precision medicine.",Bioinformatics Tools for Circadian Biology,9690782,R01GM123558,"['Address', 'Ally', 'Architecture', 'Back', 'Biogenesis', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Circadian Dysregulation', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Cyanobacterium', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Drug Targeting', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Health', 'Homeostasis', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Learning Disorders', 'Life', 'Link', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammals', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Mental Depression', 'Metabolism', 'Modernization', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Obesity', 'Organ', 'Periodicity', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Premature aging syndrome', 'Proteomics', 'Research', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Site', 'Sleep Wake Cycle', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transcript', 'Update', 'Ursidae Family', 'Vision', 'annotation  system', 'bioinformatics tool', 'circadian', 'circadian regulation', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive process', 'deep learning', 'direct application', 'genome-wide', 'high throughput analysis', 'high throughput technology', 'informatics\xa0tool', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'member', 'metabolomics', 'novel', 'precision medicine', 'protein metabolite', 'software development', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'virtual', 'web portal']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-IRVINE,R01,2019,328155,0.0037358771109943308
"PiNDA - Fully integrated software platform for Preimplantation Genetic Testing - Aneuploidy (PGT-A) PROJECT SUMMARY  Since its inception 40 years ago, in vitro fertilization (IVF) has resulted in the birth of more than 1 million babies in the United States, and has revolutionized the field of reproductive medicine. Unfortunately, the success rate of IVF is still exceedingly low, especially for women >40 years old, with only 15.5% of implanted embryos resulting in pregnancy. This is partly due to the cytological method used for pre-implantation screening, which cannot detect the most common genetic defect during IVF, aneuploidy (i.e. chromosomal copy-number variation). Aneuploidy is linked to higher rates of miscarriage, and occurs more often in women >40 years of age; thus, aneuploidy has been a frequent target for genetic screening to improve IVF outcomes.  Pre-implantation genetic testing for aneuploidy (PGT-A) refers to a variety of techniques aimed at detecting changes in chromosomal copy number, with the goal of identifying high-quality euploid embryos for implantation. Recent advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have made it possible to screen embryos at higher levels of precision, and across a wider range of genetic defects, including mosaicism, triploidy and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Despite these remarkable advances, there are still significant challenges with PGT-A sequencing. Indeed, the most commonly implemented software for PGT-A (i.e. BlueFuse® ) are bundled with specific sequencing platforms (i.e. VeriSeq®), and are only designed to test for aneuploidy. Furthermore, existing pipelines are not user-friendly or customizable, which is a serious obstacle prohibiting the use of NGS by clinicians / embryologists. A more accessible bioinformatics platform is desperately needed that will bridge the gap between PGT-A sequencing and IVF outcomes.  Basepair™ is an innovator in efficient, user-friendly, web-based NGS analysis systems, with fully automated ChIP-, RNA-, ATAC-, and DNA-Seq bioinformatics pipelines available online. Here, Basepair will deliver PiNDA™, the first fully integrated software solution for comprehensive PGT-A analysis. In Aim 1, we will develop modules to test for specific chromosomal abnormalities, including mosaicism and triploidy, and validate each model with training data derived from somatic cell lines with known chromosomal aberrations. In Aim 2, we will integrate our modules into the PiNDA software system, creating a user-friendly, web-based interface that will perform full data analysis (raw data to full summary report) in <15 minutes, with no manual input required. Final data will be accessible via Basepair’s online portal, facilitating rapid data transfer from embryologists to physicians, and supporting the integration of NGS tests in IVF. Our innovative bioinformatics platform will accelerate NGS analysis for IVF, improving rates of pregnancy and advancing research in the success of IVF procedures. PROJECT NARRATIVE  In vitro fertilization (IVF) methods have begun to leverage next-generation sequencing technologies for pre-implantation genetic testing of aneuploidy (PGT-A), expanding the array of chromosomal abnormalities that can be accurately detected. However, the vast majority of software can only distinguish one type of genetic defect (i.e. aneuploidy), are difficult to use, and are tied to distinct sequencing platforms, limiting the clinical utility of resulting analyses. Basepair™ Inc. is a pioneer in user-friendly, web-based bioinformatics pipelines, providing comprehensive services for a wide range of sequencing projects. Here, Basepair will develop an inclusive suite of software for PGT-A, compatible with sequencing data from multiple platforms.

"Development of dictyBase, an online informatics resource PROJECT SUMMARY dictyBase is the model organism database (MOD) for the eukaryote Dictyostelium discoideum and related species. A community resource, widely supported by the research community, dictyBase contains gold standard expert literature curation of genes, functional annotations using the Gene Ontology and a wide range of genomic resources. Dictyostelium is widely used to study cellular processes such as cell motility, chemotaxis, signal transduction, cellular response to drugs, and host-pathogen interactions. Dictyostelium's genome contains significant orthologs of vertebrate, yeast and microbial genes, attracting researchers interested in a wide variety of biological topics including human disease, multicellular differentiation and comparative genomics. dictyBase enables researchers to search, view and download up-to-date genomic, functional and technical information. It is also widely used by teachers/instructors due to the wealth of available teaching materials and research protocols. Dictyostelium investigators depend on dictyBase as their primary community resource, where help from dictyBase staff (dictyBase help line) or from other users (Dicty ListServ, moderated by dictyBase) is available. We are in the final stages of deploying our completely new technology stack. By the end of this year dictyBase will be run entirely as a cloud-based application. This propoal seeks support to continue operating and expanding this important community resource. Our goals for this proposal are: (Aim 1) To continue (a) expert curation by dictyBase curators and enable (b) Community curation leveraging our strong relationship with the community.

Epi25's governance structure, membership, and other information are available online at www.epi-25.org. In this project, clinical data is entered by contributors into Red Cap forms or uploaded directly into the Epi25 database. The clinical data is then checked by a computer algorithm that looks for key eligibility criteria for each participant. Errors and missing data are sent to the Phenotyping Coordinator to review and resolve, with the help of the contributing site. PROJECT NARRATIVE In 2014, collaborators from around the world created the Epi25 Collaborative to exome sequence as many as 25,000 patients with epilepsy. The collaborative has more than 6,200 exomes generated in year 2016, an additional 7,500 on sequencers in 2017, and more than 1,000 ready for sequencing in 2018.

"Tools for rapid and accurate structure elucidation of natural products Mapping the Secondary Metabolomes of Marine Cyanobacteria Bacteria are extraordinarily prolific sources of structurally unique and biologically active natural products that derive from a diversity of fascinating biochemical pathways. However, the complete structure elucidation of natural products is often the most time consuming and costly endeavor in natural product drug discovery programs. Compounding this, advancements in genome sequencing have accelerated the identification of unique modular biosynthetic gene clusters in prokaryotes and revealed a wealth of new compounds yet to be isolated and biologically and chemically characterized. Resultantly, there is an urgent and continuing need in this field to connect biosynthetic gene clusters to their respective MS fragmentation signatures in the MS2 molecular networks. The capacity to make such connections will accelerate new compound discovery as well as create associations between gene cluster and biosynthetic pathway, and aid in fast and accurate structure elucidations. Combined with this informatics approach, this proposed continuation project explores innovative methods by which to solve complex molecular structures by enhanced MS and NMR experiments, as well as the development of new algorithms by which to accelerate their analysis. Thus, the overarching goal of this grant is to develop efficient methods that facilitate automated structural classification, structural feature discovery and ultimately efficient structure elucidation of natural products (or any small molecule) and to build an infrastructure that interacts with data input from the community. We will achieve this with the following four specific aims: Aim 1. Integration of MS2 molecular networking with gene cluster networking to rapidly and efficiently locate natural products that have unique molecular architectures; Aim 2. To develop a suite of high sensitivity pulse sequences for natural product structure elucidation; Aim 3. To develop NMR based molecular networking strategies using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) to facilitate the categorization and structure elucidation of organic compounds; Aim 4. To integrate NMR molecular networking and MS2-based molecular networking as an efficient structure characterization and elucidation strategy. By achieving these aims we will develop an innovative workflow for finding new compounds and for determining their structures, both quickly and accurately. The connection between gene cluster and molecule will shed light on stereochemistry and potential halogenations and methylations. This information can then be used in combination with more efficient NMR and MS methods to accurately determine structures. These tools will be widely shared, such as through the Global Natural Products Social (GNPS) Molecular Network, to enhance the overall capacity of the natural products and organic chemistry communities to solve complex molecular structures.   Natural products are compounds produced by natural sources and about 50 % of FDA approved drugs can trace their origin back to natural products. This proposal aims to use our data set of natural products produced by cyanobacteria for development of analytical tools that will speed- up and stream-line the discovery and structure elucidation of new compounds.  ",Tools for rapid and accurate structure elucidation of natural products,9690083,R01GM107550,"['Algae', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Back', 'Bacteria', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biological', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Consumption', 'Cyanobacterium', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'FDA approved', 'Family', 'Gene Cluster', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Informatics', 'Infrastructure', 'Light', 'Marines', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Structure', 'Natural Product Drug', 'Natural Products', 'Organic Chemistry', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Progress Reports', 'Prokaryotic Cells', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'analog', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'drug discovery', 'experimental study', 'fascinate', 'genome sequencing', 'halogenation', 'innovation', 'metabolome', 'novel', 'programs', 'prototype', 'scaffold', 'small molecule', 'social', 'stereochemistry', 'tool']",NIGMS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2019,530377,-0.009415444408581919
"A Modeling Framework for Multi-View Data, with Applications to the Pioneer 100 Study and Protein Interaction Networks New advances in biomedical research have made it possible to collect multiple data “views” — for example, genetic, metabolomic, and clinical data — for a single patient. Such multi-view data promises to offer deeper insights into a patient's health and disease than would be possible if just one data view were available. However, in order to achieve this promise, new statistical methods are needed.  This proposal involves developing statistical methods for the analysis of multi-view data. These methods can be used to answer the following fundamental question: do the data views contain redundant information about the observations, or does each data view contain a different set of information? The answer to this question will provide insight into the data views, as well as insight into the observations. If two data views contain redundant information about the observations, then those two data views are related to each other. Furthermore, if each data view tells the same “story” about the observations, then we can be quite conﬁdent that the story is true.  The investigators will develop a uniﬁed framework for modeling multi-view data, which will then be applied in a number of settings. In Aim 1, this framework will be applied to multi-view multivariate data (e.g. a single set of patients, with both clinical and genetic measurements), in order to determine whether a single clustering can adequately describe the patients across all data views, or whether the patients cluster separately in each data view. In Aim 2, the framework will be applied to multi-view network data (e.g. a single set of proteins, with both binary and co-complex interactions measured), in order to determine whether the nodes belong to a single set of communities across the data views, or a separate set of communities in each data view. In Aim 3, the framework will be applied to multi-view multivariate data in order to determine whether the observations can be embedded in a single latent space across all data views, or whether they belong to a separate latent space in each data view. In Aims 1–3, the methods developed will be applied to the Pioneer 100 study, and to the protein interactome. In Aim 4(a), the availability of multiple data views will be used in order to develop a method for tuning parameter selection in unsupervised learning. In Aim 4(b), protein communities that were identiﬁed in Aim 2 will be validated experimentally. High-quality open source software will be developed in Aim 5.  The methods developed in this proposal will be used to determine whether the ﬁndings from multiple data views are the same or different. The application of these methods to multi-view data sets, including the Pioneer 100 study and the protein interactome, will improve our understanding of human health and disease, as well as fundamental biology. Biomedical researchers often collect multiple “types” of data (e.g. clinical data and genetic data) for a single patient, in order to get a fuller picture of that patient's health or disease status than would be possible using any single data type. This proposal involves developing new statistical methods that can be used in order to analyze data sets that consist of multiple data types. Applying these methods will lead to new insights and better understanding of human health and disease.","A Modeling Framework for Multi-View Data, with Applications to the Pioneer 100 Study and Protein Interaction Networks",9752596,R01GM123993,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Clinical Data', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Genetics', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Records', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Set protein', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trust', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'insight', 'metabolomics', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'unsupervised learning']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2019,323659,-0.020911356338919752
"SUPPORT AND DEVELOPMENT OF EMAN FOR ELECTRON MICROSCOPY IMAGE PROCESSING EMAN is one of the most well-established and widely used scientific image processing suites targeting the rapidly growing CryoEM/CryoET community worldwide. In turn, the CryoEM and CryoET studies which it enables permit determination of the structures of interacting macromolecules both in-vitro and in-vivo, and are being used to better understand the biochemical processes taking place in cells, to better identify potential drug targets and develop novel diagnostics. With the higher resolutions now possible in this field, direct drug interaction structural studies are now possible, and being used to gain insight into the mode of action of drugs within the cell. Unlike many newer tools in the field, such as Relion, CisTEM and CryoSparc, which focus on specific refinement tasks, EMAN is a versatile, modular suite capable of performing a variety of image processing tasks with hundreds of algorithms supporting virtually all of the standard file formats and mathematical conventions used in the field, as well as other related imaging fields. It provides an ideal platform for prototyping fundamental new algorithm developments, while still able to achieve data-limited resolution in single particle reconstruction. While high resolution single particle refinement has become routine in recent years, thanks largely to the dramatic data quality improvements provided by new detector technology, there remain significant opportunities for improvements in mitigating model bias, efficient use of data, and analysis of complexes with compositional or conformational variability. Some of the most important problems from a biological perspective involve the sort of compositional and conformational variability which remain challenging problems. The field also remains susceptible to problems of initial model bias, which are exacerbated in systems exhibiting structural variability, and as a result many structures are still published with exaggerated resolution claims. The standard protocols used by many in the field typically involve discarding a very large fraction of the raw data (as much as 80-90% in some cases), often based on qualitative assessments, raising questions related to rigor and reproducibility of structural results. In this proposal, we will develop or adapt image processing techniques to help resolve these issues, based on developments or unrealized concepts from mathematics and computer science. CryoEM and CryoET are used to study the structures of interacting biomolecules in the cell at resolutions 100x better than the best possible light microscope. This methodology permits new insights into the biomolecules which underlie disease, can shed light on structural changes in diseased cells and provide direct information on how drugs interact with the molecules they target.

"The Enzymatic Reader Project Summary At this point in time, it is generally understood and agreed upon that single-molecule sequencing (SMS) is the future of genomics, transcriptomics, epigenomics, and epitranscriptomics due to its significant advantages over other technologies and methods. However, in order for these advantages to be fully realized, and for SMS to become the “gold standard” sequencing approach, significant issues and hurdles must be solved and overcome. During this program, Electronic BioSciences, Inc. (EBS) aims to demonstrate a completely new and enabling SMS method that will possess the ability to directly and correctly identify individual nucleotides, including chemically modified nucleotides. During this project, we will both demonstrate the ability of this entirely new sequencing approach to sequence DNA with high accuracy (directly comparing the obtained accuracy, throughput, error mechanisms and associated rates to other SMS approaches) and correctly identify (and sequence) 5-methylcytosine (5mC) and its derivatives, at the single molecule level. At the conclusion of this Phase I project, we will have successfully demonstrated an entirely new and dramatically improved SMS approach, and reduced the associated risks involved with its full future commercial developments. There is a current need within the field of next generation sequencing (NGS) or so called third generation sequencing (TGS) for new, enabling instrumentation that is capable of high-accuracy, direct, native DNA sequencing, including the ability to correctly identify canonical and modified bases, homopolymer stretches, and sequence repeats. The entirely new SMS methodology that will be developed during this project will overcome known hurdles and limitations of currently available NGS, TGS, and SMS technologies, resulting in technology that is cost-efficient, highly accurate, easy to setup and utilize, capable of de novo sequencing and modified base calling, and yields highly simplistic data for easy analysis and post possessing. Through significant advancements made during this program, this resulting technology will revolutionize the use of the genome and epigenome, radically change standard R&D and clinical practices, and greatly advance clinical diagnostics, prognostics, and therapeutic decision making. Project Narrative The novel single-molecule sequencing (SMS) technology developed during this project will enable high- accuracy, direct, native DNA sequencing, including the ability to correctly identify canonical and modified bases, homopolymer stretches, and sequence repeats via a cost-efficient and easy-to-use methodology. The impact of these advances in SMS will eventually enable wide-scale, routine clinical care and diagnostics toward advanced precision medicine, not just R&D. The performance and accessibility of such technology will transform the understanding and application of genomics and epigenomics, the associated clinical practices, that ability to provide precision clinical diagnostics, prognostics, and therapeutic decision making for improved public healthcare and wellbeing.",The Enzymatic Reader,9677956,R43HG010427,"['Biological', 'Biological Sciences', 'Caliber', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Church', 'Complex', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA polymerase A', 'DNA sequencing', 'DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disadvantaged', 'Drops', 'Electrodes', 'Enzymes', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Healthcare', 'Individual', 'Ions', 'Label', 'Length', 'Lipid Bilayers', 'Logistics', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Noise', 'Nucleotides', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phase', 'Polymerase', 'Polymers', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Reader', 'Reading Frames', 'Reproducibility', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Software Tools', 'Speed', 'Stretching', 'System', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Third Generation Sequencing', 'Time', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'cost efficient', 'electric field', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'epitranscriptomics', 'improved', 'instrumentation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'nanopore', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'research and development', 'single molecule', 'solid state', 'transcriptomics']",NHGRI,"ELECTRONIC BIOSCIENCES, INC.",R43,2019,247611,-0.009214971526948786
"Evidence Extraction Systems for the Molecular Interaction Literature Burns, Gully A. Abstract  In primary research articles, scientists make claims based on evidence from experiments, and report both the claims and the supporting evidence in the results section of papers. However, biomedical databases de- scribe the claims made by scientists in detail, but rarely provide descriptions of any supporting evidence that a consulting scientist could use to understand why the claims are being made. Currently, the process of curating evidence into databases is manual, time-consuming and expensive; thus, evidence is recorded in papers but not generally captured in database systems. For example, the European Bioinformatics Institute's INTACT database describes how different molecules biochemically interact with each other in detail. They characterize the under- lying experiment providing the evidence of that interaction with only two hierarchical variables: a code denoting the method used to detect the molecular interaction and another code denoting the method used to detect each molecule. In fact, INTACT describes 94 different types of interaction detection method that could be used in conjunction with other experimental methodological processes that can be used in a variety of different ways to reveal different details about the interaction. This crucial information is not being captured in databases. Although experimental evidence is complex, it conforms to certain principles of experimental design: experimentally study- ing a phenomenon typically involves measuring well-chosen dependent variables whilst altering the values of equally well-chosen independent variables. Exploiting these principles has permitted us to devise a preliminary, robust, general-purpose representation for experimental evidence. In this project, We will use this representation to describe the methods and data pertaining to evidence underpinning the interpretive assertions about molecular interactions described by INTACT. A key contribution of our project is that we will develop methods to extract this evidence from scientiﬁc papers automatically (A) by using image processing on a speciﬁc subtype of ﬁgure that is common in molecular biology papers and (B) by using natural language processing to read information from the text used by scientists to describe their results. We will develop these tools for the INTACT repository but package them so that they may then also be used for evidence pertaining to other areas of research in biomedicine. Burns, Gully A. Narrative  Molecular biology databases contain crucial information for the study of human disease (especially cancer), but they omit details of scientiﬁc evidence. Our work will provide detailed accounts of experimental evidence supporting claims pertaining to the study of these diseases. This additional detail may provide scientists with more powerful ways of detecting anomalies and resolving contradictory ﬁndings.",Evidence Extraction Systems for the Molecular Interaction Literature,9543557,R01LM012592,"['Area', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Burn injury', 'Classification', 'Co-Immunoprecipitations', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Consult', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'European', 'Event', 'Experimental Designs', 'Experimental Models', 'Gel', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Graph', 'Image', 'Informatics', 'Institutes', 'Intelligence', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Weight', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Paper', 'Pattern', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Privatization', 'Process', 'Protein Structure Initiative', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Reading', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Scientist', 'Source Code', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Taxonomy', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Typology', 'Western Blotting', 'Work', 'base', 'data modeling', 'experimental study', 'human disease', 'image processing', 'learning strategy', 'open source', 'optical character recognition', 'protein protein interaction', 'repository', 'software systems', 'text searching', 'tool']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2018,264277,-0.00904027807458019
"Integrated Instrument for non-natural aptamer generation Project Summary DNA and RNA aptamers are a useful class of synthetic affinity reagents. However, their performance can be greatly improved through the site-specific incorporation of chemically modified, ‘non-natural’ nucleotides that provide a greater chemical repertoire to enable superior aptamer affinity and specificity. Because a broad spectrum of chemical functional groups can be incorporated, non-natural aptamers offer the exciting potential for targeting molecules for which the generation of monoclonal antibodies remains difficult, such as small- molecule drugs, metabolites and carbohydrates. Unfortunately, the access to non-natural aptamers is severely limited. This is because the process of generating non-natural aptamers is technically challenging and limited to a few specialized laboratories. The goal of this project is to develop an integrated instrument, the Non-Natural Aptamer Array (N2A2) that eliminates these bottlenecks and enable rapid and facile non-natural aptamer discovery at virtually any research laboratory. The N2A2 will be built on a modified version of a benchtop commercial sequencer (Illumina MiSeq), and will perform every stage of non-natural aptamer discovery— including sequencing, screening and binding measurements—as part of a single work-flow. There are three main innovative aspects of our N2A2 system. First, our approach will entirely eliminate the need for polymerase engineering, and thus allows us to incorporate virtually any chemical functional group through click chemistry. Second, N2A2 will enable us to directly obtain the binding affinity (Kd) of ~10^7 aptamers directly in complex samples (e.g. cell lysate or serum), thereby resulting in aptamers with high-specificity. Finally, we will develop a machine-learning (ML) approach to identify key motifs (“k-mers”) and predict novel sequences with potentially higher affinity and specificity that can be tested using the N2A2 instrument. We believe this powerful combination of massively parallel, sequence-linked binding measurements with ML-based predictions will allow us to explore sequence space that is currently inaccessible to traditional in vitro selection methods, and enable us to discover aptamers with superior performance. The success of this project will produce an integrated instrument that greatly streamlines and accelerates the discovery of non-natural aptamers for a wide range of targets in complex media. The instrument is based on a commercially available sequencer and we will make all software available to the public. In this way, we believe the N2A2 instrument could broadly expand access to robust, high quality, custom affinity reagents for biomedical research and clinical diagnostics. Project Narrative We will develop an integrated instrument that simplifies the discovery of non-natural aptamer reagents for a wide range of molecules that are difficult to target using conventional antibody reagents. The access to these custom reagents will accelerate biomedical research and clinical diagnostics.",Integrated Instrument for non-natural aptamer generation,9579149,R01GM129313,"['Affinity', 'Algorithms', 'Antibodies', 'Binding', 'Biomedical Research', 'Carbohydrates', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Chinese Hamster Ovary Cell', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Directed Molecular Evolution', 'Engineering', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'In Vitro', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Research', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monoclonal Antibodies', 'Nucleotides', 'Opioid', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Polymerase', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Reagent', 'Reproducibility', 'SLEB2 gene', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'System', 'Testing', 'Tyrosine', 'Work', 'aptamer', 'base', 'clinical diagnostics', 'functional group', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'novel', 'scaffold', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'success', 'virtual']",NIGMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,314000,-0.011383586305577939
"Reactome: An Open Knowledgebase of Human Pathways Project Summary  We seek renewal of the core operating funding for the Reactome Knowledgebase of Human Biological Pathways and Processes. Reactome is a curated, open access biomolecular pathway database that can be freely used and redistributed by all members of the biological research community. It is used by clinicians, geneti- cists, genomics researchers, and molecular biologists to interpret the results of high-throughput experimental studies, by bioinformaticians seeking to develop novel algorithms for mining knowledge from genomic studies, and by systems biologists building predictive models of normal and disease variant pathways.  Our curators, PhD-level scientists with backgrounds in cell and molecular biology work closely with in- dependent investigators within the community to assemble machine-readable descriptions of human biological pathways. Each pathway is extensively checked and peer-reviewed prior to publication to ensure its assertions are backed up by the primary literature, and that human molecular events inferred from orthologous ones in animal models have an auditable inference chain. Curated Reactome pathways currently cover 8930 protein- coding genes (44% of the translated portion of the genome) and ~150 RNA genes. We also offer a network of reliable ‘functional interactions’ (FIs) predicted by a conservative machine-learning approach, which covers an additional 3300 genes, for a combined coverage of roughly 60% of the known genome.  Over the next five years, we will: (1) curate new macromolecular entities, clinically significant protein sequence variants and isoforms, and drug-like molecules, and the complexes these entities form, into new reac- tions; (2) supplement normal pathways with alternative pathways targeted to significant diseases and devel- opmental biology; (3) expand and automate our tools for curation, management and community annotation; (4) integrate pathway modeling technologies using probabilistic graphical models and Boolean networks for pathway and network perturbation studies; (5) develop additional compelling software interfaces directed at both computational and lab biologist users; and (6) and improve outreach to bioinformaticians, molecular bi- ologists and clinical researchers. Project Narrative  Reactome represents one of a very small number of open access curated biological pathway databases. Its authoritative and detailed content has directly and indirectly supported basic and translational research studies with over-representation analysis and network-building tools to discover patterns in high-throughput data.

"Selective Whole Genome Amplification - Enabling Microbial Population Genomics Microbial population genetic research has been crucial for understanding pathogen dynamics, virulence, host specificity, and many other topics; in many cases uncovering unexpected and transformative biological processes. However, conventional population genetic analyses are limited by the quantity of sequence data from each sample. The temporal, spatial, and evolutionary resolution of techniques that rely on single gene sequences or multi-locus sequence typing are often insufficient to study biological processes on fine scales, precisely the scales at which many evolutionary and mechanistic process occur. Population genomics offers a vast quantity of sequence information for inferring evolutionary and ecological processes on very fine spatial and temporal scales, inferences that are critical to understanding and eventually controlling many infectious diseases. The promise of population genomics is tempered, however, by difficulties in isolating and preparing microbes for next-generation sequencing. We have developed the selective whole genome amplification (SWGA) technology to sequence microbial genomes from complex biological specimens without relying on labor-intensive laboratory culture, even if the focal microbial genome constitutes only a miniscule fraction of the natural sample. The primary hindrance to popular adoption of SWGA for microbial genomic studies is not its effectiveness in producing samples suitable for next-generation sequencing but in the upfront investment needed to develop an effective protocol to amplify the genome of a specific microbial species. Identifying an SWGA protocol that consistently results in selective and even amplification across the target genome is currently hindered by computationally-inefficient software that can evaluate a very limited set of the potentially effective solutions. Further, this software uses marginally-effective optimality criteria as there is currently only a limited understanding of the true criteria that result in highly-selective and even amplification of a target genome. As a result, SWGA protocol development is currently costly in both time and resources. A primary goal of the proposed research is to identify the criteria that result in optimal SWGA by analyzing next- generation sequencing data with advanced machine learning techniques. These optimality criteria will be integrated into a freely-available, computationally-efficient swga development program that will reduce the upfront investment in SWGA protocol development, thus allowing researchers to address medically- and biologically-important questions in any microbial species. In the near term, this project will also generate effective SWGA protocols for four microbial species which can be used immediately to address fundamental questions in evolutionary biology, disease progression, and emerging infectious disease dynamics. From a global disease perspective, this work is imperative as the majority of microbial species cannot easily be cultured and are in danger of becoming bystanders in the genomics revolution that is currently elucidating evolutionary processes and molecular mechanisms in cultivable microbial species. Addressing many of the major outstanding questions about pathogen evolution will require analyses of populations of microbial genomes. Although population genomic studies would provide the analytical resolution to investigate evolutionary and mechanistic processes on fine spatial and temporal scales – precisely the scales at which these processes occur – microbial population genomic research is currently hindered by the practicalities of obtaining sufficient quantities of genomes to analyze. We propose to develop an innovative, cost-effective, practical, and publically-available technology to collect sufficient quantities of microbial genomic DNA necessary for next-generation microbial genome sequencing.",Selective Whole Genome Amplification - Enabling Microbial Population Genomics,9507167,R21AI137433,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Characteristics', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Coupling', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Effectiveness', 'Emerging Communicable Diseases', 'Evolution', 'Foundations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Research', 'Genome', 'Genomic DNA', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Investigation', 'Investments', 'Laboratory culture', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Metaphor', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Microbial Genome Sequencing', 'Microsatellite Repeats', 'Molecular', 'Organism', 'Population', 'Population Analysis', 'Population Genetics', 'Process', 'Program Development', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Shapes', 'Specificity', 'Specimen', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Virulence', 'Work', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'design', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic approach', 'host-microbe interactions', 'improved', 'innovation', 'microbial', 'microbial genome', 'next generation', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'prevent', 'protocol development', 'vector', 'whole genome']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R21,2018,242837,-0.006254508283429442
"DNA Sequencing Using Single Molecule Electronics PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  Progress in DNA sequencing has occurred through multiple stages of disruptive new technologies being introduced to the field, each of which has increased sequencing capabilities by lowering costs, improving throughput, and reducing errors. The goal of this research project is to investigate a new, all-electronic sequencing method that has the potential to become the next transformative step for DNA sequencing. This new method is based on single DNA polymerase molecules bound to nanoscale electronic transistors, a hybrid device that transduces the activity of a single polymerase molecule into an electronic signal.  The goal of this research project is to determine whether these hybrid polymerase-transistors are truly applicable to DNA sequencing and the competitive environment of advanced sequencing technologies. To answer this question, the project teams the scientists who have developed the devices with Illumina, Inc., a worldwide leader in the DNA sequencing market. The experiments proposed here build on encouraging preliminary results, first to demonstrate accurate DNA sequencing and second to evaluate whether the new technique could become a competitive challenge to other sequencing methods. The interdisciplinary team will combine state-of-the-art techniques from protein engineering, nanoscale fabrication, and machine learning to customize polymerase's activity and its interactions with the electronic transistors. If successful, nanoscale solid-state devices like transistors provide one of the best opportunities for increasing sequencing capabilities while decreasing sequencing costs, so that DNA sequencing can become a standard technique in health care and disease treatment. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Over the past two decades, DNA sequencing has transformed from a heroic, nearly impossible task to a routine component of modern laboratory research. The field of DNA sequencing has improved tremendously through a strategy of modifying and monitoring polymerases, a key enzyme at the heart of many DNA sequencing technologies. This proposal is motivated by developments in the field of single-molecule electronics, which provide an entirely new mode for listening to the activity of single polymerase molecules. This electronic method is very different from the biochemical, optical, or nanopore-based techniques currently in use, and it has inherent advantages that could provide exciting possibilities for DNA sequencing. The project will tailor single-molecule electronics for the specific purpose of DNA sequencing and determine whether this strategy could lead to a new generation of sequencing technology.",DNA Sequencing Using Single Molecule Electronics,9531422,R01HG009188,"['Affect', 'Base Pairing', 'Biochemical', 'Carbon', 'Charge', 'Collaborations', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'DNA sequencing', 'DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Electronics', 'Enzyme Kinetics', 'Enzymes', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Heart', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Laboratory Research', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Massive Parallel Sequencing', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modernization', 'Modification', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Mutation', 'Nanotechnology', 'Noise', 'Nucleotides', 'Optics', 'Performance', 'Polymerase', 'Protein Engineering', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Reading', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Route', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Single-Stranded DNA', 'Site', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Transistors', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'collaborative environment', 'cost', 'enzyme activity', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'molecular modeling', 'nanoelectronics', 'nanopore', 'nanoscale', 'new technology', 'novel', 'response', 'scale up', 'single molecule', 'single walled carbon nanotube', 'solid state']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-IRVINE,R01,2018,468098,0.003731182395274102
"Developing Advanced Algorithms to Address Major Computational Challenges in Current Microbiome Research Abstract We propose a three-year interdisciplinary research plan to address two key issues currently facing the metagenomics community. The first issue concerns accurate construction and annotation of OTU tables using  of millions of 16S rRNA sequences, which is one of the most important yet most difficult problems inmicrobiome data analysis. Currently, it lacks computational algorithms capable of handling extremely large sequence data and constructing biologically consistent OTU tables. We propose a novel method that performs OTU table construction and annotation simultaneously by utilizing input and reference sequences, reference annotations, and data clustering structure within one analytical framework. Dynamic data-driven cutoffs are derived to identify OTUs that are consistent not only with data clustering structure but also with reference annotations. When successfully implemented, our method will generally address the computational needs of processing hundreds of millions of 16S rRNA reads that are currently being generated by large-scale studies. The second issue concerns developing novel methods to extract pertinent information from massive sequence data, thereby facilitating the field shifting from descriptive research to mechanistic studies. We are particularly interested in microbial community dynamics analysis, which can provide a wealth of insight into disease development unattainable through a static experiment design, and lays a critical foundation for developing probiotic and antibiotic strategies to manipulate microbial communities. Traditionally, system dynamics is approached through time-course studies. However, due to economical and logistical constraints, time-course studies are generally limited by the number of samples examined and the time period followed. With the rapid development of sequencing technology, many thousands of samples are being collected in large-scale studies. This provides us with a unique opportunity to develop a novel analytical strategy to use static data, instead of time-course data, to study microbial community dynamics. To our knowledge, this is the first time that massive static data is used to study dynamic aspects of microbial communities. When successfully implemented, our approach can effectively overcome the sampling limitation of time-course studies, and opens a new avenue of research to study microbial dynamics underlying disease development without performing a resource-intensive time-course study. The proposed pipeline will be intensively tested on a large oral microbiome dataset consisting of ~2,600 subgingival samples (~330M reads). The analysis can significantly advance our understanding of dynamic behaviors of oral microbial communities possibly contributing to the development of periodontal disease. To our knowledge, no prior work has been performed on this scale to study oral microbial community dynamics. We have assembled a multidisciplinary team that covers expertise spanning the areas of machine learning, bioinformatics, and oral microbiology. The expected outcome of this work will be a set of computational tools of high utility for the microbiology community and beyond. The human microbiome plays essential roles in many important physiological processes. We propose an interdisciplinary research plan to address some major computational challenges in current microbiome research. If successfully implemented, this work could significantly expand the capacity of existing pipelines for large-scale data analysis and scientific discovery, resulting in a significant impact on the field.",Developing Advanced Algorithms to Address Major Computational Challenges in Current Microbiome Research,9474101,R01AI125982,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Antibiotics', 'Area', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Epidemiology', 'Floods', 'Foundations', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Microbiome', 'Human body', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Knowledge', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Oral Microbiology', 'Outcome', 'Periodontal Diseases', 'Physiological Processes', 'Play', 'Probiotics', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Ribosomal RNA', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'base', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'dynamic system', 'epidemiology study', 'experimental study', 'human microbiota', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microbiome research', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'open source', 'operational taxonomic units', 'oral behavior', 'oral microbial community', 'oral microbiome', 'response', 'tumor progression', 'web app']",NIAID,STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK AT BUFFALO,R01,2018,350321,-0.0050479749004656415
"An automated pipeline for macromolecular structure discovery in cellular  electron cryo-tomography SUMMARY – OVERALL Cellular cryo-tomography has emerged as a critical tool for the visualization and structural study of the molecular nanomachines at the heart of cellular function. Although the basic electron cryo-tomography technique has been used for several decades, the technology is being revolutionized by recent advances in sample preparation, electron cryo-microscopy hardware, improved capabilities for automatic data collection, direct electron detection imaging devices, and phase plate technologies. Combined, these advances led to the ability to generate extraordinarily large numbers of cellular cryo-tomograms of exquisite quality. In principle, such large data sets offer insights into cellular variation in disease states as well as better insights into basic cellular function, opening new possibilities for studying the underpinnings of health and disease at the finest possible level, potentially leading to completely new diagnostics for cancer and other cell-altering diseases. However, collection of cellular data is now at a far faster rate than can currently be analyzed with existing methods, producing a serious barrier to progress: to match the data production rates of a single laboratory, at least 50 experienced scientists would need to handle the data analysis. The primary goal of this Program Project is to establish quantitative and highly automated tools for the reconstruction and interpretation of highly complex cellular tomographic data. We have assembled a highly synergistic team of PIs with complimentary expertise in cutting-edge computational and experimental electron microscopy techniques to achieve this goal through collaborative efforts. Project 1 (Hanein & Penczek) focuses on development and implementation of tomogram quality assessment and validation techniques and on experimentally guided optimization of data collection strategies. Project 2 focuses on automatic tomographic reconstruction technology, extraction of various features from the tomograms, and the analysis of distribution patterns derived from the extracted features. Project 3 focuses on development of quantitative tools for tomogram annotation through deep learning and sub-tomogram alignment as well as interactive visualization tools. The set of highly automated tools developed in this Program Project will permit us to interpret 5–10x as much data as is possible using existing methods, greatly expanding the types of cellular variations we can effectively study. NARRATIVE Cellular cryo-tomography has emerged as a critical tool for the visualization and structural study of the molecular nanomachines at the heart of cellular function and—with recent instrumental advances—it is now possible to image hundreds of cells per months, enabling collection of cellular data at a far faster rate than can currently be analyzed.

"The next generation of RNA-Seq simulators for benchmarking analyses Abstract: RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq) has established itself as the primary method for studying transcription in basic research, with an emerging role in the clinic – currently upwards of 5,000 publications using the technology are indexed in PubMed. However, the interpretation of RNA-Seq requires several complex operations including alignment, quantification, normalization and statistical analyses of various types. Since its inception a large number of algorithms have appeared for each step, creating a very confusing landscape for investigators. In order to determine the best analysis practices, numerous benchmarking studies have emerged which leverage real RNA-Seq data made from well-studied RNA samples, such as the Genetic European Variation in Health and Disease (GEUVADIS) consortium data. These valuable RNA-Seq datasets contain the biases and errors introduced by sequencing biochemistry—factors that any analysis method must account for and overcome. However, the utility of such datasets for benchmarking analysis methods is limited by the fact that we do not know the underlying truth (e.g. the true number of RNA molecules from each transcript in the original sample). Therefore researchers tend to rely heavily on simulated data, since we know everything about the true composition of these samples. There are dozens of DNA simulators aimed at benchmarking applications such as variant calling. And while the need for simulators is just as strong in RNA analysis, there are only a scant few RNA-Seq simulators available. Furthermore, the available RNA- Seq simulators are based on simplifying assumptions that greatly restrict their utility for benchmarking anything but the most upstream steps in the analysis pipeline (e.g. alignment). The further downstream the analysis method is, the more accurately the true nature of real data and its technical biases need to be modeled in order to draw meaningful conclusions. For example, no simulator generates data from a diploid genome, which would be necessary to evaluate allele specific quantification. Given our extensive experience with RNA-Seq analysis and transcriptomics in general, and our success at building the BEERS simulator, and our track record of authorship on all comprehensive RNA-Seq aligner benchmarking studies published to date, we are ideally situated to develop the next generation of open-source RNA-Seq simulator which aims to model all sources of technical variability. Furthermore, the simulator will model biological variability with an empirical approach based on using real data to configure the simulator’s parameters, which is a natural problem for machine learning. There are eleven steps in RNA-Seq library preparation which introduce bias, all of which will be modeled by the software in an object-oriented modular framework. Project Narrative: There have been many algorithms developed for every step of the RNA-Seq analysis pipeline with no easy way to compare between them. Simulated data are useful for this purpose, but to date there are very few RNA-Seq simulators available and all make too many simplifying assumptions to be used for anything but the most upstream steps in the pipeline, e.g. alignment. We propose to develop the next generation of open-source RNA-Seq simulator, which will capture all of the biochemical processes in a modular fashion and model all of the sources of technical variation.",The next generation of RNA-Seq simulators for benchmarking analyses,9600808,R21LM012763,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Authorship', 'Basic Science', 'Benchmarking', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Process', 'Biochemical Reaction', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'DNA', 'DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diploidy', 'Disease', 'Enzymes', 'European', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Guanine + Cytosine Composition', 'Health', 'In Vitro', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Nature', 'Output', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Protocols documentation', 'PubMed', 'Public Domains', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'RNA', 'RNA Splicing', 'RNA analysis', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sequencing Biochemistry', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Transcript', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analog', 'base', 'biochemical model', 'design', 'digital', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'indexing', 'next generation', 'open source', 'operation', 'power analysis', 'success', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R21,2018,217350,-0.04359756894877002
"Multi-Resolution Docking Methods for Electron Microscopy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the past decade, significant progress was made in 3D imaging of macromolecular assemblies via electron microscopy and in the development of computational algorithms that relate the resulting volumetric maps to atomic-resolution structures. The overall goal of the proposed research is to further develop computational fitting and validation tools for electron microscopy (EM). We intend to establish new modeling, visualization, and simulation techniques that would serve as bridges between atomic structures and EM densities. The proposed multi-scale software will aid in the routine determination of large-scale structures of biomolecular assemblies and in the validation of structural models that will be deposited to public databases such as the Protein Data Bank (PDB) and the EM Data Bank (EMDB). Key questions to be addressed include the following: (i) How can one improve, validate, and disseminate well-established matching algorithms for intermediate-resolution (8-15 Å) cryo-electron microscopy? (ii) How can one accurately identify and segment geometric features of subcellular assemblies in low-resolution (4-5 nm) cryo-electron tomograms or in focused ion beam milling of resin-embedded specimen blocks? (iii) Given the recent increase in resolution achieved with direct detection cameras, how can one systematically characterize high-resolution (2-10 Å) density patterns and validate atomic models based on local signatures in the data? We will adapt a new modeling paradigm for these studies, namely simultaneous refinement of multiple subunits. This approach is based on a ""systems"" perspective because biological assemblies exhibit ""emergent behavior"" in the spatial domain, that is, the whole is more than the sum of its parts. The new paradigm, in combination with docking protocols, improves model accuracy and opens the door to new global fitting applications in the above three areas. In addition, we will use statistical analysis and machine learning of local signatures to complement the global strategies. The collaborative efforts supported by this grant will include refinement of cytoskeletal filaments, molecular motors, chromatin fibers, and hair cell stereocilia. The algorithmic and methodological developments will be distributed freely through the established internet-based mechanisms used by the Situs and Sculptor packages. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project helps biological electron microscopists bridge a broad range of resolution levels from atomic to living organism-level. Macromolecular assemblies are the basic functional units of biological cells; they furnish targets for drug design because deficiencies in macromolecular assembly architecture are frequently linked to health problems.

"Novel Use of Emergent Technologies to Improve Efficiency of Animal Model Research PROJECT SUMMARY This Phase II project aims to continue development of a commercial quality, innovative cloud hosted information management system, called Climb 2.0™ that will increase laboratory efficiency and provide improved capabilities for research laboratories. Climb is designed to offer integrated laboratory process management modules that include mobile communications tools data monitoring and alert systems, and integrated access to Microsoft Azure Cloud™ Machine Learning and Stream Analytics services. Initially, Climb 2.0 will target animal model research laboratories; however, the core of the platform is designed to be adaptable to nearly any research type or related industry. Current research information management systems are primarily designed as record-keeping tools with little or no direct focus on laboratory efficiency or in enhancing value of the research data. They also do not leverage emergent mobile device technologies, social media frameworks, and data analysis and storage capabilities of cloud computing. Many laboratories still use paper as their primary recording system. Paper data logging is then followed by secondary data entry into a laboratory database. These systems are error prone, time consuming and lead to laboratory databases with significant time lags between data acquisition and data entry. Moreover, they do not recognized cumulative data relationships, which may identify important trends, and researchers often miss windows of opportunity to take action on time-sensitive events. In Phase I, RockStep Solutions demonstrated feasibility of an innovative Cloud Information Management Bundle system, Climb, which will increase efficiency and improve capabilities in animal model data management. During Phase I, a beta version of Climb was successfully developed and tested against strict performance metrics as a proof of concept. We successfully built a prototype with working interfaces that integrates real-time communication technologies with media capabilities of mobile devices. Phase II proposes four specific Aims: 1) Develop the technology infrastructure to support the secure and scalable Software as a Service (SaaS) deployment of Climb for enterprise commercial release; 2) Develop and extend the Phase-I prototype Data Monitoring and Messaging System (DMMS) into a platform ready for production use; 3) Extend Climb’s DMMS adding a Stream Analytics engine to support Internet of Things (IoT) devices and streaming media; 4) Deploy a beta release of Climb at partner research labs, test and refine the product for final commercialization. To ensure Climb is developed with functionality and tools relevant to research organizations, RockStep Solutions has established collaborations with key beta sites to test all of the major functionality developed in this proposal. IMPACT: By leveraging emergent technologies and cloud computing, Climb offers several advantages: 1) enables real-time communications using familiar tools among members of research groups; 2) reduces the risk of experimental setbacks, and 3) enables complex experiments to be conducted efficiently. PROJECT NARRATIVE PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The NIH Invests approximately $12 billion each year in animal model research that is central to both understanding basic biological processes and for developing applications directly related to improving human health. More cost-effective husbandry and colony management techniques, equipment, and new approaches to improve laboratory animal welfare and assure efficient and appropriate research use (e.g., through cost savings and reduced animal burden) are high priorities for NIH. RockStep Solutions proposes to meet this need by integrating existing and emergent software and communication technologies to create a novel solution, Climb 2.0, for research animal data management. Climb 2.0 extracts immediate value of data in animal research laboratories and extends the database into a multimedia communication network, thus enabling science that would be impractical to conduct with traditional methods.",Novel Use of Emergent Technologies to Improve Efficiency of Animal Model Research,9741597,R44GM112206,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Experimentation', 'Animal Model', 'Animal Welfare', 'Animals', 'Biological Process', 'Biomedical Research', 'Clinical Laboratory Information Systems', 'Cloud Computing', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Communication Tools', 'Communications Media', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Consumption', 'Cost Savings', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Security', 'Data Set', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Ensure', 'Equipment', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Event', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Human', 'Industry', 'Information Management', 'Internet', 'Internet of Things', 'Investments', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Animals', 'Laboratory Research', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Management Information Systems', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Multimedia', 'Notification', 'Paper', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Production', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Science', 'Secure', 'Services', 'Site', 'Stream', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'The Jackson Laboratory', 'Time', 'Transact', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'cloud based', 'commercialization', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'data acquisition', 'data management', 'design', 'encryption', 'experimental study', 'good laboratory practice', 'graphical user interface', 'handheld mobile device', 'improved', 'innovation', 'laptop', 'member', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'service learning', 'social media', 'software as a service', 'success', 'time interval', 'tool', 'trend', 'usability']",NIGMS,"ROCKSTEP SOLUTIONS, INC.",R44,2018,99999,0.005581057064664081
"Sci-Score, a tool suite to support Rigor and Transparency NIH and Journal Guidelines Project​ ​Summary While standards in reporting of scientific methods are absolutely critical to producing reproducible science, meeting such standards is tedious and difficult. Checklists and instructions are tough to follow often resulting in low and inconsistent compliance. Scientific journals and societies as well as the National Institutes of Health are now actively proposing general guidelines to address reproducibility issues, particularly in the reporting of methods,​ ​but​ ​the​ ​trickier​ ​part​ ​is​ ​to​ ​train​ ​the​ ​biomedical​ ​community​ ​to​ ​use​ ​these​ ​standards​ ​to​ ​effectively. To support new standards in methods reporting, especially the RRID standard for Rigor and Transparency of Key Biological Resources, we propose to build Sci-Score a text mining based tool suite to help authors meet the standard. Sci-Score will provide an automated check on compliance with the RRID standard already implemented by over 100 journals including Cell, Journal of Neuroscience, and eLife and other Rigor and transparency standards put forward by the NIH. The innovation behind Sci-score is the provision of a score, which can be obtained by individual investigators or journals. This score reflects an aspect of quality of methods reporting. We posit that the score will serve as a tool that investigators can use to compete with themselves​ ​and​ ​each​ ​other,​ ​the​ ​way​ ​they​ ​currently​ ​compete​ ​on​ ​metrics​ ​of​ ​popularity,​ ​i.e.,​ ​the​ ​H-index. In Phase I of this project and before, our group has successfully developed a text mining algorithm that can detect antibodies, cell lines, organisms and digital resources (all 4 RRID types) and has created a preliminary score. We propose to extend this approach to all research inputs, like chemicals and plasmids that are requested as part of Cell press’ STAR Methods (http://www.cell.com/star-methods)​. We also propose to build a set of algorithms to detect whether authors discuss the major sources of irreproducibility outlined by NIH, including investigator blinding, proper randomization and sufficient reporting of sex and other biological variables. Resource identification along with other quality metrics will be used to score the quality of scientific methods section text. If successful, the tool could be used by editors, reviewers, and investigators to improve the​ ​quality​ ​of​ ​the​ ​scientific​ ​paper. Our Phase II specific aims include 1) enhancing and hardening the core natural language processing pipelines to recognize a broader range of sentences in near real time; 2) building a set of modular tools that will be provided for different groups of users to take advantage of the text mining capability we develop in aim 1. At the end of Phase II, we should have a commercially viable product that will be able to be licensed to serve the needs​ ​of​ ​the​ ​publishers​ ​and​ ​the​ ​broader​ ​research​ ​community.

Cytobank already makes major contributions (1) centralizing single-cell cytometry data, (2) providing data analysis traceability that removes knowledge sharing complexities, and (3) establishing a platform that increases access to cutting edge algorithms and makes complex machine learning methods easy for biologists to use. However, as the amount, complexity, and different types of single cell data and other associated data increases and the number of workflows and single-cell algorithms to analyze the data also increases, the need for open and easy access to existing and new tools and secure, complete storage of the workflows and the resulting data has increased to the point of being critical for supporting basic and translational research collaborations and enabling them to efficiently achieve their objectives including biomarker discovery and development. The proposed project significantly extends the capabilities of the Cytobank platform. This will benefit the community by (1) enabling scalable and secure access to a number of new single-cell data analysis tools that will result in new automated workflows, and (2) enable more efficient cross platform knowledge generation with increased meta-analysis capabilities across experiments and data types. The potential of this project is that thousands of scientists around the world will be able to more easily leverage additional single-cell cytometry, transcript, and other data in their translational research data analysis including automating analysis that has primarily been dominated by expert-driven annotation, thus providing a central repository and knowledge management framework that will accelerate biomarker discovery and precision medicine. Project Narrative Single-cell biology and Immunotherapy are exploding and generating larger and more complex datasets in combination clinical trials. To take full advantage of these revolutions, the iteration and dissemination of advanced single-cell data analysis algorithms (many of whose development was funded by the NIH) needs to scale at the same rate as single-cell data generation technologies are scaling, and multi-omics data analysis and visualization must be integrated and automated. This project will greatly accelerate scientific research, transparency, and reproducibility by significantly lowering the barrier to perform complex data analysis of multiple types of high-dimensional data, providing the biomedical research community with access to powerful tools needed in immuno-oncology, autoimmunity and other high-impact disease areas.",Accelerating Multi-modal Biomarker Discovery in Translational Research with Cloud Data Integration,9464486,R44GM117914,"['Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Autoimmunity', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Basic Science', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cytometry', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Follicular Lymphoma', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Generations', 'Immune System Diseases', 'Immune system', 'Immunologic Monitoring', 'Immunology', 'Immunooncology', 'Immunotherapy', 'Information Resources Management', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Regimen', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Sharing', 'Resources', 'Scientist', 'Secure', 'System', 'Target Populations', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Toxic effect', 'Transcript', 'Translational Research', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'anti-cancer', 'base', 'biomarker development', 'biomarker discovery', 'biomarker validation', 'clinically actionable', 'cloud based', 'cost effective', 'cytokine', 'data integration', 'data management', 'data visualization', 'experimental study', 'high dimensionality', 'immunotherapy trials', 'improved', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'multiple omics', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'personalized medicine', 'population based', 'precision medicine', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'relapse prediction', 'repository', 'response', 'single cell analysis', 'single cell technology', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'synergism', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor']",NIGMS,"CYTOBANK, INC.",R44,2018,613841,-0.003376891022980973
"Integrative approach to studying LncRNA functions ABSTRACT  Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play regulatory roles in biological cell process and disease development. It has been emerging as a key regulator of diverse cellular processes. Great efforts have been made towards investigation of lncRNA functions with both experimental determination and theoretical modeling, leading to a rudimentary understanding of this class of RNAs. However, all of these cannot keep pace with the fast growth of diverse genetic data and urgent request of individual lncRNA function annotation, which is inhibited by the tremendous amount of lncRNAs and expensive experimental cost. This propose aim to address this issue by providing efficient and user-friendly tools for key lncRNA discovery and lncRNA function annotation. To do so, we will develop a unique bioinformatics and Systems Biology integrated approach, ISSNLncFA system, which enables the integration of all sorts of omics data and a comprehensive understanding of lncRNA functions.  We propose three specific aims for the ultimate lncRNA function annotation: (1) To develop a novel Co- Modules-based LncRNA Function Annotation (CoMoLncFA) model to detect key lncRNAs and to annotate lncRNA functions at post transcription level as lncRNA-PCG co-modules, lncRNA-pathways association network and lncRNA’s triplets (lncRNA-miRNA/TF-PCG) by considering the expression profiles of lncRNA, protein coding genes and miRNAs and transcript factors, and integrating the curated protein-protein interactions and biological pathways. (2) To develop a novel Structure-based LncRNA-protein Function Annotation (STRULncFA) model to characterize lncRNAs identified from Aim 1 by using their primary sequences and secondary structures for detecting lncRNA-protein functional relations; and to further reveal the regulatory roles and mechanism of these lncRNAs by determining the binding sites in both lncRNA and protein. (3) To experimentally validate the identified abnormal lncRNAs and their cellular products, to validate the identified lncRNA-protein interacting pairs and the predicted binding sites, and to develop software tools and an environment for functional annotation of lncRNAs, use these tools to evaluate the overall proposed approach, and apply them to identify lncRNA functions that may be involved in cell states, species, diseases and cancers and build lncRNA function databases.  We believe that we will build the models, tools and databases, and make them available to the public in a timely fashion. Our achievements will lead to a complete understanding of lncRNA functions and regulatory roles in cell and disease states. Moreover, our models and tools will be feasibly transformed to other function annotation tasks and disease studies with appropriate changes, and thus will move forward the general function annotation community and disease-related drug or therapy development. Project Narrative The ISSNLncFA software package will allow the investigators to characterize the LncRNA functions by integrating RNA-Seq, micorRNA-Seq, and together with protein and RNA structure data with systems biology approaches. As a prototype to test our system, we aim to use this system to study myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs). Although MDS is used as the prototype of disease for this proposal, the system developed will be applicable to multiple diseases with complex phenotypes.",Integrative approach to studying LncRNA functions,9565604,R01GM123037,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Architecture', 'Binding Sites', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Breast', 'CD34 gene', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 22', 'Chronic Disease', 'Code', 'Colorectal', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dysmyelopoietic Syndromes', 'Embryonic Development', 'Environment', 'Enzymes', 'Evaluation', 'Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomic Imprinting', 'Growth', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hematopoietic stem cells', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Liver', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Network-based', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'Transcript', 'Triplet Multiple Birth', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Work', 'X Chromosome', 'base', 'chromatin modification', 'chromatin remodeling', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'gene function', 'genomic data', 'high throughput technology', 'learning network', 'next generation', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'protein function', 'protein protein interaction', 'prototype', 'scaffold', 'software development', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'tool development', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'user-friendly']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R01,2018,302225,-0.043056249447254474

"Semantic Literature Annotation and Integrative Panomics Analysis for PTM-Disease Knowledge Network Discovery PROJECT SUMMARY Protein post-translational modification (PTM) plays a critical role in many diseases; however, critical gaps remain in research infrastructure for global analysis of PTMs. Key PTM information concerning enzyme- substrate relationships, regulation of PTM enzymes, PTM cross-talk, and functional consequences of PTM remains buried in the scientific literature. Meanwhile, while high-throughput panomics (genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, PTM proteomic) data offer an unprecedented opportunity for the discovery of PTM-disease relationships, the data must be analyzed in an integrated and easily accessible knowledge framework in order for researchers and clinicians to gain a molecular understanding of disease. The goal of this application is to develop a collaborative knowledge environment for semantic annotation of scientific literature and integrative panomics analysis for PTM-disease knowledge discovery in precision medicine. We propose to connect PTM information from literature mining and curated databases in a knowledge resource on an ontological framework that supports analysis of panomics data in the context of PTM networks. To broaden impact and foster collaborative development, our resource will be FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) and interoperable with community standards.  The specific aims are: (i) develop a novel NLP (natural language processing) system for full-scale literature mining and PTM-disease knowledge extraction; (ii) develop a PTM knowledge resource for integrative panomics analysis and network discovery; and (iii) provide a FAIR collaborative environment for scalable semantic annotation and knowledge integration. The proposed system will build upon the NLP technologies and text mining tools already developed by our team and the bioinformatics infrastructure at the Protein Information Resource (PIR). The iPTMnet web portal will allow searching, browsing, visualization and analysis of PTM networks and PTM-related mutations in conjunction with user-supplied omics data, including panomics data from major national initiatives. Use scenarios will include identification of disease-driving genetic variants and analysis of cellular responses to kinase inhibitors. Our PTM knowledgebase will be disseminated with an RDF triple-store and a SPARQL endpoint for semantic queries, while our text mining tools and full-scale literature mining results will be disseminated in the BioC community standard for seamless integration to other text mining pipelines. To engage the community semantic annotation of scientific literature, we will host a hackathon to develop tools to expose BioC-annotated literature corpora to the semantic web, as well as an annotation jamboree to explore tagging of scientific text with precise ontological terms. This project will thus offer a unique research resource for PTM-disease network discovery as well as an integrable collaborative knowledge framework to support Big Data to Knowledge in precision medicine. PROJECT NARRATIVE Precision medicine requires a detailed understanding of the molecular events that are disrupted in disease, including changes in protein post-translational modifications (PTM) that are hallmarks of many diseases. The proposed resource will support analysis of genomic-scale data for exploring PTM-disease networks and PTM-related mutations, as well as knowledge dissemination on the semantic web. These combined efforts will accelerate basic understanding of disease processes and discovery of diagnostic targets and more effective individualized therapies.",Semantic Literature Annotation and Integrative Panomics Analysis for PTM-Disease Knowledge Network Discovery,9532909,U01GM120953,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Automobile Driving', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Controlled Vocabulary', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Drug resistance', 'Educational workshop', 'Environment', 'Enzymes', 'Europe', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'FAIR principles', 'Fostering', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Hybrids', 'Imagery', 'Information Resources', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Knowledge Extraction', 'Length', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'MicroRNAs', 'Mining', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Ontology', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Phosphorylation', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Play', 'Post Translational Modification Analysis', 'Post-Translational Modification Site', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Post-Translational Regulation', 'Process', 'Protein Family', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'PubMed', 'Publications', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Semantics', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Site', 'System', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Tissues', 'Translational Research', 'Variant', 'bioinformatics resource', 'cell type', 'collaborative environment', 'computer based Semantic Analysis', 'enzyme substrate', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic variant', 'hackathon', 'indexing', 'individualized medicine', 'information organization', 'innovation', 'interoperability', 'kinase inhibitor', 'knowledge base', 'knowledge integration', 'novel', 'precision medicine', 'protein complex', 'protein protein interaction', 'response', 'system architecture', 'text searching', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'web portal', 'web services', 'web site']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF DELAWARE,U01,2018,365327,-0.033424917104253674
"A Systems Biology Approach to Investigate the Structure Changes of Biological Network Project Summary/Abstract Networks have been widely used to describe many biological processes. Understanding the structure of biological network, especially regulatory network, will provide a key to discovering the mechanisms underlying important biological processes and pathogenesis of diseases. One of the most challenging tasks in systems biology is how to correctly reconstruct the networks from the high-dimensional data generated by modern genomic technology. Most network inference methods assume the network structure is time-invariant. Some recent studies revealed the structures of some biological networks are non-stationary or time-varying. For example, the neural information flow networks of brains are changing during learning process. Importantly, cancer studies found the native T cells would be converted into senescent T cells due to the structure changes of genetic network during tumorigenesis. The stationary network inference methods can't be used to reconstruct the time-varying network. Non-stationary network inference methods are urgently needed to investigate the time-varying networks at different stages. Some researchers have attempted to develop some time-varying network inference methods. However, the inferred networks using existing methods are only correlation or causality graphs, not regulatory networks which require activation & inhibition information. This project aims to develop novel non-stationary network inference methods to reconstruct time-varying regulatory networks from time series data. Since the networks are highly complex, it is not realistic to manually verify large networks as being used by the traditional methods. We will develop a powerful Model Checker, which is a Turing Award winning technique for hardware system verification, to intelligently verify the inferred time-varying networks. Our long-term goal is to integrate the statistical inference and model checking techniques in a unified platform to automatically reconstruct and verify time-varying networks. This integrative systems biology approach will make the large-network inference and verification automatic, intelligent and efficient. Recent cancer studies show that, restoring senescent T cells represents a promising strategy for cancer treatment. In collaboration with cancer immunologist, we will apply computational-experimental approaches to investigate what structure changes of the genetic network and how they induce T-cell's functional changes and influence its fate decision making from naive T-cells to senescent T-cells. Answering these questions will significantly improve our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the T cell differentiation during tumorigenesis. Public Health Relevance/Narrative This project aims to develop a novel systems biology approach to reconstruct the time-varying biological networks from high-dimensional data in collaboration with the cancer immunologist. The proposed research has relevance to public health, because it seeks to investigate what and how the structure changes of genetic network induce the T-cell's functional changes during tumorigenesis, which will ultimately improve our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the T cell differentiation and cancer.",A Systems Biology Approach to Investigate the Structure Changes of Biological Network,9655801,R15GM129696,"['Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Brain', 'Cancer Immunology Science', 'Cells', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drosophila genus', 'Etiology', 'Evolution', 'Gene Structure', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Immunologist', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Location', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Muscle Development', 'Mutation', 'Pathogenesis', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory T-Lymphocyte', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Series', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'T cell differentiation', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'computer studies', 'exhaust', 'experimental study', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'neoplastic cell', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'senescence', 'tool', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumorigenesis']",NIGMS,SAINT LOUIS UNIVERSITY,R15,2018,454500,-0.02073367202040599
"Advanced computational methods in analyzing high-throughput sequencing data Sequencing technologies have become an essential tool to the study of human evolution, to the understanding of the genetic bases of diseases and to the clinical detection and treatment of genetic disorders. Computational algorithms are indispensible to the analysis of large-scale sequencing data and have received broad attention. However, developed several years ago, many mainstream software packages for sequence alignment, assembly and variant calling have gradually lagged behind the rapid development of sequencing technologies. They are unable to process the latest long reads or assembled contigs, and will be outpaced by upcoming technologies in terms of throughput. The development of advanced algorithms is critical to the applications of sequencing technologies in the near future. This project will address this pressing need with four proposals: (1) developing a fast and accurate aligner that accelerates short-read alignment and can map megabase-long assemblies against large sequence collections of over 100 gigabases in size; (2) developing an integrated caller for small sequence variations that is faster to run, more sensitive to moderately longer insertions and more accessible to biologists without extended expertise in bioinformatics; (3) developing a generic variant filtering tool that uses a novel deep learning model to achieve human-level accuracy on identifying false positive calls; (4) developing a new de novo assembler that works with the latest nanopore reads of ~100 kilobases in length and may achieve good contiguity at low coverage. Upon completion, the proposed studies will dramatically reduce the computational cost of data processing in most research labs and commercial entities, and will enable the applications of long reads in genome assembly, in the study of structural variations and in cancer researches. Computational algorithms are essential to the analysis of high-throughput sequencing data produced for the detection, prevention and treatment of cancers and genetic disorders. The proposed studies aim to address new challenges arising from the latest sequencing data and to develop faster and more accurate solutions to existing applications. The success of this proposal is likely to unlock the full power of recent sequencing technologies in disease studies and will dramatically reduce the cost of data analyses.",Advanced computational methods in analyzing high-throughput sequencing data,9498252,R01HG010040,"['Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Characteristics', 'Chromosomes', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Dependence', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Evolution', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Generic Drugs', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genome', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Large-Scale Sequencing', 'Length', 'Mainstreaming', 'Maps', 'Medical Genetics', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Performance', 'Population Genetics', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Production', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Running', 'Seeds', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Site', 'Speed', 'Stress', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep sequencing', 'design', 'experimental study', 'genome analysis', 'high throughput analysis', 'improved', 'indexing', 'light weight', 'mammalian genome', 'nanopore', 'novel', 'open source', 'programs', 'success', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'whole genome']",NHGRI,"BROAD INSTITUTE, INC.",R01,2018,158992,-0.024120876993419856
"Bioinformatics Tools for Circadian Biology Circadian rhythms are fundamental for understanding biology: they date back to the origin of life, they are found in virtually every species from cyanobacteria to mammals, and they coordinate many important biological functions from the sleep-wake cycle, to metabolism, and to cognitive functions. Circadian rhythms are equally fundamental for health and medicine: modifications in diet have been linked to modification in circadian rhythms at the molecular level; disruptions of circadian rhythms have been linked to health problems ranging from depression, to learning disorders, to diabetes, to obesity, to cardiovascular disease, to cancer, and to premature ageing; finally, a large fraction of drug targets have been found to oscillate in a circadian manner in one or several tissues, suggesting that a better understanding of circadian oscillations at the molecular level could have direct applications to precision medicine, for instance by optimizing the time at which drugs are taken.  To better understand circadian oscillations at the molecular level, modern high-throughput technologies are being used to measure the concentrations of many molecular species, including transcripts, proteins, and metabolites along the circadian cycle in different organs and tissues, and under different conditions. However, the informatics tools for processing, analyzing, and integrating the growing wealth of molecular circadian data are not yet in place.  This effort will fill this fundamental gap by developing and disseminating informatics tools that will enable the collection, integration, and analyses of this wealth of information and lead to novel and fundamental insights about the organization and regulation of circadian oscillations, their roles in health and disease, and their future applications to precision medicine. Specifically, through a close collaborations between computational and experimental scientists, this effort will: (1) Bring the power of deep learning methods to bear on the analyses of omic time series to determine, for instance, which molecular species are oscillating, their characteristics (period, phase, amplitude), and to predict the time/phase associated with a measurement taken at a single time point; (2) Develop Cyber-TC, an extension of the widely used Cyber-T software, for the differential analysis of circadian omic time series and expand MotifMap, a widely used genome-wide map of regulatory sites to better understand circadian regulation; and (3) Develop Circadiomics, an integrated database and web portal as a one-stop shop for circadian data, annotations, and analyses.

This project will complete the collection and review of the clinical data for each sample in the Epi25 collection to facilitate the translation of genomic and clinical discoveries into improved care for patients. The clinical and genomic data from Epi25 will be a global resource, shared with the research community for years to come. Epi25's governance structure, membership, and other information are available online at www.epi-25.org. In this project, clinical data is entered by contributors into Red Cap forms or uploaded directly into the Epi25 database. The clinical data is then checked by a computer algorithm that looks for key eligibility criteria for each participant. Errors and missing data are sent to the Phenotyping Coordinator to review and resolve, with the help of the contributing site.

"Tools for rapid and accurate structure elucidation of natural products Mapping the Secondary Metabolomes of Marine Cyanobacteria Bacteria are extraordinarily prolific sources of structurally unique and biologically active natural products that derive from a diversity of fascinating biochemical pathways. However, the complete structure elucidation of natural products is often the most time consuming and costly endeavor in natural product drug discovery programs. Compounding this, advancements in genome sequencing have accelerated the identification of unique modular biosynthetic gene clusters in prokaryotes and revealed a wealth of new compounds yet to be isolated and biologically and chemically characterized.

"HIGH THROUGHPUT LITERATURE CURATION OF GENETIC REGULATION IN BACTERIAL MODELS DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The aim of this proposal is to implement a novel way of processing and accessing the vast detailed knowledge contained within collections of scientific publications on the regulation of transcription initiation in bacterial models. In princple, this model for processing and reading information and new knowledge is applicable to other biological domains, potentially benefiting any area of biomedical knowledge. It is certainly criticl to generate new strategies to cope with the ever-increasing amount of knowledge generated in genomics and in biomedical research at large. Improving the efficiency of the traditional high-quality manual curation of scientific publications will enable us also to expand the type of biological knowledge, beyond mechanisms and their elements in the genome, to start including their connections with larger regulated processes and eventually physiological properties of the cell. We will first implement the necessary technology to improve our curation by means of a computational system that has text mining capabilities for preprocessing the papers before a human expert curator identifies which sentences contain the information that is to be added to the database. Premarked options selected by the curators will accelerate their decisions. The accumulative precise mapping between sentences and curated knowledge will provide training sets for text mining technologies to improve their automatic extraction. The curator practices will become more efficient, enabling us to curate selected high-impact published reviews to place mechanisms into a rich context of their physiological processes and general biology. Another relevant component of our proposal is the improved modeling of regulated processes by means of new concepts in biology that capture larger collections of coregulated genes and their concatenated reactions. Starting from all interactions of a local regulator, coregulated regulators and their domain of action will be incorporated to construct the biobricks of complex decisions, as they are encoded in the genome. These are conceptual containers that capture the organization of knowledge to describe the genetic programming of cellular capabilities. These proposals will be formalized and proposed within an international consortium focused in enriching standard models or ontologies of gene regulation for use by the scientific community. Finally, a portal to navigate across all the sentences of a given corpus of a large number (more than 5,000) of related papers will be implemented. The different avenues of navigation will essentially use two technologies, one dealing with automatically generating simpler sentences from original sentences as input, and the other one with the classification of papers based on their theme or ontology. Their combination will enable a novel navigation reading system. If we achieve our aims, this project will give a proof-of-principle prototype with clearly innovative higher levels of large amounts of integrated knowledge. Future directions may adapt these concepts and methods to the biology of higher organisms, including humans. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Scientific knowledge reported within publications provides a wealth of knowledge that we barely capture in databases for genomics. Enhancing the effectiveness of the processing and representation of all this knowledge will change the way we encode our understanding of concatenated interactions that are organized into networks and processes governing cell behavior. Given the conservation in evolution of the nature of biological complexity, a better encoding of our understanding of a bacterial cell shall influence that of any other living organism.",HIGH THROUGHPUT LITERATURE CURATION OF GENETIC REGULATION IN BACTERIAL MODELS,9407024,R01GM110597,"['Area', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Model', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Effectiveness', 'Elements', 'Escherichia coli', 'Evolution', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Programming', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Growth', 'Human', 'International', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Letters', 'Linguistics', 'Literature', 'Manuals', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Ontology', 'Operon', 'Organism', 'Paper', 'Physiological', 'Physiological Processes', 'Planet Earth', 'Process', 'Property', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Reaction', 'Reading', 'Regulation', 'Regulon', 'Reporting', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Solid', 'Source', 'System', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Training', 'Transcription Initiation', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'base', 'cell behavior', 'digital', 'electronic book', 'experience', 'feeding', 'functional genomics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'member', 'microbial community', 'model organisms databases', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'promoter', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'software development', 'text searching', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'usability']",NIGMS,CENTER FOR GENOMIC SCIENCES,R01,2018,395628,-0.042383243906426456
"A Modeling Framework for Multi-View Data, with Applications to the Pioneer 100 Study and Protein Interaction Networks New advances in biomedical research have made it possible to collect multiple data “views” — for example, genetic, metabolomic, and clinical data — for a single patient. Such multi-view data promises to offer deeper insights into a patient's health and disease than would be possible if just one data view were available. However, in order to achieve this promise, new statistical methods are needed.  This proposal involves developing statistical methods for the analysis of multi-view data. These methods can be used to answer the following fundamental question: do the data views contain redundant information about the observations, or does each data view contain a different set of information? The answer to this question will provide insight into the data views, as well as insight into the observations. If two data views contain redundant information about the observations, then those two data views are related to each other. Furthermore, if each data view tells the same “story” about the observations, then we can be quite conﬁdent that the story is true.  The investigators will develop a uniﬁed framework for modeling multi-view data, which will then be applied in a number of settings. In Aim 1, this framework will be applied to multi-view multivariate data (e.g. a single set of patients, with both clinical and genetic measurements), in order to determine whether a single clustering can adequately describe the patients across all data views, or whether the patients cluster separately in each data view. In Aim 2, the framework will be applied to multi-view network data (e.g. a single set of proteins, with both binary and co-complex interactions measured), in order to determine whether the nodes belong to a single set of communities across the data views, or a separate set of communities in each data view. In Aim 3, the framework will be applied to multi-view multivariate data in order to determine whether the observations can be embedded in a single latent space across all data views, or whether they belong to a separate latent space in each data view. In Aims 1–3, the methods developed will be applied to the Pioneer 100 study, and to the protein interactome. In Aim 4(a), the availability of multiple data views will be used in order to develop a method for tuning parameter selection in unsupervised learning. In Aim 4(b), protein communities that were identiﬁed in Aim 2 will be validated experimentally. High-quality open source software will be developed in Aim 5.  The methods developed in this proposal will be used to determine whether the ﬁndings from multiple data views are the same or different. The application of these methods to multi-view data sets, including the Pioneer 100 study and the protein interactome, will improve our understanding of human health and disease, as well as fundamental biology. Biomedical researchers often collect multiple “types” of data (e.g. clinical data and genetic data) for a single patient, in order to get a fuller picture of that patient's health or disease status than would be possible using any single data type. This proposal involves developing new statistical methods that can be used in order to analyze data sets that consist of multiple data types. Applying these methods will lead to new insights and better understanding of human health and disease.","A Modeling Framework for Multi-View Data, with Applications to the Pioneer 100 Study and Protein Interaction Networks",9535429,R01GM123993,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Clinical Data', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Genetics', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Records', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Set protein', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trust', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'insight', 'metabolomics', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'unsupervised learning']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2018,315184,-0.020911356338919752
"Evidence Extraction Systems for the Molecular Interaction Literature Burns, Gully A. Abstract  In primary research articles, scientists make claims based on evidence from experiments, and report both the claims and the supporting evidence in the results section of papers. However, biomedical databases de- scribe the claims made by scientists in detail, but rarely provide descriptions of any supporting evidence that a consulting scientist could use to understand why the claims are being made. Currently, the process of curating evidence into databases is manual, time-consuming and expensive; thus, evidence is recorded in papers but not generally captured in database systems. For example, the European Bioinformatics Institute's INTACT database describes how different molecules biochemically interact with each other in detail. They characterize the under- lying experiment providing the evidence of that interaction with only two hierarchical variables: a code denoting the method used to detect the molecular interaction and another code denoting the method used to detect each molecule. In fact, INTACT describes 94 different types of interaction detection method that could be used in conjunction with other experimental methodological processes that can be used in a variety of different ways to reveal different details about the interaction. This crucial information is not being captured in databases. Although experimental evidence is complex, it conforms to certain principles of experimental design: experimentally study- ing a phenomenon typically involves measuring well-chosen dependent variables whilst altering the values of equally well-chosen independent variables. Exploiting these principles has permitted us to devise a preliminary, robust, general-purpose representation for experimental evidence. In this project, We will use this representation to describe the methods and data pertaining to evidence underpinning the interpretive assertions about molecular interactions described by INTACT. A key contribution of our project is that we will develop methods to extract this evidence from scientiﬁc papers automatically (A) by using image processing on a speciﬁc subtype of ﬁgure that is common in molecular biology papers and (B) by using natural language processing to read information from the text used by scientists to describe their results. We will develop these tools for the INTACT repository but package them so that they may then also be used for evidence pertaining to other areas of research in biomedicine. Burns, Gully A. Narrative  Molecular biology databases contain crucial information for the study of human disease (especially cancer), but they omit details of scientiﬁc evidence. Our work will provide detailed accounts of experimental evidence supporting claims pertaining to the study of these diseases. This additional detail may provide scientists with more powerful ways of detecting anomalies and resolving contradictory ﬁndings.",Evidence Extraction Systems for the Molecular Interaction Literature,9365558,R01LM012592,"['Area', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Burn injury', 'Cereals', 'Classification', 'Co-Immunoprecipitations', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Consult', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'European', 'Event', 'Experimental Designs', 'Experimental Models', 'Gel', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Image', 'Informatics', 'Institutes', 'Intelligence', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Models', 'Molecular Weight', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Paper', 'Pattern', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Privatization', 'Process', 'Protein Structure Initiative', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Reading', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Scientist', 'Source Code', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Taxonomy', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Typology', 'Western Blotting', 'Work', 'base', 'data modeling', 'experimental study', 'human disease', 'image processing', 'learning strategy', 'molecular modeling', 'open source', 'optical character recognition', 'protein protein interaction', 'repository', 'software systems', 'text searching', 'tool']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2017,264299,-0.00904027807458019
"A high-throughput imaging and classification system for fruit flies PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT In this Phase I SBIR application, FlySorter proposes to development a high throughput imaging and classification system to aid research with fruit flies, a widely-used model organism relevant to both basic science as well as studies in human health. The use of animal model systems is essential for research in almost all aspects of biology: genetics, development, neuroscience, disease, physiology, and beyond. The fruit fly – Drosophila melanogaster – is small and easy to care for, but is complex enough an organism to provide a wealth of information that directly relates to human biology and health. Over 75% of human diseases with a genetic basis (including depression, alcoholism, certain forms of cancer, and many more) are either present or have an analog in Drosophila. Modern genetic tools, such as CRISPR/cas9, allow the creation of transgenic flies that provide the opportunity to study diseases, pathways and systems that don’t exist naturally in Drosophila. With these advances, fruit flies are becoming more frequently subjects for drugs screens. For all the advances in the biological tools and techniques applicable to flies, however, the limiting factor in many experiments is the manual labor involved in a few common tasks: moving flies from vial to vial or other lab equipment; classifying and sorting flies by sex, eye color and other phenotypes; and collecting virgin female flies before they mate so that they can be used in controlled crosses, etc. FlySorter’s patent-pending fly dispensing mechanism can reliably deliver a single organism from a vial containing hundreds of awake flies, and our novel FlyPlate system allows storage of individual flies in custom 96 well plates. FlySorter’s robotic fly handling system, co-developed with the de Bivort Lab at Harvard, is capable of manipulating and transporting those individual flies between vial, 96 well plate, and experimental apparatus. The next piece of the automation puzzle to solve is high throughput imaging and classification. To accomplish this goal, FlySorter will: 1) complete a prototype automated image capture hardware system; 2) adapt state-of-the-art computer vision and machine learning algorithms for use on Drosophila; and 3) build a module that can physically sort the classified flies into different vials. Once integrated into the existing FlySorter product ecosystem, this imaging and classification module will greatly expand the kinds of experiments and screens that can be automated, allowing for the study of larger populations or a wider variety of flies, reducing the impact of human error, and freeing up valuable time for researchers. PROJECT NARRATIVE Fruit flies – Drosophila melanogaster – are one of the most widely used model organisms in biology, for research in genetics, development, neuroscience, disease, and much more. One of the most common tasks in Drosophila labs is sorting flies by various markers and phenotypes using a microscope and paintbrush. FlySorter aims to build an automated system for sorting flies using high resolution digital cameras and modern computer vision algorithms, which will obviate the need for such tedious manual labor.",A high-throughput imaging and classification system for fruit flies,9408980,R43OD023302,"['Air', 'Alcoholism', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Appearance', 'Automation', 'Basic Science', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biology', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Custom', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Disease Pathway', 'Dorsal', 'Drosophila genus', 'Drosophila melanogaster', 'Ecosystem', 'Ensure', 'Eye', 'Eye Color', 'Female', 'Floor', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Screening', 'Genetic study', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Head', 'Health', 'Heart Diseases', 'Human', 'Human Biology', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Legal patent', 'Lighting', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Mechanics', 'Mental Depression', 'Methodology', 'Microscope', 'Modernization', 'Motor', 'Mutation', 'Names', 'Neurosciences', 'Obesity', 'Optics', 'Organism', 'Partner in relationship', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Preclinical Drug Evaluation', 'Pump', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'Sampling', 'Sclera', 'Shapes', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Universities', 'Vial device', 'Walking', 'Work', 'analog', 'awake', 'base', 'depression model', 'digital', 'digital imaging', 'experimental study', 'fly', 'genetic strain', 'human disease', 'improved', 'interest', 'laboratory equipment', 'male', 'meter', 'novel', 'phenotypic biomarker', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'sex', 'tool', 'virtual']",OD,"FLYSORTER, LLC",R43,2017,225000,-0.01114579596752898
"Reactome: An Open Knowledgebase of Human Pathways Project Summary  We seek renewal of the core operating funding for the Reactome Knowledgebase of Human Biological Pathways and Processes. Reactome is a curated, open access biomolecular pathway database that can be freely used and redistributed by all members of the biological research community. It is used by clinicians, geneti- cists, genomics researchers, and molecular biologists to interpret the results of high-throughput experimental studies, by bioinformaticians seeking to develop novel algorithms for mining knowledge from genomic studies, and by systems biologists building predictive models of normal and disease variant pathways.  Our curators, PhD-level scientists with backgrounds in cell and molecular biology work closely with in- dependent investigators within the community to assemble machine-readable descriptions of human biological pathways. Each pathway is extensively checked and peer-reviewed prior to publication to ensure its assertions are backed up by the primary literature, and that human molecular events inferred from orthologous ones in animal models have an auditable inference chain. Curated Reactome pathways currently cover 8930 protein- coding genes (44% of the translated portion of the genome) and ~150 RNA genes. We also offer a network of reliable ‘functional interactions’ (FIs) predicted by a conservative machine-learning approach, which covers an additional 3300 genes, for a combined coverage of roughly 60% of the known genome.  Over the next five years, we will: (1) curate new macromolecular entities, clinically significant protein sequence variants and isoforms, and drug-like molecules, and the complexes these entities form, into new reac- tions; (2) supplement normal pathways with alternative pathways targeted to significant diseases and devel- opmental biology; (3) expand and automate our tools for curation, management and community annotation; (4) integrate pathway modeling technologies using probabilistic graphical models and Boolean networks for pathway and network perturbation studies; (5) develop additional compelling software interfaces directed at both computational and lab biologist users; and (6) and improve outreach to bioinformaticians, molecular bi- ologists and clinical researchers. Project Narrative  Reactome represents one of a very small number of open access curated biological pathway databases. Its authoritative and detailed content has directly and indirectly supported basic and translational research studies with over-representation analysis and network-building tools to discover patterns in high-throughput data.

"Developing Advanced Algorithms to Address Major Computational Challenges in Current Microbiome Research Abstract We propose a three-year interdisciplinary research plan to address two key issues currently facing the metagenomics community. The first issue concerns accurate construction and annotation of OTU tables using  of millions of 16S rRNA sequences, which is one of the most important yet most difficult problems inmicrobiome data analysis. Currently, it lacks computational algorithms capable of handling extremely large sequence data and constructing biologically consistent OTU tables. We propose a novel method that performs OTU table construction and annotation simultaneously by utilizing input and reference sequences, reference annotations, and data clustering structure within one analytical framework. Dynamic data-driven cutoffs are derived to identify OTUs that are consistent not only with data clustering structure but also with reference annotations. When successfully implemented, our method will generally address the computational needs of processing hundreds of millions of 16S rRNA reads that are currently being generated by large-scale studies. The second issue concerns developing novel methods to extract pertinent information from massive sequence data, thereby facilitating the field shifting from descriptive research to mechanistic studies. We are particularly interested in microbial community dynamics analysis, which can provide a wealth of insight into disease development unattainable through a static experiment design, and lays a critical foundation for developing probiotic and antibiotic strategies to manipulate microbial communities. Traditionally, system dynamics is approached through time-course studies. However, due to economical and logistical constraints, time-course studies are generally limited by the number of samples examined and the time period followed. With the rapid development of sequencing technology, many thousands of samples are being collected in large-scale studies. This provides us with a unique opportunity to develop a novel analytical strategy to use static data, instead of time-course data, to study microbial community dynamics. To our knowledge, this is the first time that massive static data is used to study dynamic aspects of microbial communities. When successfully implemented, our approach can effectively overcome the sampling limitation of time-course studies, and opens a new avenue of research to study microbial dynamics underlying disease development without performing a resource-intensive time-course study. The proposed pipeline will be intensively tested on a large oral microbiome dataset consisting of ~2,600 subgingival samples (~330M reads). The analysis can significantly advance our understanding of dynamic behaviors of oral microbial communities possibly contributing to the development of periodontal disease. To our knowledge, no prior work has been performed on this scale to study oral microbial community dynamics. We have assembled a multidisciplinary team that covers expertise spanning the areas of machine learning, bioinformatics, and oral microbiology. The expected outcome of this work will be a set of computational tools of high utility for the microbiology community and beyond. The human microbiome plays essential roles in many important physiological processes. We propose an interdisciplinary research plan to address some major computational challenges in current microbiome research.

"DNA Sequencing Using Single Molecule Electronics PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  Progress in DNA sequencing has occurred through multiple stages of disruptive new technologies being introduced to the field, each of which has increased sequencing capabilities by lowering costs, improving throughput, and reducing errors. The goal of this research project is to investigate a new, all-electronic sequencing method that has the potential to become the next transformative step for DNA sequencing. This new method is based on single DNA polymerase molecules bound to nanoscale electronic transistors, a hybrid device that transduces the activity of a single polymerase molecule into an electronic signal.  The goal of this research project is to determine whether these hybrid polymerase-transistors are truly applicable to DNA sequencing and the competitive environment of advanced sequencing technologies. To answer this question, the project teams the scientists who have developed the devices with Illumina, Inc., a worldwide leader in the DNA sequencing market. The experiments proposed here build on encouraging preliminary results, first to demonstrate accurate DNA sequencing and second to evaluate whether the new technique could become a competitive challenge to other sequencing methods. The interdisciplinary team will combine state-of-the-art techniques from protein engineering, nanoscale fabrication, and machine learning to customize polymerase's activity and its interactions with the electronic transistors. If successful, nanoscale solid-state devices like transistors provide one of the best opportunities for increasing sequencing capabilities while decreasing sequencing costs, so that DNA sequencing can become a standard technique in health care and disease treatment. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Over the past two decades, DNA sequencing has transformed from a heroic, nearly impossible task to a routine component of modern laboratory research. The field of DNA sequencing has improved tremendously through a strategy of modifying and monitoring polymerases, a key enzyme at the heart of many DNA sequencing technologies. This proposal is motivated by developments in the field of single-molecule electronics, which provide an entirely new mode for listening to the activity of single polymerase molecules. This electronic method is very different from the biochemical, optical, or nanopore-based techniques currently in use, and it has inherent advantages that could provide exciting possibilities for DNA sequencing. The project will tailor single-molecule electronics for the specific purpose of DNA sequencing and determine whether this strategy could lead to a new generation of sequencing technology.",DNA Sequencing Using Single Molecule Electronics,9353854,R01HG009188,"['Affect', 'Base Pairing', 'Biochemical', 'Carbon', 'Charge', 'Collaborations', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'DNA sequencing', 'DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Electronics', 'Enzyme Kinetics', 'Enzymes', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Heart', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Laboratory Research', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Massive Parallel Sequencing', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modernization', 'Modification', 'Molecular Models', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Mutation', 'Nanotechnology', 'Noise', 'Nucleotides', 'Optics', 'Performance', 'Polymerase', 'Protein Engineering', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Reading', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Route', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Single-Stranded DNA', 'Site', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Transistors', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'collaborative environment', 'cost', 'enzyme activity', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'molecular modeling', 'nanoelectronics', 'nanopore', 'nanoscale', 'new technology', 'novel', 'response', 'scale up', 'single molecule', 'single walled carbon nanotube', 'solid state']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-IRVINE,R01,2017,438098,0.003731182395274102
"Multi-Resolution Docking Methods for Electron Microscopy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the past decade, significant progress was made in 3D imaging of macromolecular assemblies via electron microscopy and in the development of computational algorithms that relate the resulting volumetric maps to atomic-resolution structures. The overall goal of the proposed research is to further develop computational fitting and validation tools for electron microscopy (EM). We intend to establish new modeling, visualization, and simulation techniques that would serve as bridges between atomic structures and EM densities. The proposed multi-scale software will aid in the routine determination of large-scale structures of biomolecular assemblies and in the validation of structural models that will be deposited to public databases such as the Protein Data Bank (PDB) and the EM Data Bank (EMDB). Key questions to be addressed include the following: (i) How can one improve, validate, and disseminate well-established matching algorithms for intermediate-resolution (8-15 Å) cryo-electron microscopy? (ii) How can one accurately identify and segment geometric features of subcellular assemblies in low-resolution (4-5 nm) cryo-electron tomograms or in focused ion beam milling of resin-embedded specimen blocks? (iii) Given the recent increase in resolution achieved with direct detection cameras, how can one systematically characterize high-resolution (2-10 Å) density patterns and validate atomic models based on local signatures in the data? We will adapt a new modeling paradigm for these studies, namely simultaneous refinement of multiple subunits. This approach is based on a ""systems"" perspective because biological assemblies exhibit ""emergent behavior"" in the spatial domain, that is, the whole is more than the sum of its parts. The new paradigm, in combination with docking protocols, improves model accuracy and opens the door to new global fitting applications in the above three areas. In addition, we will use statistical analysis and machine learning of local signatures to complement the global strategies. The collaborative efforts supported by this grant will include refinement of cytoskeletal filaments, molecular motors, chromatin fibers, and hair cell stereocilia. The algorithmic and methodological developments will be distributed freely through the established internet-based mechanisms used by the Situs and Sculptor packages. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project helps biological electron microscopists bridge a broad range of resolution levels from atomic to living organism-level. Macromolecular assemblies are the basic functional units of biological cells; they furnish targets for drug design because deficiencies in macromolecular assembly architecture are frequently linked to health problems. The results of our fundamental research will be new computer codes for modeling macromolecular assemblies, the structures of which facilitate the prediction of medically relevant functions.",Multi-Resolution Docking Methods for Electron Microscopy,9306122,R01GM062968,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Chromatin Fiber', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computer-Assisted Image Analysis', 'Cryoelectron Microscopy', 'Cytoskeletal Filaments', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Docking', 'Drug Design', 'Drug Targeting', 'Educational workshop', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Electrons', 'Exhibits', 'Feedback', 'Filament', 'Freezing', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hair Cells', 'Health', 'Hydration status', 'Imagery', 'Internet', 'Ions', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Membrane', 'Methods', 'Microtubules', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Motors', 'Noise', 'Organism', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Plant Resins', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Scanning Electron Microscopy', 'Series', 'Specimen', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Tomogram', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Vesicle', 'algorithmic methodologies', 'base', 'computer code', 'cryogenics', 'density', 'design', 'fiber cell', 'fitness', 'fundamental research', 'high standard', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'macromolecular assembly', 'microscopic imaging', 'new technology', 'next generation', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'simulation', 'statistics', 'tomography', 'tool']",NIGMS,OLD DOMINION UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,306527,-0.012549583829447057
"Novel Use of Emergent Technologies to Improve Efficiency of Animal Model Research ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Phase II project aims to continue development of a commercial quality, innovative cloud hosted information management system, called Climb 2.0(tm) that will increase laboratory efficiency and provide improved capabilities for research laboratories. Climb is designed to offer integrated laboratory process management modules that include mobile communications tools data monitoring and alert systems, and integrated access to Microsoft Azure Cloud(tm) Machine Learning and Stream Analytics services. Initially, Climb 2.0 will target animal model research laboratories; however, the core of the platform is designed to be adaptable to nearly any research type or related industry. Current research information management systems are primarily designed as record-keeping tools with little or no direct focus on laboratory efficiency or in enhancing value of the research data. They also do not leverage emergent mobile device technologies, social media frameworks, and data analysis and storage capabilities of cloud computing. Many laboratories still use paper as their primary recording system. Paper data logging is then followed by secondary data entry into a laboratory database. These systems are error prone, time consuming and lead to laboratory databases with significant time lags between data acquisition and data entry. Moreover, they do not recognized cumulative data relationships, which may identify important trends, and researchers often miss windows of opportunity to take action on time-sensitive events. In Phase I, RockStep Solutions demonstrated feasibility of an innovative Cloud Information Management Bundle system, Climb, which will increase efficiency and improve capabilities in animal model data management. During Phase I, a beta version of Climb was successfully developed and tested against strict performance metrics as a proof of concept. We successfully built a prototype with working interfaces that integrates real-time communication technologies with media capabilities of mobile devices. Phase II proposes four specific Aims: 1) Develop the technology infrastructure to support the secure and scalable Software as a Service (SaaS) deployment of Climb for enterprise commercial release; 2) Develop and extend the Phase-I prototype Data Monitoring and Messaging System (DMMS) into a platform ready for production use; 3) Extend Climb's DMMS adding a Stream Analytics engine to support Internet of Things (IoT) devices and streaming media; 4) Deploy a beta release of Climb at partner research labs, test and refine the product for final commercialization. To ensure Climb is developed with functionality and tools relevant to research organizations, RockStep Solutions has established collaborations with key beta sites to test all of the major functionality developed in this proposal. IMPACT: By leveraging emergent technologies and cloud computing, Climb offers several advantages: 1) enables real-time communications using familiar tools among members of research groups; 2) reduces the risk of experimental setbacks, and 3) enables complex experiments to be conducted efficiently. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The NIH Invests approximately $12 billion each year in animal model research that is central to both understanding basic biological processes and for developing applications directly related to improving human health. More cost-effective husbandry and colony management techniques, equipment, and new approaches to improve laboratory animal welfare and assure efficient and appropriate research use (e.g., through cost savings and reduced animal burden) are high priorities for NIH. RockStep Solutions proposes to meet this need by integrating existing and emergent software and communication technologies to create a novel solution, Climb 2.0, for research animal data management. Climb 2.0 extracts immediate value of data in animal research laboratories and extends the database into a multimedia communication network, thus enabling science that would be impractical to conduct with traditional methods.",Novel Use of Emergent Technologies to Improve Efficiency of Animal Model Research,9354497,R44GM112206,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Experimentation', 'Animal Model', 'Animal Welfare', 'Animals', 'Biological Process', 'Biomedical Research', 'Clinical Laboratory Information Systems', 'Cloud Computing', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Communication Tools', 'Communications Media', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Consumption', 'Cost Savings', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Security', 'Data Set', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Ensure', 'Equipment', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Event', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Human', 'Industry', 'Information Management', 'Internet', 'Internet of Things', 'Investments', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Animals', 'Laboratory Research', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Management Information Systems', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Multimedia', 'Notification', 'Paper', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Production', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Science', 'Secure', 'Services', 'Site', 'Stream', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'The Jackson Laboratory', 'Time', 'Transact', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'cloud based', 'commercialization', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'data acquisition', 'data management', 'design', 'encryption', 'experimental study', 'good laboratory practice', 'graphical user interface', 'handheld mobile device', 'improved', 'innovation', 'laptop', 'member', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'service learning', 'social media', 'software as a service', 'success', 'time interval', 'tool', 'trend', 'usability']",NIGMS,"ROCKSTEP SOLUTIONS, INC.",R44,2017,739402,0.0058818914406890705
"Genome analysis based on the integration of DNA sequence and shape DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Current techniques for genome analysis are mainly based on the one-dimensional DNA sequence, comprised of the letters A, C, G, and T. However, proteins recognize DNA as a three-dimensional (3D) object. Nuances in DNA shape at single nucleotide resolution play a crucial role in the binding specificity of transcription facors (TFs), including those involved in embryonic development and human cancer. This project involves the development of a battery of tools for genome analysis, through the integration of information derived from the DNA sequence and the 3D structure of DNA, or ""DNA shape"". The basis for these novel tools is a high- throughput (HT) method for the prediction of multiple features of local DNA shape at the genomic scale. Data will be made available to the community in the UCSC Genome Browser track format through a web server interface. These tools will enable users to analyze the shape of any number or length of DNA sequences, including whole genomes and the effect of DNA methylation. HT shape predictions will be validated based on X-ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy, and hydroxyl radical cleavage data. Predictions will be combined with ORChID, an ENCODE project that infers DNA minor groove geometry from hydroxyl radical cleavage experiments. The HT method will be used to study how paralogous TFs select different target sites in vivo despite sharing core-binding motifs or having similar binding properties in vitro. To study this question, we will investigate the effect of flanking sequences on multiple structural features of TF binding sites (TFBSs). The initial focus of this study will be homeodomains and basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) TFs. Other protein families will later be included and used to construct a comprehensive TFBS database that provides shape features for binding motifs derived from JASPAR and other motif databases. Structural effects of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) will also be analyzed. Some SNPs are associated with deleterious functions, whereas others have no apparent effect. The HT shape prediction method will be used to predict the function of SNPs in non-coding regions based on DNA shape. We will correlate quantitative effects of SNPs on DNA structure with expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) and genome-wide association study (GWAS) signals, to develop a predictive tool for the functional effect of SNPs. The HT shape prediction approach will be used to design DNA sequences with different AT/GC contents but similar shapes. The relative contributions of sequence and shape to binding will be tested with analytic models including multiple linear regression (MLR) and support vector regression (SVR). For systems in which the integration of sequence and shape proves advantageous, novel motif finding tools will be developed based on an extended alphabet that combines sequence with informative structural features, selected by machine learning and feature selection approaches. Sequence+shape motifs will be tested by motif scanning, compared to sequence-only motifs, and integrated into the MEME Suite. The goal of this sequence-shape integration is to increase the accuracy of finding in vivo TFBSs in the genome. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Protein-DNA recognition is a critical yet poorly understood component of gene regulation. This proposal will connect the fields of DNA sequence and structure analysis, which so far have been developed in parallel but largely disconnected from each other. Integration of the one-dimensional DNA sequence at a genome-wide scale with the three-dimensional DNA structure at atomic resolution will lead to the development of novel genome analysis tools and will advance our understanding of genome function, leading to fundamentally new insights into the mechanisms of gene regulation and its impact on human disease.",Genome analysis based on the integration of DNA sequence and shape,9203633,R01GM106056,"['Affect', 'Affinity', 'Algorithms', 'BHLH Protein', 'Base Pairing', 'Base Sequence', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Process', 'ChIP-on-chip', 'ChIP-seq', 'Characteristics', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'DNA', 'DNA Databases', 'DNA Integration', 'DNA Structure', 'DNase-I Footprinting', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Deoxyribonuclease I', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Drosophila genus', 'Embryonic Development', 'Family', 'Gaussian model', 'Gene Components', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genome Scan', 'Genomics', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Guanine + Cytosine Composition', 'Helix-Turn-Helix Motifs', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Hydroxyl Radical', 'In Vitro', 'Internet', 'Length', 'Letters', 'Linear Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Minor Groove', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Conformation', 'NMR Spectroscopy', 'Nucleotides', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protein Family', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Width', 'X-Ray Crystallography', 'Yeasts', 'base', 'design', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'genetic evolution', 'genome analysis', 'genome browser', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'homeodomain', 'human disease', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'member', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'predictive tools', 'public health relevance', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'vector', 'whole genome']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2017,309913,-0.019335383919924228
"CSHL Computational and Comparative Genomics Course The Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory proposes to continue a course entitled “Computational and Comparative Genomics”, to be held in the Fall of 2017 – 2019.

"Sci-Score, a tool to support rigor and transparency guidelines Project Summary While  standards  in  reporting  of  scientific  methods  are  absolutely  critical  to  producing  reproducible  science,  meeting  such  standards  is  difficult.  Checklists  and  instructions  are  tough  to  follow  often  resulting  in  low  and inconsistent  compliance.  Scientific  journals  and  societies  as  well  as  the  National  Institutes  of  Health  are  now actively proposing general guidelines to address reproducibility issues, particularly in the reporting of methods  (e.g.,  http://www.cell.com/star-­methods),  but  the  trickier  part  will  be  to  train  the  biomedical  community  to  use these standards to effectively improve how scientific methods are communicated. To support new standards in methods reporting, specifically the RRID standard for Rigor and Transparency of  Key Biological Resources, we propose to build Sci-­Score a text mining based tool suite to help authors meet the  standard.  Sci-­Score  will  provide  an  automated  check  on  compliance  with  the  RRID  standard  already  implemented by over 100 journals including Cell, Journal of Neuroscience, and eLife. The innovation behind Sci-­ score is the provision of a score, which can be obtained by individual investigators, which reflects a numerical  validation of the quality of their methods reporting. We posit that the score will serve as a tool that investigators  and journals can use to compete with themselves and each other, or in the very least allow them to see how  close they are to the average in meeting quality requirements.   Recently, our group has developed a text mining algorithm that has now been successfully been used to detect software tools and databases from the SciCrunch Registry in published papers. Digital tools are one of four resource types that the RRID standard identifies. We propose to extend this approach to the other types of entities: antibodies, cell lines and model organisms. Resource identification along with other quality metrics twill be used to train an algorithm to score the overall quality of the methods document. If successful, the tool could be used by editors, reviewers, and investigators to improve the number of RRIDs, therefore the quality of descriptors of key biological resources in published papers. This SBIR project will build a set of algorithms similar to the resource finding pipeline and develop it into an industrial robust and reconfigurable software system. Our Phase I specific aims include to 1) creating gold sets of data for each resource type and training a set of algorithms for each resource type; 2) designing and evaluating the scoring system; 3) designing and evaluating a report generating system based on the previous aims. In Phase II, we will develop a scalable backend infrastructure to serve the needs of scientific publishers and research community.

"Semantic Literature Annotation and Integrative Panomics Analysis for PTM-Disease Knowledge Network Discovery PROJECT SUMMARY Protein post-translational modification (PTM) plays a critical role in many diseases; however, critical gaps remain in research infrastructure for global analysis of PTMs. Key PTM information concerning enzyme- substrate relationships, regulation of PTM enzymes, PTM cross-talk, and functional consequences of PTM remains buried in the scientific literature. Meanwhile, while high-throughput panomics (genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, PTM proteomic) data offer an unprecedented opportunity for the discovery of PTM-disease relationships, the data must be analyzed in an integrated and easily accessible knowledge framework in order for researchers and clinicians to gain a molecular understanding of disease. The goal of this application is to develop a collaborative knowledge environment for semantic annotation of scientific literature and integrative panomics analysis for PTM-disease knowledge discovery in precision medicine. We propose to connect PTM information from literature mining and curated databases in a knowledge resource on an ontological framework that supports analysis of panomics data in the context of PTM networks. To broaden impact and foster collaborative development, our resource will be FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) and interoperable with community standards.  The specific aims are: (i) develop a novel NLP (natural language processing) system for full-scale literature mining and PTM-disease knowledge extraction; (ii) develop a PTM knowledge resource for integrative panomics analysis and network discovery; and (iii) provide a FAIR collaborative environment for scalable semantic annotation and knowledge integration. The proposed system will build upon the NLP technologies and text mining tools already developed by our team and the bioinformatics infrastructure at the Protein Information Resource (PIR). The iPTMnet web portal will allow searching, browsing, visualization and analysis of PTM networks and PTM-related mutations in conjunction with user-supplied omics data, including panomics data from major national initiatives. Use scenarios will include identification of disease-driving genetic variants and analysis of cellular responses to kinase inhibitors. Our PTM knowledgebase will be disseminated with an RDF triple-store and a SPARQL endpoint for semantic queries, while our text mining tools and full-scale literature mining results will be disseminated in the BioC community standard for seamless integration to other text mining pipelines. To engage the community semantic annotation of scientific literature, we will host a hackathon to develop tools to expose BioC-annotated literature corpora to the semantic web, as well as an annotation jamboree to explore tagging of scientific text with precise ontological terms. This project will thus offer a unique research resource for PTM-disease network discovery as well as an integrable collaborative knowledge framework to support Big Data to Knowledge in precision medicine. PROJECT NARRATIVE Precision medicine requires a detailed understanding of the molecular events that are disrupted in disease, including changes in protein post-translational modifications (PTM) that are hallmarks of many diseases. The proposed resource will support analysis of genomic-scale data for exploring PTM-disease networks and PTM-related mutations, as well as knowledge dissemination on the semantic web.

"Integrative approach to studying LncRNA functions ABSTRACT  Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play regulatory roles in biological cell process and disease development. It has been emerging as a key regulator of diverse cellular processes. Great efforts have been made towards investigation of lncRNA functions with both experimental determination and theoretical modeling, leading to a rudimentary understanding of this class of RNAs. However, all of these cannot keep pace with the fast growth of diverse genetic data and urgent request of individual lncRNA function annotation, which is inhibited by the tremendous amount of lncRNAs and expensive experimental cost. This propose aim to address this issue by providing efficient and user-friendly tools for key lncRNA discovery and lncRNA function annotation. To do so, we will develop a unique bioinformatics and Systems Biology integrated approach, ISSNLncFA system, which enables the integration of all sorts of omics data and a comprehensive understanding of lncRNA functions.  We propose three specific aims for the ultimate lncRNA function annotation: (1) To develop a novel Co- Modules-based LncRNA Function Annotation (CoMoLncFA) model to detect key lncRNAs and to annotate lncRNA functions at post transcription level as lncRNA-PCG co-modules, lncRNA-pathways association network and lncRNA’s triplets (lncRNA-miRNA/TF-PCG) by considering the expression profiles of lncRNA, protein coding genes and miRNAs and transcript factors, and integrating the curated protein-protein interactions and biological pathways. (2) To develop a novel Structure-based LncRNA-protein Function Annotation (STRULncFA) model to characterize lncRNAs identified from Aim 1 by using their primary sequences and secondary structures for detecting lncRNA-protein functional relations; and to further reveal the regulatory roles and mechanism of these lncRNAs by determining the binding sites in both lncRNA and protein. (3) To experimentally validate the identified abnormal lncRNAs and their cellular products, to validate the identified lncRNA-protein interacting pairs and the predicted binding sites, and to develop software tools and an environment for functional annotation of lncRNAs, use these tools to evaluate the overall proposed approach, and apply them to identify lncRNA functions that may be involved in cell states, species, diseases and cancers and build lncRNA function databases.  We believe that we will build the models, tools and databases, and make them available to the public in a timely fashion. Our achievements will lead to a complete understanding of lncRNA functions and regulatory roles in cell and disease states. Moreover, our models and tools will be feasibly transformed to other function annotation tasks and disease studies with appropriate changes, and thus will move forward the general function annotation community and disease-related drug or therapy development. Project Narrative The ISSNLncFA software package will allow the investigators to characterize the LncRNA functions by integrating RNA-Seq, micorRNA-Seq, and together with protein and RNA structure data with systems biology approaches. As a prototype to test our system, we aim to use this system to study myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs). Although MDS is used as the prototype of disease for this proposal, the system developed will be applicable to multiple diseases with complex phenotypes.",Integrative approach to studying LncRNA functions,9288292,R01GM123037,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Architecture', 'Binding Sites', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Breast', 'CD34 gene', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 22', 'Chronic Disease', 'Code', 'Colorectal', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dysmyelopoietic Syndromes', 'Embryonic Development', 'Environment', 'Enzymes', 'Evaluation', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomic Imprinting', 'Growth', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hematopoietic stem cells', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Liver', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Network-based', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'Transcript', 'Triplet Multiple Birth', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Work', 'X Chromosome', 'base', 'chromatin modification', 'chromatin remodeling', 'cost', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'gene function', 'genomic data', 'high throughput technology', 'learning network', 'next generation', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'protein function', 'protein protein interaction', 'prototype', 'scaffold', 'software development', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'tool development', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'user-friendly']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R01,2017,302225,-0.043056249447254474
"HIGH THROUGHPUT LITERATURE CURATION OF GENETIC REGULATION IN BACTERIAL MODELS DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The aim of this proposal is to implement a novel way of processing and accessing the vast detailed knowledge contained within collections of scientific publications on the regulation of transcription initiation in bacterial models. In princple, this model for processing and reading information and new knowledge is applicable to other biological domains, potentially benefiting any area of biomedical knowledge. It is certainly criticl to generate new strategies to cope with the ever-increasing amount of knowledge generated in genomics and in biomedical research at large. Improving the efficiency of the traditional high-quality manual curation of scientific publications will enable us also to expand the type of biological knowledge, beyond mechanisms and their elements in the genome, to start including their connections with larger regulated processes and eventually physiological properties of the cell. We will first implement the necessary technology to improve our curation by means of a computational system that has text mining capabilities for preprocessing the papers before a human expert curator identifies which sentences contain the information that is to be added to the database. Premarked options selected by the curators will accelerate their decisions. The accumulative precise mapping between sentences and curated knowledge will provide training sets for text mining technologies to improve their automatic extraction. The curator practices will become more efficient, enabling us to curate selected high-impact published reviews to place mechanisms into a rich context of their physiological processes and general biology. Another relevant component of our proposal is the improved modeling of regulated processes by means of new concepts in biology that capture larger collections of coregulated genes and their concatenated reactions. Starting from all interactions of a local regulator, coregulated regulators and their domain of action will be incorporated to construct the biobricks of complex decisions, as they are encoded in the genome. These are conceptual containers that capture the organization of knowledge to describe the genetic programming of cellular capabilities. These proposals will be formalized and proposed within an international consortium focused in enriching standard models or ontologies of gene regulation for use by the scientific community. Finally, a portal to navigate across all the sentences of a given corpus of a large number (more than 5,000) of related papers will be implemented. The different avenues of navigation will essentially use two technologies, one dealing with automatically generating simpler sentences from original sentences as input, and the other one with the classification of papers based on their theme or ontology. Their combination will enable a novel navigation reading system. If we achieve our aims, this project will give a proof-of-principle prototype with clearly innovative higher levels of large amounts of integrated knowledge. Future directions may adapt these concepts and methods to the biology of higher organisms, including humans. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Scientific knowledge reported within publications provides a wealth of knowledge that we barely capture in databases for genomics. Enhancing the effectiveness of the processing and representation of all this knowledge will change the way we encode our understanding of concatenated interactions that are organized into networks and processes governing cell behavior. Given the conservation in evolution of the nature of biological complexity, a better encoding of our understanding of a bacterial cell shall influence that of any other living organism.",HIGH THROUGHPUT LITERATURE CURATION OF GENETIC REGULATION IN BACTERIAL MODELS,9193091,R01GM110597,"['Area', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Model', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Effectiveness', 'Elements', 'Escherichia coli', 'Evolution', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Programming', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Growth', 'Human', 'International', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Letters', 'Linguistics', 'Literature', 'Manuals', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Ontology', 'Operon', 'Organism', 'Paper', 'Physiological', 'Physiological Processes', 'Planet Earth', 'Process', 'Property', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Reaction', 'Reading', 'Regulation', 'Regulon', 'Reporting', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Solid', 'Source', 'System', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Training', 'Transcription Initiation', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'base', 'cell behavior', 'digital', 'electronic book', 'experience', 'feeding', 'functional genomics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'member', 'microbial community', 'model organisms databases', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'promoter', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'software development', 'text searching', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'usability']",NIGMS,CENTER FOR GENOMIC SCIENCES,R01,2017,396248,-0.042383243906426456
"Bioinformatics Tools for Circadian Biology Circadian rhythms are fundamental for understanding biology: they date back to the origin of life, they are found in virtually every species from cyanobacteria to mammals, and they coordinate many important biological functions from the sleep-wake cycle, to metabolism, and to cognitive functions. Circadian rhythms are equally fundamental for health and medicine: modifications in diet have been linked to modification in circadian rhythms at the molecular level; disruptions of circadian rhythms have been linked to health problems ranging from depression, to learning disorders, to diabetes, to obesity, to cardiovascular disease, to cancer, and to premature ageing; finally, a large fraction of drug targets have been found to oscillate in a circadian manner in one or several tissues, suggesting that a better understanding of circadian oscillations at the molecular level could have direct applications to precision medicine, for instance by optimizing the time at which drugs are taken.  To better understand circadian oscillations at the molecular level, modern high-throughput technologies are being used to measure the concentrations of many molecular species, including transcripts, proteins, and metabolites along the circadian cycle in different organs and tissues, and under different conditions. However, the informatics tools for processing, analyzing, and integrating the growing wealth of molecular circadian data are not yet in place.  This effort will fill this fundamental gap by developing and disseminating informatics tools that will enable the collection, integration, and analyses of this wealth of information and lead to novel and fundamental insights about the organization and regulation of circadian oscillations, their roles in health and disease, and their future applications to precision medicine. Specifically, through a close collaborations between computational and experimental scientists, this effort will: (1) Bring the power of deep learning methods to bear on the analyses of omic time series to determine, for instance, which molecular species are oscillating, their characteristics (period, phase, amplitude), and to predict the time/phase associated with a measurement taken at a single time point; (2) Develop Cyber-TC, an extension of the widely used Cyber-T software, for the differential analysis of circadian omic time series and expand MotifMap, a widely used genome-wide map of regulatory sites to better understand circadian regulation; and (3) Develop Circadiomics, an integrated database and web portal as a one-stop shop for circadian data, annotations, and analyses. All data, software, and results will be freely available for academic research purposes and broadly disseminated through multiple channels to benefit both the circadian community and the broader bioinformatics community. Circadian rhythms are fundamental for biology and medicine. Modern high-throughput technologies are revealing how the concentrations of many molecular species, including transcripts, proteins, and metabolites oscillate with the day and night cycle in almost every species, tissue, and cell. In close collaboration with biologists, this project will develop the informatics tools that will enable the collection, integration, and analyses of this wealth of information and lead to novel and fundamental insights about the organization and regulation of circadian oscillations, their roles in health and disease, and their future applications to precision medicine.",Bioinformatics Tools for Circadian Biology,9325275,R01GM123558,"['Address', 'Ally', 'Architecture', 'Back', 'Biogenesis', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Cyanobacterium', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Drug Targeting', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Health', 'Homeostasis', 'Informatics', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Learning Disorders', 'Life', 'Link', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammals', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Mental Depression', 'Metabolism', 'Modernization', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Obesity', 'Organ', 'Periodicity', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Plasticizers', 'Premature aging syndrome', 'Proteomics', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Site', 'Sleep Wake Cycle', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transcript', 'Update', 'Ursidae Family', 'Vision', 'annotation  system', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive process', 'direct application', 'genome-wide', 'high throughput analysis', 'high throughput technology', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'member', 'metabolomics', 'novel', 'precision medicine', 'protein metabolite', 'software development', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'virtual', 'web portal']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-IRVINE,R01,2017,324508,0.0037358771109943308
"A Machine-Learning Based Software Widget for Resolving Metabolite Identities Owing to recent technological advances in measurement platforms, it is now possible to simultaneously detect and characterize a very large number of metabolites covering a substantial fraction of the small molecules present in a biological sample. This presents an exciting opportunity to develop potentially transformative approaches to study cells and organisms. One major challenge in realizing this potential lies in processing and analyzing the data. A typical dataset from an untargeted experiment contains many of thousands of “features,” each of which could correspond to a unique metabolite. Analyzing such datasets to obtain meaningful biological information depends on reliably and efficiently resolving the chemical identities of the detected features. Currently, in silico fragmentation methods predict candidate metabolites that are scored and ranked based on how well the fragmentation explains the observed MS/MS spectrum, and on other factors influencing fragmentation such as bond dissociation energies and ionization conditions. Deciding which candidate metabolites is the best match for a particular feature in the context of the biological sample, however, is a daunting task. Extensive testing of candidate metabolites against chemical standards library may be prohibitive in terms of cost and efforts. We seek to develop software-enabled workflows centered on resolving metabolite identities. Our approach is to exploit knowledge of the biological context of a sample to identify the metabolites. Recognizing that the metabolites present in a sample result from enzyme-catalyzed biochemical reactions active in the corresponding biological system, we employ topological analysis and inference to best map the metabolites implied by the detected features to metabolic pathways that are feasible based on the genome(s) of cells in the biological system. Aim 1 develops a computational method based on Bayesian-inference to enhance candidate metabolite rankings that are obtained via in silico fragmentation analysis. Our method utilizes all available information (database lookups, in silico fragmentation analysis, and network/pathway context) to maximally inform and adjust the rankings. Aim 2 will build software widgets to implement the metabolite identification workflow within a data-analytics framework. As the analytics framework, we will use Orange, which allows the user to create interactive data analysis pipelines through a plug-and-play graphical user interface (GUI). Aim 3 will validate the computational method and software widget implementation. Experimental validation will utilize high-purity standards to confirm (or reject) the computationally assigned metabolite identities. Widget implementation will be evaluated through a focus group discussion with the widget users in the labs directed by the PIs. As project outcomes, we anticipate both a methodological advance in analyzing mass signature data as well as a suite of easily accessible software in the form of widgets. Metabolomics is concerned with the comprehensive characterization of the small molecule metabolites in biological systems. Owing to recent technological advances in measurement platforms, it is now possible to simultaneously detect and characterize a very large number of metabolites. Prospectively, advanced computational tools and software for metabolomics data analysis can aid discovery efforts aimed at identifying novel bioactive metabolites that could be developed into diagnostic indicators or therapeutic agents. ",A Machine-Learning Based Software Widget for Resolving Metabolite Identities,9223450,R03CA211839,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Automatic Data Processing', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biochemical Reaction', 'Biological', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Diagnostic', 'Dissociation', 'Environment', 'Enzymes', 'Feedback', 'Focus Groups', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Knowledge', 'Libraries', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metabolism', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance', 'Oranges', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Process', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Models', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'base', 'biological systems', 'chemical standard', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'database query', 'flexibility', 'functional outcomes', 'graphical user interface', 'heuristics', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'instrument', 'ionization', 'mass spectrometer', 'member', 'metabolomics', 'novel', 'programs', 'protein expression', 'research study', 'small molecule', 'software development']",NCI,TUFTS UNIVERSITY MEDFORD,R03,2016,147569,-0.038584309124286675
"Developing Advanced Algorithms to Address Major Computational Challenges in Current Microbiome Research Abstract We propose a three-year interdisciplinary research plan to address two key issues currently facing the metagenomics community. The first issue concerns accurate construction and annotation of OTU tables using  of millions of 16S rRNA sequences, which is one of the most important yet most difficult problems inmicrobiome data analysis. Currently, it lacks computational algorithms capable of handling extremely large sequence data and constructing biologically consistent OTU tables. We propose a novel method that performs OTU table construction and annotation simultaneously by utilizing input and reference sequences, reference annotations, and data clustering structure within one analytical framework. Dynamic data-driven cutoffs are derived to identify OTUs that are consistent not only with data clustering structure but also with reference annotations. When successfully implemented, our method will generally address the computational needs of processing hundreds of millions of 16S rRNA reads that are currently being generated by large-scale studies. The second issue concerns developing novel methods to extract pertinent information from massive sequence data, thereby facilitating the field shifting from descriptive research to mechanistic studies. We are particularly interested in microbial community dynamics analysis, which can provide a wealth of insight into disease development unattainable through a static experiment design, and lays a critical foundation for developing probiotic and antibiotic strategies to manipulate microbial communities. Traditionally, system dynamics is approached through time-course studies. However, due to economical and logistical constraints, time-course studies are generally limited by the number of samples examined and the time period followed. With the rapid development of sequencing technology, many thousands of samples are being collected in large-scale studies. This provides us with a unique opportunity to develop a novel analytical strategy to use static data, instead of time-course data, to study microbial community dynamics. To our knowledge, this is the first time that massive static data is used to study dynamic aspects of microbial communities. When successfully implemented, our approach can effectively overcome the sampling limitation of time-course studies, and opens a new avenue of research to study microbial dynamics underlying disease development without performing a resource-intensive time-course study. The proposed pipeline will be intensively tested on a large oral microbiome dataset consisting of ~2,600 subgingival samples (~330M reads). The analysis can significantly advance our understanding of dynamic behaviors of oral microbial communities possibly contributing to the development of periodontal disease. To our knowledge, no prior work has been performed on this scale to study oral microbial community dynamics. We have assembled a multidisciplinary team that covers expertise spanning the areas of machine learning, bioinformatics, and oral microbiology. The expected outcome of this work will be a set of computational tools of high utility for the microbiology community and beyond. The human microbiome plays essential roles in many important physiological processes. We propose an interdisciplinary research plan to address some major computational challenges in current microbiome research. If successfully implemented, this work could significantly expand the capacity of existing pipelines for large-scale data analysis and scientific discovery, resulting in a significant impact on the field.",Developing Advanced Algorithms to Address Major Computational Challenges in Current Microbiome Research,9158909,R01AI125982,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Antibiotics', 'Area', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Epidemiology', 'Floods', 'Foundations', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Microbiome', 'Human body', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Oral', 'Oral Microbiology', 'Outcome', 'Periodontal Diseases', 'Physiological Processes', 'Play', 'Probiotics', 'Process', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Ribosomal RNA', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'dynamic system', 'epidemiology study', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'open source', 'oral behavior', 'oral microbiome', 'research study', 'response', 'tumor progression', 'web app']",NIAID,STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK AT BUFFALO,R01,2016,311803,-0.0050479749004656415
"Reactome: An Open Knowledgebase of Human Pathways DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We seek renewal of the core operating funding for the Reactome Knowledgebase of Human Biological Pathways and Processes. Reactome is a curated knowledgebase available online as an open access resource that can be freely used and redistributed by all members of the biological research community. It is used by geneticists, genomics researchers, clinical researchers and molecular biologists to interpret the results of high-throughput experimental studies, by bioinformaticians seeking to develop novel algorithms for mining knowledge from genomics studies, and by systems biologists building predictive models of normal and abnormal pathways.  Our curational system draws heavily on the expertise of independent investigators within the community who author precise machine-readable descriptions of human biological pathways under the guidance of a staff of dedicated curators. Each pathway is extensively checked and peer-reviewed prior to publication to ensure its factual accuracy and compliance with the data model. A system of evidence tracking ensures that all assertions are backed up by the primary literature, and that human molecular events inferred from orthologous ones in animal models have an auditable inference chain. Curated pathways described by Reactome currently cover roughly one quarter of the translated portion of the genome. We also offer a network of ""functional interactions"" (FIs) predicted by a conservative machine-learning approach, that covers an additional quarter of the translated genome, for a combined coverage of roughly 50% of the known genome.  Over the next five years, we seek to (1) increase the number of curated proteins and other functional entities to at least 10,500; (2) to supplement normal pathways with variant reactions for 1200 genes representing disease states; (3) increase the size of the Reactome Fl network to 15,000 molecules; and (4) enhance the web site and other resources to meet the needs of a growing and diverse user community.

"DNA Sequencing Using Single Molecule Electronics PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  Progress in DNA sequencing has occurred through multiple stages of disruptive new technologies being introduced to the field, each of which has increased sequencing capabilities by lowering costs, improving throughput, and reducing errors. The goal of this research project is to investigate a new, all-electronic sequencing method that has the potential to become the next transformative step for DNA sequencing. This new method is based on single DNA polymerase molecules bound to nanoscale electronic transistors, a hybrid device that transduces the activity of a single polymerase molecule into an electronic signal.  The goal of this research project is to determine whether these hybrid polymerase-transistors are truly applicable to DNA sequencing and the competitive environment of advanced sequencing technologies. To answer this question, the project teams the scientists who have developed the devices with Illumina, Inc., a worldwide leader in the DNA sequencing market. The experiments proposed here build on encouraging preliminary results, first to demonstrate accurate DNA sequencing and second to evaluate whether the new technique could become a competitive challenge to other sequencing methods. The interdisciplinary team will combine state-of-the-art techniques from protein engineering, nanoscale fabrication, and machine learning to customize polymerase's activity and its interactions with the electronic transistors. If successful, nanoscale solid-state devices like transistors provide one of the best opportunities for increasing sequencing capabilities while decreasing sequencing costs, so that DNA sequencing can become a standard technique in health care and disease treatment. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Over the past two decades, DNA sequencing has transformed from a heroic, nearly impossible task to a routine component of modern laboratory research. The field of DNA sequencing has improved tremendously through a strategy of modifying and monitoring polymerases, a key enzyme at the heart of many DNA sequencing technologies. This proposal is motivated by developments in the field of single-molecule electronics, which provide an entirely new mode for listening to the activity of single polymerase molecules. This electronic method is very different from the biochemical, optical, or nanopore-based techniques currently in use, and it has inherent advantages that could provide exciting possibilities for DNA sequencing. The project will tailor single-molecule electronics for the specific purpose of DNA sequencing and determine whether this strategy could lead to a new generation of sequencing technology.",DNA Sequencing Using Single Molecule Electronics,9172062,R01HG009188,"['Affect', 'Base Pairing', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Carbon', 'Charge', 'Collaborations', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Electronics', 'Enzyme Kinetics', 'Enzymes', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health Care Research', 'Healthcare', 'Heart', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Laboratory Research', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Marketing', 'Massive Parallel Sequencing', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modification', 'Molecular Models', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Mutation', 'Nanotechnology', 'Noise', 'Nucleotides', 'Optics', 'Performance', 'Polymerase', 'Process', 'Protein Engineering', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Route', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Single-Stranded DNA', 'Site', 'Staging', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Transistors', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'collaborative environment', 'cost', 'enzyme activity', 'improved', 'molecular modeling', 'nanoelectronics', 'nanopore', 'nanoscale', 'new technology', 'novel', 'research study', 'response', 'scale up', 'single molecule', 'single walled carbon nanotube', 'solid state']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-IRVINE,R01,2016,584552,0.003731182395274102
"Multi-Resolution Docking Methods for Electron Microscopy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the past decade, significant progress was made in 3D imaging of macromolecular assemblies via electron microscopy and in the development of computational algorithms that relate the resulting volumetric maps to atomic-resolution structures. The overall goal of the proposed research is to further develop computational fitting and validation tools for electron microscopy (EM). We intend to establish new modeling, visualization, and simulation techniques that would serve as bridges between atomic structures and EM densities. The proposed multi-scale software will aid in the routine determination of large-scale structures of biomolecular assemblies and in the validation of structural models that will be deposited to public databases such as the Protein Data Bank (PDB) and the EM Data Bank (EMDB). Key questions to be addressed include the following: (i) How can one improve, validate, and disseminate well-established matching algorithms for intermediate-resolution (8-15 Å) cryo-electron microscopy? (ii) How can one accurately identify and segment geometric features of subcellular assemblies in low-resolution (4-5 nm) cryo-electron tomograms or in focused ion beam milling of resin-embedded specimen blocks? (iii) Given the recent increase in resolution achieved with direct detection cameras, how can one systematically characterize high-resolution (2-10 Å) density patterns and validate atomic models based on local signatures in the data? We will adapt a new modeling paradigm for these studies, namely simultaneous refinement of multiple subunits. This approach is based on a ""systems"" perspective because biological assemblies exhibit ""emergent behavior"" in the spatial domain, that is, the whole is more than the sum of its parts. The new paradigm, in combination with docking protocols, improves model accuracy and opens the door to new global fitting applications in the above three areas. In addition, we will use statistical analysis and machine learning of local signatures to complement the global strategies. The collaborative efforts supported by this grant will include refinement of cytoskeletal filaments, molecular motors, chromatin fibers, and hair cell stereocilia. The algorithmic and methodological developments will be distributed freely through the established internet-based mechanisms used by the Situs and Sculptor packages.

"Single Molecule Sequencing of Glycosaminoglycans using Recognition Tunneling Nanopores ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Structural analysis of large polysaccharides remains challenging in glycobiology. The problem is especially acute when polysaccharides in question are glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). GAGs are large, linear, sulfated polysaccharides ubiquitous to all mammals. Interests in GAG structures stem from GAGs' diverse biological activities that govern phenomena such as tissue development/regeneration, inflammation, blood coagulation and amyloid plaque formation. Abnormal GAG structures have also been associated with the development of a number of diseases, notably cancer and inflammation. As a result, there has been a desire to understand how GAG structures correlate with their biological activities, especially how the distribution of sulfate groups along the chain influence their interactions with GAG-binding proteins. However, GAGs' large size and complex sulfation patterns make analysis of intact GAG chains by conventional ensemble analytical techniques difficult, if not impossible. Here we propose to develop a single molecule sequencer for analysis of polysaccharides using the recognition tunneling nanopore (RTP) device currently under development for ""$1000 genome"" project as a template. With the R21 grant, we will demonstrate the feasibility by carrying out pre-requisite work needed to achieve single molecule sequencing of intact GAG chains using RTP. A RTP device incorporates a nanopore with a tunneling nanogap that contains two electrodes functionalized with recognition molecules capable of forming transient complexes with functional groups on a polymeric chain as it translocates the nanopore, thus generating electrical signals. Single molecule sequencing of GAG chains proposed here circumvents the need to obtain homogeneous samples of GAGs, greatly reducing complexity of sample preparation. GAG analysis by RT devices also does not have the size limitations of most of the existing analytical techniques, and the solid state device planned here are economical to manufacturer and operate. In this application, we aim to carry out pilot studies needed to make GAG sequencing by RTPs feasible: (1) we will investigate the translocation of size defined sulfated GAG fragments through nanopores to optimize the translocation efficiency of GAG ligands as well as to understand the influence of GAG sulfation density and GAG size on their translocation efficiency and speed; (2) we will carry out recognition tunneling experiments on sulfated GAG disaccharides as well as trisaccharides so these signals of GAGs can be analyzed using machine learning algorithms to identify unique signatures needed to detect the presence of these sulfation motifs in longer GAG chains. Completion of these aims will provide all the knowledge required for correct interpretations of RT signals produced by GAG translocation and sets the stage for sequencing of intact GAG chains by RT devices. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     Work proposed here will allow single molecule sequencing of glycosaminoglycan polysaccharides using an electronic chip with a high speed and low cost for the first time. Glycosaminoglycans have important pharmacological properties and are modulators of critical biological phenomena such as tissue development/regeneration and inflammation. Determination of their sequence structures will allow better understanding of how organisms control these physiological events through glycosaminoglycans.",Single Molecule Sequencing of Glycosaminoglycans using Recognition Tunneling Nanopores,9109642,R21GM118339,"['Acute', 'Algorithms', 'Amino Acids', 'Architecture', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Phenomena', 'Blood coagulation', 'Cells', 'Charge', 'Chemistry', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disaccharides', 'Disease', 'Electrodes', 'Electronics', 'Electrons', 'Environment', 'Enzymes', 'Event', 'Genome', 'Glycobiology', 'Glycosaminoglycans', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Imidazole', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inorganic Sulfates', 'Ions', 'Isomerism', 'Knowledge', 'Leukocyte Trafficking', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Mammals', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Natural regeneration', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Oligosaccharides', 'Organism', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Polysaccharides', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Senile Plaques', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signaling Protein', 'Site', 'Speed', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Trisaccharides', 'Unspecified or Sulfate Ion Sulfates', 'Work', 'amyloid formation', 'analytical method', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cost', 'density', 'design', 'extracellular', 'functional group', 'interest', 'nanopore', 'polysulfated glycosaminoglycan', 'programs', 'research study', 'single molecule', 'solid state', 'stem', 'sugar', 'sulfation', 'therapeutic biomarker', 'tool']",NIGMS,ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY-TEMPE CAMPUS,R21,2016,271743,0.000431218361848384
"Novel Use of Emergent Technologies to Improve Efficiency of Animal Model Research ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Phase II project aims to continue development of a commercial quality, innovative cloud hosted information management system, called Climb 2.0(tm) that will increase laboratory efficiency and provide improved capabilities for research laboratories. Climb is designed to offer integrated laboratory process management modules that include mobile communications tools data monitoring and alert systems, and integrated access to Microsoft Azure Cloud(tm) Machine Learning and Stream Analytics services. Initially, Climb 2.0 will target animal model research laboratories; however, the core of the platform is designed to be adaptable to nearly any research type or related industry. Current research information management systems are primarily designed as record-keeping tools with little or no direct focus on laboratory efficiency or in enhancing value of the research data. They also do not leverage emergent mobile device technologies, social media frameworks, and data analysis and storage capabilities of cloud computing. Many laboratories still use paper as their primary recording system. Paper data logging is then followed by secondary data entry into a laboratory database. These systems are error prone, time consuming and lead to laboratory databases with significant time lags between data acquisition and data entry. Moreover, they do not recognized cumulative data relationships, which may identify important trends, and researchers often miss windows of opportunity to take action on time-sensitive events. In Phase I, RockStep Solutions demonstrated feasibility of an innovative Cloud Information Management Bundle system, Climb, which will increase efficiency and improve capabilities in animal model data management. During Phase I, a beta version of Climb was successfully developed and tested against strict performance metrics as a proof of concept. We successfully built a prototype with working interfaces that integrates real-time communication technologies with media capabilities of mobile devices. Phase II proposes four specific Aims: 1) Develop the technology infrastructure to support the secure and scalable Software as a Service (SaaS) deployment of Climb for enterprise commercial release; 2) Develop and extend the Phase-I prototype Data Monitoring and Messaging System (DMMS) into a platform ready for production use; 3) Extend Climb's DMMS adding a Stream Analytics engine to support Internet of Things (IoT) devices and streaming media; 4) Deploy a beta release of Climb at partner research labs, test and refine the product for final commercialization. To ensure Climb is developed with functionality and tools relevant to research organizations, RockStep Solutions has established collaborations with key beta sites to test all of the major functionality developed in this proposal. IMPACT: By leveraging emergent technologies and cloud computing, Climb offers several advantages: 1) enables real-time communications using familiar tools among members of research groups; 2) reduces the risk of experimental setbacks, and 3) enables complex experiments to be conducted efficiently.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The NIH Invests approximately $12 billion each year in animal model research that is central to both understanding basic biological processes and for developing applications directly related to improving human health. More cost-effective husbandry and colony management techniques, equipment, and new approaches to improve laboratory animal welfare and assure efficient and appropriate research use (e.g., through cost savings and reduced animal burden) are high priorities for NIH. RockStep Solutions proposes to meet this need by integrating existing and emergent software and communication technologies to create a novel solution, Climb 2.0, for research animal data management. Climb 2.0 extracts immediate value of data in animal research laboratories and extends the database into a multimedia communication network, thus enabling science that would be impractical to conduct with traditional methods.        ",Novel Use of Emergent Technologies to Improve Efficiency of Animal Model Research,9138555,R44GM112206,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Experimentation', 'Animal Model', 'Animal Welfare', 'Animals', 'Biological Process', 'Biomedical Research', 'Clinical Laboratory Information Systems', 'Cloud Computing', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Communication Tools', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Consumption', 'Cost Savings', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Security', 'Data Set', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Ensure', 'Equipment', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Event', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Human', 'Industry', 'Information Management', 'Internet', 'Investments', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Animals', 'Laboratory Research', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Management Information Systems', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Multimedia', 'Notification', 'Paper', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Production', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Science', 'Secure', 'Services', 'Site', 'Stream', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'The Jackson Laboratory', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'animal data', 'base', 'cloud based', 'commercialization', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'data acquisition', 'data management', 'design', 'encryption', 'good laboratory practice', 'graphical user interface', 'handheld mobile device', 'improved', 'innovation', 'laptop', 'meetings', 'member', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'social media', 'software as a service', 'success', 'time interval', 'tool', 'trend', 'usability']",NIGMS,"ROCKSTEP SOLUTIONS, INC.",R44,2016,750063,0.0058818914406890705
"Genome analysis based on the integration of DNA sequence and shape DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Current techniques for genome analysis are mainly based on the one-dimensional DNA sequence, comprised of the letters A, C, G, and T. However, proteins recognize DNA as a three-dimensional (3D) object. Nuances in DNA shape at single nucleotide resolution play a crucial role in the binding specificity of transcription facors (TFs), including those involved in embryonic development and human cancer. This project involves the development of a battery of tools for genome analysis, through the integration of information derived from the DNA sequence and the 3D structure of DNA, or ""DNA shape"". The basis for these novel tools is a high- throughput (HT) method for the prediction of multiple features of local DNA shape at the genomic scale. Data will be made available to the community in the UCSC Genome Browser track format through a web server interface. These tools will enable users to analyze the shape of any number or length of DNA sequences, including whole genomes and the effect of DNA methylation. HT shape predictions will be validated based on X-ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy, and hydroxyl radical cleavage data. Predictions will be combined with ORChID, an ENCODE project that infers DNA minor groove geometry from hydroxyl radical cleavage experiments. The HT method will be used to study how paralogous TFs select different target sites in vivo despite sharing core-binding motifs or having similar binding properties in vitro. To study this question, we will investigate the effect of flanking sequences on multiple structural features of TF binding sites (TFBSs). The initial focus of this study will be homeodomains and basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) TFs. Other protein families will later be included and used to construct a comprehensive TFBS database that provides shape features for binding motifs derived from JASPAR and other motif databases. Structural effects of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) will also be analyzed. Some SNPs are associated with deleterious functions, whereas others have no apparent effect. The HT shape prediction method will be used to predict the function of SNPs in non-coding regions based on DNA shape. We will correlate quantitative effects of SNPs on DNA structure with expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) and genome-wide association study (GWAS) signals, to develop a predictive tool for the functional effect of SNPs. The HT shape prediction approach will be used to design DNA sequences with different AT/GC contents but similar shapes. The relative contributions of sequence and shape to binding will be tested with analytic models including multiple linear regression (MLR) and support vector regression (SVR). For systems in which the integration of sequence and shape proves advantageous, novel motif finding tools will be developed based on an extended alphabet that combines sequence with informative structural features, selected by machine learning and feature selection approaches. Sequence+shape motifs will be tested by motif scanning, compared to sequence-only motifs, and integrated into the MEME Suite. The goal of this sequence-shape integration is to increase the accuracy of finding in vivo TFBSs in the genome. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Protein-DNA recognition is a critical yet poorly understood component of gene regulation. This proposal will connect the fields of DNA sequence and structure analysis, which so far have been developed in parallel but largely disconnected from each other. Integration of the one-dimensional DNA sequence at a genome-wide scale with the three-dimensional DNA structure at atomic resolution will lead to the development of novel genome analysis tools and will advance our understanding of genome function, leading to fundamentally new insights into the mechanisms of gene regulation and its impact on human disease.",Genome analysis based on the integration of DNA sequence and shape,8998963,R01GM106056,"['Affect', 'Affinity', 'Algorithms', 'BHLH Protein', 'Base Pairing', 'Base Sequence', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Process', 'ChIP-on-chip', 'ChIP-seq', 'Characteristics', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'DNA', 'DNA Binding', 'DNA Databases', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA Structure', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'DNase-I Footprinting', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Deoxyribonuclease I', 'Development', 'Drosophila genus', 'Embryonic Development', 'Family', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genome Scan', 'Genomics', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Guanine + Cytosine Composition', 'Health', 'Helix-Turn-Helix Motifs', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Hydroxyl Radical', 'In Vitro', 'Internet', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Letters', 'Linear Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Mining', 'Minor Groove', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Biology', 'NMR Spectroscopy', 'Nucleotides', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protein Family', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Width', 'X-Ray Crystallography', 'Yeasts', 'base', 'design', 'flexibility', 'genetic evolution', 'genome analysis', 'genome browser', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'homeodomain', 'human disease', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'member', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'predictive tools', 'research study', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'vector', 'whole genome']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2016,306949,-0.019335383919924228
"Semantic Literature Annotation and Integrative Panomics Analysis for PTM-Disease Knowledge Network Discovery PROJECT SUMMARY Protein post-translational modification (PTM) plays a critical role in many diseases; however, critical gaps remain in research infrastructure for global analysis of PTMs. Key PTM information concerning enzyme- substrate relationships, regulation of PTM enzymes, PTM cross-talk, and functional consequences of PTM remains buried in the scientific literature. Meanwhile, while high-throughput panomics (genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, PTM proteomic) data offer an unprecedented opportunity for the discovery of PTM-disease relationships, the data must be analyzed in an integrated and easily accessible knowledge framework in order for researchers and clinicians to gain a molecular understanding of disease. The goal of this application is to develop a collaborative knowledge environment for semantic annotation of scientific literature and integrative panomics analysis for PTM-disease knowledge discovery in precision medicine. We propose to connect PTM information from literature mining and curated databases in a knowledge resource on an ontological framework that supports analysis of panomics data in the context of PTM networks. To broaden impact and foster collaborative development, our resource will be FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) and interoperable with community standards.  The specific aims are: (i) develop a novel NLP (natural language processing) system for full-scale literature mining and PTM-disease knowledge extraction; (ii) develop a PTM knowledge resource for integrative panomics analysis and network discovery; and (iii) provide a FAIR collaborative environment for scalable semantic annotation and knowledge integration. The proposed system will build upon the NLP technologies and text mining tools already developed by our team and the bioinformatics infrastructure at the Protein Information Resource (PIR). The iPTMnet web portal will allow searching, browsing, visualization and analysis of PTM networks and PTM-related mutations in conjunction with user-supplied omics data, including panomics data from major national initiatives. Use scenarios will include identification of disease-driving genetic variants and analysis of cellular responses to kinase inhibitors. Our PTM knowledgebase will be disseminated with an RDF triple-store and a SPARQL endpoint for semantic queries, while our text mining tools and full-scale literature mining results will be disseminated in the BioC community standard for seamless integration to other text mining pipelines. To engage the community semantic annotation of scientific literature, we will host a hackathon to develop tools to expose BioC-annotated literature corpora to the semantic web, as well as an annotation jamboree to explore tagging of scientific text with precise ontological terms. This project will thus offer a unique research resource for PTM-disease network discovery as well as an integrable collaborative knowledge framework to support Big Data to Knowledge in precision medicine. PROJECT NARRATIVE Precision medicine requires a detailed understanding of the molecular events that are disrupted in disease, including changes in protein post-translational modifications (PTM) that are hallmarks of many diseases. The proposed resource will support analysis of genomic-scale data for exploring PTM-disease networks and PTM-related mutations, as well as knowledge dissemination on the semantic web. These combined efforts will accelerate basic understanding of disease processes and discovery of diagnostic targets and more effective individualized therapies.",Semantic Literature Annotation and Integrative Panomics Analysis for PTM-Disease Knowledge Network Discovery,9195864,U01GM120953,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Automobile Driving', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Controlled Vocabulary', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Drug resistance', 'Educational workshop', 'Environment', 'Enzymes', 'Europe', 'Event', 'Fostering', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Hybrids', 'Imagery', 'Information Resources', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Knowledge Extraction', 'Length', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'MicroRNAs', 'Mining', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Ontology', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Phosphorylation', 'Phosphorylation Site', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Play', 'Post Translational Modification Analysis', 'Post-Translational Modification Site', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Process', 'Protein Databases', 'Protein Family', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'PubMed', 'Publications', 'Regulation', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Semantics', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Staging', 'System', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Tissues', 'Translational Research', 'Variant', 'abstracting', 'cell type', 'collaborative environment', 'computer based Semantic Analysis', 'enzyme substrate', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic variant', 'hackathon', 'indexing', 'information organization', 'innovation', 'kinase inhibitor', 'knowledge base', 'novel', 'precision medicine', 'protein complex', 'protein protein interaction', 'response', 'system architecture', 'text searching', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'web portal', 'web services', 'web site']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF DELAWARE,U01,2016,374400,-0.033424917104253674

"HIGH THROUGHPUT LITERATURE CURATION OF GENETIC REGULATION IN BACTERIAL MODELS DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The aim of this proposal is to implement a novel way of processing and accessing the vast detailed knowledge contained within collections of scientific publications on the regulation of transcription initiation in bacterial models. In princple, this model for processing and reading information and new knowledge is applicable to other biological domains, potentially benefiting any area of biomedical knowledge. It is certainly criticl to generate new strategies to cope with the ever-increasing amount of knowledge generated in genomics and in biomedical research at large. Improving the efficiency of the traditional high-quality manual curation of scientific publications will enable us also to expand the type of biological knowledge, beyond mechanisms and their elements in the genome, to start including their connections with larger regulated processes and eventually physiological properties of the cell. We will first implement the necessary technology to improve our curation by means of a computational system that has text mining capabilities for preprocessing the papers before a human expert curator identifies which sentences contain the information that is to be added to the database. Premarked options selected by the curators will accelerate their decisions. The accumulative precise mapping between sentences and curated knowledge will provide training sets for text mining technologies to improve their automatic extraction. The curator practices will become more efficient, enabling us to curate selected high-impact published reviews to place mechanisms into a rich context of their physiological processes and general biology. Another relevant component of our proposal is the improved modeling of regulated processes by means of new concepts in biology that capture larger collections of coregulated genes and their concatenated reactions. Starting from all interactions of a local regulator, coregulated regulators and their domain of action will be incorporated to construct the biobricks of complex decisions, as they are encoded in the genome. These are conceptual containers that capture the organization of knowledge to describe the genetic programming of cellular capabilities. These proposals will be formalized and proposed within an international consortium focused in enriching standard models or ontologies of gene regulation for use by the scientific community. Finally, a portal to navigate across all the sentences of a given corpus of a large number (more than 5,000) of related papers will be implemented. The different avenues of navigation will essentially use two technologies, one dealing with automatically generating simpler sentences from original sentences as input, and the other one with the classification of papers based on their theme or ontology. Their combination will enable a novel navigation reading system. If we achieve our aims, this project will give a proof-of-principle prototype with clearly innovative higher levels of large amounts of integrated knowledge. Future directions may adapt these concepts and methods to the biology of higher organisms, including humans. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Scientific knowledge reported within publications provides a wealth of knowledge that we barely capture in databases for genomics. Enhancing the effectiveness of the processing and representation of all this knowledge will change the way we encode our understanding of concatenated interactions that are organized into networks and processes governing cell behavior. Given the conservation in evolution of the nature of biological complexity, a better encoding of our understanding of a bacterial cell shall influence that of any other living organism.",HIGH THROUGHPUT LITERATURE CURATION OF GENETIC REGULATION IN BACTERIAL MODELS,8985684,R01GM110597,"['Area', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Model', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Effectiveness', 'Elements', 'Escherichia coli', 'Evolution', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Programming', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Human', 'Indium', 'International', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Letters', 'Life', 'Linguistics', 'Literature', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Ontology', 'Operon', 'Organism', 'Paper', 'Physiological', 'Physiological Processes', 'Process', 'Property', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Reaction', 'Reading', 'Regulation', 'Regulon', 'Reporting', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Solid', 'Source', 'System', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Training', 'Transcription Initiation', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'base', 'cell behavior', 'coping', 'digital', 'electronic book', 'experience', 'feeding', 'functional genomics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'member', 'microbial community', 'model organisms databases', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'promoter', 'prototype', 'response', 'software development', 'text searching', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'usability']",NIGMS,CENTER FOR GENOMIC SCIENCES,R01,2016,405708,-0.042383243906426456
"Informatics Tools for High-Throughput Sequences Data Analysis DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) is a suite of best-in-class, widely-used, well-supported, open-source tools for processing and analysis of next-generation DNA sequencing (NGS) data. These tools currently  include a multiple sequence realigner, a covariate-correcting base quality score recalibrator, multi-sample  SNP, INDEL, and CNV genotypers, machine learning algorithms for false positive identification, variant  evaluation modules, somatic SNP and indel callers, and hundreds of other tools. Underlying all of these tools is our structured programming framework (GATK-Engine) that uses the functional programming philosophy of MapReduce to make writing feature-rich, efficient and robust analysis tools easy. By centralizing common data management infrastructure, all GATK-based tools benefit from the engine's correctness, CPU and memory efficiency, as well as automatic distributed and shared memory parallelization, essential capabilities given the massive and growing size of NGS datasets. The GATK currently supports all of the major sequencing technologies including lllumina. Life Sciences 454, and ABI SOLID, from hybrid capture of exomes to 1000s of low-pass samples in the 1000 Genomes Project. Our emphasis on technology-agnostic processing tools has helped to popularize the now standard SAM/BAM and VCFs formats for representing NGS data and variation calls, respectively. In this RFA we propose to  continue to develop the GATK-Engine and data processing tools to (1) achieve complete and accurate  variation discovery and genotyping for all major sequencing study designs and NGS technologies (2)  optimize the GATK-Engine and pipelining infrastructure to operate efficiently on distributed data sets at the  scale of tens of thousands of samples (3) extend the GATK data processing tools to support the upcoming  sequencing technologies of Complete Genomics, lon Torrent, and Pacific Biosciences as well as we do  current technologies, (4) expand significantly our educational and support structures to ensure that the longtail  of future NGS users can benefit from the best-practice data processing and analysis tools in the GATK.

"Reactome: An Open Knowledgebase of Human Pathways DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We seek renewal of the core operating funding for the Reactome Knowledgebase of Human Biological Pathways and Processes. Reactome is a curated knowledgebase available online as an open access resource that can be freely used and redistributed by all members of the biological research community. It is used by geneticists, genomics researchers, clinical researchers and molecular biologists to interpret the results of high-throughput experimental studies, by bioinformaticians seeking to develop novel algorithms for mining knowledge from genomics studies, and by systems biologists building predictive models of normal and abnormal pathways.  Our curational system draws heavily on the expertise of independent investigators within the community who author precise machine-readable descriptions of human biological pathways under the guidance of a staff of dedicated curators. Each pathway is extensively checked and peer-reviewed prior to publication to ensure its factual accuracy and compliance with the data model. A system of evidence tracking ensures that all assertions are backed up by the primary literature, and that human molecular events inferred from orthologous ones in animal models have an auditable inference chain. Curated pathways described by Reactome currently cover roughly one quarter of the translated portion of the genome. We also offer a network of ""functional interactions"" (FIs) predicted by a conservative machine-learning approach, that covers an additional quarter of the translated genome, for a combined coverage of roughly 50% of the known genome.  Over the next five years, we seek to (1) increase the number of curated proteins and other functional entities to at least 10,500; (2) to supplement normal pathways with variant reactions for 1200 genes representing disease states; (3) increase the size of the Reactome Fl network to 15,000 molecules; and (4) enhance the web site and other resources to meet the needs of a growing and diverse user community. RELEVANCE (See instructions):  Reactome represents one of a very small number of fully open access curated pathway databases. Its contents have contributed both directly and indirectly to large numbers of basic and translational research studies, and it supports a broad, diverse and engaged user community. As such it represents a key and irreplaceable community resource for genomics, genetics, systems biology, and translational researchers.",Reactome: An Open Knowledgebase of Human Pathways,8840984,U41HG003751,"['Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Back', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Disease Pathway', 'Ensure', 'Event', 'Funding', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Instruction', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Literature', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'MicroRNAs', 'Mining', 'Molecular', 'Online Systems', 'Pathway interactions', 'Peer Review', 'Process', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proteins', 'Publications', 'Reaction', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Software Tools', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Tablet Computer', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'base', 'biological research', 'data exchange', 'data modeling', 'improved', 'knowledge base', 'meetings', 'member', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'research study', 'small molecule', 'touchscreen', 'transcription factor', 'usability', 'web services', 'web site']",NHGRI,ONTARIO INSTITUTE FOR CANCER RESEARCH,U41,2015,1243799,0.018938974525962864
"Multi-Resolution Docking Methods for Electron Microscopy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the past decade, significant progress was made in 3D imaging of macromolecular assemblies via electron microscopy and in the development of computational algorithms that relate the resulting volumetric maps to atomic-resolution structures. The overall goal of the proposed research is to further develop computational fitting and validation tools for electron microscopy (EM). We intend to establish new modeling, visualization, and simulation techniques that would serve as bridges between atomic structures and EM densities. The proposed multi-scale software will aid in the routine determination of large-scale structures of biomolecular assemblies and in the validation of structural models that will be deposited to public databases such as the Protein Data Bank (PDB) and the EM Data Bank (EMDB). Key questions to be addressed include the following: (i) How can one improve, validate, and disseminate well-established matching algorithms for intermediate-resolution (8-15 Å) cryo-electron microscopy? (ii) How can one accurately identify and segment geometric features of subcellular assemblies in low-resolution (4-5 nm) cryo-electron tomograms or in focused ion beam milling of resin-embedded specimen blocks? (iii) Given the recent increase in resolution achieved with direct detection cameras, how can one systematically characterize high-resolution (2-10 Å) density patterns and validate atomic models based on local signatures in the data? We will adapt a new modeling paradigm for these studies, namely simultaneous refinement of multiple subunits. This approach is based on a ""systems"" perspective because biological assemblies exhibit ""emergent behavior"" in the spatial domain, that is, the whole is more than the sum of its parts. The new paradigm, in combination with docking protocols, improves model accuracy and opens the door to new global fitting applications in the above three areas. In addition, we will use statistical analysis and machine learning of local signatures to complement the global strategies. The collaborative efforts supported by this grant will include refinement of cytoskeletal filaments, molecular motors, chromatin fibers, and hair cell stereocilia. The algorithmic and methodological developments will be distributed freely through the established internet-based mechanisms used by the Situs and Sculptor packages.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project helps biological electron microscopists bridge a broad range of resolution levels from atomic to living organism-level. Macromolecular assemblies are the basic functional units of biological cells; they furnish targets for drug design because deficiencies in macromolecular assembly architecture are frequently linked to health problems. The results of our fundamental research will be new computer codes for modeling macromolecular assemblies, the structures of which facilitate the prediction of medically relevant functions.            ",Multi-Resolution Docking Methods for Electron Microscopy,8964685,R01GM062968,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Chromatin Fiber', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computer-Assisted Image Analysis', 'Cryoelectron Microscopy', 'Cytoskeletal Filaments', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Docking', 'Drug Design', 'Educational workshop', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Electrons', 'Exhibits', 'Feedback', 'Filament', 'Freezing', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hair Cells', 'Health', 'Heating', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Internet', 'Ions', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Membrane', 'Methods', 'Microtubules', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Motors', 'Noise', 'Organism', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Plant Resins', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Scanning Electron Microscopy', 'Series', 'Specimen', 'Stereocilium', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Tomogram', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Vesicle', 'base', 'computer code', 'cryogenics', 'density', 'design', 'fitness', 'fundamental research', 'high standard', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'macromolecular assembly', 'new technology', 'next generation', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'simulation', 'statistics', 'tomography', 'tool']",NIGMS,OLD DOMINION UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,307928,-0.012549583829447057
"Single Molecule Sequencing of Glycosaminoglycans using Recognition Tunneling Nanopores ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Structural analysis of large polysaccharides remains challenging in glycobiology. The problem is especially acute when polysaccharides in question are glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). GAGs are large, linear, sulfated polysaccharides ubiquitous to all mammals. Interests in GAG structures stem from GAGs' diverse biological activities that govern phenomena such as tissue development/regeneration, inflammation, blood coagulation and amyloid plaque formation. Abnormal GAG structures have also been associated with the development of a number of diseases, notably cancer and inflammation. As a result, there has been a desire to understand how GAG structures correlate with their biological activities, especially how the distribution of sulfate groups along the chain influence their interactions with GAG-binding proteins. However, GAGs' large size and complex sulfation patterns make analysis of intact GAG chains by conventional ensemble analytical techniques difficult, if not impossible. Here we propose to develop a single molecule sequencer for analysis of polysaccharides using the recognition tunneling nanopore (RTP) device currently under development for ""$1000 genome"" project as a template. With the R21 grant, we will demonstrate the feasibility by carrying out pre-requisite work needed to achieve single molecule sequencing of intact GAG chains using RTP. A RTP device incorporates a nanopore with a tunneling nanogap that contains two electrodes functionalized with recognition molecules capable of forming transient complexes with functional groups on a polymeric chain as it translocates the nanopore, thus generating electrical signals. Single molecule sequencing of GAG chains proposed here circumvents the need to obtain homogeneous samples of GAGs, greatly reducing complexity of sample preparation. GAG analysis by RT devices also does not have the size limitations of most of the existing analytical techniques, and the solid state device planned here are economical to manufacturer and operate. In this application, we aim to carry out pilot studies needed to make GAG sequencing by RTPs feasible: (1) we will investigate the translocation of size defined sulfated GAG fragments through nanopores to optimize the translocation efficiency of GAG ligands as well as to understand the influence of GAG sulfation density and GAG size on their translocation efficiency and speed; (2) we will carry out recognition tunneling experiments on sulfated GAG disaccharides as well as trisaccharides so these signals of GAGs can be analyzed using machine learning algorithms to identify unique signatures needed to detect the presence of these sulfation motifs in longer GAG chains. Completion of these aims will provide all the knowledge required for correct interpretations of RT signals produced by GAG translocation and sets the stage for sequencing of intact GAG chains by RT devices.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     Work proposed here will allow single molecule sequencing of glycosaminoglycan polysaccharides using an electronic chip with a high speed and low cost for the first time. Glycosaminoglycans have important pharmacological properties and are modulators of critical biological phenomena such as tissue development/regeneration and inflammation. Determination of their sequence structures will allow better understanding of how organisms control these physiological events through glycosaminoglycans.            ",Single Molecule Sequencing of Glycosaminoglycans using Recognition Tunneling Nanopores,8984813,R21GM118339,"['Acute', 'Algorithms', 'Amino Acids', 'Architecture', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Phenomena', 'Blood coagulation', 'Cells', 'Charge', 'Chemistry', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disaccharides', 'Disease', 'Electrodes', 'Electronics', 'Electrons', 'Environment', 'Enzymes', 'Event', 'Genome', 'Glycobiology', 'Glycosaminoglycans', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Imidazole', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inorganic Sulfates', 'Ions', 'Isomerism', 'Knowledge', 'Leukocyte Trafficking', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Mammals', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Natural regeneration', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Oligosaccharides', 'Organism', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Polysaccharides', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Senile Plaques', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signaling Protein', 'Site', 'Speed', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Trisaccharides', 'Unspecified or Sulfate Ion Sulfates', 'Work', 'amyloid formation', 'analytical method', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cost', 'density', 'design', 'extracellular', 'functional group', 'interest', 'nanopore', 'polysulfated glycosaminoglycan', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'single molecule', 'solid state', 'stem', 'sugar', 'sulfation', 'tool']",NIGMS,ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY-TEMPE CAMPUS,R21,2015,273816,0.000431218361848384
"Genome analysis based on the integration of DNA sequence and shape DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Current techniques for genome analysis are mainly based on the one-dimensional DNA sequence, comprised of the letters A, C, G, and T. However, proteins recognize DNA as a three-dimensional (3D) object. Nuances in DNA shape at single nucleotide resolution play a crucial role in the binding specificity of transcription facors (TFs), including those involved in embryonic development and human cancer. This project involves the development of a battery of tools for genome analysis, through the integration of information derived from the DNA sequence and the 3D structure of DNA, or ""DNA shape"". The basis for these novel tools is a high- throughput (HT) method for the prediction of multiple features of local DNA shape at the genomic scale. Data will be made available to the community in the UCSC Genome Browser track format through a web server interface. These tools will enable users to analyze the shape of any number or length of DNA sequences, including whole genomes and the effect of DNA methylation. HT shape predictions will be validated based on X-ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy, and hydroxyl radical cleavage data. Predictions will be combined with ORChID, an ENCODE project that infers DNA minor groove geometry from hydroxyl radical cleavage experiments. The HT method will be used to study how paralogous TFs select different target sites in vivo despite sharing core-binding motifs or having similar binding properties in vitro. To study this question, we will investigate the effect of flanking sequences on multiple structural features of TF binding sites (TFBSs). The initial focus of this study will be homeodomains and basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) TFs. Other protein families will later be included and used to construct a comprehensive TFBS database that provides shape features for binding motifs derived from JASPAR and other motif databases. Structural effects of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) will also be analyzed. Some SNPs are associated with deleterious functions, whereas others have no apparent effect. The HT shape prediction method will be used to predict the function of SNPs in non-coding regions based on DNA shape. We will correlate quantitative effects of SNPs on DNA structure with expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) and genome-wide association study (GWAS) signals, to develop a predictive tool for the functional effect of SNPs. The HT shape prediction approach will be used to design DNA sequences with different AT/GC contents but similar shapes. The relative contributions of sequence and shape to binding will be tested with analytic models including multiple linear regression (MLR) and support vector regression (SVR). For systems in which the integration of sequence and shape proves advantageous, novel motif finding tools will be developed based on an extended alphabet that combines sequence with informative structural features, selected by machine learning and feature selection approaches. Sequence+shape motifs will be tested by motif scanning, compared to sequence-only motifs, and integrated into the MEME Suite. The goal of this sequence-shape integration is to increase the accuracy of finding in vivo TFBSs in the genome. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Protein-DNA recognition is a critical yet poorly understood component of gene regulation. This proposal will connect the fields of DNA sequence and structure analysis, which so far have been developed in parallel but largely disconnected from each other. Integration of the one-dimensional DNA sequence at a genome-wide scale with the three-dimensional DNA structure at atomic resolution will lead to the development of novel genome analysis tools and will advance our understanding of genome function, leading to fundamentally new insights into the mechanisms of gene regulation and its impact on human disease.",Genome analysis based on the integration of DNA sequence and shape,8795204,R01GM106056,"['Affect', 'Affinity', 'Algorithms', 'BHLH Protein', 'Base Pairing', 'Base Sequence', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Process', 'ChIP-on-chip', 'ChIP-seq', 'Characteristics', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'DNA', 'DNA Binding', 'DNA Databases', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA Structure', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'DNase-I Footprinting', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Deoxyribonuclease I', 'Development', 'Drosophila genus', 'Embryonic Development', 'Family', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genome Scan', 'Genomics', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Guanine + Cytosine Composition', 'Health', 'Helix-Turn-Helix Motifs', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Hydroxyl Radical', 'In Vitro', 'Internet', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Letters', 'Linear Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Mining', 'Minor Groove', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Biology', 'NMR Spectroscopy', 'Nucleotides', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Family', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Relative (related person)', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Width', 'X-Ray Crystallography', 'Yeasts', 'base', 'design', 'flexibility', 'genetic evolution', 'genome analysis', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'homeodomain', 'human disease', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'member', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'research study', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'vector']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2015,304719,-0.019335383919924228

"BIGDATA: DA: Interpreting massive genomic data sets via summarization Genomic data is big and getting ever bigger, but current analysis methods will not scale to the analysis of thousands or millions of genomes. Consequently, a critical technical challenge is to develop new methods that can analyze these enormous data sets. In this proposal, we describe a new computational framework for drawing inferences from massive genomic data sets. Our approach leverages submodular summarization methods that have been developed for analyzing text corpora. We will apply these methods to five big data problems in genomics: 1) identifying functional elements characteristic o f a given human cell type; 2) identifying genomic features associated with a particular subclass of cancer; 3-4) identifying genomic variants representative of ancestrally or phenotypically defined human populations; and 5) finding a set of microbial genes that characterize a given site on the human body. This project will advance discovery and understanding on two fronts. First, we will develop novel methods for summarizing genomic, epigenomic and metagenomic data sets. Indeed, to our knowledge, this grant proposes the first application of summarization methods to genomic data of any kind. The proposed research will significantly advance our ability to apply submodularity to these summarization tasks, particularly with respect to identifying and creating a library of distance functions that have bee validated with respect to the five tasks outlined in the proposal. Second, we will apply our novel methods to problems of profound importance. Indeed, significant progress toward any one of our five tasks would represent an important advance in our scientific understanding of human history, biology or disease. The impact of this project will grow as the big data problem grows, even after the project is complete. The results of this project, both the software that we develop and the summaries that we produce, will be useful for answering a wide array of questions in any field that must cope with big data. Rapid advances in DNA sequencing technology have led to an explosion of genomic data. This data contains valuable knowledge about human biology and human disease, but few existing computational methods are designed to scale to the joint analysis of tens of thousands of human genomes.

The database and its associated resources will always remain publicly available without restriction from www.yeastgenome.org.  SGD will continue to provide the S. cerevisiae genome and its gene products culled from the published literature. New user interfaces and analysis resources will be developed for existing information as well as for new types of data, such as results from large scale genomic/proteomic analysis. These improvements will be developed using publicly available tools such as those available from the GMOD project. Query tools will be more enhanced to instantly direct users to the appropriate pages.  SGD has evolved into a substantial service organization, and will maintain its service to the scientific community, reaching out to all yeast researchers as well as scientists outside the fungal community to serve those who have a need for information about budding yeast genes, their products, and their functions. SGD will continue existing services while working to simplify the use and maintenance of our hardware and software environment through the application of new technologies. We will continue to collaborate with the yeast biology community to keep the database accurate and current, and to maintain consensus and order in the naming of genes and other generic elements. Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a model forth understanding of chromosome maintenance, the cell cycle and cellular biology. S. cerevisiae is used for the development of new genomic and proteomic technologies.

"HIGH THROUGHPUT LITERATURE CURATION OF GENETIC REGULATION IN BACTERIAL MODELS     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The aim of this proposal is to implement a novel way of processing and accessing the vast detailed knowledge contained within collections of scientific publications on the regulation of transcription initiation in bacterial models. In princple, this model for processing and reading information and new knowledge is applicable to other biological domains, potentially benefiting any area of biomedical knowledge. It is certainly criticl to generate new strategies to cope with the ever-increasing amount of knowledge generated in genomics and in biomedical research at large. Improving the efficiency of the traditional high-quality manual curation of scientific publications will enable us also to expand the type of biological knowledge, beyond mechanisms and their elements in the genome, to start including their connections with larger regulated processes and eventually physiological properties of the cell. We will first implement the necessary technology to improve our curation by means of a computational system that has text mining capabilities for preprocessing the papers before a human expert curator identifies which sentences contain the information that is to be added to the database. Premarked options selected by the curators will accelerate their decisions. The accumulative precise mapping between sentences and curated knowledge will provide training sets for text mining technologies to improve their automatic extraction. The curator practices will become more efficient, enabling us to curate selected high-impact published reviews to place mechanisms into a rich context of their physiological processes and general biology. Another relevant component of our proposal is the improved modeling of regulated processes by means of new concepts in biology that capture larger collections of coregulated genes and their concatenated reactions. Starting from all interactions of a local regulator, coregulated regulators and their domain of action will be incorporated to construct the biobricks of complex decisions, as they are encoded in the genome. These are conceptual containers that capture the organization of knowledge to describe the genetic programming of cellular capabilities. These proposals will be formalized and proposed within an international consortium focused in enriching standard models or ontologies of gene regulation for use by the scientific community. Finally, a portal to navigate across all the sentences of a given corpus of a large number (more than 5,000) of related papers will be implemented. The different avenues of navigation will essentially use two technologies, one dealing with automatically generating simpler sentences from original sentences as input, and the other one with the classification of papers based on their theme or ontology. Their combination will enable a novel navigation reading system. If we achieve our aims, this project will give a proof-of-principle prototype with clearly innovative higher levels of large amounts of integrated knowledge. Future directions may adapt these concepts and methods to the biology of higher organisms, including humans.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Scientific knowledge reported within publications provides a wealth of knowledge that we barely capture in databases for genomics. Enhancing the effectiveness of the processing and representation of all this knowledge will change the way we encode our understanding of concatenated interactions that are organized into networks and processes governing cell behavior. Given the conservation in evolution of the nature of biological complexity, a better encoding of our understanding of a bacterial cell shall influence that of any other living organism.            ",HIGH THROUGHPUT LITERATURE CURATION OF GENETIC REGULATION IN BACTERIAL MODELS,8817212,R01GM110597,"['Area', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Model', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Books', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Effectiveness', 'Elements', 'Escherichia coli', 'Evolution', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Programming', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Indium', 'International', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Letters', 'Life', 'Linguistics', 'Literature', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Ontology', 'Operon', 'Organism', 'Paper', 'Physiological', 'Physiological Processes', 'Process', 'Property', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Reaction', 'Reading', 'Regulation', 'Regulon', 'Reporting', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Solid', 'Source', 'System', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Training', 'Transcription Initiation', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'base', 'cell behavior', 'coping', 'digital', 'experience', 'feeding', 'functional genomics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'member', 'microbial community', 'model organisms databases', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'promoter', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'software development', 'text searching', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'usability']",NIGMS,CENTER FOR GENOMIC SCIENCES,R01,2015,406247,-0.042383243906426456
"Machine learning methods to increase genomic accessibility by next-gen sequencing     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): DNA sequencing has become an indispensable tool in many areas of biology and medicine. Recent techno- logical breakthroughs in next-generation sequencing (NGS) have made it possible to sequence billions of bases quickly and cheaply. A number of NGS-based tools have been created, including ChIP-seq, RNA-seq, Methyl- seq and exon/whole-genome sequencing, enabling a fundamentally new way of studying diseases, genomes and epigenomes. The widespread use of NGS-based methods calls for better and more efficient tools for the analysis and interpretation of the NGS high-throughput data. Although a number of computational tools have been devel- oped, they are insufficient in mapping and studying genome features located within repeat, duplicated and other so-called unmappable regions of genomes. In this project, computational algorithms and software that expand genomic accessibility of NGS to these previously understudied regions will be developed.  The algorithms will begin with a new way of mapping raw reads from NGS to the reference genome, followed by a machine learning method to resolve ambiguously mapped reads, and will be integrated into a comprehen- sive analysis pipeline for ChIP-seq. More specifically, the three aims of the research are to develop: (1) Data structures and efficient algorithms for read mapping to rapidly identify all mapping locations. Unlike existing methods, the focus of this research is to rapidly identify all candidate locations of each read, instead of one or only a few locations. (2) Machine learning algorithms for read analysis to resolve ambiguously mapped reads for both ChIP-seq analysis and genetic variation detection. This work will develop probabilistic models to resolve ambiguously mapped reads by pooling information from the entire collection of reads. (3) A comprehensive ChIP- seq analysis pipeline to systematically study genomic features located within unmappable regions of genomes. These algorithms will be tested and refined using both publicly available data and data from established wet-lab collaborators.  In addition to discovering new genomic features located within repeat, duplicated or other previously unac- cessible regions, this work will provide the NGS community with (a) a faster and more accurate tool for mapping short sequence reads, (b) a general methodology for expanding genomic accessibility of NGS, and (c) a versatile, modular, open-source toolbox of algorithms for NGS data analysis, (d) a comprehensive analysis of protein-DNA interactions in repeat regions in all publicly available ChIP-seq datasets.  This work is a close collaboration between computer scientists and web-lab biologists who are developing NGS assays to study biomedical problems. In particular, we will collaborate with Timothy Osborne of Sanford- Burnham Medical Research Institute to study regulators involved in cholesterol and fatty acid metabolism, with Kyoko Yokomori of UC Irvine to study Cohesin, Nipbl and their roles in Cornelia de Lange syndrome, and Ken Cho of UC Irvine to study the roles of FoxH1 and Schnurri in development and growth control.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: DNA-sequencing has become an indispensable tool for basic biomedical research as well as for discovering new treatments and helping biomedical researchers understand disease mechanisms. Next-generation sequencing, which enables rapid generation of billions of bases at relatively low cost, poses a significant computational challenge on how to analyze the large amount of sequence data efficiently and accurately. The goal of this research is to develop open-source software to improve both the efficiency and accuracy of the next-generation sequencing analysis tools, and thereby allowing biomedical researchers to take full advantage of next-generation sequencing to study biology and disease.            ",Machine learning methods to increase genomic accessibility by next-gen sequencing,8683213,R01HG006870,"['Algorithms', 'Anus', 'Area', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Bruck-de Lange syndrome', 'ChIP-seq', 'Cholesterol', 'Chromatin', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA-Protein Interaction', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Exons', 'Facioscapulohumeral', 'Foundations', 'Generations', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Growth and Development function', 'Internet', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medical Research', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Muscular Dystrophies', 'Procedures', 'Publishing', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Research Institute', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Software Engineering', 'Speed', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Uncertainty', 'Work', 'base', 'cohesin', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'epigenome', 'fatty acid metabolism', 'functional genomics', 'genome sequencing', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'open source', 'public health relevance', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'xenopus development']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-IRVINE,R01,2014,221252,-0.005278252315055061
"Informatics Tools for High-Throughput Sequences Data Analysis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) is a suite of best-in-class, widely-used, well-supported, open-source tools for processing and analysis of next-generation DNA sequencing (NGS) data. These tools currently  include a multiple sequence realigner, a covariate-correcting base quality score recalibrator, multi-sample  SNP, INDEL, and CNV genotypers, machine learning algorithms for false positive identification, variant  evaluation modules, somatic SNP and indel callers, and hundreds of other tools. Underlying all of these tools is our structured programming framework (GATK-Engine) that uses the functional programming philosophy of MapReduce to make writing feature-rich, efficient and robust analysis tools easy. By centralizing common data management infrastructure, all GATK-based tools benefit from the engine's correctness, CPU and memory efficiency, as well as automatic distributed and shared memory parallelization, essential capabilities given the massive and growing size of NGS datasets. The GATK currently supports all of the major sequencing technologies including lllumina. Life Sciences 454, and ABI SOLID, from hybrid capture of exomes to 1000s of low-pass samples in the 1000 Genomes Project. Our emphasis on technology-agnostic processing tools has helped to popularize the now standard SAM/BAM and VCFs formats for representing NGS data and variation calls, respectively. In this RFA we propose to  continue to develop the GATK-Engine and data processing tools to (1) achieve complete and accurate  variation discovery and genotyping for all major sequencing study designs and NGS technologies (2)  optimize the GATK-Engine and pipelining infrastructure to operate efficiently on distributed data sets at the  scale of tens of thousands of samples (3) extend the GATK data processing tools to support the upcoming  sequencing technologies of Complete Genomics, lon Torrent, and Pacific Biosciences as well as we do  current technologies, (4) expand significantly our educational and support structures to ensure that the longtail  of future NGS users can benefit from the best-practice data processing and analysis tools in the GATK.        The proposed project aims to continue to develop the Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK), a suite of widely used and mission-critical tools for analyzing the next-generation DNA sequencing data. With this grant we will improve these tools, make them more robust, and extend them to new sequencing technologies. This is essential to realize the potential of DNA sequencing to understand human history, diversity, and to discover  new loci associated with human disease, leading to new biologic hypotheses and new drug targets.

"The Crystallography of Macromolecules    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposal ""The Crystallography of Macromolecules"" addresses the limitations of diffraction data analysis methods in the field of X-ray crystallography. The significance of this work is determined by the importance of the technique, which generates uniquely-detailed information about cellular processes at the atomic level. The structural results obtained with crystallography are used to explain and validate results obtain by other biophysical, biochemical and cell biology techniques, to generate hypotheses for detailed studies of cellular process and to guide drug design studies - all of which are highly relevant to NIH mission. The proposal focuses on method development to address a frequent situation, where the crystal size and order is insufficient to obtain a structure from a single crystal. This is particularly frequent in cases of large eukaryotic complexes and membrane proteins, where the structural information is the most valuable to the NIH mission. The diffraction power of a single crystal is directly related to the microscopic order and size of that specimen. It is also one of the main correlates of structure solution success. The method used to solve the problem of data insufficiency in the case of a single crystal is to use multiple crystals and to average data between them, which allows to retrieve even very low signals. However, different crystals of the same protein, even if they are very similar i.e. have the same crystal lattice symmetry and very similar unit cell dimensions, still are characterized by a somewhat different order. This non-isomorphism is often high enough to make their solution with averaged data impossible. Moreover, the use of multiple data sets complicates decision making as each of the datasets contains different information and it is not clear when and how to combine them. The proposed solution relies on hierarchical analysis. First, the shape of the diffraction spot profiles will be modeled using a novel approach (Aim 1). This will form the ground for the next step, in which deconvolution of overlapping Bragg spot profiles from multiple lattices will be achieved (Aim 2). An additional benefit of algorithms developed in Aim 1 is that they will automatically derive the integration parameters and identify artifacts, making the whole process more robust. This is particularly significant for high-throughput and multiple crystal analysis. In Aim 3, comparison of data from multiple crystals will be performed to identify subsets of data that should be merged to produce optimal results. The critical aspect of this analysis will be the identification and assessment of non- isomorphism between datasets. The experimental decision-making strategy is the subject of Aim 4. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) method will be used to evaluate the suitability of available datasets for possible methods of structure solution. In cases of insufficient data it will identify the most significant factor that needs to be improved. Aim 5 is to simplify navigation of data reduction and to integrate the results of previous aims with other improvements in hardware and computing.        The goal of the proposal is to develop methods for analysis of X-ray diffraction data with a particular focus on the novel analysis of diffraction spot shape and the streamlining of data analysis in multi-crystal modes. The development of such methods is essential to advance structural studies in thousands of projects, which individually are important for NIH mission.

"Reactome: An Open Knowledgebase of Human Pathways     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We seek renewal of the core operating funding for the Reactome Knowledgebase of Human Biological Pathways and Processes. Reactome is a curated knowledgebase available online as an open access resource that can be freely used and redistributed by all members of the biological research community. It is used by geneticists, genomics researchers, clinical researchers and molecular biologists to interpret the results of high-throughput experimental studies, by bioinformaticians seeking to develop novel algorithms for mining knowledge from genomics studies, and by systems biologists building predictive models of normal and abnormal pathways.  Our curational system draws heavily on the expertise of independent investigators within the community who author precise machine-readable descriptions of human biological pathways under the guidance of a staff of dedicated curators. Each pathway is extensively checked and peer-reviewed prior to publication to ensure its factual accuracy and compliance with the data model. A system of evidence tracking ensures that all assertions are backed up by the primary literature, and that human molecular events inferred from orthologous ones in animal models have an auditable inference chain. Curated pathways described by Reactome currently cover roughly one quarter of the translated portion of the genome. We also offer a network of ""functional interactions"" (FIs) predicted by a conservative machine-learning approach, that covers an additional quarter of the translated genome, for a combined coverage of roughly 50% of the known genome.  Over the next five years, we seek to (1) increase the number of curated proteins and other functional entities to at least 10,500; (2) to supplement normal pathways with variant reactions for 1200 genes representing disease states; (3) increase the size of the Reactome Fl network to 15,000 molecules; and (4) enhance the web site and other resources to meet the needs of a growing and diverse user community.

"SLASH: SCALABLE LARGE ANALYTIC SEGMENTATION HYBRID DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Advanced instrumentation and cellular imaging techniques using high-throughput 3D electron microscopy are driving a new revolution in the exploration of complex biological systems by providing near seamless views across multiple scales of resolution. These datasets provide the necessary breadth and depth to analyze multicellular, cellular, and subcelluar structure across large swathes of neural tissue. While these new imaging procedures are generating extremely large datasets of enormous value, the quantities are such that no single user or even laboratory team can possibly analyze the full content of their own imaging activities through traditional means. To address this challenge, we propose to further develop and refine a prototype hybrid system for high-throughput segmentation of large neuropil datasets that: 1) advances automatic algorithms for segmentation of cellular and sub-cellular structures using machine learning techniques; 2) couples these techniques to a scalable and flexible process or tool suite allowing multiple users to simultaneously review, edit and curate the results of these automatic approaches; and, 3) builds a knowledge base of training data guiding and improving automated processing. This system will allow project scientists to select areas of interest, execute automatic segmentation algorithms, and distribute workload, curate data, and deposit final results into the Cell Centered Database (Martone et al. 2008) via accessible web-interfaces. Emerging techniques in cellular and subcellular 3D imaging are generating datasets of enormous value to the study of disease processes and to the pursuit of greater insight into the structure and function of the nervous system. To unlock the potential of these data, new solutions are needed to improve the capability to segment and label the individual molecular, subcellular and cellular components within very large volumetric expanses. To address this challenge, we propose a hybrid system for high-throughput segmentation of large neuropil datasets that advances machine learning algorithms for automatic segmentation and couples these techniques to a scalable tool suite for multiple users to simultaneously review, edit and curate results.",SLASH: SCALABLE LARGE ANALYTIC SEGMENTATION HYBRID,8653848,R01NS075314,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological', 'Cell membrane', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular Structures', 'Classification', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Computers and Advanced Instrumentation', 'Couples', 'Cytoskeleton', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Electrons', 'Face', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Internet', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Mitochondria', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Target', 'Names', 'Nervous System Physiology', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurofibrillary Tangles', 'Neurons', 'Neuropil', 'Online Systems', 'Organelles', 'Participant', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Scanning Electron Microscopy', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Solutions', 'Staining method', 'Stains', 'Structure', 'Subcellular structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Utah', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Workload', 'biological systems', 'cellular imaging', 'complex biological systems', 'data mining', 'digital imaging', 'electron optics', 'flexibility', 'image processing', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'novel', 'prototype', 'relating to nervous system', 'scientific computing', 'tomography', 'tool', 'web interface']",NINDS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2014,436094,-0.0003821570131455201
"Building an open-source cloud-based computational platform to improve data access   We propose to develop a novel, cost-effective, cloud-based data and analytics platform that will provide efficient data storage solutions and enhanced analytics, annotation and reporting capabilities for supporting and accelerating clinical and molecular research in the treatment of substance use disorders (SUD). This open source platform, which leverages existing BioDX technology, will provide a centralized, multi-user environment that enables and encourages collaborative research and information dissemination among team members.  One of the unmet infrastructural challenges of modern molecular research is the availability of computational platforms that allow the management of large databases, easy access to data, the availability of powerful customizable tools for data mining, analysis and visualization, and integration of different data sources to allow successful analysis of complex data problems. Such problems are commonplace in high- throughput molecular research. This proposal aims to fill this gap by developing a robust platform that integrates state-of-the-art open-source technologies for data storage, data access, data mining and analysis, annotation, visualization and reporting.  We previously developed a cloud-based BioDatomics platform for Next Generation Sequencing (NGS), BioDX, which has been successful and has been used commercially by several clients. This proposal aims to develop a new platform leveraging our experience with the BioDX platform that integrates: data storage and real-time data querying using Cloudera Impala; powerful and customizable analytics tools using R and its derivative Bioconductor suite of programs for bioinformatics; annotation integration and reporting which is an existing feature of BioDX; and a visual programming interface that will simplify and enhance the development and maintenance of reproducible analytics workflows. We believe this powerful integrated data platform, if successful, will enable real-time collaboration, dramatically reduce data repository costs, and increase the efficiency and efficacy of data analyses for translating experimental data into actionable research products.  We are committed to analyzing stakeholder needs and optimizing hardware, software and information technology systems to meet their demands. This platform will enhance stakeholder capabilities for developing, implementing and testing various models for substance addiction, risky behavior, discovery of molecular targets for treatment, genomic profiling of patients and other relevant scientific questions. Users will have access to modern statistical, machine learning, data mining and visualization tools.  The initial phase of work will involve development of the platform, optimizing performance on the cloud and testing the integration of new technology. BioDatomics is committed to funding the next phase of work which will include usability testing and finalizing a commercial product, following which full commercialization will proceed. Preliminary commercialization plans have demonstrated that the project has the capacity to generate a million dollars in revenue during the first full year after commercial release.  The ultimate beneficiaries of this platform will be government agencies, academic researchers and pharmaceutical companies pursuing collaborative projects to discover treatments for substance abuse disorders. This open source platform will enable significant savings to the end users in terms of data storage and analytic capabilities, and promises to have a major impact in increasing the success of molecular, clinical and translational research for substance abuse disorders.

"Genome analysis based on the integration of DNA sequence and shape  Title: Genome analysis based on the integration of DNA sequence and shape PI: Rohs, Remo (USC); Co-I: Noble, William Stafford (UW); Co-I: Tullius, Thomas D. (BU) PROJECT SUMMARY Current techniques for genome analysis are mainly based on the one-dimensional DNA sequence, comprised of the letters A, C, G, and T. However, proteins recognize DNA as a three-dimensional (3D) object. Nuances in DNA shape at single nucleotide resolution play a crucial role in the binding specificity of transcription factors (TFs), including those involved in embryonic development and human cancer. This project involves the development of a battery of tools for genome analysis, through the integration of information derived from the DNA sequence and the 3D structure of DNA, or ""DNA shape"". The basis for these novel tools is a high- throughput (HT) method for the prediction of multiple features of local DNA shape at the genomic scale. Data will be made available to the community in the UCSC Genome Browser track format through a web server interface. These tools will enable users to analyze the shape of any number or length of DNA sequences, including whole genomes and the effect of DNA methylation. HT shape predictions will be validated based on X-ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy, and hydroxyl radical cleavage data. Predictions will be combined with ORChID, an ENCODE project that infers DNA minor groove geometry from hydroxyl radical cleavage experiments. The HT method will be used to study how paralogous TFs select different target sites in vivo despite sharing core-binding motifs or having similar binding properties in vitro. To study this question, we will investigate the effect of flanking sequences on multiple structural features of TF binding sites (TFBSs). The initial focus of this study will be homeodomains and basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) TFs. Other protein families will later be included and used to construct a comprehensive TFBS database that provides shape features for binding motifs derived from JASPAR and other motif databases. Structural effects of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) will also be analyzed. Some SNPs are associated with deleterious functions, whereas others have no apparent effect. The HT shape prediction method will be used to predict the function of SNPs in non-coding regions based on DNA shape. We will correlate quantitative effects of SNPs on DNA structure with expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) and genome-wide association study (GWAS) signals, to develop a predictive tool for the functional effect of SNPs. The HT shape prediction approach will be used to design DNA sequences with different AT/GC contents but similar shapes. The relative contributions of sequence and shape to binding will be tested with analytic models including multiple linear regression (MLR) and support vector regression (SVR). For systems in which the integration of sequence and shape proves advantageous, novel motif finding tools will be developed based on an extended alphabet that combines sequence with informative structural features, selected by machine learning and feature selection approaches. Sequence+shape motifs will be tested by motif scanning, compared to sequence-only motifs, and integrated into the MEME Suite. The goal of this sequence-shape integration is to increase the accuracy of finding in vivo TFBSs in the genome. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Protein-DNA recognition is a critical yet poorly understood component of gene regulation. This proposal will connect the fields of DNA sequence and structure analysis, which so far have been developed in parallel but largely disconnected from each other. Integration of the one-dimensional DNA sequence at a genome-wide scale with the three-dimensional DNA structure at atomic resolution will lead to the development of novel genome analysis tools and will advance our understanding of genome function, leading to fundamentally new insights into the mechanisms of gene regulation and its impact on human disease.            ",Genome analysis based on the integration of DNA sequence and shape,8632246,R01GM106056,"['Affect', 'Affinity', 'Algorithms', 'BHLH Protein', 'Base Pairing', 'Base Sequence', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Process', 'ChIP-on-chip', 'ChIP-seq', 'Characteristics', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'DNA', 'DNA Binding', 'DNA Databases', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA Structure', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'DNase-I Footprinting', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Deoxyribonuclease I', 'Development', 'Drosophila genus', 'Embryonic Development', 'Family', 'Functional RNA', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genome Scan', 'Genomics', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Guanine + Cytosine Composition', 'Helix-Turn-Helix Motifs', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Hydroxyl Radical', 'In Vitro', 'Internet', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Letters', 'Linear Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Mining', 'Minor Groove', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Biology', 'NMR Spectroscopy', 'Nucleotides', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Family', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Relative (related person)', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Width', 'X-Ray Crystallography', 'Yeasts', 'base', 'design', 'flexibility', 'genetic evolution', 'genome analysis', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'homeodomain', 'human disease', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'member', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'vector']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2014,334303,-0.02024125557223552

"Integration and visualization of diverse biological data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Modern genome-scale experimental techniques enable for the first time in biological research the comprehensive monitoring of the entire molecular regulatory events leading to disease. Their integrative analyses hold the promise of generating specific, experimentally testable hypotheses, paving the way for a systems-level molecular view of complex disease. However, systems-level modeling of metazoan biology must address the challenges of: 1. biological complexity, including individual cell lineages and tissue types, 2. the increasingly large scale of data in higher organisms, and 3. the diversity of biomolecules and interaction mechanisms in the cell. The long-term goal of this research is to address these challenges through the development of bioinformatics frameworks for the study of gene function and regulation in complex biological systems thereby contributing to a greater understanding of human disease. In the initial funding period, we have developed accurate methods for integrating and visualizing diverse functional genomics data in S. cerevisiae and implemented them in interactive web-based systems for the biology community. Our methods have led to experimental discoveries of novel biology, are widely used by the yeast community, and are integrated with the SGD model organism database. We now propose to leverage our previous work to develop novel data integration and analysis methods and implement them in a public system for human data. In the proposed research period, we will create algorithms appropriate for integrating metazoan data in a tissue- and cell-lineage specific manner in health and disease. We will also develop novel hierarchical methods for predicting specific molecular interaction mechanisms and will extend our methods for integrating additional biomolecules. These methods will direct experiments focused on the glomerular kidney filter, a critical and complex component of the human vascular system whose dysfunction directly contributes to microvascular disease. Prediction of these cell-lineage specific functional networks will advance the understanding of the glomerulus function and its role in microvascular disease, leading to better clinical predictors, diagnoses, and treatments. From a technical perspective, application to glomerular biology will enable iterative improvement of the proposed methods based on experimental feedback. The end product of this research will be a general, robust, interactive, and automatically updated system for human data integration and analysis that will be freely available to the biomedical community. We will leverage parallel processing technologies (inspired by Google- type cloud computing solutions) to ensure interactive-analysis speed on the system. This system will allow biomedical researchers to synthesize, analyze, and visualize diverse data in human biology, enabling accurate predictions of biological networks and understanding their cell-lineage specificity and role in disease. Such integrative analyses will provide experimentally testable hypotheses, leading to a deeper understanding of complex disorders and paving the way to molecular-defined tissue targeted therapies and drug development.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Our general system will enable integrative analysis of human functional genomics data in a cell-lineage and disease-focused manner, allowing biomedical researchers to identify potential clinical biomarkers and to formulate specific hypotheses elucidating the cause and development of a variety of complex disorders. Our application of this system to generate cell-lineage specific functional networks will lead to a better understanding of the glomerulus function and will directly benefit human health through the development of improved predictors, diagnoses, and treatments for microvascular disease.

"BIGDATA: DA: Interpreting massive genomic data sets via summarization Genomic data is big and getting ever bigger, but current analysis methods will not scale to the analysis of thousands or millions of genomes. Consequently, a critical technical challenge is to develop new methods that can analyze these enormous data sets. In this proposal, we describe a new computational framework for drawing inferences from massive genomic data sets. Our approach leverages submodular summarization methods that have been developed for analyzing text corpora. We will apply these methods to five big data problems in genomics: 1) identifying functional elements characteristic o f a given human cell type; 2) identifying genomic features associated with a particular subclass of cancer; 3-4) identifying genomic variants representative of ancestrally or phenotypically defined human populations; and 5) finding a set of microbial genes that characterize a given site on the human body. This project will advance discovery and understanding on two fronts. First, we will develop novel methods for summarizing genomic, epigenomic and metagenomic data sets. Indeed, to our knowledge, this grant proposes the first application of summarization methods to genomic data of any kind. The proposed research will significantly advance our ability to apply submodularity to these summarization tasks, particularly with respect to identifying and creating a library of distance functions that have bee validated with respect to the five tasks outlined in the proposal. Second, we will apply our novel methods to problems of profound importance. Indeed, significant progress toward any one of our five tasks would represent an important advance in our scientific understanding of human history, biology or disease. The impact of this project will grow as the big data problem grows, even after the project is complete. The results of this project, both the software that we develop and the summaries that we produce, will be useful for answering a wide array of questions in any field that must cope with big data. Rapid advances in DNA sequencing technology have led to an explosion of genomic data. This data contains valuable knowledge about human biology and human disease, but few existing computational methods are designed to scale to the joint analysis of tens of thousands of human genomes.

"Ontology-Driven Methods for Knowledge Acquisition and Knowledge Discovery    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       A great challenge in the biomedical informatics domain is to develop computational methods that combine existing knowledge and experimental data to derive new knowledge regarding biological systems and disease mechanisms. Most knowledge regarding genes and proteins in biomedical literature is stored in the form of free text that is not suitable for computation, and the manual processes of encoding this body of knowledge into computable form cannot keep up with the rate of knowledge accumulation. The main thrust of the proposed research is to design novel statistical text-mining algorithms to acquire and represent knowledge regarding genes and proteins from free-text literature, and further to combine this acquired knowledge with experimental data to derive new knowledge. We will organize the proposed research to the following specific aims. Specific Aim 1. Develop ontology-guided semantic modeling algorithms for extracting biological concepts from free text, in which we will design hierarchical probabilistic topic models that are capable of representing biological concepts as a hierarchy and develop novel learning algorithms to infer biological concepts from free-text documents. Specific Aim 2. Integrate semantic modeling with BioNLP to extract textual evidence supporting protein-function annotations. We will develop information extraction algorithms that will combine the results of hierarchical semantic analysis and BioNLP to identify the text regions that will most likely provide evidence regarding the function of genes/proteins and map the extracted information to a controlled vocabulary. Specific Aim 3. Develop a framework to unify the procedures of knowledge reasoning and data mining for knowledge discovery. In this aim, we will reason using existing knowledge (represented in the form of an ontology) to reveal functional modules among the genes from the experimental data. We will then further develop algorithms that will reveal relationships between these gene modules by mining system-scaled experimental data. The overall framework will integrate functional reasoning and data mining in an iterative manner to refine the knowledge progressively and to derive rules such as: when genes involved in biological process X are perturbed, genes involved in biological process Y will respond. We will test the framework on the data from yeast-system biology studies and the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project to gain insights into the cellular systems and disease mechanisms of cancer cells.           In recent decades, biomedical sciences have achieved significant advances; most of the knowledge resulting from research is stored in the form of biomedical literature in the form free-text.

"Genomic Database for the Yeast Saccharomyces    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of the Saccharomyces Genome Database (SGD) is to continue the development and implementation of a comprehensive resource containing curated information about the genome and its elements of the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. SGD will continue to annotate the genome, assimilate new data, include genomic information from other fungal species, and incorporate formalized and controlled vocabularies to represent biological concepts. We will continue to maintain and broaden relationships with the greater scientific community and make technical improvements through the development of tools and the use of third party tools that will allow us to better serve our users. The database and its associated resources will always remain publicly available without restriction from www.yeastgenome.org.  SGD will continue to provide the S. cerevisiae genome and its gene products culled from the published literature. New user interfaces and analysis resources will be developed for existing information as well as for new types of data, such as results from large scale genomic/proteomic analysis. These improvements will be developed using publicly available tools such as those available from the GMOD project. Query tools will be more enhanced to instantly direct users to the appropriate pages.  SGD has evolved into a substantial service organization, and will maintain its service to the scientific community, reaching out to all yeast researchers as well as scientists outside the fungal community to serve those who have a need for information about budding yeast genes, their products, and their functions. SGD will continue existing services while working to simplify the use and maintenance of our hardware and software environment through the application of new technologies. We will continue to collaborate with the yeast biology community to keep the database accurate and current, and to maintain consensus and order in the naming of genes and other generic elements.

"New Physical Methodologies for Genomic Analysis     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite substantial efforts in developing sequencing technologies and computational software, spanning over 30 years, the full genome of any but the simplest organisms is still unable to automatically reconstructed. The length of the DNA sequences that can be 'read' by modern sequencing systems is substantially smaller than the length of most genomes (1000s of base-pairs versus millions to billions), making it virtually impossible to use the fragmented information generated by the shotgun sequencing process to reconstruct the long-range information linking together genomic segments belonging to a same chromosome. The main reason why genome assembly is difficult is genomic repeats - segments of DNA that occur in multiple identical or near-identical copies throughout a genome. Any repeats longer than the length of a sequencing read introduce ambiguity in the possible reconstructions of a genome - an exponential (in the number of repeats) number of different genomes can be constructed from the same set of reads, among which only one is the true reconstruction of the genome being assembled. Finding this one correct genome from among the many possible alternatives is impossible without the use of additional information, such as mate-pair information constraining the relative placement of pairs of shotgun reads along the genome. Mate-pair information is routinely generated in sequencing experiments and has been critical to scientists' ability to reconstruct genomes from shotgun data (e.g., mate-pair information was crucial to the success of the first prokaryotic genome project - Haemophilus influenza). Given these outstanding issues, a series of interlocking aims is proposed that center on enhanced optical and electronic detection of specially-decorated, genomic DNA molecules. The aims are designed for enabling new technologies that will provide sufficient physical map information to intimately mix with modern sequencing data for comprehensive assembly of complex genomes. These proposed advancements will be cradled within a new generation of nanofluidic devices engendering novel means for molecular control and detection. Such efforts will be directed by state-of-the art computer simulations that will model novel aspects of the new platforms for allowing rapid loops of design/implementation/testing. The main thrust of these technological developments will be carefully guided and serve a broad-based bioinformatics framework that will be developed for this work while laying the basis for highly integrated approaches to genome assembly and analysis.          Development of new machines and software is proposed, which will rapidly analyze a person's genome and reveal new types of information that doctors will be able to use for treating patients. The machines that will be developed are actually very small devices that may one day be sufficiently miniaturized to fit in a person's hand.

"Machine learning methods to increase genomic accessibility by next-gen sequencing     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): DNA sequencing has become an indispensable tool in many areas of biology and medicine. Recent techno- logical breakthroughs in next-generation sequencing (NGS) have made it possible to sequence billions of bases quickly and cheaply. A number of NGS-based tools have been created, including ChIP-seq, RNA-seq, Methyl- seq and exon/whole-genome sequencing, enabling a fundamentally new way of studying diseases, genomes and epigenomes. The widespread use of NGS-based methods calls for better and more efficient tools for the analysis and interpretation of the NGS high-throughput data. Although a number of computational tools have been devel- oped, they are insufficient in mapping and studying genome features located within repeat, duplicated and other so-called unmappable regions of genomes. In this project, computational algorithms and software that expand genomic accessibility of NGS to these previously understudied regions will be developed.  The algorithms will begin with a new way of mapping raw reads from NGS to the reference genome, followed by a machine learning method to resolve ambiguously mapped reads, and will be integrated into a comprehen- sive analysis pipeline for ChIP-seq. More specifically, the three aims of the research are to develop: (1) Data structures and efficient algorithms for read mapping to rapidly identify all mapping locations. Unlike existing methods, the focus of this research is to rapidly identify all candidate locations of each read, instead of one or only a few locations. (2) Machine learning algorithms for read analysis to resolve ambiguously mapped reads for both ChIP-seq analysis and genetic variation detection. This work will develop probabilistic models to resolve ambiguously mapped reads by pooling information from the entire collection of reads. (3) A comprehensive ChIP- seq analysis pipeline to systematically study genomic features located within unmappable regions of genomes. These algorithms will be tested and refined using both publicly available data and data from established wet-lab collaborators.  In addition to discovering new genomic features located within repeat, duplicated or other previously unac- cessible regions, this work will provide the NGS community with (a) a faster and more accurate tool for mapping short sequence reads, (b) a general methodology for expanding genomic accessibility of NGS, and (c) a versatile, modular, open-source toolbox of algorithms for NGS data analysis, (d) a comprehensive analysis of protein-DNA interactions in repeat regions in all publicly available ChIP-seq datasets.  This work is a close collaboration between computer scientists and web-lab biologists who are developing NGS assays to study biomedical problems. In particular, we will collaborate with Timothy Osborne of Sanford- Burnham Medical Research Institute to study regulators involved in cholesterol and fatty acid metabolism, with Kyoko Yokomori of UC Irvine to study Cohesin, Nipbl and their roles in Cornelia de Lange syndrome, and Ken Cho of UC Irvine to study the roles of FoxH1 and Schnurri in development and growth control.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: DNA-sequencing has become an indispensable tool for basic biomedical research as well as for discovering new treatments and helping biomedical researchers understand disease mechanisms. Next-generation sequencing, which enables rapid generation of billions of bases at relatively low cost, poses a significant computational challenge on how to analyze the large amount of sequence data efficiently and accurately. The goal of this research is to develop open-source software to improve both the efficiency and accuracy of the next-generation sequencing analysis tools, and thereby allowing biomedical researchers to take full advantage of next-generation sequencing to study biology and disease.            ",Machine learning methods to increase genomic accessibility by next-gen sequencing,8518436,R01HG006870,"['Algorithms', 'Anus', 'Area', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Bruck-de Lange syndrome', 'ChIP-seq', 'Cholesterol', 'Chromatin', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA-Protein Interaction', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Exons', 'Facioscapulohumeral', 'Foundations', 'Generations', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Growth and Development function', 'Internet', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medical Research', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Muscular Dystrophies', 'Procedures', 'Publishing', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Research Institute', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Software Engineering', 'Speed', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Uncertainty', 'Work', 'base', 'cohesin', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'epigenome', 'fatty acid metabolism', 'functional genomics', 'genome sequencing', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'open source', 'public health relevance', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'xenopus development']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-IRVINE,R01,2013,220626,-0.005278252315055061
"Informatics Tools for High-Throughput Sequences Data Analysis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) is a suite of best-in-class, widely-used, well-supported, open-source tools for processing and analysis of next-generation DNA sequencing (NGS) data. These tools currently  include a multiple sequence realigner, a covariate-correcting base quality score recalibrator, multi-sample  SNP, INDEL, and CNV genotypers, machine learning algorithms for false positive identification, variant  evaluation modules, somatic SNP and indel callers, and hundreds of other tools. Underlying all of these tools is our structured programming framework (GATK-Engine) that uses the functional programming philosophy of MapReduce to make writing feature-rich, efficient and robust analysis tools easy. By centralizing common data management infrastructure, all GATK-based tools benefit from the engine's correctness, CPU and memory efficiency, as well as automatic distributed and shared memory parallelization, essential capabilities given the massive and growing size of NGS datasets. The GATK currently supports all of the major sequencing technologies including lllumina. Life Sciences 454, and ABI SOLID, from hybrid capture of exomes to 1000s of low-pass samples in the 1000 Genomes Project. Our emphasis on technology-agnostic processing tools has helped to popularize the now standard SAM/BAM and VCFs formats for representing NGS data and variation calls, respectively. In this RFA we propose to  continue to develop the GATK-Engine and data processing tools to (1) achieve complete and accurate  variation discovery and genotyping for all major sequencing study designs and NGS technologies (2)  optimize the GATK-Engine and pipelining infrastructure to operate efficiently on distributed data sets at the  scale of tens of thousands of samples (3) extend the GATK data processing tools to support the upcoming  sequencing technologies of Complete Genomics, lon Torrent, and Pacific Biosciences as well as we do  current technologies, (4) expand significantly our educational and support structures to ensure that the longtail  of future NGS users can benefit from the best-practice data processing and analysis tools in the GATK.        The proposed project aims to continue to develop the Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK), a suite of widely used and mission-critical tools for analyzing the next-generation DNA sequencing data. With this grant we will improve these tools, make them more robust, and extend them to new sequencing technologies. This is essential to realize the potential of DNA sequencing to understand human history, diversity, and to discover  new loci associated with human disease, leading to new biologic hypotheses and new drug targets.

"Annotating Functional Sites in 3D Biological Structures    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Project Summary/Abstract Dramatic advances in our understanding of molecular structure and function promise to accelerate the creation of new diagnostics and therapeutics. However the link between the structure of a biological macromolecule and its function is usually not obvious: fundamental to understanding how a molecule functions is an understanding of how its structure behaves over time. Recent advances in molecular dynamics simulations now allow the rapid collection of information about structural motion. These data sets are huge, and require statistical machine learning algorithms to characterize and recognize patterns relevant to function. The National Library of Medicine's new long-range plan calls for research in the use of advanced simulation and machine learning algorithms in support of biomedical research.       This proposal focuses on annotating molecular structures with missing or incomplete functional information. We are particularly interested in identifying binding sites and active sites in proteins. We bring together simulation and machine learning, and hypothesize that the performance of structure- based function annotation methods will dramatically improve with the addition of information about dynamics. Thus, our specific aims are (1) to develop methods for recognizing function from structural dynamics and diversity, (2) to develop capabilities for large scale clustering and analysis tools for the discovery of novel functions, and (3) to apply our tools to challenging and important biological systems, while disseminating our software, data and capabilities to the biomedical research community. In particular, we will focus our new capabilities on three difficult function annotation challenges: ATP binding sites, phosphorylation sites, and metabolizing enzyme active sites.            Project Narrative The explosion in data related to molecular biology has created great opportunities for new disease diagnostics and therapies. One source of data is the three-dimensional (3D) structure of biological molecules such as proteins, DNA and RNA. This work focuses on using computational technologies to understand how these structures perform their function, so we have a better understanding of both normal and disease processes.",Annotating Functional Sites in 3D Biological Structures,8528717,R01LM005652,"['Active Sites', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Automobile Driving', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Research', 'Calcium Binding', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Crystallography', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Drug Binding Site', 'Environment', 'Enzymes', 'Explosion', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genomics', 'Grant', 'High Performance Computing', 'Human', 'Informatics', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Korea', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Medicine', 'Molecular Structure', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Pathologic', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphorylation', 'Phosphorylation Site', 'Physics', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Retrieval', 'San Francisco', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Software Engineering', 'Source', 'Source Code', 'Specialist', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'United States National Library of Medicine', 'Universities', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'advanced simulation', 'base', 'biological systems', 'cost', 'data reduction', 'design', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'interest', 'macromolecule', 'molecular dynamics', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel therapeutics', 'programs', 'protein function', 'protein structure', 'simulation', 'simulation software', 'structural genomics', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool']",NLM,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2013,292222,-0.021366985192433772
"HyPhy: Molecular Evolutionary Analyses    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Project Description HyPhy (http://www.hyphy.org) is a scriptable software platform designed to enable flexible and powerful analyses of DNA, RNA, codon, amino acid and other types of sequence data in an evolutionary context. Such analyses have become an indispensable component of most research studies that make use of comparative genomic data. Biologists and bioinformaticians increasingly recognize the benefits of molecular evolutionary analyses. Since its initial release in 2001, HyPhy has become a relatively stable and mature product, and has been downloaded by more than 4,500 unique users, integrated into several popular web-based genomic data analysis servers, cited in over 400 peer-reviewed publications and described in three book chapters, in spite of the fact that the development of the package has never been directly funded. This proposal seeks support to improve the quality, performance, reliability, modularity, documentation and feature sets of the HyPhy system. Specific aims can be divided into four major areas: 1. Software engineering, testing, and documentation of the HyPhy codebase. 2. The development of a high-performance engine for phylogenetic maximum likelihood model fitting and inference. 3. Extension of a newly-initiated toolbox for machine learning applications in molecular evolution. 4. Creation and maintenance of a wiki-themed documentation resource.

"The Crystallography of Macromolecules    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposal ""The Crystallography of Macromolecules"" addresses the limitations of diffraction data analysis methods in the field of X-ray crystallography. The significance of this work is determined by the importance of the technique, which generates uniquely-detailed information about cellular processes at the atomic level. The structural results obtained with crystallography are used to explain and validate results obtain by other biophysical, biochemical and cell biology techniques, to generate hypotheses for detailed studies of cellular process and to guide drug design studies - all of which are highly relevant to NIH mission. The proposal focuses on method development to address a frequent situation, where the crystal size and order is insufficient to obtain a structure from a single crystal. This is particularly frequent in cases of large eukaryotic complexes and membrane proteins, where the structural information is the most valuable to the NIH mission. The diffraction power of a single crystal is directly related to the microscopic order and size of that specimen. It is also one of the main correlates of structure solution success. The method used to solve the problem of data insufficiency in the case of a single crystal is to use multiple crystals and to average data between them, which allows to retrieve even very low signals. However, different crystals of the same protein, even if they are very similar i.e. have the same crystal lattice symmetry and very similar unit cell dimensions, still are characterized by a somewhat different order. This non-isomorphism is often high enough to make their solution with averaged data impossible. Moreover, the use of multiple data sets complicates decision making as each of the datasets contains different information and it is not clear when and how to combine them. The proposed solution relies on hierarchical analysis. First, the shape of the diffraction spot profiles will be modeled using a novel approach (Aim 1). This will form the ground for the next step, in which deconvolution of overlapping Bragg spot profiles from multiple lattices will be achieved (Aim 2). An additional benefit of algorithms developed in Aim 1 is that they will automatically derive the integration parameters and identify artifacts, making the whole process more robust. This is particularly significant for high-throughput and multiple crystal analysis. In Aim 3, comparison of data from multiple crystals will be performed to identify subsets of data that should be merged to produce optimal results. The critical aspect of this analysis will be the identification and assessment of non- isomorphism between datasets. The experimental decision-making strategy is the subject of Aim 4. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) method will be used to evaluate the suitability of available datasets for possible methods of structure solution. In cases of insufficient data it will identify the most significant factor that needs to be improved. Aim 5 is to simplify navigation of data reduction and to integrate the results of previous aims with other improvements in hardware and computing.        The goal of the proposal is to develop methods for analysis of X-ray diffraction data with a particular focus on the novel analysis of diffraction spot shape and the streamlining of data analysis in multi-crystal modes. The development of such methods is essential to advance structural studies in thousands of projects, which individually are important for NIH mission.

"Reactome: An Open Knowledgebase of Human Pathways     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We seek renewal of the core operating funding for the Reactome Knowledgebase of Human Biological Pathways and Processes. Reactome is a curated knowledgebase available online as an open access resource that can be freely used and redistributed by all members of the biological research community. It is used by geneticists, genomics researchers, clinical researchers and molecular biologists to interpret the results of high-throughput experimental studies, by bioinformaticians seeking to develop novel algorithms for mining knowledge from genomics studies, and by systems biologists building predictive models of normal and abnormal pathways.  Our curational system draws heavily on the expertise of independent investigators within the community who author precise machine-readable descriptions of human biological pathways under the guidance of a staff of dedicated curators. Each pathway is extensively checked and peer-reviewed prior to publication to ensure its factual accuracy and compliance with the data model. A system of evidence tracking ensures that all assertions are backed up by the primary literature, and that human molecular events inferred from orthologous ones in animal models have an auditable inference chain. Curated pathways described by Reactome currently cover roughly one quarter of the translated portion of the genome. We also offer a network of ""functional interactions"" (FIs) predicted by a conservative machine-learning approach, that covers an additional quarter of the translated genome, for a combined coverage of roughly 50% of the known genome.  Over the next five years, we seek to (1) increase the number of curated proteins and other functional entities to at least 10,500; (2) to supplement normal pathways with variant reactions for 1200 genes representing disease states; (3) increase the size of the Reactome Fl network to 15,000 molecules; and (4) enhance the web site and other resources to meet the needs of a growing and diverse user community.          RELEVANCE (See instructions):  Reactome represents one of a very small number of fully open access curated pathway databases. Its contents have contributed both directly and indirectly to large numbers of basic and translational research studies, and it supports a broad, diverse and engaged user community.

"SLASH: SCALABLE LARGE ANALYTIC SEGMENTATION HYBRID DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Advanced instrumentation and cellular imaging techniques using high-throughput 3D electron microscopy are driving a new revolution in the exploration of complex biological systems by providing near seamless views across multiple scales of resolution. These datasets provide the necessary breadth and depth to analyze multicellular, cellular, and subcelluar structure across large swathes of neural tissue. While these new imaging procedures are generating extremely large datasets of enormous value, the quantities are such that no single user or even laboratory team can possibly analyze the full content of their own imaging activities through traditional means. To address this challenge, we propose to further develop and refine a prototype hybrid system for high-throughput segmentation of large neuropil datasets that: 1) advances automatic algorithms for segmentation of cellular and sub-cellular structures using machine learning techniques; 2) couples these techniques to a scalable and flexible process or tool suite allowing multiple users to simultaneously review, edit and curate the results of these automatic approaches; and, 3) builds a knowledge base of training data guiding and improving automated processing. This system will allow project scientists to select areas of interest, execute automatic segmentation algorithms, and distribute workload, curate data, and deposit final results into the Cell Centered Database (Martone et al. 2008) via accessible web-interfaces. Emerging techniques in cellular and subcellular 3D imaging are generating datasets of enormous value to the study of disease processes and to the pursuit of greater insight into the structure and function of the nervous system. To unlock the potential of these data, new solutions are needed to improve the capability to segment and label the individual molecular, subcellular and cellular components within very large volumetric expanses.

To this end, he joined Dr. Stanley F. Nelson's laboratory as a Postdoctoral Fellow in Human Genetics at UCLA one year ago, in order to retrain in bioinformatics and sequencing. Kevin's background in machine learning gives him a good foundation for a career in bioinformatics. What he needs, and what obtaining this grant will give him, is a good background in basic biology, biochemistry, and genetics, in order to better understand the biological processes behind the data he is working with. Kevin explorations in genetics have inspired him to make his career in this field. He hopes to gain a much better understanding of biology in order to ask and answer research questions relevant to the biology of cancer using second (and later) generation sequencing and through the use and development of relevant tools and analysis. As part of the research development plan, Kevin will complete a didactic coursework component in the first 2 years, to fill in the gaps in biology and bioinformatics in his background. During and after that, his research will focus on giving him a better understanding the genetics of cancer, attempting to answer relevant research questions from high throughput genomic sequencing data, through the use and creation of sequence analysis tools and other bioinformatics tools.

"Integration and visualization of diverse biological data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Modern genome-scale experimental techniques enable for the first time in biological research the comprehensive monitoring of the entire molecular regulatory events leading to disease. Their integrative analyses hold the promise of generating specific, experimentally testable hypotheses, paving the way for a systems-level molecular view of complex disease. However, systems-level modeling of metazoan biology must address the challenges of: 1. biological complexity, including individual cell lineages and tissue types, 2. the increasingly large scale of data in higher organisms, and 3. the diversity of biomolecules and interaction mechanisms in the cell. The long-term goal of this research is to address these challenges through the development of bioinformatics frameworks for the study of gene function and regulation in complex biological systems thereby contributing to a greater understanding of human disease. In the initial funding period, we have developed accurate methods for integrating and visualizing diverse functional genomics data in S. cerevisiae and implemented them in interactive web-based systems for the biology community. Our methods have led to experimental discoveries of novel biology, are widely used by the yeast community, and are integrated with the SGD model organism database. We now propose to leverage our previous work to develop novel data integration and analysis methods and implement them in a public system for human data. In the proposed research period, we will create algorithms appropriate for integrating metazoan data in a tissue- and cell-lineage specific manner in health and disease. We will also develop novel hierarchical methods for predicting specific molecular interaction mechanisms and will extend our methods for integrating additional biomolecules. These methods will direct experiments focused on the glomerular kidney filter, a critical and complex component of the human vascular system whose dysfunction directly contributes to microvascular disease. Prediction of these cell-lineage specific functional networks will advance the understanding of the glomerulus function and its role in microvascular disease, leading to better clinical predictors, diagnoses, and treatments. From a technical perspective, application to glomerular biology will enable iterative improvement of the proposed methods based on experimental feedback. The end product of this research will be a general, robust, interactive, and automatically updated system for human data integration and analysis that will be freely available to the biomedical community. We will leverage parallel processing technologies (inspired by Google- type cloud computing solutions) to ensure interactive-analysis speed on the system. This system will allow biomedical researchers to synthesize, analyze, and visualize diverse data in human biology, enabling accurate predictions of biological networks and understanding their cell-lineage specificity and role in disease. Such integrative analyses will provide experimentally testable hypotheses, leading to a deeper understanding of complex disorders and paving the way to molecular-defined tissue targeted therapies and drug development.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Our general system will enable integrative analysis of human functional genomics data in a cell-lineage and disease-focused manner, allowing biomedical researchers to identify potential clinical biomarkers and to formulate specific hypotheses elucidating the cause and development of a variety of complex disorders. Our application of this system to generate cell-lineage specific functional networks will lead to a better understanding of the glomerulus function and will directly benefit human health through the development of improved predictors, diagnoses, and treatments for microvascular disease.

"BIGDATA: DA: Interpreting massive genomic data sets via summarization Genomic data is big and getting ever bigger, but current analysis methods will not scale to the analysis of thousands or millions of genomes.

Our approach leverages submodular summarization methods that have been developed for analyzing text corpora. We will apply these methods to five big data problems in genomics: 1) identifying functional elements characteristic o f a given human cell type; 2) identifying genomic features associated with a particular subclass of cancer; 3-4) identifying genomic variants representative of ancestrally or phenotypically defined human populations; and 5) finding a set of microbial genes that characterize a given site on the human body. This project will advance discovery and understanding on two fronts. First, we will develop novel methods for summarizing genomic, epigenomic and metagenomic data sets. Indeed, to our knowledge, this grant proposes the first application of summarization methods to genomic data of any kind. The proposed research will significantly advance our ability to apply submodularity to these summarization tasks, particularly with respect to identifying and creating a library of distance functions that have bee validated with respect to the five tasks outlined in the proposal. Second, we will apply our novel methods to problems of profound importance. Indeed, significant progress toward any one of our five tasks would represent an important advance in our scientific understanding of human history, biology or disease. The impact of this project will grow as the big data problem grows, even after the project is complete. The results of this project, both the software that we develop and the summaries that we produce, will be useful for answering a wide array of questions in any field that must cope with big data. Rapid advances in DNA sequencing technology have led to an explosion of genomic data. This data contains valuable knowledge about human biology and human disease, but few existing computational methods are designed to scale to the joint analysis of tens of thousands of human genomes.

"Ontology-Driven Methods for Knowledge Acquisition and Knowledge Discovery    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       A great challenge in the biomedical informatics domain is to develop computational methods that combine existing knowledge and experimental data to derive new knowledge regarding biological systems and disease mechanisms. Most knowledge regarding genes and proteins in biomedical literature is stored in the form of free text that is not suitable for computation, and the manual processes of encoding this body of knowledge into computable form cannot keep up with the rate of knowledge accumulation. The main thrust of the proposed research is to design novel statistical text-mining algorithms to acquire and represent knowledge regarding genes and proteins from free-text literature, and further to combine this acquired knowledge with experimental data to derive new knowledge. We will organize the proposed research to the following specific aims. Specific Aim 1. Develop ontology-guided semantic modeling algorithms for extracting biological concepts from free text, in which we will design hierarchical probabilistic topic models that are capable of representing biological concepts as a hierarchy and develop novel learning algorithms to infer biological concepts from free-text documents. Specific Aim 2. Integrate semantic modeling with BioNLP to extract textual evidence supporting protein-function annotations. We will develop information extraction algorithms that will combine the results of hierarchical semantic analysis and BioNLP to identify the text regions that will most likely provide evidence regarding the function of genes/proteins and map the extracted information to a controlled vocabulary. Specific Aim 3. Develop a framework to unify the procedures of knowledge reasoning and data mining for knowledge discovery. In this aim, we will reason using existing knowledge (represented in the form of an ontology) to reveal functional modules among the genes from the experimental data. We will then further develop algorithms that will reveal relationships between these gene modules by mining system-scaled experimental data. The overall framework will integrate functional reasoning and data mining in an iterative manner to refine the knowledge progressively and to derive rules such as: when genes involved in biological process X are perturbed, genes involved in biological process Y will respond. We will test the framework on the data from yeast-system biology studies and the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project to gain insights into the cellular systems and disease mechanisms of cancer cells.           In recent decades, biomedical sciences have achieved significant advances; most of the knowledge resulting from research is stored in the form of biomedical literature in the form free-text. This project develop computational approaches to extract knowledge from biomedical literature, represent the knowledge in computable form, and combined the knowledge with experiment data to gain insights into biological systems and disease mechanisms",Ontology-Driven Methods for Knowledge Acquisition and Knowledge Discovery,8535824,R01LM011155,"['Accounting', 'Achievement', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biomedical Research', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Controlled Vocabulary', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Knowledge acquisition', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Ontology', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Psyche structure', 'Research', 'Science', 'Semantics', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Training', 'Tweens', 'Yeasts', 'biological systems', 'biomedical informatics', 'cancer cell', 'data mining', 'design', 'insight', 'interest', 'knowledge of results', 'novel', 'protein function', 'protein protein interaction', 'research study', 'text searching']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2013,291730,-0.04820467146278634
"Genomic Database for the Yeast Saccharomyces    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of the Saccharomyces Genome Database (SGD) is to continue the development and implementation of a comprehensive resource containing curated information about the genome and its elements of the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. SGD will continue to annotate the genome, assimilate new data, include genomic information from other fungal species, and incorporate formalized and controlled vocabularies to represent biological concepts. We will continue to maintain and broaden relationships with the greater scientific community and make technical improvements through the development of tools and the use of third party tools that will allow us to better serve our users. The database and its associated resources will always remain publicly available without restriction from www.yeastgenome.org.  SGD will continue to provide the S. cerevisiae genome and its gene products culled from the published literature. New user interfaces and analysis resources will be developed for existing information as well as for new types of data, such as results from large scale genomic/proteomic analysis. These improvements will be developed using publicly available tools such as those available from the GMOD project. Query tools will be more enhanced to instantly direct users to the appropriate pages.  SGD has evolved into a substantial service organization, and will maintain its service to the scientific community, reaching out to all yeast researchers as well as scientists outside the fungal community to serve those who have a need for information about budding yeast genes, their products, and their functions. SGD will continue existing services while working to simplify the use and maintenance of our hardware and software environment through the application of new technologies. We will continue to collaborate with the yeast biology community to keep the database accurate and current, and to maintain consensus and order in the naming of genes and other generic elements.         Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a model forth understanding of chromosome maintenance, the cell cycle and cellular biology. S. cerevisiae is used for the development of new genomic and proteomic technologies. S. cerevisiae is the most well studied eukaryofic genome and the experimental literature for this yeast contains these results.

"New Physical Methodologies for Genomic Analysis     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite substantial efforts in developing sequencing technologies and computational software, spanning over 30 years, the full genome of any but the simplest organisms is still unable to automatically reconstructed. The length of the DNA sequences that can be 'read' by modern sequencing systems is substantially smaller than the length of most genomes (1000s of base-pairs versus millions to billions), making it virtually impossible to use the fragmented information generated by the shotgun sequencing process to reconstruct the long-range information linking together genomic segments belonging to a same chromosome. The main reason why genome assembly is difficult is genomic repeats - segments of DNA that occur in multiple identical or near-identical copies throughout a genome. Any repeats longer than the length of a sequencing read introduce ambiguity in the possible reconstructions of a genome - an exponential (in the number of repeats) number of different genomes can be constructed from the same set of reads, among which only one is the true reconstruction of the genome being assembled. Finding this one correct genome from among the many possible alternatives is impossible without the use of additional information, such as mate-pair information constraining the relative placement of pairs of shotgun reads along the genome. Mate-pair information is routinely generated in sequencing experiments and has been critical to scientists' ability to reconstruct genomes from shotgun data (e.g., mate-pair information was crucial to the success of the first prokaryotic genome project - Haemophilus influenza). Given these outstanding issues, a series of interlocking aims is proposed that center on enhanced optical and electronic detection of specially-decorated, genomic DNA molecules. The aims are designed for enabling new technologies that will provide sufficient physical map information to intimately mix with modern sequencing data for comprehensive assembly of complex genomes. These proposed advancements will be cradled within a new generation of nanofluidic devices engendering novel means for molecular control and detection. Such efforts will be directed by state-of-the art computer simulations that will model novel aspects of the new platforms for allowing rapid loops of design/implementation/testing. The main thrust of these technological developments will be carefully guided and serve a broad-based bioinformatics framework that will be developed for this work while laying the basis for highly integrated approaches to genome assembly and analysis.          Development of new machines and software is proposed, which will rapidly analyze a person's genome and reveal new types of information that doctors will be able to use for treating patients. The machines that will be developed are actually very small devices that may one day be sufficiently miniaturized to fit in a person's hand.

"Improved algorithms for macromolecular structure determination by cryo-EM and NMR    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Single-particle electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) and 2D NMR spectroscopy are methods for observing the three-dimensional structures of large and small macromolecules. respectively. We propose to develop and apply novel algorithms for solving the difficult mathematical problems posed by these techniques of structural biology. In cryo-EM the experimental data consist of noisy, random projection images of macromolecular ""particles"", and the problem is finding the 3D structure which is consistent with these images. Present reconstruction techniques rely on user input or ad hoc models to initiate a refinement cycle. We propose a new algorithm, ""globally consistent angular reconstitution"" (GCAR) that provides an unbiased and direct solution to the reconstruction problem. We further propose an extension to GCAR to handle heterogeneous particle populations. We also will pursue a powerful new approach to determining class averages, ""triplet class averaging"". This should allow GCAR to be used with data having very low signal-to-noise ratios, as is commonly obtained. The experimental data from NMR consist of estimates of local distances between atoms, and the goal is to find a globally consistent coordinate system. The same theory behind GCAR, involving the properties of sparse linear operators, can be applied to obtain a fast and direct solution to the distance geometry problem. We will develop and implement all of these algorithms and test them with experimental cryo-EM and NMR data.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Determining the structures of proteins and other large molecules is an essential step in the basic understanding of biological processes, as well as the first step in rational drug design. We propose to develop new, faster and more reliable computer algorithms to increase the power of two structure-determination methods, cryo-EM and NMR.

"Machine learning methods to increase genomic accessibility by next-gen sequencing     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): DNA sequencing has become an indispensable tool in many areas of biology and medicine. Recent techno- logical breakthroughs in next-generation sequencing (NGS) have made it possible to sequence billions of bases quickly and cheaply. A number of NGS-based tools have been created, including ChIP-seq, RNA-seq, Methyl- seq and exon/whole-genome sequencing, enabling a fundamentally new way of studying diseases, genomes and epigenomes. The widespread use of NGS-based methods calls for better and more efficient tools for the analysis and interpretation of the NGS high-throughput data. Although a number of computational tools have been devel- oped, they are insufficient in mapping and studying genome features located within repeat, duplicated and other so-called unmappable regions of genomes. In this project, computational algorithms and software that expand genomic accessibility of NGS to these previously understudied regions will be developed.  The algorithms will begin with a new way of mapping raw reads from NGS to the reference genome, followed by a machine learning method to resolve ambiguously mapped reads, and will be integrated into a comprehen- sive analysis pipeline for ChIP-seq. More specifically, the three aims of the research are to develop: (1) Data structures and efficient algorithms for read mapping to rapidly identify all mapping locations. Unlike existing methods, the focus of this research is to rapidly identify all candidate locations of each read, instead of one or only a few locations. (2) Machine learning algorithms for read analysis to resolve ambiguously mapped reads for both ChIP-seq analysis and genetic variation detection. This work will develop probabilistic models to resolve ambiguously mapped reads by pooling information from the entire collection of reads. (3) A comprehensive ChIP- seq analysis pipeline to systematically study genomic features located within unmappable regions of genomes. These algorithms will be tested and refined using both publicly available data and data from established wet-lab collaborators.  In addition to discovering new genomic features located within repeat, duplicated or other previously unac- cessible regions, this work will provide the NGS community with (a) a faster and more accurate tool for mapping short sequence reads, (b) a general methodology for expanding genomic accessibility of NGS, and (c) a versatile, modular, open-source toolbox of algorithms for NGS data analysis, (d) a comprehensive analysis of protein-DNA interactions in repeat regions in all publicly available ChIP-seq datasets.  This work is a close collaboration between computer scientists and web-lab biologists who are developing NGS assays to study biomedical problems. In particular, we will collaborate with Timothy Osborne of Sanford- Burnham Medical Research Institute to study regulators involved in cholesterol and fatty acid metabolism, with Kyoko Yokomori of UC Irvine to study Cohesin, Nipbl and their roles in Cornelia de Lange syndrome, and Ken Cho of UC Irvine to study the roles of FoxH1 and Schnurri in development and growth control.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: DNA-sequencing has become an indispensable tool for basic biomedical research as well as for discovering new treatments and helping biomedical researchers understand disease mechanisms. Next-generation sequencing, which enables rapid generation of billions of bases at relatively low cost, poses a significant computational challenge on how to analyze the large amount of sequence data efficiently and accurately. The goal of this research is to develop open-source software to improve both the efficiency and accuracy of the next-generation sequencing analysis tools, and thereby allowing biomedical researchers to take full advantage of next-generation sequencing to study biology and disease.              DNA-sequencing has become an indispensable tool for basic biomedical research as well as for discovering new treatments and helping biomedical researchers understand disease mechanisms.

"ISMB 2012 Conference Support for Students & Young Scientists     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The 2012 Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology (ISMB) conference in will be held in Long Beach, California, with 1,500-1,700 attendees, including 33-38% students/post doctoral researchers. ISMB brings together graduate students, post doctoral researchers, faculty, research staff and senior scientists of many different nationalities, all of whom are studying or working in computer science, molecular biology, mathematics or statistics. The conference brings biologists and computational scientists together to focus on research centered on actual biological problems rather than simply theoretical calculations. The combined focus on ""intelligent systems"" and actual biological data makes ISMB a highly relevant meeting, and many years of producing the event has resulted in a professionally organized and respected annual conference. The ISMB conference presents the latest research methods and results developed through the application of computer programming to the study of biological sciences, including advances in sequencing genomes that may lead to a better understanding of how, for instance, cells interact for the treatment of diseases such as cancer. Presentations may describe methods and advances associated with the analysis of existing biological literature, including benchmarking experiments, to create a better public understanding of scientific research reports. Overall, ISMB serves to educate attendees on the latest developments that will further drive the research methods and results of the field of computational biology. Students and scientists are able to return to their labs to appy what they have learned as they advance their own research efforts or begin investigating new areas they were exposed to as a result of attending ISMB. The scientific program for each ISMB meeting includes parallel presentation tracks of original research papers, highlights of recently published papers, special sessions focused on emerging topics, technology demos, late breaking research and poster presentations, an art in science exhibition, tutorial workshops, special interest group meetings and a student symposium organized by and for students. For ISMB 2011, 258 original research papers were submitted and 48 selected for the Proceedings Track, while 88 previously published papers were submitted and 38 selected for the Highlights Track. In all, over 225 talks were presented during the course of the 2011 conference, and similar numbers are anticipated for 2012. In all cases, submissions are rigorously reviewed, typically by three members of each track's committee before approval by the track chair, insuring the highest possible quality of work is presented. The specific areas represented in the conference vary each year depending on the areas that researchers find most interesting and innovative, and therefore submit as papers and proposals. This proposal seeks funding to assist students and junior researchers in attending the conference, thus exposing them to the latest research of their own areas as well as areas that may be new to them.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Bioinformatics is well established as an essential tool for understanding biological systems, largely driven by genomic sequence efforts due to the usefulness of genomic data in the quest to develop new and improved treatments for and prevention of disease is highly dependent on one's ability to electronically access and manipulate it.

"Informatics Tools for High-Throughput Sequences Data Analysis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) is a suite of best-in-class, widely-used, well-supported, open-source tools for processing and analysis of next-generation DNA sequencing (NGS) data. These tools currently  include a multiple sequence realigner, a covariate-correcting base quality score recalibrator, multi-sample  SNP, INDEL, and CNV genotypers, machine learning algorithms for false positive identification, variant  evaluation modules, somatic SNP and indel callers, and hundreds of other tools. Underlying all of these tools is our structured programming framework (GATK-Engine) that uses the functional programming philosophy of MapReduce to make writing feature-rich, efficient and robust analysis tools easy. By centralizing common data management infrastructure, all GATK-based tools benefit from the engine's correctness, CPU and memory efficiency, as well as automatic distributed and shared memory parallelization, essential capabilities given the massive and growing size of NGS datasets. The GATK currently supports all of the major sequencing technologies including lllumina.

"Annotating Functional Sites in 3D Biological Structures    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Project Summary/Abstract Dramatic advances in our understanding of molecular structure and function promise to accelerate the creation of new diagnostics and therapeutics. However the link between the structure of a biological macromolecule and its function is usually not obvious: fundamental to understanding how a molecule functions is an understanding of how its structure behaves over time. Recent advances in molecular dynamics simulations now allow the rapid collection of information about structural motion. These data sets are huge, and require statistical machine learning algorithms to characterize and recognize patterns relevant to function. The National Library of Medicine's new long-range plan calls for research in the use of advanced simulation and machine learning algorithms in support of biomedical research.       This proposal focuses on annotating molecular structures with missing or incomplete functional information. We are particularly interested in identifying binding sites and active sites in proteins. We bring together simulation and machine learning, and hypothesize that the performance of structure- based function annotation methods will dramatically improve with the addition of information about dynamics. Thus, our specific aims are (1) to develop methods for recognizing function from structural dynamics and diversity, (2) to develop capabilities for large scale clustering and analysis tools for the discovery of novel functions, and (3) to apply our tools to challenging and important biological systems, while disseminating our software, data and capabilities to the biomedical research community. In particular, we will focus our new capabilities on three difficult function annotation challenges: ATP binding sites, phosphorylation sites, and metabolizing enzyme active sites.            Project Narrative The explosion in data related to molecular biology has created great opportunities for new disease diagnostics and therapies. One source of data is the three-dimensional (3D) structure of biological molecules such as proteins, DNA and RNA. This work focuses on using computational technologies to understand how these structures perform their function, so we have a better understanding of both normal and disease processes.",Annotating Functional Sites in 3D Biological Structures,8324017,R01LM005652,"['Active Sites', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Automobile Driving', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Research', 'Calcium Binding', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Crystallography', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Drug Binding Site', 'Environment', 'Enzymes', 'Explosion', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genomics', 'Grant', 'High Performance Computing', 'Human', 'Informatics', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Korea', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Medicine', 'Molecular Structure', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Pathologic', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphorylation', 'Phosphorylation Site', 'Physics', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Retrieval', 'San Francisco', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Software Engineering', 'Source', 'Source Code', 'Specialist', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'United States National Library of Medicine', 'Universities', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'advanced simulation', 'base', 'biological systems', 'cost', 'data reduction', 'design', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'interest', 'macromolecule', 'molecular dynamics', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel therapeutics', 'programs', 'protein function', 'protein structure', 'simulation', 'simulation software', 'structural genomics', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool']",NLM,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2012,314573,-0.021366985192433772
"HyPhy: Molecular Evolutionary Analyses    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Project Description HyPhy (http://www.hyphy.org) is a scriptable software platform designed to enable flexible and powerful analyses of DNA, RNA, codon, amino acid and other types of sequence data in an evolutionary context. Such analyses have become an indispensable component of most research studies that make use of comparative genomic data. Biologists and bioinformaticians increasingly recognize the benefits of molecular evolutionary analyses. Since its initial release in 2001, HyPhy has become a relatively stable and mature product, and has been downloaded by more than 4,500 unique users, integrated into several popular web-based genomic data analysis servers, cited in over 400 peer-reviewed publications and described in three book chapters, in spite of the fact that the development of the package has never been directly funded. This proposal seeks support to improve the quality, performance, reliability, modularity, documentation and feature sets of the HyPhy system. Specific aims can be divided into four major areas: 1. Software engineering, testing, and documentation of the HyPhy codebase. 2. The development of a high-performance engine for phylogenetic maximum likelihood model fitting and inference. 3. Extension of a newly-initiated toolbox for machine learning applications in molecular evolution. 4. Creation and maintenance of a wiki-themed documentation resource.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Project Narrative Molecular evolutionary analyses are central to many aspects of basic, translational, and applied biomedical research. Examples include identifying gene mutations that allow pathogens to evade the immune response; prediction of the structure and function of proteins; estimating the evolutionary relatedness of human or other populations; characterizing the magnitude of selective pressure, either natural or artificial, on genes or species.

"The Crystallography of Macromolecules    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposal ""The Crystallography of Macromolecules"" addresses the limitations of diffraction data analysis methods in the field of X-ray crystallography. The significance of this work is determined by the importance of the technique, which generates uniquely-detailed information about cellular processes at the atomic level. The structural results obtained with crystallography are used to explain and validate results obtain by other biophysical, biochemical and cell biology techniques, to generate hypotheses for detailed studies of cellular process and to guide drug design studies - all of which are highly relevant to NIH mission. The proposal focuses on method development to address a frequent situation, where the crystal size and order is insufficient to obtain a structure from a single crystal. This is particularly frequent in cases of large eukaryotic complexes and membrane proteins, where the structural information is the most valuable to the NIH mission. The diffraction power of a single crystal is directly related to the microscopic order and size of that specimen. It is also one of the main correlates of structure solution success. The method used to solve the problem of data insufficiency in the case of a single crystal is to use multiple crystals and to average data between them, which allows to retrieve even very low signals. However, different crystals of the same protein, even if they are very similar i.e. have the same crystal lattice symmetry and very similar unit cell dimensions, still are characterized by a somewhat different order. This non-isomorphism is often high enough to make their solution with averaged data impossible. Moreover, the use of multiple data sets complicates decision making as each of the datasets contains different information and it is not clear when and how to combine them. The proposed solution relies on hierarchical analysis. First, the shape of the diffraction spot profiles will be modeled using a novel approach (Aim 1). This will form the ground for the next step, in which deconvolution of overlapping Bragg spot profiles from multiple lattices will be achieved (Aim 2). An additional benefit of algorithms developed in Aim 1 is that they will automatically derive the integration parameters and identify artifacts, making the whole process more robust. This is particularly significant for high-throughput and multiple crystal analysis. In Aim 3, comparison of data from multiple crystals will be performed to identify subsets of data that should be merged to produce optimal results. The critical aspect of this analysis will be the identification and assessment of non- isomorphism between datasets. The experimental decision-making strategy is the subject of Aim 4. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) method will be used to evaluate the suitability of available datasets for possible methods of structure solution. In cases of insufficient data it will identify the most significant factor that needs to be improved. Aim 5 is to simplify navigation of data reduction and to integrate the results of previous aims with other improvements in hardware and computing.        The goal of the proposal is to develop methods for analysis of X-ray diffraction data with a particular focus on the novel analysis of diffraction spot shape and the streamlining of data analysis in multi-crystal modes. The development of such methods is essential to advance structural studies in thousands of projects, which individually are important for NIH mission.

"Reactome: An Open Knowledgebase of Human Pathways     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We seek renewal of the core operating funding for the Reactome Knowledgebase of Human Biological Pathways and Processes. Reactome is a curated knowledgebase available online as an open access resource that can be freely used and redistributed by all members of the biological research community. It is used by geneticists, genomics researchers, clinical researchers and molecular biologists to interpret the results of high-throughput experimental studies, by bioinformaticians seeking to develop novel algorithms for mining knowledge from genomics studies, and by systems biologists building predictive models of normal and abnormal pathways.  Our curational system draws heavily on the expertise of independent investigators within the community who author precise machine-readable descriptions of human biological pathways under the guidance of a staff of dedicated curators. Each pathway is extensively checked and peer-reviewed prior to publication to ensure its factual accuracy and compliance with the data model. A system of evidence tracking ensures that all assertions are backed up by the primary literature, and that human molecular events inferred from orthologous ones in animal models have an auditable inference chain. Curated pathways described by Reactome currently cover roughly one quarter of the translated portion of the genome. We also offer a network of ""functional interactions"" (FIs) predicted by a conservative machine-learning approach, that covers an additional quarter of the translated genome, for a combined coverage of roughly 50% of the known genome.  Over the next five years, we seek to (1) increase the number of curated proteins and other functional entities to at least 10,500; (2) to supplement normal pathways with variant reactions for 1200 genes representing disease states; (3) increase the size of the Reactome Fl network to 15,000 molecules; and (4) enhance the web site and other resources to meet the needs of a growing and diverse user community.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: RELEVANCE (See instructions):  Reactome represents one of a very small number of fully open access curated pathway databases.

"Position Sensitive P-Mer Frequency Clustering with Applications to Classification    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Position Sensitive P-Mer Frequency Clustering with  Applications to Classification and Differentiation Recent genomic sequencing advances, such as next generation sequencing, and projects like the Human Microbiome Project create extremely large genomic databases. Even though the length of any specific sequence may be much shorter than that of the complete DNA sequence of an organism, looking at enormous libraries of sequences, such as 16S rRNA, presents an equally (if not greater) computational challenge. In traditional genomic analysis, only one sequence may be analyzed at a time. When dealing with metagenomics, thousands (or more) sequences need to be analyzed at the same time. However, to study such problems as environmental biological diversity and human microbiome diversity this is exactly what is needed. Current techniques have several shortcomings which need to be addressed. Techniques involving sequence alignment are typically based on selection of one representative sequence (as is typically done when looking at 16S rRNA data) which introduces selection bias. Genomic databases involving multiple copies of 16S per organism across thousands of organisms, will soon grow too large to practically process just using computationally expensive alignment methods to match sequences, but faster alignment-free methods currently do not provide the needed accuracy and sensitivity. As a complement to existing methods we introduce a novel class of fast high-throughput algorithms based on quasi-alignment using position specific p-mer frequency clustering. Organisms are represented by a directed graph structure that summarizes the ordering between clusters of p-mer frequency histograms at different positions in sequences. This model can be learned using all available 16S copies of an organism and thus eliminates selection bias. Due to the added position information, these algorithms can be used for species (and even strain) classification facilitating the study of strain diversity within species. Our prototype implementation of this new technique shows that it is able to produce compact profiles which can be efficiently stored and used for large scale classification and differentiation down to the strain level. Since the technique incorporates high-throughput data stream clustering, a proven technique in high performance computing, it scales well for very large scale DNA/RNA sequence data as well as massive sets of short sequence snippets collected during metagenomic research. In this project we will develop a suite of tools, profile models, and scoring techniques to model RNA/DNA sequences providing applications of organism classification, and intra/inter-organism similarity/diversity. Our approach provides both the specificity needed to perform strain classification and still avoid the computational overhead of alignment. It is important to note that this is accomplished through dynamic online machine learning techniques without human intervention.           Recent advances in Metagenomics and the Human Microbiome provide a complex landscape for dealing with a multitude of genomes all at once. One of the many challenges in this field is classification of the genomes present in the sample. Effective metagenomic classification and diversity analysis require complex representations of taxa. The significance of our research is that we develop a suite of tools, based on novel alignment free techniques that will be applied to environmental metagenomics samples as well as human microbiome samples. Providing such methods to rapidly classify organisms using our new approach on a laptop computer instead of several multi-processor servers will facilitate the rapid development of microbiome-based health screening in the near future.

"SLASH: SCALABLE LARGE ANALYTIC SEGMENTATION HYBRID DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Advanced instrumentation and cellular imaging techniques using high-throughput 3D electron microscopy are driving a new revolution in the exploration of complex biological systems by providing near seamless views across multiple scales of resolution. These datasets provide the necessary breadth and depth to analyze multicellular, cellular, and subcelluar structure across large swathes of neural tissue. While these new imaging procedures are generating extremely large datasets of enormous value, the quantities are such that no single user or even laboratory team can possibly analyze the full content of their own imaging activities through traditional means. To address this challenge, we propose to further develop and refine a prototype hybrid system for high-throughput segmentation of large neuropil datasets that: 1) advances automatic algorithms for segmentation of cellular and sub-cellular structures using machine learning techniques; 2) couples these techniques to a scalable and flexible process or tool suite allowing multiple users to simultaneously review, edit and curate the results of these automatic approaches; and, 3) builds a knowledge base of training data guiding and improving automated processing. This system will allow project scientists to select areas of interest, execute automatic segmentation algorithms, and distribute workload, curate data, and deposit final results into the Cell Centered Database (Martone et al. 2008) via accessible web-interfaces. Emerging techniques in cellular and subcellular 3D imaging are generating datasets of enormous value to the study of disease processes and to the pursuit of greater insight into the structure and function of the nervous system. To unlock the potential of these data, new solutions are needed to improve the capability to segment and label the individual molecular, subcellular and cellular components within very large volumetric expanses.

"Pattern Discovery for comparative epigenomics    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose a training program that will prepare an effective independent investigator in computational genomics. The candidate has a PhD in biology from the University of Cambridge and will extend his skills in both computational and wet-lab methods through a two-year program of organized mentorship and training, and a structured five-year research program.  This program will promote the command of machine learning as applied to functional genomics data. Dr. William Noble will mentor the candidate's scientific development. Dr. Noble is a recognized leader in computational biology and machine learning. He holds a dual appointment as Associate Professor in Genome Sciences and Com- puter Science and Engineering, and has trained numerous postdoctoral fellows and graduate students. Dr. Jeff Bilmes, Associate Professor of Electrical Engineering, will contribute to the mentoring effort, and a committee of experienced genome and computational biologists will advise on science and the candidate's career goals.  Research will focus on the analysis of multiple tracks of data from high-throughput sequencing assays, such as the ChIP-seq data produced by the ENCODE Project. These experiments allow us to obtain a more complete picture of the structure of human chromatin, revealing the behavior of transcription factors, the organization of epigenetic modifications, and the locations of accessible DNA across the entire genome at up to single-base resolution. A current challenge is to discover joint patterns across multiple tracks of these functional genomics results simultaneously. This project will (1) develop computational methods for identifying such patterns, providing new ways of finding both well-understood genomic features and novel functional elements, (2) apply those methods to characterize the similarities and differences among different biological samples, establishing a better understanding of chromatin, the bounds of its variation, and its role in human disease, and (3) validate computational findings with laboratory experiments. The project will use a dynamic Bayesian network (DBN), a type of probabilistic graphical model, to represent the statistical dependencies between observed data, such as sequencing tag density, on an inferred hidden state sequence.  The Department of Genome Sciences of the University Of Washington School Of Medicine provides an ideal setting for training a new independent investigator with an extensive program of formal and informal education for postdoctoral scientists, opportunities for collaboration with researchers with expertise in diverse areas, and modern computational and laboratory resources. This environment maximizes the potential for the candidate to obtain the training and perform the research necessary to establish himself as a skilled investigator with an independent research program.         The major outcome of this work will be a trained scientist with the skills to run an independent research pro- gram integrating computational methods and genome biology.

"Statistical Models and Inference in the Single-Molecule Approach to Biology DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The rapid advance of nanotechnology has generated much excitement in the scientific and engineering community. Its application to the biological front created the new area of single-molecule biology: Scientists were able to investigate biological processes on a molecule-by-molecule basis, opening the door to addressing many problems that were inaccessible just a few decades ago. The new frontier also raises many statistical challenges, calling upon an urgent need for new statistical inference tools and new stochastic models because of the stochastic nature of single-molecule experiments and because many classical models derived from oversimplified assumptions are no longer valid for single-molecule experiments. The current proposal focuses on the statistical challenges in the single-molecule approach to biology. The proposed research consists of three projects: (1) Using stochastic networks to model enzymatic reaction kinetics. The goal is to provide models not only biologically meaningful, but also capable of explaining the recent single-molecule experimental discoveries that contradict the classical Michaelis-Menten model. (2) Using the kernel method to infer biochemical properties from doubly stochastic Poisson process data, in particular, photon arrival data from single-molecule experiments. The goal is to develop nonparametric inference tools to recover the dependence structure, such as the autocorrelation function, from the doubly stochastic Poisson data. (3) Using bootstrap moment estimates to infer the helical diffusion of DNA-binding proteins. The goal is to elucidate how DNA-binding proteins interact with DNA, and estimate the associated energy landscape. The proposed research aims to provide essential statistical models and inference tools to study biological processes at the single-molecule level and to advance significantly our understanding of how important biological processes such as enzymatic reactions and protein-DNA interactions actually occur in our cells. The single-molecule approach to biology presents many opportunities for interdisciplinary research, calling upon collective efforts from mathematical, biological and physical scientists. The proposed research seeks to meet a high academic standard and aims to reach out to the general scientific community to collaborate and cross-fertilize the interdisciplinary field. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to human health because both enzymatic reactions and protein-DNA interactions play fundamental roles in the healthy function of our cells. For example, deficiency of the beta- galactosidase, an enzyme studied in the proposal, can result in galactosialidosis or Morquio B syndrome; the misfunction of hOgg1, a DNA-repair protein studied in this proposal, can result in harmful genetic mutations.",Statistical Models and Inference in the Single-Molecule Approach to Biology,8280335,R01GM090202,"['Address', 'Area', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Reaction', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Cells', 'Communities', 'DNA', 'DNA repair protein', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'DNA-Protein Interaction', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Diffusion', 'Educational Activities', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Engineering', 'Enzymes', 'Gangliosidosis GM1', 'Gene Mutation', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Kinetics', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Nanotechnology', 'Nature', 'Photons', 'Play', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Property', 'Research', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Syndrome', 'Training', 'base', 'career', 'computerized data processing', 'frontier', 'graduate student', 'meetings', 'research study', 'single molecule', 'statistics', 'tool']",NIGMS,HARVARD UNIVERSITY,R01,2012,288150,-0.016052104331403184
"Integration and visualization of diverse biological data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Modern genome-scale experimental techniques enable for the first time in biological research the comprehensive monitoring of the entire molecular regulatory events leading to disease. Their integrative analyses hold the promise of generating specific, experimentally testable hypotheses, paving the way for a systems-level molecular view of complex disease. However, systems-level modeling of metazoan biology must address the challenges of: 1. biological complexity, including individual cell lineages and tissue types, 2. the increasingly large scale of data in higher organisms, and 3. the diversity of biomolecules and interaction mechanisms in the cell. The long-term goal of this research is to address these challenges through the development of bioinformatics frameworks for the study of gene function and regulation in complex biological systems thereby contributing to a greater understanding of human disease. In the initial funding period, we have developed accurate methods for integrating and visualizing diverse functional genomics data in S. cerevisiae and implemented them in interactive web-based systems for the biology community. Our methods have led to experimental discoveries of novel biology, are widely used by the yeast community, and are integrated with the SGD model organism database. We now propose to leverage our previous work to develop novel data integration and analysis methods and implement them in a public system for human data. In the proposed research period, we will create algorithms appropriate for integrating metazoan data in a tissue- and cell-lineage specific manner in health and disease. We will also develop novel hierarchical methods for predicting specific molecular interaction mechanisms and will extend our methods for integrating additional biomolecules. These methods will direct experiments focused on the glomerular kidney filter, a critical and complex component of the human vascular system whose dysfunction directly contributes to microvascular disease. Prediction of these cell-lineage specific functional networks will advance the understanding of the glomerulus function and its role in microvascular disease, leading to better clinical predictors, diagnoses, and treatments. From a technical perspective, application to glomerular biology will enable iterative improvement of the proposed methods based on experimental feedback. The end product of this research will be a general, robust, interactive, and automatically updated system for human data integration and analysis that will be freely available to the biomedical community. We will leverage parallel processing technologies (inspired by Google- type cloud computing solutions) to ensure interactive-analysis speed on the system. This system will allow biomedical researchers to synthesize, analyze, and visualize diverse data in human biology, enabling accurate predictions of biological networks and understanding their cell-lineage specificity and role in disease.

"Ontology-Driven Methods for Knowledge Acquisition and Knowledge Discovery    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       A great challenge in the biomedical informatics domain is to develop computational methods that combine existing knowledge and experimental data to derive new knowledge regarding biological systems and disease mechanisms. Most knowledge regarding genes and proteins in biomedical literature is stored in the form of free text that is not suitable for computation, and the manual processes of encoding this body of knowledge into computable form cannot keep up with the rate of knowledge accumulation. The main thrust of the proposed research is to design novel statistical text-mining algorithms to acquire and represent knowledge regarding genes and proteins from free-text literature, and further to combine this acquired knowledge with experimental data to derive new knowledge. We will organize the proposed research to the following specific aims. Specific Aim 1. Develop ontology-guided semantic modeling algorithms for extracting biological concepts from free text, in which we will design hierarchical probabilistic topic models that are capable of representing biological concepts as a hierarchy and develop novel learning algorithms to infer biological concepts from free-text documents. Specific Aim 2. Integrate semantic modeling with BioNLP to extract textual evidence supporting protein-function annotations. We will develop information extraction algorithms that will combine the results of hierarchical semantic analysis and BioNLP to identify the text regions that will most likely provide evidence regarding the function of genes/proteins and map the extracted information to a controlled vocabulary. Specific Aim 3. Develop a framework to unify the procedures of knowledge reasoning and data mining for knowledge discovery. In this aim, we will reason using existing knowledge (represented in the form of an ontology) to reveal functional modules among the genes from the experimental data. We will then further develop algorithms that will reveal relationships between these gene modules by mining system-scaled experimental data. The overall framework will integrate functional reasoning and data mining in an iterative manner to refine the knowledge progressively and to derive rules such as: when genes involved in biological process X are perturbed, genes involved in biological process Y will respond. We will test the framework on the data from yeast-system biology studies and the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project to gain insights into the cellular systems and disease mechanisms of cancer cells.           In recent decades, biomedical sciences have achieved significant advances; most of the knowledge resulting from research is stored in the form of biomedical literature in the form free-text.

"Improved algorithms for macromolecular structure determination by cryo-EM and NMR    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Single-particle electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) and 2D NMR spectroscopy are methods for observing the three-dimensional structures of large and small macromolecules. respectively. We propose to develop and apply novel algorithms for solving the difficult mathematical problems posed by these techniques of structural biology. In cryo-EM the experimental data consist of noisy, random projection images of macromolecular ""particles"", and the problem is finding the 3D structure which is consistent with these images. Present reconstruction techniques rely on user input or ad hoc models to initiate a refinement cycle. We propose a new algorithm, ""globally consistent angular reconstitution"" (GCAR) that provides an unbiased and direct solution to the reconstruction problem. We further propose an extension to GCAR to handle heterogeneous particle populations. We also will pursue a powerful new approach to determining class averages, ""triplet class averaging"". This should allow GCAR to be used with data having very low signal-to-noise ratios, as is commonly obtained. The experimental data from NMR consist of estimates of local distances between atoms, and the goal is to find a globally consistent coordinate system. The same theory behind GCAR, involving the properties of sparse linear operators, can be applied to obtain a fast and direct solution to the distance geometry problem. We will develop and implement all of these algorithms and test them with experimental cryo-EM and NMR data.

"New Physical Methodologies for Genomic Analysis     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite substantial efforts in developing sequencing technologies and computational software, spanning over 30 years, the full genome of any but the simplest organisms is still unable to automatically reconstructed. The length of the DNA sequences that can be 'read' by modern sequencing systems is substantially smaller than the length of most genomes (1000s of base-pairs versus millions to billions), making it virtually impossible to use the fragmented information generated by the shotgun sequencing process to reconstruct the long-range information linking together genomic segments belonging to a same chromosome. The main reason why genome assembly is difficult is genomic repeats - segments of DNA that occur in multiple identical or near-identical copies throughout a genome. Any repeats longer than the length of a sequencing read introduce ambiguity in the possible reconstructions of a genome - an exponential (in the number of repeats) number of different genomes can be constructed from the same set of reads, among which only one is the true reconstruction of the genome being assembled. Finding this one correct genome from among the many possible alternatives is impossible without the use of additional information, such as mate-pair information constraining the relative placement of pairs of shotgun reads along the genome. Mate-pair information is routinely generated in sequencing experiments and has been critical to scientists' ability to reconstruct genomes from shotgun data (e.g., mate-pair information was crucial to the success of the first prokaryotic genome project - Haemophilus influenza). Given these outstanding issues, a series of interlocking aims is proposed that center on enhanced optical and electronic detection of specially-decorated, genomic DNA molecules. The aims are designed for enabling new technologies that will provide sufficient physical map information to intimately mix with modern sequencing data for comprehensive assembly of complex genomes. These proposed advancements will be cradled within a new generation of nanofluidic devices engendering novel means for molecular control and detection. Such efforts will be directed by state-of-the art computer simulations that will model novel aspects of the new platforms for allowing rapid loops of design/implementation/testing. The main thrust of these technological developments will be carefully guided and serve a broad-based bioinformatics framework that will be developed for this work while laying the basis for highly integrated approaches to genome assembly and analysis.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Development of new machines and software is proposed, which will rapidly analyze a person's genome and reveal new types of information that doctors will be able to use for treating patients.

"Annotating Functional Sites in 3D Biological Structures    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Project Summary/Abstract Dramatic advances in our understanding of molecular structure and function promise to accelerate the creation of new diagnostics and therapeutics. However the link between the structure of a biological macromolecule and its function is usually not obvious: fundamental to understanding how a molecule functions is an understanding of how its structure behaves over time. Recent advances in molecular dynamics simulations now allow the rapid collection of information about structural motion. These data sets are huge, and require statistical machine learning algorithms to characterize and recognize patterns relevant to function. The National Library of Medicine's new long-range plan calls for research in the use of advanced simulation and machine learning algorithms in support of biomedical research.       This proposal focuses on annotating molecular structures with missing or incomplete functional information. We are particularly interested in identifying binding sites and active sites in proteins. We bring together simulation and machine learning, and hypothesize that the performance of structure- based function annotation methods will dramatically improve with the addition of information about dynamics. Thus, our specific aims are (1) to develop methods for recognizing function from structural dynamics and diversity, (2) to develop capabilities for large scale clustering and analysis tools for the discovery of novel functions, and (3) to apply our tools to challenging and important biological systems, while disseminating our software, data and capabilities to the biomedical research community. In particular, we will focus our new capabilities on three difficult function annotation challenges: ATP binding sites, phosphorylation sites, and metabolizing enzyme active sites.            Project Narrative The explosion in data related to molecular biology has created great opportunities for new disease diagnostics and therapies.

"HyPhy: Molecular Evolutionary Analyses    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Project Description HyPhy (http://www.hyphy.org) is a scriptable software platform designed to enable flexible and powerful analyses of DNA, RNA, codon, amino acid and other types of sequence data in an evolutionary context. Such analyses have become an indispensable component of most research studies that make use of comparative genomic data.

"The Crystallography of Macromolecules    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposal ""The Crystallography of Macromolecules"" addresses the limitations of diffraction data analysis methods in the field of X-ray crystallography. The significance of this work is determined by the importance of the technique, which generates uniquely-detailed information about cellular processes at the atomic level. The structural results obtained with crystallography are used to explain and validate results obtain by other biophysical, biochemical and cell biology techniques, to generate hypotheses for detailed studies of cellular process and to guide drug design studies - all of which are highly relevant to NIH mission. The proposal focuses on method development to address a frequent situation, where the crystal size and order is insufficient to obtain a structure from a single crystal. This is particularly frequent in cases of large eukaryotic complexes and membrane proteins, where the structural information is the most valuable to the NIH mission. The diffraction power of a single crystal is directly related to the microscopic order and size of that specimen. It is also one of the main correlates of structure solution success. The method used to solve the problem of data insufficiency in the case of a single crystal is to use multiple crystals and to average data between them, which allows to retrieve even very low signals. However, different crystals of the same protein, even if they are very similar i.e. have the same crystal lattice symmetry and very similar unit cell dimensions, still are characterized by a somewhat different order. This non-isomorphism is often high enough to make their solution with averaged data impossible. Moreover, the use of multiple data sets complicates decision making as each of the datasets contains different information and it is not clear when and how to combine them. The proposed solution relies on hierarchical analysis. First, the shape of the diffraction spot profiles will be modeled using a novel approach (Aim 1). This will form the ground for the next step, in which deconvolution of overlapping Bragg spot profiles from multiple lattices will be achieved (Aim 2). An additional benefit of algorithms developed in Aim 1 is that they will automatically derive the integration parameters and identify artifacts, making the whole process more robust. This is particularly significant for high-throughput and multiple crystal analysis. In Aim 3, comparison of data from multiple crystals will be performed to identify subsets of data that should be merged to produce optimal results. The critical aspect of this analysis will be the identification and assessment of non- isomorphism between datasets. The experimental decision-making strategy is the subject of Aim 4. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) method will be used to evaluate the suitability of available datasets for possible methods of structure solution. In cases of insufficient data it will identify the most significant factor that needs to be improved.

"Position Sensitive P-Mer Frequency Clustering with Applications to Classification    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Position Sensitive P-Mer Frequency Clustering with  Applications to Classification and Differentiation Recent genomic sequencing advances, such as next generation sequencing, and projects like the Human Microbiome Project create extremely large genomic databases. Even though the length of any specific sequence may be much shorter than that of the complete DNA sequence of an organism, looking at enormous libraries of sequences, such as 16S rRNA, presents an equally (if not greater) computational challenge. In traditional genomic analysis, only one sequence may be analyzed at a time. When dealing with metagenomics, thousands (or more) sequences need to be analyzed at the same time. However, to study such problems as environmental biological diversity and human microbiome diversity this is exactly what is needed. Current techniques have several shortcomings which need to be addressed. Techniques involving sequence alignment are typically based on selection of one representative sequence (as is typically done when looking at 16S rRNA data) which introduces selection bias. Genomic databases involving multiple copies of 16S per organism across thousands of organisms, will soon grow too large to practically process just using computationally expensive alignment methods to match sequences, but faster alignment-free methods currently do not provide the needed accuracy and sensitivity. As a complement to existing methods we introduce a novel class of fast high-throughput algorithms based on quasi-alignment using position specific p-mer frequency clustering. Organisms are represented by a directed graph structure that summarizes the ordering between clusters of p-mer frequency histograms at different positions in sequences. This model can be learned using all available 16S copies of an organism and thus eliminates selection bias. Due to the added position information, these algorithms can be used for species (and even strain) classification facilitating the study of strain diversity within species. Our prototype implementation of this new technique shows that it is able to produce compact profiles which can be efficiently stored and used for large scale classification and differentiation down to the strain level. Since the technique incorporates high-throughput data stream clustering, a proven technique in high performance computing, it scales well for very large scale DNA/RNA sequence data as well as massive sets of short sequence snippets collected during metagenomic research. In this project we will develop a suite of tools, profile models, and scoring techniques to model RNA/DNA sequences providing applications of organism classification, and intra/inter-organism similarity/diversity. Our approach provides both the specificity needed to perform strain classification and still avoid the computational overhead of alignment. It is important to note that this is accomplished through dynamic online machine learning techniques without human intervention.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:    Recent advances in Metagenomics and the Human Microbiome provide a complex landscape for dealing with a multitude of genomes all at once. One of the many challenges in this field is classification of the genomes present in the sample. Effective metagenomic classification and diversity analysis require complex representations of taxa. The significance of our research is that we develop a suite of tools, based on novel alignment free techniques that will be applied to environmental metagenomics samples as well as human microbiome samples. Providing such methods to rapidly classify organisms using our new approach on a laptop computer instead of several multi-processor servers will facilitate the rapid development of microbiome-based health screening in the near future.                 Recent advances in Metagenomics and the Human Microbiome provide a complex landscape for dealing with a multitude of genomes all at once.

"SLASH: SCALABLE LARGE ANALYTIC SEGMENTATION HYBRID DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Advanced instrumentation and cellular imaging techniques using high-throughput 3D electron microscopy are driving a new revolution in the exploration of complex biological systems by providing near seamless views across multiple scales of resolution. These datasets provide the necessary breadth and depth to analyze multicellular, cellular, and subcelluar structure across large swathes of neural tissue. While these new imaging procedures are generating extremely large datasets of enormous value, the quantities are such that no single user or even laboratory team can possibly analyze the full content of their own imaging activities through traditional means. To address this challenge, we propose to further develop and refine a prototype hybrid system for high-throughput segmentation of large neuropil datasets that: 1) advances automatic algorithms for segmentation of cellular and sub-cellular structures using machine learning techniques; 2) couples these techniques to a scalable and flexible process or tool suite allowing multiple users to simultaneously review, edit and curate the results of these automatic approaches; and, 3) builds a knowledge base of training data guiding and improving automated processing. This system will allow project scientists to select areas of interest, execute automatic segmentation algorithms, and distribute workload, curate data, and deposit final results into the Cell Centered Database (Martone et al. 2008) via accessible web-interfaces. Emerging techniques in cellular and subcellular 3D imaging are generating datasets of enormous value to the study of disease processes and to the pursuit of greater insight into the structure and function of the nervous system. To unlock the potential of these data, new solutions are needed to improve the capability to segment and label the individual molecular, subcellular and cellular components within very large volumetric expanses. To address this challenge, we propose a hybrid system for high-throughput segmentation of large neuropil datasets that advances machine learning algorithms for automatic segmentation and couples these techniques to a scalable tool suite for multiple users to simultaneously review, edit and curate results.",SLASH: SCALABLE LARGE ANALYTIC SEGMENTATION HYBRID,8163481,R01NS075314,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological', 'Cell membrane', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular Structures', 'Classification', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Computers and Advanced Instrumentation', 'Couples', 'Cytoskeleton', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Electrons', 'Face', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Internet', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Mitochondria', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Target', 'Names', 'Nervous System Physiology', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurofibrillary Tangles', 'Neurons', 'Neuropil', 'Online Systems', 'Organelles', 'Participant', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Scanning Electron Microscopy', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Solutions', 'Staining method', 'Stains', 'Structure', 'Subcellular structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Utah', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Workload', 'biological systems', 'cellular imaging', 'complex biological systems', 'data mining', 'digital imaging', 'electron optics', 'flexibility', 'image processing', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'novel', 'prototype', 'relating to nervous system', 'scientific computing', 'tomography', 'tool', 'web interface']",NINDS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2011,459174,-0.0003821570131455201
"Pattern Discovery for comparative epigenomics    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose a training program that will prepare an effective independent investigator in computational genomics. The candidate has a PhD in biology from the University of Cambridge and will extend his skills in both computational and wet-lab methods through a two-year program of organized mentorship and training, and a structured five-year research program.  This program will promote the command of machine learning as applied to functional genomics data. Dr. William Noble will mentor the candidate's scientific development. Dr. Noble is a recognized leader in computational biology and machine learning. He holds a dual appointment as Associate Professor in Genome Sciences and Com- puter Science and Engineering, and has trained numerous postdoctoral fellows and graduate students. Dr. Jeff Bilmes, Associate Professor of Electrical Engineering, will contribute to the mentoring effort, and a committee of experienced genome and computational biologists will advise on science and the candidate's career goals.  Research will focus on the analysis of multiple tracks of data from high-throughput sequencing assays, such as the ChIP-seq data produced by the ENCODE Project. These experiments allow us to obtain a more complete picture of the structure of human chromatin, revealing the behavior of transcription factors, the organization of epigenetic modifications, and the locations of accessible DNA across the entire genome at up to single-base resolution. A current challenge is to discover joint patterns across multiple tracks of these functional genomics results simultaneously. This project will (1) develop computational methods for identifying such patterns, providing new ways of finding both well-understood genomic features and novel functional elements, (2) apply those methods to characterize the similarities and differences among different biological samples, establishing a better understanding of chromatin, the bounds of its variation, and its role in human disease, and (3) validate computational findings with laboratory experiments. The project will use a dynamic Bayesian network (DBN), a type of probabilistic graphical model, to represent the statistical dependencies between observed data, such as sequencing tag density, on an inferred hidden state sequence.  The Department of Genome Sciences of the University Of Washington School Of Medicine provides an ideal setting for training a new independent investigator with an extensive program of formal and informal education for postdoctoral scientists, opportunities for collaboration with researchers with expertise in diverse areas, and modern computational and laboratory resources. This environment maximizes the potential for the candidate to obtain the training and perform the research necessary to establish himself as a skilled investigator with an independent research program.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The major outcome of this work will be a trained scientist with the skills to run an independent research pro- gram integrating computational methods and genome biology. Additionally, the research will result in improved methodology and software resources for analyzing functional genomics data, and a better understanding of how chromatin state affects molecular biology and human disease.              The major outcome of this work will be a trained scientist with the skills to run an independent research pro- gram integrating computational methods and genome biology.

"Statistical Models and Inference in the Single-Molecule Approach to Biology    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The rapid advance of nanotechnology has generated much excitement in the scientific and engineering community. Its application to the biological front created the new area of single-molecule biology: Scientists were able to investigate biological processes on a molecule-by-molecule basis, opening the door to addressing many problems that were inaccessible just a few decades ago. The new frontier also raises many statistical challenges, calling upon an urgent need for new statistical inference tools and new stochastic models because of the stochastic nature of single-molecule experiments and because many classical models derived from oversimplified assumptions are no longer valid for single-molecule experiments. The current proposal focuses on the statistical challenges in the single-molecule approach to biology. The proposed research consists of three projects: (1) Using stochastic networks to model enzymatic reaction kinetics. The goal is to provide models not only biologically meaningful, but also capable of explaining the recent single-molecule experimental discoveries that contradict the classical Michaelis-Menten model. (2) Using the kernel method to infer biochemical properties from doubly stochastic Poisson process data, in particular, photon arrival data from single-molecule experiments. The goal is to develop nonparametric inference tools to recover the dependence structure, such as the autocorrelation function, from the doubly stochastic Poisson data. (3) Using bootstrap moment estimates to infer the helical diffusion of DNA-binding proteins. The goal is to elucidate how DNA-binding proteins interact with DNA, and estimate the associated energy landscape. The proposed research aims to provide essential statistical models and inference tools to study biological processes at the single-molecule level and to advance significantly our understanding of how important biological processes such as enzymatic reactions and protein-DNA interactions actually occur in our cells. The single-molecule approach to biology presents many opportunities for interdisciplinary research, calling upon collective efforts from mathematical, biological and physical scientists. The proposed research seeks to meet a high academic standard and aims to reach out to the general scientific community to collaborate and cross-fertilize the interdisciplinary field. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to human health because both enzymatic reactions and protein-DNA interactions play fundamental roles in the healthy function of our cells. For example, deficiency of the beta- galactosidase, an enzyme studied in the proposal, can result in galactosialidosis or Morquio B syndrome; the misfunction of hOgg1, a DNA-repair protein studied in this proposal, can result in harmful genetic mutations.       	       n/a",Statistical Models and Inference in the Single-Molecule Approach to Biology,8100430,R01GM090202,"['Address', 'Area', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Reaction', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Cells', 'Communities', 'DNA', 'DNA repair protein', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'DNA-Protein Interaction', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Diffusion', 'Engineering', 'Enzymes', 'Gangliosidosis GM1', 'Gene Mutation', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Kinetics', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Nanotechnology', 'Nature', 'Photons', 'Play', 'Property', 'Research', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Syndrome', 'base', 'computerized data processing', 'frontier', 'meetings', 'research study', 'single molecule', 'tool']",NIGMS,HARVARD UNIVERSITY,R01,2011,288150,-0.016052104331403184
"A Comprehensive catalog of human DNasel hypersensitive sites The overall aim of this proposal is to establish a comprehensive, high-quality catalogue of human DNasel hypersensitive sites (DHSs) spanning all major tissue lineages.

"ISMB 2011 Conference Support for Students & Young Scientists    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): ISMB 2011 Conference Travel Support for Students and Young Scientists.  The Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology (ISMB) conference in 2011 will be held in Vienna, Austria, as a conference of approximately 1,500-1,700 attendees, including 33-38% students/post doctoral researchers. ISMB brings together graduate students, post doctoral researchers, faculty, research staff and senior scientists of many different nationalities, all of whom are studying or working in computer science, molecular biology, mathematics and/or statistics. The conference brings biologists and computational scientists together to focus on research centered on actual biological problems rather than simply theoretical calculations. The combined focus on ""intelligent systems"" and actual biological data makes ISMB a highly relevant meeting, and many years of producing the event has resulted in a well organized, well attended, and respected annual conference. The ISMB conference presents the latest research methods and results developed through the application of computer programming to the study of biological sciences, including advances in sequencing genomes that may lead to a better understanding of how, for instance, cells interact for the treatment of diseases such as cancer. Additionally, presentations may describe methods and advances associated with the analysis of existing biological literature, including benchmarking experiments, to create a better public understanding of scientific research reports. Overall, ISMB serves to educate attendees on the latest developments that will further drive the research methods and results of the field of computational biology. Students and scientists are able to return to their labs to apply what they have learned as they advance their own research efforts. The scientific program for each ISMB meeting comprises parallel presentation tracks of original research papers, highlights of recently published research, topically focused special sessions on emerging topics, technology demos, tutorial workshops, special interest group meetings and a student symposium organized by and for students. As an example, for ISMB 2010, 234 original research papers were submitted and 48 selected for the Proceedings Track; 126 published papers were submitted and 42 selected for the Highlights Track; nine proposals were submitted and four selected for presentation along with two invited for the Special Sessions Track. In all, well over 200 talks were presented during the course of the 2010 conference, and similar numbers are anticipated for 2011. In all cases, submissions are rigorously reviewed, typically by three members of each track's committee before approval by the track chair, insuring the highest possible quality of work is presented. The specific areas represented in the conference vary each year depending on the areas that researchers find most interesting and innovative, and therefore submit as papers and proposals. This proposal seeks funding to assist students and junior researchers in attending the conference, thus exposing them to the latest research of their own areas as well as areas that may be new to them.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Relevance Bioinformatics is well established as an essential tool for understanding biological systems. The widespread recognition of bioinformatics has been largely driven by genomic sequence efforts, because laboratory scientists recognize that the usefulness of genomic data in the quest to develop new and improved treatments for and prevention of disease is highly dependent on one's ability to electronically access and manipulate it. Biologists are routinely integrating computational tools into their research programs and creating large predictive models based on information found in databases and other electronic resources. The Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology (ISMB) conference series directly addresses these questions by showcasing the latest advances in the field, as well as exposing what's on the horizon of future discoveries.           Relevance Bioinformatics is well established as an essential tool for understanding biological systems.

"Integration and visualization of diverse biological data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Modern genome-scale experimental techniques enable for the first time in biological research the comprehensive monitoring of the entire molecular regulatory events leading to disease. Their integrative analyses hold the promise of generating specific, experimentally testable hypotheses, paving the way for a systems-level molecular view of complex disease. However, systems-level modeling of metazoan biology must address the challenges of: 1. biological complexity, including individual cell lineages and tissue types, 2. the increasingly large scale of data in higher organisms, and 3. the diversity of biomolecules and interaction mechanisms in the cell. The long-term goal of this research is to address these challenges through the development of bioinformatics frameworks for the study of gene function and regulation in complex biological systems thereby contributing to a greater understanding of human disease. In the initial funding period, we have developed accurate methods for integrating and visualizing diverse functional genomics data in S. cerevisiae and implemented them in interactive web-based systems for the biology community. Our methods have led to experimental discoveries of novel biology, are widely used by the yeast community, and are integrated with the SGD model organism database. We now propose to leverage our previous work to develop novel data integration and analysis methods and implement them in a public system for human data. In the proposed research period, we will create algorithms appropriate for integrating metazoan data in a tissue- and cell-lineage specific manner in health and disease. We will also develop novel hierarchical methods for predicting specific molecular interaction mechanisms and will extend our methods for integrating additional biomolecules. These methods will direct experiments focused on the glomerular kidney filter, a critical and complex component of the human vascular system whose dysfunction directly contributes to microvascular disease. Prediction of these cell-lineage specific functional networks will advance the understanding of the glomerulus function and its role in microvascular disease, leading to better clinical predictors, diagnoses, and treatments. From a technical perspective, application to glomerular biology will enable iterative improvement of the proposed methods based on experimental feedback. The end product of this research will be a general, robust, interactive, and automatically updated system for human data integration and analysis that will be freely available to the biomedical community. We will leverage parallel processing technologies (inspired by Google- type cloud computing solutions) to ensure interactive-analysis speed on the system. This system will allow biomedical researchers to synthesize, analyze, and visualize diverse data in human biology, enabling accurate predictions of biological networks and understanding their cell-lineage specificity and role in disease.

"Ontology-Driven Methods for Knowledge Acquisition and Knowledge Discovery    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       A great challenge in the biomedical informatics domain is to develop computational methods that combine existing knowledge and experimental data to derive new knowledge regarding biological systems and disease mechanisms. Most knowledge regarding genes and proteins in biomedical literature is stored in the form of free text that is not suitable for computation, and the manual processes of encoding this body of knowledge into computable form cannot keep up with the rate of knowledge accumulation. The main thrust of the proposed research is to design novel statistical text-mining algorithms to acquire and represent knowledge regarding genes and proteins from free-text literature, and further to combine this acquired knowledge with experimental data to derive new knowledge. We will organize the proposed research to the following specific aims. Specific Aim 1. Develop ontology-guided semantic modeling algorithms for extracting biological concepts from free text, in which we will design hierarchical probabilistic topic models that are capable of representing biological concepts as a hierarchy and develop novel learning algorithms to infer biological concepts from free-text documents. Specific Aim 2. Integrate semantic modeling with BioNLP to extract textual evidence supporting protein-function annotations. We will develop information extraction algorithms that will combine the results of hierarchical semantic analysis and BioNLP to identify the text regions that will most likely provide evidence regarding the function of genes/proteins and map the extracted information to a controlled vocabulary. Specific Aim 3. Develop a framework to unify the procedures of knowledge reasoning and data mining for knowledge discovery. In this aim, we will reason using existing knowledge (represented in the form of an ontology) to reveal functional modules among the genes from the experimental data. We will then further develop algorithms that will reveal relationships between these gene modules by mining system-scaled experimental data. The overall framework will integrate functional reasoning and data mining in an iterative manner to refine the knowledge progressively and to derive rules such as: when genes involved in biological process X are perturbed, genes involved in biological process Y will respond. We will test the framework on the data from yeast-system biology studies and the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project to gain insights into the cellular systems and disease mechanisms of cancer cells.           In recent decades, biomedical sciences have achieved significant advances; most of the knowledge resulting from research is stored in the form of biomedical literature in the form free-text.

"Improved algorithms for macromolecular structure determination by cryo-EM and NMR    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Single-particle electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) and 2D NMR spectroscopy are methods for observing the three-dimensional structures of large and small macromolecules. respectively. We propose to develop and apply novel algorithms for solving the difficult mathematical problems posed by these techniques of structural biology. In cryo-EM the experimental data consist of noisy, random projection images of macromolecular ""particles"", and the problem is finding the 3D structure which is consistent with these images. Present reconstruction techniques rely on user input or ad hoc models to initiate a refinement cycle. We propose a new algorithm, ""globally consistent angular reconstitution"" (GCAR) that provides an unbiased and direct solution to the reconstruction problem. We further propose an extension to GCAR to handle heterogeneous particle populations. We also will pursue a powerful new approach to determining class averages, ""triplet class averaging"". This should allow GCAR to be used with data having very low signal-to-noise ratios, as is commonly obtained. The experimental data from NMR consist of estimates of local distances between atoms, and the goal is to find a globally consistent coordinate system. The same theory behind GCAR, involving the properties of sparse linear operators, can be applied to obtain a fast and direct solution to the distance geometry problem. We will develop and implement all of these algorithms and test them with experimental cryo-EM and NMR data. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Determining the structures of proteins and other large molecules is an essential step in the basic understanding of biological processes, as well as the first step in rational drug design.

The proposed tool represents a novel approach for monitoring scientific progress in biology, which has become a formidable task. We will exploit recent advances in machine learning and database systems to develop a useful approximation to a personalized biological knowledge base f.i.i.e., single information resource that would include all the knowledge sources on which a biologist relies.

"HyPhy: Molecular Evolutionary Analyses    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Project Description HyPhy (http://www.hyphy.org) is a scriptable software platform designed to enable flexible and powerful analyses of DNA, RNA, codon, amino acid and other types of sequence data in an evolutionary context. Such analyses have become an indispensable component of most research studies that make use of comparative genomic data. Biologists and bioinformaticians increasingly recognize the benefits of molecular evolutionary analyses. Since its initial release in 2001, HyPhy has become a relatively stable and mature product, and has been downloaded by more than 4,500 unique users, integrated into several popular web-based genomic data analysis servers, cited in over 400 peer-reviewed publications and described in three book chapters, in spite of the fact that the development of the package has never been directly funded. This proposal seeks support to improve the quality, performance, reliability, modularity, documentation and feature sets of the HyPhy system. Specific aims can be divided into four major areas: 1. Software engineering, testing, and documentation of the HyPhy codebase. 2. The development of a high-performance engine for phylogenetic maximum likelihood model fitting and inference. 3.

"Statistical Models and Inference in the Single-Molecule Approach to Biology    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The rapid advance of nanotechnology has generated much excitement in the scientific and engineering community. Its application to the biological front created the new area of single-molecule biology: Scientists were able to investigate biological processes on a molecule-by-molecule basis, opening the door to addressing many problems that were inaccessible just a few decades ago. The new frontier also raises many statistical challenges, calling upon an urgent need for new statistical inference tools and new stochastic models because of the stochastic nature of single-molecule experiments and because many classical models derived from oversimplified assumptions are no longer valid for single-molecule experiments. The current proposal focuses on the statistical challenges in the single-molecule approach to biology. The proposed research consists of three projects: (1) Using stochastic networks to model enzymatic reaction kinetics. The goal is to provide models not only biologically meaningful, but also capable of explaining the recent single-molecule experimental discoveries that contradict the classical Michaelis-Menten model. (2) Using the kernel method to infer biochemical properties from doubly stochastic Poisson process data, in particular, photon arrival data from single-molecule experiments. The goal is to develop nonparametric inference tools to recover the dependence structure, such as the autocorrelation function, from the doubly stochastic Poisson data. (3) Using bootstrap moment estimates to infer the helical diffusion of DNA-binding proteins. The goal is to elucidate how DNA-binding proteins interact with DNA, and estimate the associated energy landscape. The proposed research aims to provide essential statistical models and inference tools to study biological processes at the single-molecule level and to advance significantly our understanding of how important biological processes such as enzymatic reactions and protein-DNA interactions actually occur in our cells. The single-molecule approach to biology presents many opportunities for interdisciplinary research, calling upon collective efforts from mathematical, biological and physical scientists. The proposed research seeks to meet a high academic standard and aims to reach out to the general scientific community to collaborate and cross-fertilize the interdisciplinary field. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to human health because both enzymatic reactions and protein-DNA interactions play fundamental roles in the healthy function of our cells. For example, deficiency of the beta- galactosidase, an enzyme studied in the proposal, can result in galactosialidosis or Morquio B syndrome; the misfunction of hOgg1, a DNA-repair protein studied in this proposal, can result in harmful genetic mutations.       	       n/a",Statistical Models and Inference in the Single-Molecule Approach to Biology,7895064,R01GM090202,"['Address', 'Area', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Reaction', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Cells', 'Communities', 'DNA', 'DNA repair protein', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'DNA-Protein Interaction', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Diffusion', 'Engineering', 'Enzymes', 'Gangliosidosis GM1', 'Gene Mutation', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Kinetics', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Nanotechnology', 'Nature', 'Photons', 'Play', 'Property', 'Research', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Syndrome', 'base', 'computerized data processing', 'frontier', 'meetings', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'single molecule', 'tool']",NIGMS,HARVARD UNIVERSITY,R01,2010,291060,-0.016052104331403184
"Methods for genomic data with graphical structures    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The broad, long-term objective of this project concerns the development of novel statistical methods and computational tools for statistical and probabilistic modeling of genomic data motivated by important biological questions and experiments. The specific aim of the current project is to develop new statistical models and methods for analysis of genomic data with graphical structures, focusing on methods for analyzing genetic pathways and networks, including the development of nonparametric pathway-smooth tests for two-sample and analysis of variance problems for identifying pathways with perturbed activity between two or multiple experimental conditions, the development of group Lasso and group threshold gradient descent regularized estimation procedures for the pathway-smoothed generalized linear models, Cox proportional hazards models and the accelerated failure time models in order to identify pathways that are related to various clinical phenotypes. These methods hinge on novel integration of spectral graph theory, non-parametric methods for analysis of multivariate data and regularized estimation methods fro statistical learning. The new methods can be applied to different types of genomic data and will ideally facilitate the identification of genes and biological pathways underlying various complex human diseases and complex biological processes. The project will also investigate the robustness, power and efficiencies o these methods and compare them with existing methods. In addition, this project will develop practical a feasible computer programs in order to implement the proposed methods, to evaluate the performance o these methods through application to real data on microarray gene expression studies of human hear failure, cardiac allograft rejection and neuroblastoma. The work proposed here will contribute both statistical methodology to modeling genomic data with graphical structures, to studying complex phenotypes and biological systems and methods for high-dimensional data analysis, and offer insight into each of the clinical areas represented by the various data sets to evaluate these new methods. All programs developed under this grant and detailed documentation will be made available free-of-charge to interested researchers via the World Wide Web.          n/a",Methods for genomic data with graphical structures,7798186,R01CA127334,"['Address', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Charge', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Cox Proportional Hazards Models', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Grant', 'Graph', 'Hearing', 'Heart failure', 'Human', 'Internet', 'Lasso', 'Linear Models', 'Machine Learning', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metadata', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Neuroblastoma', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pennsylvania', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Procedures', 'Proteomics', 'Regulatory Pathway', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Signal Pathway', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Work', 'allograft rejection', 'biological systems', 'clinical phenotype', 'computer program', 'computerized tools', 'genetic analysis', 'heart allograft', 'high throughput technology', 'human disease', 'insight', 'interest', 'novel', 'programs', 'research study', 'response', 'software development', 'theories', 'vector']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2010,289814,-0.004443731306192567
"Analysis of the Functional Impact of Coding region SNPs    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       During the current grant period, we have developed two models of the impact of missense SNPs on protein function in vivo. Through this work, and that of others, we now have a clearer understanding of the molecular mechanisms that lead to monogenic disease. We have also developed a web resource which integrates our results with a large range of other information relevant to disease. Goals for next phase fall into three categories: (1) Exploiting the present results to address basic questions concerning the relationship between genetic variation and disease. Specifically: What is the distribution of mechanisms by which mis-sense SNPs influence protein function; how common are epistatic (non-linear) interactions between SNPs with the same protein molecule and across protein-protein interfaces; what are the characteristics of the approximately 1500 proteins involved in monogenic disease, versus all the others; which SNPs are most significant in directly and indirectly affecting particular biological processes and susceptibility to common diseases? (2) Improving and extending SNP analysis methods, both to obtain a more extensive and reliable set of deleterious mis-sense SNPs, and to include analysis of SNPs that influence disease susceptibility through other processes. New models will be developed for effects on transcription, message processing and translation. Available database information will be augmented by a combination of literature analysis and   soliciting input from appropriate members of the scientific community. (3) Maintain and enhance the web resource to increase its utility to the research community. Functionality will be extended to allow users to input their own SNPs and receive a real time analysis from both models; a user annotation interface will be developed, to capture knowledge on the role of amino acids altered mis-sense SNPs, as well as which genes are most relevant to disease, and what buffering mechanisms shield the phenotype from particular deleterious SNPs; additional information sources will be incorporated, including SNP analysis by others.    Relevance to public health: Many common human diseases, such as heart attack, Alzheimer, asthma and diabetes, are partly inherited, through specific DNA features. At present, there is no common disease for which these inheritance mechanisms are understood. This work will provide specific insight into a number of diseases, and improved understanding of the inheritance process.              n/a",Analysis of the Functional Impact of Coding region SNPs,7842564,R01LM007174,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amino Acids', 'Asthma', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Process', 'Buffers', 'Catalysis', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Code', 'Communities', 'DNA', 'Databases', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Disease Association', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Ensure', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Ligand Binding', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molting', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Online Systems', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Set protein', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Time', 'Translation Process', 'Work', 'base', 'falls', 'human disease', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'member', 'mutant', 'programs', 'protein function', 'protein structure function']",NLM,"UNIV OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK",R01,2010,290690,-0.01686131732082337
"Bioconductor: an open computing resource for genomics    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Bioconductor project provides an open resource for the development and distribution of innovative reliable software for computational biology and bioinformatics. The range of available software is broad and rapidly growing as are both the user community and the developer community. The project maintains a web portal for delivering software and documentation to end users as well as an active mailing list. Additional services for developers include a software archive, mailing list and assistance and advice program development and design      We propose an active development strategy designed to meet new challenges while simultaneously providing user and developer support for existing tools and methods. In particular we emphasize a design strategy that accommodates the imperfect, yet evolving nature of biological knowledge and the relatively rapid development of new experimental technologies. Software solutions must be able to rapidly adapt and to facilitate new problems when they arise.      CRITQUE 1:      The Bioconductor project began in 2001. In 2002 it was awarded a BISTI grant for three years 2003-2006). During this time the project has expanded and provided support for a world wide community of researchers. This is a proposal for continued development for Bioconductor, which is a set of statistical programs which are specifically tailored to the computatational biology community. Bioconductor is composed of over 130 R packages that have been contributed by a large number of developers. The software packages range from state of the art statistical methods which typically are used in microarray analysis, to annotation tools, to plotting functions, GUIs, to sequence alignment and data management packages. Contributions to and usage of Bioconductor is growing rapidly and the applicants are requesting support to continue its development as well as general logistical support for software distribution and quality assurance. The proposal includes a research component for Bioconductor which will involve the development of analysis techniques. This will include optimization of the R statistical analyses, statistical processing of Affymetrix data, analysis of SNP data, improved standards, data storage, retreivals from NCBI, sequence management, machine learning, web services and distributed computing.      SCIENTIFIC MERIT   The applicants address many issues that are crucial to the success of a large open source project with multiple contributors. Examples of training, scientific publication, documentation and resource development run throughout the proposal. Many tangible examples were given on the usage of the system by the scientific community.        EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN   This is a description of their management workflow for the project which does a good job of demonstrating the technical excellence brought to the project by this group. 1) Build annotation packages every three months, Integrate changes in annotation source data structure into annotation package building code. 2) Maintain project website, mailing lists, source control archive. Organize web resources for short course and conferences. 3) Improve existing software. 4) Sustain automated nightly builds. Work with developers whose packages fail to pass QA. 5) Resolve cross-platform issues. 6) Review new submissions. Answer questions on the mailing lists. 7) Use software engineering best practices. Develop unit testing strategies. Design appropriate classes and methods for new data types. Refactor existing code for better interoperability and extensibility. 8) Develop and organize training materials and documentation.      Extensive detail on testing, build procedures, interoperability, quality assurance and project management is given elsewhere in the document. They clearly have dealt with many issues necessary for a project of this size. They state that one of the biggest cost items is support of this package to run on multiple platforms. They point out that many contributors focus on a single platform, much of their work is track down cross-platform bugs. This is time well-spent, given the platforms used are in sync with the needs of the greater bioinformatics community.        ORIGINALITY   While a high degree of originality is not a particularly critical element of open source software development project, there are certainly areas in the proposal that are unique. Most importantly, it is safe to say that there is not another project which has this blend of statistical analysis systems specifically tailored to a important research bioinformatics area that can be deployed on a number of different computer environments.      INVESTIGATOR AND CO-INVESTIGATORS   Dr. Gentleman is the founder and leader of the Bioconductor project. Dr. Gentlemen was an Associate Professor in the Department of Biostatistics, Harvard School of Public Health and Department of Biostatistics and Computational Biology, Dana Farber Cancer Institute. In 2004 he became Program Head, Computational Biology, at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle. He has on the order of ten publications relating to Bioconductor or related statistical analysis. He implemented the original versions of the R programming language jointly with another co-founder. He is PI or Investigator of a number of research grants, at least two are directly related to this work. He and other members of the proposal have taught a number of courses and given lectures on Bioconductor, the amount of these courses certainly indicate significant dedication to the project.  A review of the PI and Co-PI activities related to this project are shown on Table 3 on page 42 of the application. The roles and time allocations assigned to each participant appear to be reasonable.  Dr. Gentleman will serve as project leader and will manage the programmers, coordinating the project, and investigating new computational methods and approaches.  Dr. Vincent Carey, as co Principal Investigator has 20% time allocated for the project.  In 2005 he became Associate Professor of Medicine (Biostatistics). Carey is a senior member of the Bioconductor development core. He will improve interoperability to allow Bioconductor reuse of external modules in Java, Perl and other languages as well as strengthen interfaces between high throughput experimental workflows and machine learning tools, and ontology capture.  An administrative assistant will assist Dr. Carey with administrative requirements, including call coordination, manuscript preparation and distribution, scheduling and budget management.  Dr. Rafael Irizarry as co-PI will spend 30% effort on the project.  Dr. Irizarry has four years experience developing methods for microarray data analysis and in the Department of Biostatistics serving as faculty liaison to the Johns Hopkins Medical Institution's Microarray Core.  He will supervize all efforts to support preprocessing on all platforms and support for microarray related consortiums such as the ERCC, GEO, and ArrayExpress.      Programmers will be responsible for the project website, managing email lists, maintaining training materials, upgrading software, refactoring and other code enhancements, managing the svn archive, and Bioconductor releases. They will handle checking all submitted packages, developing unit tests, and simplifying downloads, nightly build procedures, cross-platform issues, data technologies as well as integrating resources found in other languages (e.g. large C libraries of routines for string handling, machine learning and so on). Programmers have familiarity with R packages and systems for database management and for parallel and distributed computing. They will be responsible for managing the annotation data including package building and liaising with organism specific and other data providers.      SIGNIFICANCE   Given the scope of the proposal, and the size of the Bioconductor project in general the request for the above resources is appropriate. There is an excellent mix of grounded project management along with development of newer state of the art techniques that will benifit many members of the bioinformatics community. There is a high probability that funding this project will help to maintain and advance this important community resource.      ENVIRONMENT   The computer infrastructure, and the local departments of the PI and Co-PIs, as well as the work with the larger scientific community are all excellent environments to support this project.      IN SUMMARY   This is a terrific resource.  It is a well managed large open source project with very well crafted QA testing, documentation and training.  Continuation of this is a three year project. Beyond that period, a statement of long term stated goals is needed. The PI should articulate the strategic goals, as well as their research motivation and translate that into an action plan. They should also use that context to describe how they would go about choosing packages that are put into the Bioconductor system; Table 3 only listed the names of the packages made by the applicants, it could have gone further to give the reader more information for choosing packages.  A simple example would have been if they stated in the document: ""Given our assessment of the microarray state of the art, we ultimately aim to overlay annotation data, ontological information, and other forms of meta data onto a statistical framework for expression data."" The resulting research plan would then justify a five year project, but it was not strong enough in this application.       It should be noted that many of the benificiaries to this system are not just users that download the system.  In many cases a centralized informatics service downloads their system and then performs analysis for other members of the campus or the wider www community. While that type of ""success measure"" is hard to assess, more effort in this area in subsequent proposals would be helpful.           n/a",Bioconductor: an open computing resource for genomics,7910730,P41HG004059,[' '],NHGRI,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,P41,2010,1093220,0.0012569966318561185
"Improved algorithms for macromolecular structure determination by cryo-EM and NMR    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Single-particle electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) and 2D NMR spectroscopy are methods for observing the three-dimensional structures of large and small macromolecules. respectively. We propose to develop and apply novel algorithms for solving the difficult mathematical problems posed by these techniques of structural biology. In cryo-EM the experimental data consist of noisy, random projection images of macromolecular ""particles"", and the problem is finding the 3D structure which is consistent with these images. Present reconstruction techniques rely on user input or ad hoc models to initiate a refinement cycle. We propose a new algorithm, ""globally consistent angular reconstitution"" (GCAR) that provides an unbiased and direct solution to the reconstruction problem. We further propose an extension to GCAR to handle heterogeneous particle populations. We also will pursue a powerful new approach to determining class averages, ""triplet class averaging"". This should allow GCAR to be used with data having very low signal-to-noise ratios, as is commonly obtained. The experimental data from NMR consist of estimates of local distances between atoms, and the goal is to find a globally consistent coordinate system. The same theory behind GCAR, involving the properties of sparse linear operators, can be applied to obtain a fast and direct solution to the distance geometry problem. We will develop and implement all of these algorithms and test them with experimental cryo-EM and NMR data. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Determining the structures of proteins and other large molecules is an essential step in the basic understanding of biological processes, as well as the first step in rational drug design.

"ADAPTIVE PERSONALIZED INFORMATION MANAGEMENT FOR BIOLOGISTS    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We propose development of an adaptive, personalizable, information management tool, which can be configured and trained by an individual biologist to most effectively exploit the particular knowledge bases and document collections that are most useful for him or her. The proposed tool represents a novel approach for monitoring scientific progress in biology, which has become a formidable task. We will exploit recent advances in machine learning and database systems to develop a useful approximation to a personalized biological knowledge base f.i.i.e., single information resource that would include all the knowledge sources on which a biologist relies. More specifically, we propose a scheme for loosely integrating both structured information and unstructured text, and then querying the integrated information using easily-formulated similarity queries. The system will also learn from every episode in which a biologist seeks information. The research team on this project includes a computer scientist and two biologists. The proposed work will make systems for monitoring scientific progress in biology more effective. This will make biologists, clinicians and medical researchers better able to track advances in the biomedical literature that are relevant to their work.          n/a",ADAPTIVE PERSONALIZED INFORMATION MANAGEMENT FOR BIOLOGISTS,7656692,R01GM081293,"['Address', 'Biological', 'Biological Phenomena', 'Biology', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computers', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Eukaryota', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Individual', 'Information Management', 'Information Resources', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Metric', 'Monitor', 'Output', 'Persons', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Ribosomes', 'Role', 'Scheme', 'Scientist', 'Solutions', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'design', 'experience', 'knowledge base', 'man', 'novel strategies', 'programs', 'tool']",NIGMS,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R01,2009,282304,-0.02048503103203191
"Pathway Prediction and Assessment Integrating Multiple Evidence Types    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Metabolic pathway databases provide a biological framework in which relationships among an organism's genes may be revealed. This context can be exploited to boost the accuracy of genome annotation, to discover new targets for therapeutics, or to engineer metabolic pathways in bacteria to produce a historically expensive drug cheaply and quickly. But, knowledge of metabolism in ill-characterized species is limited and dependent on computational predictions of pathways. Our ultimate target is to develop methods for the prediction of novel metabolic pathways in any organism, coupled with robust assessment of the validity of any predicted pathway. We hypothesize that integrating evidence from multiple levels of an organism's metabolic network - from the fit of a pathway within the network to evolutionary relationships between pathways - will allow us to assess pathway validity and to predict novel metabolic pathways. We have successfully applied machine learning methods to the problem of identifying missing enzymes in metabolic pathways and believe similar methods will prove fruitful in this application. Our preliminary studies have identified several properties of predicted metabolic pathways that differ between sets of true positive pathway predictions (i.e., pathways known to occur in an organism) and sets of false positive pathway predictions. We will expand on these features and develop methods to address the following specific aims:      1) Identify features that are informative in distinguishing between correct and incorrect pathway predictions in computationally-generated pathway/genome databases based on predictions for highly-curated organisms (e.g., Escherichia coli and Arabidopsis thaliana).   2) Develop methods for computing the probability that a pathway is correctly predicted. Informative features identified in Specific Aim #1 will be integrated into a classifier that will compute the probability that a predicted pathway is correct given the associated evidence.   3) Extend the Pathologic program (the Pathway Tools algorithm used to infer the metabolic network of an organism) to predict alternate, previously unknown pathways in an organism. We will search the MetaCyc reaction space (comprising almost 6000 reactions) for novel subpathways, explicitly constraining our search using organism-specific evidence (i.e., homology, experimental evidence, etc.) at each step.          n/a",Pathway Prediction and Assessment Integrating Multiple Evidence Types,7685518,R01LM009651,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Antimalarials', 'Bacteria', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biological', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Engineering', 'Enzymes', 'Escherichia', 'Escherichia coli', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Gold', 'Government', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratory Research', 'Left', 'Machine Learning', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mouse-ear Cress', 'Organism', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Probability', 'Prodrugs', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Reaction', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Institute', 'Research Personnel', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Yeasts', 'base', 'design', 'genome database', 'metabolomics', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'pathway tools', 'programs', 'reconstruction']",NLM,SRI INTERNATIONAL,R01,2009,175647,0.000558793887719735

"The Statistical and Computational Analysis of Flow Cytometry Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Flow cytometry is a data-rich technology that plays a critical role in basic research and clinical therapy for a variety of human diseases. Recent technological developments have greatly increased the areas of application and data throughput, and corresponding innovative analysis methods are needed. In order to be able to take advantage of these new capabilities researchers need access to high quality analysis tools that will help to identify subpopulations of cells with particular characteristics. The methods we are proposing include advanced methods for machine learning and visualization. We will apply our methods to a number of different scenarios such as the analysis of longitudinal data, and the analysis of data arising from clinical studies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The aims of this project are to provide statistical and computational methods for the analysis of flow cytometry data. The impact of these tools will be to provide better, more reliable, tools for the analysis of flow cytometry data. The domain of application spans all diseases, but current applications are focused on HIV disease and cancer.          n/a",The Statistical and Computational Analysis of Flow Cytometry Data,7577491,R01EB008400,"['AIDS/HIV problem', 'Address', 'Antibodies', 'Antigens', 'Area', 'Basic Science', 'Biological', 'Cancer Vaccines', 'Cations', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cytometry', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Event', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Future', 'Genomics', 'HIV', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Imagery', 'Immune response', 'Immunity', 'Intervention', 'Lasers', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Names', 'Noise', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Reagent', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Rosa', 'Sampling', 'Shapes', 'Software Tools', 'Staining method', 'Stains', 'Statistical Methods', 'Surface', 'Technology', 'Transplantation', 'Vaccine Research', 'Variant', 'Work', 'graft vs host disease', 'human disease', 'immune function', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'instrumentation', 'leukemia/lymphoma', 'longitudinal analysis', 'particle', 'public health relevance', 'sound', 'tool']",NIBIB,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2009,342223,0.004031217241858022
"Bioconductor: an open computing resource for genomics    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Bioconductor project provides an open resource for the development and distribution of innovative reliable software for computational biology and bioinformatics. The range of available software is broad and rapidly growing as are both the user community and the developer community. The project maintains a web portal for delivering software and documentation to end users as well as an active mailing list. Additional services for developers include a software archive, mailing list and assistance and advice program development and design      We propose an active development strategy designed to meet new challenges while simultaneously providing user and developer support for existing tools and methods. In particular we emphasize a design strategy that accommodates the imperfect, yet evolving nature of biological knowledge and the relatively rapid development of new experimental technologies. Software solutions must be able to rapidly adapt and to facilitate new problems when they arise.      CRITQUE 1:      The Bioconductor project began in 2001. In 2002 it was awarded a BISTI grant for three years 2003-2006). During this time the project has expanded and provided support for a world wide community of researchers. This is a proposal for continued development for Bioconductor, which is a set of statistical programs which are specifically tailored to the computatational biology community. Bioconductor is composed of over 130 R packages that have been contributed by a large number of developers. The software packages range from state of the art statistical methods which typically are used in microarray analysis, to annotation tools, to plotting functions, GUIs, to sequence alignment and data management packages. Contributions to and usage of Bioconductor is growing rapidly and the applicants are requesting support to continue its development as well as general logistical support for software distribution and quality assurance. The proposal includes a research component for Bioconductor which will involve the development of analysis techniques. This will include optimization of the R statistical analyses, statistical processing of Affymetrix data, analysis of SNP data, improved standards, data storage, retreivals from NCBI, sequence management, machine learning, web services and distributed computing.      SCIENTIFIC MERIT   The applicants address many issues that are crucial to the success of a large open source project with multiple contributors. Examples of training, scientific publication, documentation and resource development run throughout the proposal. Many tangible examples were given on the usage of the system by the scientific community.        EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN   This is a description of their management workflow for the project which does a good job of demonstrating the technical excellence brought to the project by this group. 1) Build annotation packages every three months, Integrate changes in annotation source data structure into annotation package building code. 2) Maintain project website, mailing lists, source control archive. Organize web resources for short course and conferences. 3) Improve existing software. 4) Sustain automated nightly builds. Work with developers whose packages fail to pass QA. 5) Resolve cross-platform issues. 6) Review new submissions. Answer questions on the mailing lists. 7) Use software engineering best practices. Develop unit testing strategies. Design appropriate classes and methods for new data types. Refactor existing code for better interoperability and extensibility. 8) Develop and organize training materials and documentation.      Extensive detail on testing, build procedures, interoperability, quality assurance and project management is given elsewhere in the document. They clearly have dealt with many issues necessary for a project of this size. They state that one of the biggest cost items is support of this package to run on multiple platforms. They point out that many contributors focus on a single platform, much of their work is track down cross-platform bugs. This is time well-spent, given the platforms used are in sync with the needs of the greater bioinformatics community.        ORIGINALITY   While a high degree of originality is not a particularly critical element of open source software development project, there are certainly areas in the proposal that are unique. Most importantly, it is safe to say that there is not another project which has this blend of statistical analysis systems specifically tailored to a important research bioinformatics area that can be deployed on a number of different computer environments.      INVESTIGATOR AND CO-INVESTIGATORS   Dr. Gentleman is the founder and leader of the Bioconductor project. Dr. Gentlemen was an Associate Professor in the Department of Biostatistics, Harvard School of Public Health and Department of Biostatistics and Computational Biology, Dana Farber Cancer Institute. In 2004 he became Program Head, Computational Biology, at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle. He has on the order of ten publications relating to Bioconductor or related statistical analysis. He implemented the original versions of the R programming language jointly with another co-founder. He is PI or Investigator of a number of research grants, at least two are directly related to this work. He and other members of the proposal have taught a number of courses and given lectures on Bioconductor, the amount of these courses certainly indicate significant dedication to the project.  A review of the PI and Co-PI activities related to this project are shown on Table 3 on page 42 of the application. The roles and time allocations assigned to each participant appear to be reasonable.  Dr. Gentleman will serve as project leader and will manage the programmers, coordinating the project, and investigating new computational methods and approaches.  Dr. Vincent Carey, as co Principal Investigator has 20% time allocated for the project.  In 2005 he became Associate Professor of Medicine (Biostatistics). Carey is a senior member of the Bioconductor development core. He will improve interoperability to allow Bioconductor reuse of external modules in Java, Perl and other languages as well as strengthen interfaces between high throughput experimental workflows and machine learning tools, and ontology capture.  An administrative assistant will assist Dr. Carey with administrative requirements, including call coordination, manuscript preparation and distribution, scheduling and budget management.  Dr. Rafael Irizarry as co-PI will spend 30% effort on the project.  Dr. Irizarry has four years experience developing methods for microarray data analysis and in the Department of Biostatistics serving as faculty liaison to the Johns Hopkins Medical Institution's Microarray Core.  He will supervize all efforts to support preprocessing on all platforms and support for microarray related consortiums such as the ERCC, GEO, and ArrayExpress.      Programmers will be responsible for the project website, managing email lists, maintaining training materials, upgrading software, refactoring and other code enhancements, managing the svn archive, and Bioconductor releases. They will handle checking all submitted packages, developing unit tests, and simplifying downloads, nightly build procedures, cross-platform issues, data technologies as well as integrating resources found in other languages (e.g. large C libraries of routines for string handling, machine learning and so on). Programmers have familiarity with R packages and systems for database management and for parallel and distributed computing. They will be responsible for managing the annotation data including package building and liaising with organism specific and other data providers.      SIGNIFICANCE   Given the scope of the proposal, and the size of the Bioconductor project in general the request for the above resources is appropriate. There is an excellent mix of grounded project management along with development of newer state of the art techniques that will benifit many members of the bioinformatics community. There is a high probability that funding this project will help to maintain and advance this important community resource.      ENVIRONMENT   The computer infrastructure, and the local departments of the PI and Co-PIs, as well as the work with the larger scientific community are all excellent environments to support this project.      IN SUMMARY   This is a terrific resource.  It is a well managed large open source project with very well crafted QA testing, documentation and training.  Continuation of this is a three year project. Beyond that period, a statement of long term stated goals is needed. The PI should articulate the strategic goals, as well as their research motivation and translate that into an action plan. They should also use that context to describe how they would go about choosing packages that are put into the Bioconductor system; Table 3 only listed the names of the packages made by the applicants, it could have gone further to give the reader more information for choosing packages.  A simple example would have been if they stated in the document: ""Given our assessment of the microarray state of the art, we ultimately aim to overlay annotation data, ontological information, and other forms of meta data onto a statistical framework for expression data."" The resulting research plan would then justify a five year project, but it was not strong enough in this application.       It should be noted that many of the benificiaries to this system are not just users that download the system.  In many cases a centralized informatics service downloads their system and then performs analysis for other members of the campus or the wider www community. While that type of ""success measure"" is hard to assess, more effort in this area in subsequent proposals would be helpful.           n/a",Bioconductor: an open computing resource for genomics,7669241,P41HG004059,"['Address', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Arts', 'Award', 'Bioconductor', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Budgets', 'Building Codes', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Database Management Systems', 'Dedications', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Documentation', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Electronic Mail', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Evolution', 'Experimental Designs', 'Faculty', 'Familiarity', 'FarGo', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center', 'Funding', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Head', 'Human Genome', 'Human Resources', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Internet', 'Investigation', 'Java', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Mails', 'Manuscripts', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Motivation', 'Names', 'Nature', 'Occupations', 'Ontology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organism', 'Participant', 'Policies', 'Preparation', 'Principal Investigator', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Program Development', 'Programming Languages', 'Provider', 'Public Health Schools', 'Publications', 'Reader', 'Request for Proposals', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resource Development', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Running', 'Schedule', 'Scientist', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Services', 'Software Design', 'Software Engineering', 'Solutions', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Work', 'cluster computing', 'computer infrastructure', 'computing resources', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'data management', 'data structure', 'design', 'experience', 'falls', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interoperability', 'lectures', 'meetings', 'member', 'model development', 'open source', 'originality', 'professor', 'programs', 'quality assurance', 'research study', 'software development', 'success', 'symposium', 'tool', 'tool development', 'web site', 'web-accessible']",NHGRI,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,P41,2009,829379,0.0012569966318561185

"Statistical Models and Inference in the Single-Molecule Approach to Biology    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The rapid advance of nanotechnology has generated much excitement in the scientific and engineering community. Its application to the biological front created the new area of single-molecule biology: Scientists were able to investigate biological processes on a molecule-by-molecule basis, opening the door to addressing many problems that were inaccessible just a few decades ago. The new frontier also raises many statistical challenges, calling upon an urgent need for new statistical inference tools and new stochastic models because of the stochastic nature of single-molecule experiments and because many classical models derived from oversimplified assumptions are no longer valid for single-molecule experiments. The current proposal focuses on the statistical challenges in the single-molecule approach to biology. The proposed research consists of three projects: (1) Using stochastic networks to model enzymatic reaction kinetics. The goal is to provide models not only biologically meaningful, but also capable of explaining the recent single-molecule experimental discoveries that contradict the classical Michaelis-Menten model. (2) Using the kernel method to infer biochemical properties from doubly stochastic Poisson process data, in particular, photon arrival data from single-molecule experiments. The goal is to develop nonparametric inference tools to recover the dependence structure, such as the autocorrelation function, from the doubly stochastic Poisson data. (3) Using bootstrap moment estimates to infer the helical diffusion of DNA-binding proteins. The goal is to elucidate how DNA-binding proteins interact with DNA, and estimate the associated energy landscape. The proposed research aims to provide essential statistical models and inference tools to study biological processes at the single-molecule level and to advance significantly our understanding of how important biological processes such as enzymatic reactions and protein-DNA interactions actually occur in our cells. The single-molecule approach to biology presents many opportunities for interdisciplinary research, calling upon collective efforts from mathematical, biological and physical scientists. The proposed research seeks to meet a high academic standard and aims to reach out to the general scientific community to collaborate and cross-fertilize the interdisciplinary field. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to human health because both enzymatic reactions and protein-DNA interactions play fundamental roles in the healthy function of our cells. For example, deficiency of the beta- galactosidase, an enzyme studied in the proposal, can result in galactosialidosis or Morquio B syndrome; the misfunction of hOgg1, a DNA-repair protein studied in this proposal, can result in harmful genetic mutations.       	       n/a",Statistical Models and Inference in the Single-Molecule Approach to Biology,7787322,R01GM090202,"['Address', 'Area', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Reaction', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Cells', 'Communities', 'DNA', 'DNA repair protein', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'DNA-Protein Interaction', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Diffusion', 'Engineering', 'Enzymes', 'Gangliosidosis GM1', 'Gene Mutation', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Kinetics', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Nanotechnology', 'Nature', 'Photons', 'Play', 'Property', 'Research', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Syndrome', 'base', 'computerized data processing', 'frontier', 'meetings', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'single molecule', 'tool']",NIGMS,HARVARD UNIVERSITY,R01,2009,294000,-0.016052104331403184
"Visant-Predictome: A System for Integration, Mining Visualization and Analysis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent and continuing technological advances are producing large amounts of disparate data about cell structure, function and activity. This is driving the development of tools for storing, mining, analyzing, visualizing and integrating data. This proposal describes the VisANT system: a tool for visual data mining that operates on a local database which includes results from our lab, as well as automatically updated proteomics data from web accessible databases such as MIPS and BIND. In addition to accessing its own database, a name normalization table (i.e. a dictionary of identifiers), permits the system to seamlessly retrieve sequence, disease and other data from sources such as GenBank and OMIM. The visualization tool is able to reversibly group related sets of nodes, and display and duplicate their internal structure, providing an approach to hierarchical representation and modeling. We propose to build further on these unique features by including capabilities for mining and representing chemical reactions, orthologous networks, combinatorially regulated transcriptional networks, splice variants and functional hierarchies. Software is open source, and the system also allows users to exchange and integrate the networks that they discover with those of others.           n/a","Visant-Predictome: A System for Integration, Mining Visualization and Analysis",7663288,R01RR022971,"['Address', 'Archives', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bayesian Method', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Cell physiology', 'Cellular Structures', 'Chemicals', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computer Systems Development', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Dependence', 'Dependency', 'Development', 'Dictionary', 'Disease', 'Educational workshop', 'Electronic Mail', 'Genbank', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Imagery', 'Information Systems', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Names', 'Network-based', 'Online Mendelian Inheritance In Man', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Proteomics', 'RNA Splicing', 'Reaction', 'Reporting', 'Source', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Integration', 'Technology', 'Update', 'Ursidae Family', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Weight', 'base', 'chemical reaction', 'data mining', 'improved', 'meetings', 'models and simulation', 'open source', 'outreach', 'protein complex', 'protein protein interaction', 'software development', 'statistics', 'tool', 'tool development', 'web-accessible', 'wiki']",NCRR,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),R01,2009,437938,0.020187860228744976
"Methods for genomic data with graphical structures    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The broad, long-term objective of this project concerns the development of novel statistical methods and computational tools for statistical and probabilistic modeling of genomic data motivated by important biological questions and experiments. The specific aim of the current project is to develop new statistical models and methods for analysis of genomic data with graphical structures, focusing on methods for analyzing genetic pathways and networks, including the development of nonparametric pathway-smooth tests for two-sample and analysis of variance problems for identifying pathways with perturbed activity between two or multiple experimental conditions, the development of group Lasso and group threshold gradient descent regularized estimation procedures for the pathway-smoothed generalized linear models, Cox proportional hazards models and the accelerated failure time models in order to identify pathways that are related to various clinical phenotypes. These methods hinge on novel integration of spectral graph theory, non-parametric methods for analysis of multivariate data and regularized estimation methods fro statistical learning. The new methods can be applied to different types of genomic data and will ideally facilitate the identification of genes and biological pathways underlying various complex human diseases and complex biological processes. The project will also investigate the robustness, power and efficiencies o these methods and compare them with existing methods.

"Analysis of the Functional Impact of Coding region SNPs    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       During the current grant period, we have developed two models of the impact of missense SNPs on protein function in vivo. Through this work, and that of others, we now have a clearer understanding of the molecular mechanisms that lead to monogenic disease. We have also developed a web resource which integrates our results with a large range of other information relevant to disease. Goals for next phase fall into three categories: (1) Exploiting the present results to address basic questions concerning the relationship between genetic variation and disease. Specifically: What is the distribution of mechanisms by which mis-sense SNPs influence protein function; how common are epistatic (non-linear) interactions between SNPs with the same protein molecule and across protein-protein interfaces; what are the characteristics of the approximately 1500 proteins involved in monogenic disease, versus all the others; which SNPs are most significant in directly and indirectly affecting particular biological processes and susceptibility to common diseases? (2) Improving and extending SNP analysis methods, both to obtain a more extensive and reliable set of deleterious mis-sense SNPs, and to include analysis of SNPs that influence disease susceptibility through other processes. New models will be developed for effects on transcription, message processing and translation. Available database information will be augmented by a combination of literature analysis and   soliciting input from appropriate members of the scientific community. (3) Maintain and enhance the web resource to increase its utility to the research community. Functionality will be extended to allow users to input their own SNPs and receive a real time analysis from both models; a user annotation interface will be developed, to capture knowledge on the role of amino acids altered mis-sense SNPs, as well as which genes are most relevant to disease, and what buffering mechanisms shield the phenotype from particular deleterious SNPs; additional information sources will be incorporated, including SNP analysis by others.    Relevance to public health: Many common human diseases, such as heart attack, Alzheimer, asthma and diabetes, are partly inherited, through specific DNA features. At present, there is no common disease for which these inheritance mechanisms are understood. This work will provide specific insight into a number of diseases, and improved understanding of the inheritance process.              n/a",Analysis of the Functional Impact of Coding region SNPs,7625225,R01LM007174,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amino Acids', 'Asthma', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Process', 'Buffers', 'Catalysis', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Code', 'Communities', 'DNA', 'Databases', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Disease Association', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Ensure', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Ligand Binding', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molting', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Online Systems', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Set protein', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Time', 'Translation Process', 'Work', 'base', 'falls', 'human disease', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'member', 'mutant', 'programs', 'protein function', 'protein structure function']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF MD BIOTECHNOLOGY INSTITUTE,R01,2009,290689,-0.01686131732082337
"Integrated Analysis of Genome-Wide Array Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project will develop an integrated desktop application to combine data from expression array, RNA transcript array, proteomics, SNP array (for polymorphism an analysis, as well as LOH and copy number determination), methylation array, histone modification array, promoter array, and microRNA array and metabolomics technologies. Current approaches to analysis of individual `omic' technologies suffer from problems of fragmentation, that present an incomplete view of the workings of the cell. However, effective integration into a single analytic platform is non-trivial. There is a need for a consistent approach, infrastructure, and interface between array types, to maximize ease of use, while recognizing and accommodating the specific computational and statistical requirements, and biological context, of each array. A central challenge is the need to create and work with lists of genomic regions of interest (GROIs) for each sample: we propose three novel approaches to aid in identification of GROIs. These lists must then be integrated with rectangular (sample by feature) data arrays to facilitate statistical analysis. Integration between array types occurs at the computational level, through a unified software package, statistically, through tools that seek statistical relationships between features from different arrays, biologically, through use of annotations (particularly gene ontology, protein- protein and protein-DNA interactions, and pathway membership) that document functional relationships between features, and through genomic interactions that suggest relationships between features that map to the same regions of the genome. The end product will support analysis of each platform separately, with a comprehensive suite of data management, statistical and heuristic analytic tools and the means to place findings of interest into a meaningful biological context through cross-reference to extensive biobases. Beyond that, a range of methods - statistical, biological and genomic - will be available to explore interactions and associations between platforms. PDF created with PDF Factory trial version www.pdffactory.com. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: While the large-scale array technologies have provided an unprecedented capability to model cellular processes, both in normal functioning and disease states, this capability is utterly dependent on the availability of complex data management, computational, statistical and informatic software tools.  The utility of the next generation of arrays - which focus on critical regulation and control functions of the cell - will be stymied by an initial lack of suitable bioinformatic tools.  This proposal initiates an accelerated development of an integrated software package intended to empower biologists in the application and analysis of these powerful new technologies, with broadly reaching impact at all levels of biological and clinical research, and across every discipline.          n/a",Integrated Analysis of Genome-Wide Array Data,7788875,R43HG004677,"['Algorithms', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Binding', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Bite', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'DNA copy number', 'DNA-Protein Interaction', 'Data', 'Data Linkages', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Evaluation', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Heating', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Internet', 'Joints', 'Link', 'Loss of Heterozygosity', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methylation', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Ontology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phase', 'Polymorphism Analysis', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'RNA', 'Regulation', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Software Tools', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Transcript', 'Work', 'base', 'data management', 'empowered', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide analysis', 'heuristics', 'high throughput technology', 'histone modification', 'interest', 'metabolomics', 'new technology', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'prognostic', 'promoter', 'public health relevance', 'tool', 'tool development']",NHGRI,EPICENTER SOFTWARE,R43,2009,142123,0.0040126878463677875
"Integration and Visualization of Diverse Biological Data DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Currently a gap exists between the explosion of high-throughput data generation in molecular biology and the relatively slower growth of reliable functional information extracted from the data. This gap is largely due to the lack of specificity necessary for accurate gene function prediction in the currently available large-scale experimental technologies for rapid protein function assessment. Bioinformatics methods that integrate diverse data sources in their analysis achieve higher accuracy and thus alleviate this lack of specificity, but there's a paucity of generalizable, efficient, and accurate methods for data integration. In addition, no efficient methods exist to effectively display diverse genomic data, even though visualization has been very valuable for analysis of data from large scale technologies such as gene expression microarrays. The long-term goal of this proposal is to develop an accurate and generalizable bioinformatics framework for integrated analysis and visualization of heterogeneous biological data.      We propose to address the data integration problem with a Bayesian network approach and effective visualization methods. We have shown the efficacy of this method in a proof-of-principle system that increased the accuracy of gene function prediction for Saccharomyces cerevisiae compared to individual data sources. Building on our previous work, we present a two-part plan to improve and expand our system and to develop novel visualization methods for genomic data based on the scalable display technology. First, we will investigate the computational and theoretical issues behind accurate integration, analysis and effective visualization of heterogeneous high-throughput data. Then, leveraging our existing system and algorithmic improvements developed in the first part of the project, we will design and implement a full-scale data integration and function prediction system for Saccharomyces cerevisiae that will be incorporated with the Saccharomyces Genome Database (SGD), a model organism database for yeast.      The proposed system would provide highly accurate automatic function prediction that can accelerate genomic functional annotation through targeted experimental testing. Furthermore, our system will perform general integration and will offer researchers a unified view of the diverse high-throughput data through effective integration and visualization tools, thereby facilitating hypothesis generation and data analysis. Our scalable visualization methods will enable teams of researchers to examine biological data interactively and thus support the highly collaborative nature of genomic research. In addition to contributing to S. cerevisiae genomics, the technology for efficient and accurate heterogeneous data integration and visualization developed as a result of this proposal will form a basis for systems that address the same set of issues for other organisms, including the human. n/a",Integration and Visualization of Diverse Biological Data,7595813,R01GM071966,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Binding', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Consultations', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Evaluation', 'Expert Systems', 'Explosion', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Investigation', 'Knock-out', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Magic', 'Methods', 'Molecular Biology', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Online Systems', 'Organism', 'Phenotype', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Protein-Protein Interaction Map', 'Proteomics', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Saccharomyces', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Scientist', 'Side', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Staining method', 'Stains', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Two-Hybrid System Techniques', 'Universities', 'Visualization software', 'Work', 'Yeasts', 'base', 'biological systems', 'comparative', 'computer based statistical methods', 'data integration', 'design', 'flexibility', 'functional genomics', 'gene function', 'genome database', 'high throughput analysis', 'improved', 'model organisms databases', 'novel', 'parallel computing', 'programs', 'protein function', 'prototype', 'research study', 'software development', 'tandem mass spectrometry', 'tool', 'ultra high resolution', 'web interface', 'web site']",NIGMS,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,R01,2009,243004,0.007989939483026858
"Continuous-Imaging HT Screening Instrument(RMI) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Completion of the genomes of humans and several other organisms creates the foundation for translating this rich knowledge base into new products for the improvement of human medicine. A critical component of realizing the promise of genomics efforts is access to well-characterized chemical compounds that bind to and alter the activities of specific gene products. To this end, modern technologies for genome-wide expression profiling and high throughput proteomics provide the enabling foundation for large-scale chemical biology initiatives, using chemical compounds as discovery tools to probe biological pathways, thereby revealing new protein targets that alter cellular phenotypes in potentially beneficial or insightful ways. It is becoming recognized that many critical points of biological pathway regulation are predicated on protein-protein interactions rather than enzyme-based catalysis of cellular products to substrates. Thus, traditional methods of drug discovery are limited in the scope of targets they can adequately address.   Screening scientists are finding that elucidation of cellular responses to chemical compounds at critical points of biological pathway regulation can be enabled by image-based cellular assays that automatically measure protein dynamics via computer vision of pattern and organelle translocations. Subunits of membrane and intracellular receptors often respond by reorganization or translocation. In addition, cellular heterogeneities that are both physiological (e.g., cell division cycle phase-specific) or apparently random can overwhelm whole-well conventional high throughput screening HTS readouts. These are examples of the ways that cell-image-based instruments can dramatically increase the information content of automated assays. The drawback of cell-image-based screening has been that instruments imaging at medium microscopy resolution (approximately 0.5 - 2.0 mu/m with 10-40x objectives) are typically limited to about 25,000 wells per day as compared with rates of 100,000 or more wells/per day for HTS conventional whole-well plate-reader HTS systems. While higher rates have been reported, these increases have been typically achieved by sacrificing resolution (e.g., even lower magnification objectives or substantial camera binning).   Here we propose to increase the fundamental image scanning bandwidth (measured in pixels/s) by 10- fold over the current Beckman Coulter IC-100 instrument, the prototype of which was developed in Dr. Price's academic laboratory and first commercialized by Q3DM Inc. This increase will be gained by application of fundamentally new principles that parallelize auto-focus and image acquisition to scan slides and microtiter plates in long, unbroken continuous-motion multi-color strips. This will result in screening speeds of over 100,000 wells per day using medium resolution objectives (10-40x dry magnification). n/a",Continuous-Imaging HT Screening Instrument(RMI),7850408,R01EB006200,"['Address', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Biotechnology', 'Catalysis', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cellular Assay', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Color', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Development', 'Drug Industry', 'Enzymes', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Genomics', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Image', 'Institutes', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intracellular Membranes', 'Investments', 'Laboratories', 'Licensing', 'Location', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Motion', 'Optics', 'Organelles', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Price', 'Protein Dynamics', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Reader', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Robotics', 'Running', 'Scanning', 'Scientist', 'Screening procedure', 'Slide', 'Speed', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'base', 'cellular imaging', 'charge coupled device camera', 'discount', 'drug discovery', 'empowered', 'fluorescence imaging', 'genome-wide', 'high throughput screening', 'instrument', 'instrumentation', 'knowledge base', 'protein protein interaction', 'prototype', 'receptor', 'research and development', 'response', 'small molecule libraries', 'software systems', 'success', 'tool']",NIBIB,SANFORD BURNHAM PREBYS MEDICAL DISCOVERY INSTITUTE,R01,2009,26557,-0.0023456352128068928
"Improved algorithms for macromolecular structure determination by cryo-EM and NMR    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Single-particle electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) and 2D NMR spectroscopy are methods for observing the three-dimensional structures of large and small macromolecules. respectively. We propose to develop and apply novel algorithms for solving the difficult mathematical problems posed by these techniques of structural biology. In cryo-EM the experimental data consist of noisy, random projection images of macromolecular ""particles"", and the problem is finding the 3D structure which is consistent with these images. Present reconstruction techniques rely on user input or ad hoc models to initiate a refinement cycle. We propose a new algorithm, ""globally consistent angular reconstitution"" (GCAR) that provides an unbiased and direct solution to the reconstruction problem. We further propose an extension to GCAR to handle heterogeneous particle populations. We also will pursue a powerful new approach to determining class averages, ""triplet class averaging"". This should allow GCAR to be used with data having very low signal-to-noise ratios, as is commonly obtained. The experimental data from NMR consist of estimates of local distances between atoms, and the goal is to find a globally consistent coordinate system. The same theory behind GCAR, involving the properties of sparse linear operators, can be applied to obtain a fast and direct solution to the distance geometry problem. We will develop and implement all of these algorithms and test them with experimental cryo-EM and NMR data. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Determining the structures of proteins and other large molecules is an essential step in the basic understanding of biological processes, as well as the first step in rational drug design.

"ADAPTIVE PERSONALIZED INFORMATION MANAGEMENT FOR BIOLOGISTS    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We propose development of an adaptive, personalizable, information management tool, which can be configured and trained by an individual biologist to most effectively exploit the particular knowledge bases and document collections that are most useful for him or her. The proposed tool represents a novel approach for monitoring scientific progress in biology, which has become a formidable task. We will exploit recent advances in machine learning and database systems to develop a useful approximation to a personalized biological knowledge base f.i.i.e., single information resource that would include all the knowledge sources on which a biologist relies. More specifically, we propose a scheme for loosely integrating both structured information and unstructured text, and then querying the integrated information using easily-formulated similarity queries. The system will also learn from every episode in which a biologist seeks information. The research team on this project includes a computer scientist and two biologists.

"Exon recognition during constitutive pre-mRNA splicing    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The splicing together of exons during the transcription of most eukaryotic pre-mRNA molecules is a fundamental step in the transfer of information from DNA to protein. However, how the splice sites are recognized to initiate this fast and accurate process in not at all clear, since false sequences that resemble real sites outnumber the latter by 1 or 2 orders of magnitude yet are not used. We are searching for the additional information that specifies splice site recognition during pre-mRNA splicing in mammalian cells. In previous work we have used computational analysis to discover that: 1) that exon flanks 50 nt beyond the splice site consensuses can greatly influence splicing and contain sequences that stand out from the background; and 2) there are a large number of specific 8 mers that can act either as exonic splicing enhancers or splicing silencers. We will characterize both of these types of sequences, defining their base requirements, extent, position dependence, and specificity. With regard to the last, we will develop a novel exhaustive survey method that uses massively parallel solid state sequencing to identify every possible 8-mer that can be functional in a particular context, and we will compare this profile in different intronic, exonic and cellular contexts for constitutive and alternatively spliced exons. The flanking sequences fall into 2 distinct classes according to their G+C contents; we will test the idea that the rules governing exon definition differ for the two classes. To simplify the discovery of rules that govern exon definition, we will create designer exons made up of synthetic 8-mer modules we have identified as enhancers, silencers or neutral sequences. The numbers and spacing of these modules will reveal relationships that are hidden in the complexity of natural sequences. Finally, we will continue to use computation, including new machine learning algorithms, to better define intronic elements and to discover interactions between two or more features of a local sequence that define a splice site. We will also develop a Web-based exon-finding program that integrates all the information we have accumulated. Pre-mRNA splicing goes awry in a large proportion or human genetic disease cases. An understanding of the rules that govern the recognition of splice sites should help in the design of therapeutic intervention strategies to reverse such ill effects.                           n/a",Exon recognition during constitutive pre-mRNA splicing,7469442,R01GM072740,"['Algorithms', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Class', 'Computer Analysis', 'Consensus', 'DNA', 'Dependence', 'Elements', 'Enhancers', 'Exons', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Guanine + Cytosine Composition', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Heterogeneous Nuclear RNA', 'Human', 'Intervention', 'Introns', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Numbers', 'Online Systems', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'RNA Splicing', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Survey Methodology', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Work', 'base', 'design', 'falls', 'genetic selection', 'mRNA Precursor', 'novel', 'prevent', 'programs', 'size', 'solid state']",NIGMS,COLUMBIA UNIV NEW YORK MORNINGSIDE,R01,2008,291756,-0.021789151023849655
"Pathway Prediction and Assessment Integrating Multiple Evidence Types    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Metabolic pathway databases provide a biological framework in which relationships among an organism's genes may be revealed. This context can be exploited to boost the accuracy of genome annotation, to discover new targets for therapeutics, or to engineer metabolic pathways in bacteria to produce a historically expensive drug cheaply and quickly. But, knowledge of metabolism in ill-characterized species is limited and dependent on computational predictions of pathways. Our ultimate target is to develop methods for the prediction of novel metabolic pathways in any organism, coupled with robust assessment of the validity of any predicted pathway. We hypothesize that integrating evidence from multiple levels of an organism's metabolic network - from the fit of a pathway within the network to evolutionary relationships between pathways - will allow us to assess pathway validity and to predict novel metabolic pathways. We have successfully applied machine learning methods to the problem of identifying missing enzymes in metabolic pathways and believe similar methods will prove fruitful in this application. Our preliminary studies have identified several properties of predicted metabolic pathways that differ between sets of true positive pathway predictions (i.e., pathways known to occur in an organism) and sets of false positive pathway predictions. We will expand on these features and develop methods to address the following specific aims:      1) Identify features that are informative in distinguishing between correct and incorrect pathway predictions in computationally-generated pathway/genome databases based on predictions for highly-curated organisms (e.g., Escherichia coli and Arabidopsis thaliana).   2) Develop methods for computing the probability that a pathway is correctly predicted. Informative features identified in Specific Aim #1 will be integrated into a classifier that will compute the probability that a predicted pathway is correct given the associated evidence.   3) Extend the Pathologic program (the Pathway Tools algorithm used to infer the metabolic network of an organism) to predict alternate, previously unknown pathways in an organism. We will search the MetaCyc reaction space (comprising almost 6000 reactions) for novel subpathways, explicitly constraining our search using organism-specific evidence (i.e., homology, experimental evidence, etc.) at each step.          n/a",Pathway Prediction and Assessment Integrating Multiple Evidence Types,7504002,R01LM009651,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Antimalarials', 'Bacteria', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biological', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Engineering', 'Enzymes', 'Escherichia', 'Escherichia coli', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Gold', 'Government', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratory Research', 'Left', 'Machine Learning', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mouse-ear Cress', 'Organism', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Probability', 'Prodrugs', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Reaction', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Institute', 'Research Personnel', 'Scientist', 'Score', 'Series', 'Software Tools', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Yeasts', 'base', 'design', 'genome database', 'metabolomics', 'novel', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'therapeutic target', 'tool']",NLM,SRI INTERNATIONAL,R01,2008,176002,0.000558793887719735

"Annotating functional sites in 3D biological structures DESCRIPTION:    High-throughput data collection methods have revolutionized many areas of biology and medicine. The National Library of Medicine has targeted the representation, management, and manipulation of biological structure as a key element of its mission. Following upon the success of genome sequencing and functional genomics projects, the structural biology community is creating technologies to streamline the process of determining three-dimensional biological structures--with efforts in structural genomics. Like other high-throughput efforts, a major challenge for these efforts is the appropriate annotation and indexing of structures for retrieval and analysis by biologists who are trying to understand molecular function at an atomic detail: Where are the important functional sites, and how confident are we in their location?      In this proposal, we plan to develop and apply methods for annotating biological structures, so that active sites, binding sites and interaction sites in biological structures can be automatically identified and annotated. Our novel computational representation of functional sites has been successful in characterizing these sites, and recognizing them based on their biochemical and biophysical signature--a 3D motif. We propose to improve the performance of our method with basic research in the representations and algorithms used for our site models. Because our site models are manually created, our library of available models has grown slowly. We therefore further propose to accelerate the growth of our model library using a combination of supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods. First, we will use known 1D sequence motifs as ""seeds"" to create corresponding 3D motifs. Second, we will develop techniques for discovering entirely new motifs using cluster techniques. We will evaluate our models and resulting predictions through analysis of known structural sites, follow-up and dissemination of predictions with the structural genomics community, and large-scale evaluation on decoy and predicted structures. We will make the resulting models available on the Web for real-time structural annotation, and will distribute the software for open source development. n/a",Annotating functional sites in 3D biological structures,7477279,R01LM005652,"['Active Sites', 'Algorithms', 'Appendix', 'Area', 'Basic Science', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Catalysis', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Crystallography', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Failure', 'Growth', 'Informatics', 'Internet', 'Libraries', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Neighborhoods', 'Online Systems', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Resolution', 'Retrieval', 'Seeds', 'Site', 'Speed', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'United States National Library of Medicine', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'design', 'follow-up', 'functional genomics', 'genome sequencing', 'high throughput technology', 'improved', 'indexing', 'macromolecule', 'novel', 'open source', 'programs', 'size', 'structural biology', 'structural genomics', 'success', 'technology development', 'three dimensional structure', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'tool', 'vector']",NLM,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2008,338976,0.006541318629198215
"A Simulation Tool to Enable Identification of Critical Network Interactions Using    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): One of the main challenges in the discovery of intracellular biomarkers and identification of therapeutic targets is the lack of a mechanistic understanding of the complex underlying pathways. The tremendous increase in both the quantity and diversity of cellular data represents a significant challenge to researchers seeking to construct biologically relevant interaction maps, and objectively extract specific actionable information. Machine learning based clustering algorithms serve as a preliminary statistical data analysis metric, but they fail to capture the data in the proper biological context. While chemical kinetics based models have proved to be effective in elucidating the pathway mechanisms, accurate estimates for the model parameters are severely lacking and are often impossible to obtain owing to the inherent difficulties involved in making dynamic measurements of specific intracellular phenomena. Additionally, methods for rational prioritization and selection of critical intracellular interactions (in the absence of kinetic information) are sorely lacking. Therefore, there is a clear need for innovative software tools that enable quantitative analysis of available microarray data in a biological pathway context, ultimately leading to the objective identification of critical biological interactions, providing a direction for more focused future efforts. We propose to address this challenge by developing an automated software platform that utilizes microarray data to select and merge relevant canonical biological pathway models thereby placing significantly expressed genes in their biological context. The analysis software will utilize a microarray expression-weighted metric to objectively rank the most critical interactions within the network model using a novel chemical kinetics-free Boolean dynamics algorithm. In the Phase I effort, we will develop a software tool composed of an R library that enables the automated generation of a pathway model from a given microarray dataset. Additionally, a methodology, and associated R library will be developed to objectively rank critical interactions in the pathway model, using a microarray data expression-weighted metric. Demonstration and validation of proposed algorithm will be carried out using a well characterized lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophage system. In Phase II, we will extend the scope of the algorithmic framework to include proteomic and metabolomic weighting in the objective ranking of critical interactions, and add workflow improvements through the addition of a graphical user interface (GUI). Experimental verification and validation of critical interactions identified in Phase I will be carried out using gene-silencing techniques. We also intend to establish collaborative partnerships with commercial entities. The proposing team has extensive experience in the areas of systems biology and bioinformatics (CFDRC) and microarray data analysis (Shawn Levy, University of Vanderbilt). CFDRC has a strong track record in the commercialization of software and hardware. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Recently, there has been a tremendous increase in both the amount and diversity of cellular data available to researchers, representing a clear need for the development of advanced computational analysis software to enable the discovery of biomarkers of disease states, and identification of new therapeutic targets. However, currently available analysis tools do not consider the data in a proper biological context. This research proposes to develop an automated software platform that utilizes available data to develop and analyze mathematical models of complex processes in an automated fashion, resulting in the identification of critical intracellular processes.             n/a",A Simulation Tool to Enable Identification of Critical Network Interactions Using,7482734,R43GM084890,"['Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Future', 'Gene Silencing', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Kinetics', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Lipopolysaccharides', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Software Tools', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Title', 'Universities', 'Urination', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'base', 'chemical kinetics', 'commercialization', 'editorial', 'experience', 'graphical user interface', 'innovation', 'macrophage', 'mathematical model', 'metabolomics', 'network models', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'simulation', 'therapeutic target', 'tool']",NIGMS,CFD RESEARCH CORPORATION,R43,2008,99571,-0.02641691809705876
"Methods for genomic data with graphical structures    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The broad, long-term objective of this project concerns the development of novel statistical methods and computational tools for statistical and probabilistic modeling of genomic data motivated by important biological questions and experiments. The specific aim of the current project is to develop new statistical models and methods for analysis of genomic data with graphical structures, focusing on methods for analyzing genetic pathways and networks, including the development of nonparametric pathway-smooth tests for two-sample and analysis of variance problems for identifying pathways with perturbed activity between two or multiple experimental conditions, the development of group Lasso and group threshold gradient descent regularized estimation procedures for the pathway-smoothed generalized linear models, Cox proportional hazards models and the accelerated failure time models in order to identify pathways that are related to various clinical phenotypes. These methods hinge on novel integration of spectral graph theory, non-parametric methods for analysis of multivariate data and regularized estimation methods fro statistical learning. The new methods can be applied to different types of genomic data and will ideally facilitate the identification of genes and biological pathways underlying various complex human diseases and complex biological processes. The project will also investigate the robustness, power and efficiencies o these methods and compare them with existing methods. In addition, this project will develop practical a feasible computer programs in order to implement the proposed methods, to evaluate the performance o these methods through application to real data on microarray gene expression studies of human hear failure, cardiac allograft rejection and neuroblastoma. The work proposed here will contribute both statistical methodology to modeling genomic data with graphical structures, to studying complex phenotypes and biological systems and methods for high-dimensional data analysis, and offer insight into each of the clinical areas represented by the various data sets to evaluate these new methods.

"Visant-Predictome: A System for Integration, Mining Visualization and Analysis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent and continuing technological advances are producing large amounts of disparate data about cell structure, function and activity. This is driving the development of tools for storing, mining, analyzing, visualizing and integrating data. This proposal describes the VisANT system: a tool for visual data mining that operates on a local database which includes results from our lab, as well as automatically updated proteomics data from web accessible databases such as MIPS and BIND. In addition to accessing its own database, a name normalization table (i.e. a dictionary of identifiers), permits the system to seamlessly retrieve sequence, disease and other data from sources such as GenBank and OMIM. The visualization tool is able to reversibly group related sets of nodes, and display and duplicate their internal structure, providing an approach to hierarchical representation and modeling. We propose to build further on these unique features by including capabilities for mining and representing chemical reactions, orthologous networks, combinatorially regulated transcriptional networks, splice variants and functional hierarchies. Software is open source, and the system also allows users to exchange and integrate the networks that they discover with those of others.           n/a","Visant-Predictome: A System for Integration, Mining Visualization and Analysis",7457647,R01RR022971,"['Address', 'Archives', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bayesian Method', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Cell physiology', 'Cellular Structures', 'Chemicals', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Systems Development', 'Computer software', 'Condition', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Dependence', 'Dependency', 'Development', 'Dictionary', 'Disease', 'Educational workshop', 'Electronic Mail', 'Facility Construction Funding Category', 'Genbank', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Imagery', 'Information Systems', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Names', 'Network-based', 'Numbers', 'Online Mendelian Inheritance In Man', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Proteomics', 'RNA Splicing', 'Reaction', 'Reporting', 'Score', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Integration', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Tertiary Protein Structure', 'Update', 'Ursidae Family', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Weight', 'base', 'chemical reaction', 'data mining', 'improved', 'models and simulation', 'open source', 'outreach', 'protein protein interaction', 'software development', 'statistics', 'tool', 'tool development', 'web-accessible', 'wiki']",NCRR,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),R01,2008,437938,0.020187860228744976
"A Comprehensive Structural and Dynamic Map of DNA Duplex Ends    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The structure and dynamics of DNA duplex ends can influence numerous enzyme-dependent processes such as transposition of phage Mu, and integration of HIV dsDNA copies into target chromosomal DNA. Despite their critical importance in biology, DNA duplex ends are significantly under-represented in NMR and crystal structure studies, and their dynamic properties have not been measured directly. The long-term goal of this project is to establish a comprehensive dynamic and structural map of DNA duplex ends. This map will be at near angstrom precision and will include all possible combinations of base pairs for the last six positions of the DNA helix (i.e. 46 = 4096 unique sequences). The approach we will use to generate the map couples NMR spectroscopy with an instrument developed in our laboratory for single molecule measurements. This instrument is based on a nanoscale pore formed by the bacterial toxin, ?-hemolysin. When individual DNA hairpins are captured in this pore by an applied electric field, the duplex stem is suspended in the pore vestibule. Preliminary results suggest that low frequency (kHz) current noise during DNA capture is caused by structural changes of the helix terminus. The aim of this R-21 proposal is to determine if the nanopore detector gives unbiased reads of DNA duplex end structure and dynamics in the Hz to MHz range. Specific questions we will address include: 1) To what extent does the pore vestibule and the applied electric field influence DNA dynamics? 2) Are the duplex end kinetics independent of hairpin loop identity and duplex stem length? 3) There is broad consensus that some sequences are unusually rigid (e.g. A tracts) while others are highly flexible (e.g. TATA). Do these sequences cause nanopore current signatures that cluster together as predicted? 4) Can pattern recognition algorithms be used to automate data analysis? We consider this research to be suited for R-21 funding because there is substantial risk that the outcome will be negative, i.e. we may find that the observed current dynamics are only relevant to the limited case of DNA hairpins captured in a nanoscale protein cavity. However, if the research is successful, it will yield a new way to observe DNA dynamics that reports precise kinetic data, and that is amenable to high throughput experiments. These nanopore experiments will be used to direct subsequent NMR experiments and vice versa.         n/a",A Comprehensive Structural and Dynamic Map of DNA Duplex Ends,7447802,R21GM073617,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Automated Pattern Recognition', 'Bacterial Toxins', 'Bacteriophage mu', 'Base Pairing', 'Bathing', 'Behavior', 'Biology', 'Caliber', 'Canada', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 5', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Couples', 'DNA', 'DNA mapping', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Devices', 'Digestion', 'Enzymes', 'Exonuclease', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'HIV', 'Helix (Snails)', 'Hemolysin', 'Individual', 'Kinetics', 'Laboratories', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'NMR Spectroscopy', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Phase', 'Pore Proteins', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Range', 'Reading', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Residual state', 'Risk', 'Robotics', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Shapes', 'Structure', 'System', 'Teflon', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tube', 'Universities', 'Vestibule', 'base', 'detector', 'ear helix', 'electric field', 'improved', 'instrument', 'interest', 'nanopore', 'nanoscale', 'polymerization', 'professor', 'research study', 'single molecule', 'stem', 'two-dimensional']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SANTA CRUZ,R21,2008,100329,0.003175006399143536
"Analysis of the Functional Impact of Coding region SNPs    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       During the current grant period, we have developed two models of the impact of missense SNPs on protein function in vivo. Through this work, and that of others, we now have a clearer understanding of the molecular mechanisms that lead to monogenic disease. We have also developed a web resource which integrates our results with a large range of other information relevant to disease. Goals for next phase fall into three categories: (1) Exploiting the present results to address basic questions concerning the relationship between genetic variation and disease. Specifically: What is the distribution of mechanisms by which mis-sense SNPs influence protein function; how common are epistatic (non-linear) interactions between SNPs with the same protein molecule and across protein-protein interfaces; what are the characteristics of the approximately 1500 proteins involved in monogenic disease, versus all the others; which SNPs are most significant in directly and indirectly affecting particular biological processes and susceptibility to common diseases? (2) Improving and extending SNP analysis methods, both to obtain a more extensive and reliable set of deleterious mis-sense SNPs, and to include analysis of SNPs that influence disease susceptibility through other processes. New models will be developed for effects on transcription, message processing and translation. Available database information will be augmented by a combination of literature analysis and   soliciting input from appropriate members of the scientific community. (3) Maintain and enhance the web resource to increase its utility to the research community. Functionality will be extended to allow users to input their own SNPs and receive a real time analysis from both models; a user annotation interface will be developed, to capture knowledge on the role of amino acids altered mis-sense SNPs, as well as which genes are most relevant to disease, and what buffering mechanisms shield the phenotype from particular deleterious SNPs; additional information sources will be incorporated, including SNP analysis by others.    Relevance to public health: Many common human diseases, such as heart attack, Alzheimer, asthma and diabetes, are partly inherited, through specific DNA features. At present, there is no common disease for which these inheritance mechanisms are understood. This work will provide specific insight into a number of diseases, and improved understanding of the inheritance process.              n/a",Analysis of the Functional Impact of Coding region SNPs,7383901,R01LM007174,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amino Acids', 'Asthma', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Process', 'Buffers', 'Catalysis', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Code', 'Communities', 'DNA', 'Databases', 'Depth', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Disease Association', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Ensure', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Ligand Binding', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molting', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Numbers', 'Online Systems', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Range', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Set protein', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Time', 'Translation Process', 'Work', 'base', 'falls', 'human disease', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'member', 'mutant', 'programs', 'protein function', 'protein structure function']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF MD BIOTECHNOLOGY INSTITUTE,R01,2008,285166,-0.01686131732082337
"Integration and Visualization of Diverse Biological Data DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Currently a gap exists between the explosion of high-throughput data generation in molecular biology and the relatively slower growth of reliable functional information extracted from the data. This gap is largely due to the lack of specificity necessary for accurate gene function prediction in the currently available large-scale experimental technologies for rapid protein function assessment. Bioinformatics methods that integrate diverse data sources in their analysis achieve higher accuracy and thus alleviate this lack of specificity, but there's a paucity of generalizable, efficient, and accurate methods for data integration. In addition, no efficient methods exist to effectively display diverse genomic data, even though visualization has been very valuable for analysis of data from large scale technologies such as gene expression microarrays. The long-term goal of this proposal is to develop an accurate and generalizable bioinformatics framework for integrated analysis and visualization of heterogeneous biological data.      We propose to address the data integration problem with a Bayesian network approach and effective visualization methods. We have shown the efficacy of this method in a proof-of-principle system that increased the accuracy of gene function prediction for Saccharomyces cerevisiae compared to individual data sources. Building on our previous work, we present a two-part plan to improve and expand our system and to develop novel visualization methods for genomic data based on the scalable display technology. First, we will investigate the computational and theoretical issues behind accurate integration, analysis and effective visualization of heterogeneous high-throughput data. Then, leveraging our existing system and algorithmic improvements developed in the first part of the project, we will design and implement a full-scale data integration and function prediction system for Saccharomyces cerevisiae that will be incorporated with the Saccharomyces Genome Database (SGD), a model organism database for yeast.      The proposed system would provide highly accurate automatic function prediction that can accelerate genomic functional annotation through targeted experimental testing. Furthermore, our system will perform general integration and will offer researchers a unified view of the diverse high-throughput data through effective integration and visualization tools, thereby facilitating hypothesis generation and data analysis. Our scalable visualization methods will enable teams of researchers to examine biological data interactively and thus support the highly collaborative nature of genomic research. In addition to contributing to S. cerevisiae genomics, the technology for efficient and accurate heterogeneous data integration and visualization developed as a result of this proposal will form a basis for systems that address the same set of issues for other organisms, including the human. n/a",Integration and Visualization of Diverse Biological Data,7404447,R01GM071966,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Binding', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Compatible', 'Computer software', 'Consultations', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Depth', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Evaluation', 'Expert Systems', 'Explosion', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Information Systems', 'Institutes', 'Investigation', 'Knock-out', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Magic', 'Methods', 'Molecular Biology', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Online Systems', 'Organism', 'Phenotype', 'Pliability', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Protein-Protein Interaction Map', 'Proteomics', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Saccharomyces', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Scientist', 'Side', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Staining method', 'Stains', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Two-Hybrid System Techniques', 'Universities', 'Visualization software', 'Work', 'Yeasts', 'base', 'comparative', 'computer based statistical methods', 'concept', 'data integration', 'design', 'functional genomics', 'gene function', 'genome database', 'high throughput analysis', 'improved', 'model organisms databases', 'novel', 'parallel computing', 'programs', 'protein function', 'prototype', 'research study', 'software development', 'tandem mass spectrometry', 'tool', 'ultra high resolution', 'web interface']",NIGMS,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,R01,2008,243004,0.007989939483026858
"Integrated Analysis of Genome-Wide Array Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project will develop an integrated desktop application to combine data from expression array, RNA transcript array, proteomics, SNP array (for polymorphism an analysis, as well as LOH and copy number determination), methylation array, histone modification array, promoter array, and microRNA array and metabolomics technologies. Current approaches to analysis of individual `omic' technologies suffer from problems of fragmentation, that present an incomplete view of the workings of the cell. However, effective integration into a single analytic platform is non-trivial. There is a need for a consistent approach, infrastructure, and interface between array types, to maximize ease of use, while recognizing and accommodating the specific computational and statistical requirements, and biological context, of each array. A central challenge is the need to create and work with lists of genomic regions of interest (GROIs) for each sample: we propose three novel approaches to aid in identification of GROIs. These lists must then be integrated with rectangular (sample by feature) data arrays to facilitate statistical analysis. Integration between array types occurs at the computational level, through a unified software package, statistically, through tools that seek statistical relationships between features from different arrays, biologically, through use of annotations (particularly gene ontology, protein- protein and protein-DNA interactions, and pathway membership) that document functional relationships between features, and through genomic interactions that suggest relationships between features that map to the same regions of the genome. The end product will support analysis of each platform separately, with a comprehensive suite of data management, statistical and heuristic analytic tools and the means to place findings of interest into a meaningful biological context through cross-reference to extensive biobases. Beyond that, a range of methods - statistical, biological and genomic - will be available to explore interactions and associations between platforms.

The utility of the next generation of arrays - which focus on critical regulation and control functions of the cell - will be stymied by an initial lack of suitable bioinformatic tools.

"Continuous-Imaging HT Screening Instrument(RMI) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Completion of the genomes of humans and several other organisms creates the foundation for translating this rich knowledge base into new products for the improvement of human medicine. A critical component of realizing the promise of genomics efforts is access to well-characterized chemical compounds that bind to and alter the activities of specific gene products. To this end, modern technologies for genome-wide expression profiling and high throughput proteomics provide the enabling foundation for large-scale chemical biology initiatives, using chemical compounds as discovery tools to probe biological pathways, thereby revealing new protein targets that alter cellular phenotypes in potentially beneficial or insightful ways. It is becoming recognized that many critical points of biological pathway regulation are predicated on protein-protein interactions rather than enzyme-based catalysis of cellular products to substrates. Thus, traditional methods of drug discovery are limited in the scope of targets they can adequately address.   Screening scientists are finding that elucidation of cellular responses to chemical compounds at critical points of biological pathway regulation can be enabled by image-based cellular assays that automatically measure protein dynamics via computer vision of pattern and organelle translocations. Subunits of membrane and intracellular receptors often respond by reorganization or translocation. In addition, cellular heterogeneities that are both physiological (e.g., cell division cycle phase-specific) or apparently random can overwhelm whole-well conventional high throughput screening HTS readouts. These are examples of the ways that cell-image-based instruments can dramatically increase the information content of automated assays. The drawback of cell-image-based screening has been that instruments imaging at medium microscopy resolution (approximately 0.5 - 2.0 mu/m with 10-40x objectives) are typically limited to about 25,000 wells per day as compared with rates of 100,000 or more wells/per day for HTS conventional whole-well plate-reader HTS systems. While higher rates have been reported, these increases have been typically achieved by sacrificing resolution (e.g., even lower magnification objectives or substantial camera binning).   Here we propose to increase the fundamental image scanning bandwidth (measured in pixels/s) by 10- fold over the current Beckman Coulter IC-100 instrument, the prototype of which was developed in Dr. Price's academic laboratory and first commercialized by Q3DM Inc. This increase will be gained by application of fundamentally new principles that parallelize auto-focus and image acquisition to scan slides and microtiter plates in long, unbroken continuous-motion multi-color strips. This will result in screening speeds of over 100,000 wells per day using medium resolution objectives (10-40x dry magnification). n/a",Continuous-Imaging HT Screening Instrument(RMI),7471355,R01EB006200,"['Address', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Biotechnology', 'Catalysis', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cellular Assay', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Color', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Development', 'Drug Industry', 'Enzymes', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Image', 'Institutes', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intracellular Membranes', 'Investments', 'Laboratories', 'Licensing', 'Location', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Motion', 'Numbers', 'Optics', 'Organelles', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Price', 'Protein Dynamics', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Rate', 'Reader', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Robotics', 'Running', 'Scanning', 'Scientist', 'Screening procedure', 'Slide', 'Speed', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'base', 'cellular imaging', 'charge coupled device camera', 'day', 'discount', 'drug discovery', 'fluorescence imaging', 'high throughput screening', 'instrument', 'instrumentation', 'knowledge base', 'protein protein interaction', 'prototype', 'receptor', 'research and development', 'response', 'small molecule libraries', 'software systems', 'success', 'tool']",NIBIB,SANFORD BURNHAM PREBYS MEDICAL DISCOVERY INSTITUTE,R01,2008,411777,-0.0023456352128068928

"WormBase: a core data resource for C elegans and other nematodes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Caenorhabditis elegans is a major model system for basic biological and biomedical research and the first animal for which there is a complete description of its genome, anatomy and development, and some information about each of its ~22,000 genes. Five years of funding is requested to maintain and expand WormBase, a Model Organism Database (MOD), with complete coverage of core genomic, genetic, anatomical and functional information about this and other nematodes. Such a database is necessary to allow the entire biomedical research community to make full use of nematode genomic sequences. The two top priorities will be intensive data curation and user interface improvement. WormBase will include up-to-date annotation of the genomic data, the current genetic and physical maps and many experimental data such as genome-scale datasets connected to the function and interactions of cells and genes, as well as development, physiology and behavior. Direct access to the sources of biological material, such as the strain collection of the Caenorhabditis Genetics Center and direct links to data sets maintained by others will be provided. Data will be recovered from the existing resources, from direct contribution of the individual laboratories, and from the literature. While WormBase will act as a central forum through which every laboratory will be able to contribute constructively to the global effort to fully comprehend this metazoan organism, WormBase professional curators will ensure detailed attribution of data sources and check consistency and integrity. To facilitate communication, WormBase will use technology, terminology and style concordant with other databases wherever possible. WormBase will maintain ontologies for nematode anatomy and phenotypes. WormBase will be Web-based and easy to use. Multiple relational databases will be used for data management; the object-based Acedb database system will be used for integration, and this integrated database plus ""slave"" relational databases will be used to drive the website. Coordination of the project and the main curation site will be at Caltech under the supervision of a C. elegans biologist. Curation and annotation of genomic sequence will take place at the centers - the Sanger Institute and Washington University - that generated the entire genome sequence. Oxford University will maintain genetic nomenclature.  Nematodes (roundworms) are major parasites of humans, livestock and crops, and extension of WormBase to broader coverage of nematode genomics will facilitate research into the diagnosis and treatment of nematode-based disease. Studies of C. elegans have informed us of basic principles of normal development and the molecular basis of aging, cancer, nicotine addiction, as well as a variety of fundamental biological processes such as cell migration, cell differentiation and cell death.              n/a",WormBase: a core data resource for C elegans and other nematodes,7502984,P41HG002223,"['Ablation', 'Age', 'Agriculture', 'Alleles', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Antibodies', 'Architecture', 'Base Sequence', 'Behavior', 'Binding Sites', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biological Process', 'Biomedical Research', 'Caenorhabditis', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell Death', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Comparative Anatomy', 'Compatible', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Depth', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Expressed Sequence Tags', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Proteins', 'Gene Structure', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Processes', 'Genetic Recombination', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Internet', 'Knock-out', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Livestock', 'Longevity', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Mutation', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Nematoda', 'Nicotine Dependence', 'Nomenclature', 'Online Systems', 'Ontology', 'Organism', 'Paper', 'Parasites', 'Parasitic nematode', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Physical Chromosome Mapping', 'Physiology', 'Pliability', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'RNA Interference', 'Reagent', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Secure', 'Site', 'Slave', 'Source', 'Subcellular Anatomy', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Terminology', 'Tertiary Protein Structure', 'Transcript', 'Transgenes', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Washington', 'Yeasts', 'base', 'cell motility', 'chromatin immunoprecipitation', 'comparative', 'comparative genomic hybridization', 'data integration', 'data management', 'data modeling', 'design', 'experience', 'functional genomics', 'gene function', 'genetic analysis', 'genome sequencing', 'improved', 'interoperability', 'member', 'migration', 'model organisms databases', 'programs', 'research study', 'small molecule', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'usability', 'web interface', 'yeast two hybrid system']",NHGRI,CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,P41,2008,2750000,-0.02069169498447582
"Semantics and Services enabled Problem Solving Environment for Trypanosoma cruzi    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The study of complex biological systems increasingly depends on vast amounts of dynamic information from diverse sources. The scientific analysis of the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi (T.cruzi), the principal causative agent of human Chagas disease, is the driving biological application of this proposal. Approximately 18 million people, predominantly in Latin America, are infected with the T.cruzi parasite. As many as 40 percent of these are predicted eventually to suffer from Chagas disease, which is the leading cause of heart disease and sudden death in middle-aged adults in the region. Research on T. cruzi is therefore an important human disease related effort. It has reached a critical juncture with the quantities of experimental data being generated by labs around the world, due in large part to the publication of the T.cruzi genome in 2005. Although this research has the potential to improve human health significantly, the data being generated exist in independent heterogeneous databases with poor integration and accessibility. The scientific objectives of this research proposal are to develop and deploy a novel ontology-driven semantic problem-solving environment (PSE) for T.cruzi. This is in collaboration with the National Center for Biomedical Ontologies (NCBO) and will leverage its resources to achieve the objectives of this proposal as well as effectively to disseminate results to the broader life science community, including researchers in human pathogens. The PSE allows the dynamic integration of local and public data to answer biological questions at multiple levels of granularity. The PSE will utilize state-of- the-art semantic technologies for effective querying of multiple databases and, just as important, feature an intuitive and comprehensive set of interfaces for usability and easy adoption by biologists. Included in the multimodal datasets will be the genomic data and the associated bioinformatics predictions, functional information from metabolic pathways, experimental data from mass spectrometry and microarray experiments, and textual information from Pubmed. Researchers will be able to use and contribute to a rigorously curated T.cruzi knowledge base that will make it reusable and extensible. The resources developed as part of this proposal will be also useful to researchers in T.cruzi related kinetoplastids, Trypanosoma brucei and Leishmania major (among other pathogenic organisms), which use similar research protocols and face similar informatics challenges. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The scientific objective of this proposal is to develop and deploy a novel ontology-driven semantic problem-solving environment (PSE) for Trypanosoma cruzi, a parasite that infects approximately 18 million people, predominantly in Latin America. As many as 40 percent of those infected are predicted to eventually suffer from Chagas disease, the leading cause of heart disease and sudden death in middle-aged adults in the region. Facilitating T.cruzi research through the PSE, with the aim of identifying vaccine, diagnostic, and therapeutic targets, is an important human disease related endeavor.          n/a",Semantics and Services enabled Problem Solving Environment for Trypanosoma cruzi,7428761,R01HL087795,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Model', 'Anti-Retroviral Agents', 'Architecture', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Arts', 'Automobile Driving', 'Beds', 'Behavior', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Sciences', 'Biomedical Computing', 'Biomedical Research', 'Body of uterus', 'Buffaloes', 'California', 'Caring', 'Chagas Disease', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Systems Development', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Controlled Vocabulary', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Doctor of Public Health', 'Drops', 'Drosophila genus', 'Educational Activities', 'Educational workshop', 'Electronics', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Face', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gene Mutation', 'Generations', 'Generic Drugs', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Geographic Locations', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'HIV Infections', 'Health', 'Heart Diseases', 'Homologous Gene', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Imagery', 'Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes', 'Immunology', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Informatics', 'Information Management', 'Information Resources', 'Information Services', 'Information Technology', 'International', 'Internet', 'Interruption', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Organism', 'Language', 'Latin America', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Leishmania major', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Medical Informatics', 'Medicine', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metadata', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mind', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Online Mendelian Inheritance In Man', 'Online Systems', 'Ontology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Oregon', 'Organism', 'Orthologous Gene', 'Outcome', 'Parasites', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Philosophy', 'Physiology', 'Prevention strategy', 'Principal Investigator', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Proteomics', 'Protocols documentation', 'PubMed', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Purpose', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Range', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Proposals', 'Resources', 'San Francisco', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Semantics', 'Services', 'Site', 'Software Tools', 'Solutions', 'Source', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Structure', 'Study models', 'Sudden Death', 'Sum', 'System', 'TAF8 gene', 'Talents', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Training', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Trypanosoma brucei brucei', 'Trypanosoma cruzi', 'USA Georgia', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'United States National Library of Medicine', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Vaccines', 'Vertical Disease Transmission', 'Victoria Austrailia', 'Virtual Library', 'Virus', 'Western Asia Georgia', 'Work', 'Zebrafish', 'abstracting', 'base', 'biocomputing', 'biomedical scientist', 'college', 'computer based Semantic Analysis', 'computer science', 'concept', 'data integration', 'design', 'desire', 'fundamental research', 'human disease', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovative technologies', 'knowledge base', 'member', 'metabolomics', 'middle age', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'outreach', 'pandemic disease', 'pathogen', 'prevent', 'programs', 'protein protein interaction', 'repository', 'research and development', 'research study', 'syntax', 'theories', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'usability']",NHLBI,WRIGHT STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2008,393930,-0.021575440853056533
"Technology Development for a MolBio Knowledge-Base Since the introduction of the Mycin system more than 25 years ago, it has widely been hypothesized that extensive, well-represented computer knowledge-bases will facilitate a wide variety of scientific and clinical tasks. Driven by growing knowledge-management challenges adsing from the proliferation of high- throughput instrumentation, recently created knowledge-bases in areas related to genomics and related aspects of contemporary biology, such as the Gene Ontology, EcoCyc and PharmGKB, have begun to become integrated into the laboratory practices of a growing number of molecular biologists. However, these successful molecular biology knowledge-bases (MBKBs) have two drawbacks which impede their more general application: each has been narrowed to a particular special purpose, either in its domain of applicability or in the scope of knowledge represented, and each of these knowledge-bases was constructed largely on the basis of enormous human effort. Given the current state of molecular biology data and recent iadvances in database integration and information extraction technology, we proposed to test the following hypothesis: Current computational technology and existing human-curated knowledge resources are sufficient to build an extensive, high-quality computational knowledge-base of molecular biology. To test this hypothesis we propose to first create tools which can (a) automatically link incommensurate knowledge sources using semantic linking, and (b) use natural language processing techniques to extract new information from NCBrs GeneRIFs and from the GO definitions fields; and second, to evaluate the results of these methods by carefully quantifying the degree to which the induced linkages and extracted assertions are complete, consistent and correct. Although we propose to construct a broad and rich knowledge-base in order to develop and test the adequacy of largely automated methods to leverage existing human-curated collections, we do not propose to build a comprehensive MBKB. n/a",Technology Development for a MolBio Knowledge-Base,7473405,R01LM008111,"['Address', 'Area', 'Biology', 'Class', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Evaluation', 'Facility Construction Funding Category', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Human', 'Indium', 'Informatics', 'Information Resources', 'Information Resources Management', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Base (Computer)', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Metric System', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Mus', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Numbers', 'Ontology', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Plug-in', 'Proteins', 'Purpose', 'Semantics', 'Source', 'SwissProt', 'System', 'Taxonomy', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'concept', 'data integration', 'gene function', 'heuristics', 'instrumentation', 'knowledge base', 'success', 'technology development', 'tool']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R01,2007,234058,-0.018782408002261892
"Pathway Prediction and Assessment Integrating Multiple Evidence Types    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Metabolic pathway databases provide a biological framework in which relationships among an organism's genes may be revealed. This context can be exploited to boost the accuracy of genome annotation, to discover new targets for therapeutics, or to engineer metabolic pathways in bacteria to produce a historically expensive drug cheaply and quickly. But, knowledge of metabolism in ill-characterized species is limited and dependent on computational predictions of pathways. Our ultimate target is to develop methods for the prediction of novel metabolic pathways in any organism, coupled with robust assessment of the validity of any predicted pathway. We hypothesize that integrating evidence from multiple levels of an organism's metabolic network - from the fit of a pathway within the network to evolutionary relationships between pathways - will allow us to assess pathway validity and to predict novel metabolic pathways. We have successfully applied machine learning methods to the problem of identifying missing enzymes in metabolic pathways and believe similar methods will prove fruitful in this application. Our preliminary studies have identified several properties of predicted metabolic pathways that differ between sets of true positive pathway predictions (i.e., pathways known to occur in an organism) and sets of false positive pathway predictions. We will expand on these features and develop methods to address the following specific aims:      1) Identify features that are informative in distinguishing between correct and incorrect pathway predictions in computationally-generated pathway/genome databases based on predictions for highly-curated organisms (e.g., Escherichia coli and Arabidopsis thaliana).   2) Develop methods for computing the probability that a pathway is correctly predicted. Informative features identified in Specific Aim #1 will be integrated into a classifier that will compute the probability that a predicted pathway is correct given the associated evidence.   3) Extend the Pathologic program (the Pathway Tools algorithm used to infer the metabolic network of an organism) to predict alternate, previously unknown pathways in an organism. We will search the MetaCyc reaction space (comprising almost 6000 reactions) for novel subpathways, explicitly constraining our search using organism-specific evidence (i.e., homology, experimental evidence, etc.) at each step.          n/a",Pathway Prediction and Assessment Integrating Multiple Evidence Types,7301424,R01LM009651,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Antimalarials', 'Bacteria', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biological', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Engineering', 'Enzymes', 'Escherichia', 'Escherichia coli', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Gold', 'Government', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratory Research', 'Left', 'Machine Learning', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mouse-ear Cress', 'Organism', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Probability', 'Prodrugs', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Reaction', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Institute', 'Research Personnel', 'Scientist', 'Score', 'Series', 'Software Tools', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Yeasts', 'base', 'design', 'genome database', 'metabolomics', 'novel', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'therapeutic target', 'tool']",NLM,SRI INTERNATIONAL,R01,2007,173307,0.000558793887719735
"Annotating functional sites in 3D biological structures DESCRIPTION:    High-throughput data collection methods have revolutionized many areas of biology and medicine. The National Library of Medicine has targeted the representation, management, and manipulation of biological structure as a key element of its mission. Following upon the success of genome sequencing and functional genomics projects, the structural biology community is creating technologies to streamline the process of determining three-dimensional biological structures--with efforts in structural genomics. Like other high-throughput efforts, a major challenge for these efforts is the appropriate annotation and indexing of structures for retrieval and analysis by biologists who are trying to understand molecular function at an atomic detail: Where are the important functional sites, and how confident are we in their location?      In this proposal, we plan to develop and apply methods for annotating biological structures, so that active sites, binding sites and interaction sites in biological structures can be automatically identified and annotated. Our novel computational representation of functional sites has been successful in characterizing these sites, and recognizing them based on their biochemical and biophysical signature--a 3D motif. We propose to improve the performance of our method with basic research in the representations and algorithms used for our site models. Because our site models are manually created, our library of available models has grown slowly. We therefore further propose to accelerate the growth of our model library using a combination of supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods. First, we will use known 1D sequence motifs as ""seeds"" to create corresponding 3D motifs. Second, we will develop techniques for discovering entirely new motifs using cluster techniques. We will evaluate our models and resulting predictions through analysis of known structural sites, follow-up and dissemination of predictions with the structural genomics community, and large-scale evaluation on decoy and predicted structures. We will make the resulting models available on the Web for real-time structural annotation, and will distribute the software for open source development. n/a",Annotating functional sites in 3D biological structures,7282065,R01LM005652,"['Active Sites', 'Algorithms', 'Appendix', 'Area', 'Basic Science', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Catalysis', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Crystallography', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Failure', 'Growth', 'Informatics', 'Internet', 'Libraries', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Neighborhoods', 'Online Systems', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Resolution', 'Retrieval', 'Seeds', 'Site', 'Speed', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'United States National Library of Medicine', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'design', 'follow-up', 'functional genomics', 'genome sequencing', 'high throughput technology', 'improved', 'indexing', 'macromolecule', 'novel', 'open source', 'programs', 'size', 'structural biology', 'structural genomics', 'success', 'technology development', 'three dimensional structure', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'tool', 'vector']",NLM,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2007,355458,0.006541318629198215
"Bioconductor: an open computing resource for genomics    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Bioconductor project provides an open resource for the development and distribution of innovative reliable software for computational biology and bioinformatics. The range of available software is broad and rapidly growing as are both the user community and the developer community. The project maintains a web portal for delivering software and documentation to end users as well as an active mailing list. Additional services for developers include a software archive, mailing list and assistance and advice program development and design      We propose an active development strategy designed to meet new challenges while simultaneously providing user and developer support for existing tools and methods. In particular we emphasize a design strategy that accommodates the imperfect, yet evolving nature of biological knowledge and the relatively rapid development of new experimental technologies. Software solutions must be able to rapidly adapt and to facilitate new problems when they arise.      CRITQUE 1:      The Bioconductor project began in 2001. In 2002 it was awarded a BISTI grant for three years 2003-2006). During this time the project has expanded and provided support for a world wide community of researchers. This is a proposal for continued development for Bioconductor, which is a set of statistical programs which are specifically tailored to the computatational biology community. Bioconductor is composed of over 130 R packages that have been contributed by a large number of developers. The software packages range from state of the art statistical methods which typically are used in microarray analysis, to annotation tools, to plotting functions, GUIs, to sequence alignment and data management packages. Contributions to and usage of Bioconductor is growing rapidly and the applicants are requesting support to continue its development as well as general logistical support for software distribution and quality assurance. The proposal includes a research component for Bioconductor which will involve the development of analysis techniques. This will include optimization of the R statistical analyses, statistical processing of Affymetrix data, analysis of SNP data, improved standards, data storage, retreivals from NCBI, sequence management, machine learning, web services and distributed computing.      SCIENTIFIC MERIT   The applicants address many issues that are crucial to the success of a large open source project with multiple contributors. Examples of training, scientific publication, documentation and resource development run throughout the proposal. Many tangible examples were given on the usage of the system by the scientific community.        EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN   This is a description of their management workflow for the project which does a good job of demonstrating the technical excellence brought to the project by this group. 1) Build annotation packages every three months, Integrate changes in annotation source data structure into annotation package building code. 2) Maintain project website, mailing lists, source control archive. Organize web resources for short course and conferences. 3) Improve existing software. 4) Sustain automated nightly builds. Work with developers whose packages fail to pass QA. 5) Resolve cross-platform issues. 6) Review new submissions. Answer questions on the mailing lists. 7) Use software engineering best practices. Develop unit testing strategies. Design appropriate classes and methods for new data types. Refactor existing code for better interoperability and extensibility. 8) Develop and organize training materials and documentation.      Extensive detail on testing, build procedures, interoperability, quality assurance and project management is given elsewhere in the document. They clearly have dealt with many issues necessary for a project of this size. They state that one of the biggest cost items is support of this package to run on multiple platforms. They point out that many contributors focus on a single platform, much of their work is track down cross-platform bugs. This is time well-spent, given the platforms used are in sync with the needs of the greater bioinformatics community.        ORIGINALITY   While a high degree of originality is not a particularly critical element of open source software development project, there are certainly areas in the proposal that are unique. Most importantly, it is safe to say that there is not another project which has this blend of statistical analysis systems specifically tailored to a important research bioinformatics area that can be deployed on a number of different computer environments.      INVESTIGATOR AND CO-INVESTIGATORS   Dr. Gentleman is the founder and leader of the Bioconductor project. Dr. Gentlemen was an Associate Professor in the Department of Biostatistics, Harvard School of Public Health and Department of Biostatistics and Computational Biology, Dana Farber Cancer Institute. In 2004 he became Program Head, Computational Biology, at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle. He has on the order of ten publications relating to Bioconductor or related statistical analysis. He implemented the original versions of the R programming language jointly with another co-founder. He is PI or Investigator of a number of research grants, at least two are directly related to this work. He and other members of the proposal have taught a number of courses and given lectures on Bioconductor, the amount of these courses certainly indicate significant dedication to the project.  A review of the PI and Co-PI activities related to this project are shown on Table 3 on page 42 of the application. The roles and time allocations assigned to each participant appear to be reasonable.  Dr. Gentleman will serve as project leader and will manage the programmers, coordinating the project, and investigating new computational methods and approaches.  Dr. Vincent Carey, as co Principal Investigator has 20% time allocated for the project.  In 2005 he became Associate Professor of Medicine (Biostatistics). Carey is a senior member of the Bioconductor development core. He will improve interoperability to allow Bioconductor reuse of external modules in Java, Perl and other languages as well as strengthen interfaces between high throughput experimental workflows and machine learning tools, and ontology capture.  An administrative assistant will assist Dr. Carey with administrative requirements, including call coordination, manuscript preparation and distribution, scheduling and budget management.  Dr. Rafael Irizarry as co-PI will spend 30% effort on the project.  Dr. Irizarry has four years experience developing methods for microarray data analysis and in the Department of Biostatistics serving as faculty liaison to the Johns Hopkins Medical Institution's Microarray Core.  He will supervize all efforts to support preprocessing on all platforms and support for microarray related consortiums such as the ERCC, GEO, and ArrayExpress.      Programmers will be responsible for the project website, managing email lists, maintaining training materials, upgrading software, refactoring and other code enhancements, managing the svn archive, and Bioconductor releases. They will handle checking all submitted packages, developing unit tests, and simplifying downloads, nightly build procedures, cross-platform issues, data technologies as well as integrating resources found in other languages (e.g. large C libraries of routines for string handling, machine learning and so on). Programmers have familiarity with R packages and systems for database management and for parallel and distributed computing. They will be responsible for managing the annotation data including package building and liaising with organism specific and other data providers.      SIGNIFICANCE   Given the scope of the proposal, and the size of the Bioconductor project in general the request for the above resources is appropriate. There is an excellent mix of grounded project management along with development of newer state of the art techniques that will benifit many members of the bioinformatics community. There is a high probability that funding this project will help to maintain and advance this important community resource.      ENVIRONMENT   The computer infrastructure, and the local departments of the PI and Co-PIs, as well as the work with the larger scientific community are all excellent environments to support this project.      IN SUMMARY   This is a terrific resource.  It is a well managed large open source project with very well crafted QA testing, documentation and training.  Continuation of this is a three year project. Beyond that period, a statement of long term stated goals is needed. The PI should articulate the strategic goals, as well as their research motivation and translate that into an action plan. They should also use that context to describe how they would go about choosing packages that are put into the Bioconductor system; Table 3 only listed the names of the packages made by the applicants, it could have gone further to give the reader more information for choosing packages.  A simple example would have been if they stated in the document: ""Given our assessment of the microarray state of the art, we ultimately aim to overlay annotation data, ontological information, and other forms of meta data onto a statistical framework for expression data.""

"Artificial Intelligence Methods for Crystallization DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is widely believed that crystallization is the rate-limiting step in most X-ray structure determinations. We have therefore been developing computational tools to facilitate this process, including the XtalGrow suite of programs. Here we propose to improve the power and scope of these tools along two fronts: 1. Initial screening, the (iterative) set of experiments that hopefully, yields one or more preliminary ""hits"" (crystalline material that is demonstrably protein); and 2. Optimization experiments that begin with an initial hit and end with diffraction-quality crystals. A central concept of this proposal is that this tool building requires a knowledge-based foundation. Therefore, one of the broad goals of the proposal is to develop a framework for the acquisition and encoding of knowledge in computationally tractable forms; specifically, forms that will yield more effective crystallization procedures. We are interested in how the data interact and how that can be used to improve the crystallization process. While available data, both in the literature and from other projects in the laboratory will continue to be used wherever possible, our analysis has also demonstrated the need to be pro-active i.e. to gather selected data required to complete the knowledge base. We propose to do this by: I. Deepening the data representations is several areas including additional protein characteristics, incorporating a hierarchy of chemical additives and acquiring detailed response data. 11. Improving the efficiency of crystallization screens: Initial crystallization screens would be improved by applying inductive reasoning to the refinement of Bayesian belief nets; procedures would also be developed for dealing with the absence of promising results by identifying unexplored regions of the parameter space and using additional measurements, such as dynamic light scattering and cloud point determinations to further refine the Bayesian belief nets and steer experimentation in more promising directions. Optimization screens would be improved by applying Case-Based and Bayesian methods here as well as by further developments of automated image analysis. III. Improving the ""user friendliness,"" integration and automation of the entire system. n/a",Artificial Intelligence Methods for Crystallization,7269383,R01RR014477,[' '],NCRR,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2007,307022,-0.009516295489679995
"Comparative Visualization and Analysis for GCxGC    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Project Summary. This project will investigate and develop effective information technologies for comparative analysis and visualization of complex data generated by comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography (GCxGC). GCxGC is an emerging technology that provides an order-of-magnitude greater separation capacity, significantly better signal-to-noise ratio, and higher dimensional retention-structure relations than traditional GC. The principal challenge for utilization of GCxGC, in a wide range of public-health and other applications, is the difficulty of analyzing and interpreting the large, complex data it generates. The quantity and complexity of GCxGC data necessitates the investigation and development of new information technologies. This project will develop and demonstrate innovative methods and tools for comparative analysis of GCxGC datasets. The expected results of this research and development include a PCA-based method for chemical fingerprinting, decision trees with chemical constraints for sample classification, genetic programming for template and constraint-based matching and classification, and visualization methods for comparative GCxGC analyses. These methods will be implemented in commercial software that will support researchers and laboratory analysts in a wide range of commercial applications, including health care, environmental monitoring, and chemical processing. The power of GCxGC, supported by effective information technologies, will enable better understanding of chemical compositions and processes, a foundation for future scientific advances and discoveries. Relevance to Public Health. Today, a few advanced laboratories are pioneering GCxGC for a variety of applications such as environmental monitoring of exposure profiles in air, soil, food, and water; identification and quantification of toxic products in blood, urine, milk, and breath samples; and qualitative and quantitative metabolomics to provide a holistic view of the biochemical status or biochemical phenotype of an organism. Many analyses in these applications require detailed chemical comparisons of samples, e.g..monitoring changes, comparison to reference standards, chemical matching or ""fingerprinting"", and classification. GCxGC is a powerful new technology for such comparative analyses. This proposal will provide innovative information technologies to support users in these applications.           n/a",Comparative Visualization and Analysis for GCxGC,7270029,R44RR020256,"['Air', 'Archives', 'Biochemical', 'Blood', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Environmental Monitoring', 'Fingerprint', 'Food', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gas Chromatography', 'Genetic Programming', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Information Technology', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Machine Learning', 'Marketing', 'Methods', 'Milk', 'Monitor', 'Noise', 'Organism', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Range', 'Reference Standards', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Sales', 'Sampling', 'Schedule', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'Soil', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Today', 'Trademark', 'Urine', 'Water', 'base', 'chemical fingerprinting', 'commercial application', 'comparative', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'instrument', 'metabolomics', 'new technology', 'research and development', 'tool', 'two-dimensional']",NCRR,"GC IMAGE, LLC",R44,2007,239373,-0.01141068869860568
"Methods for genomic data with graphical structures    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The broad, long-term objective of this project concerns the development of novel statistical methods and computational tools for statistical and probabilistic modeling of genomic data motivated by important biological questions and experiments. The specific aim of the current project is to develop new statistical models and methods for analysis of genomic data with graphical structures, focusing on methods for analyzing genetic pathways and networks, including the development of nonparametric pathway-smooth tests for two-sample and analysis of variance problems for identifying pathways with perturbed activity between two or multiple experimental conditions, the development of group Lasso and group threshold gradient descent regularized estimation procedures for the pathway-smoothed generalized linear models, Cox proportional hazards models and the accelerated failure time models in order to identify pathways that are related to various clinical phenotypes. These methods hinge on novel integration of spectral graph theory, non-parametric methods for analysis of multivariate data and regularized estimation methods fro statistical learning. The new methods can be applied to different types of genomic data and will ideally facilitate the identification of genes and biological pathways underlying various complex human diseases and complex biological processes. The project will also investigate the robustness, power and efficiencies o these methods and compare them with existing methods. In addition, this project will develop practical a feasible computer programs in order to implement the proposed methods, to evaluate the performance o these methods through application to real data on microarray gene expression studies of human hear failure, cardiac allograft rejection and neuroblastoma. The work proposed here will contribute both statistical methodology to modeling genomic data with graphical structures, to studying complex phenotypes and biological systems and methods for high-dimensional data analysis, and offer insight into each of the clinical areas represented by the various data sets to evaluate these new methods.

"Visant-Predictome: A System for Integration, Mining Visualization and Analysis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent and continuing technological advances are producing large amounts of disparate data about cell structure, function and activity. This is driving the development of tools for storing, mining, analyzing, visualizing and integrating data. This proposal describes the VisANT system: a tool for visual data mining that operates on a local database which includes results from our lab, as well as automatically updated proteomics data from web accessible databases such as MIPS and BIND. In addition to accessing its own database, a name normalization table (i.e. a dictionary of identifiers), permits the system to seamlessly retrieve sequence, disease and other data from sources such as GenBank and OMIM. The visualization tool is able to reversibly group related sets of nodes, and display and duplicate their internal structure, providing an approach to hierarchical representation and modeling. We propose to build further on these unique features by including capabilities for mining and representing chemical reactions, orthologous networks, combinatorially regulated transcriptional networks, splice variants and functional hierarchies.

"A Comprehensive catalog of human DNasel hypersensitive sites    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   The overall aim of this proposal is to establish a comprehensive, high-quality catalogue of human DNaseI hypersensitive sites (DHSs) spanning all major tissue lineages. We plan to map DNaseI hypersensitive sites at physiological resolution across the genome with high sensitivity and specificity. The major focus of our production effort will be on data quality, a strategy that served the Human Genome Project well. Accordingly, samples will be rigorously screened in a pipeline fashion, with only a select set advancing to whole-genome data collection (Specific Aim 1). To ensure the broadest possible coverage of both unique and non-unique genomic territories, a synergistic combination of three technologies (DNase-array, digital mapping of DNAasel cleave site sequences, and Quantitative Chromatin Profiling) will be applied (Specific Aim 2). This combination will enable mapping of >95% of the DHSs in the genome of each cell type. Independent validation provides the ultimate quality standard. We therefore plan to validate the DHS catalogue in a statistically rigorous fashion using hypersensitivity Southerns, a well-established, gold standard assay (Specific Aim 3). Since DNAasel hypersensitive sites are generic markers of a broad spectrum of human cis-regulatory sequences, the utility of the catalogue will be greatly enhanced by the classification of DHSs into major functional categories including promoters, distal elements (enhancers, LCRs), and insulators (Specific Aim 4). Validation of DHS functional classes will be accomplished using well-tested cell and transgenic assays of biological function (Specific Aim 5).           n/a",A Comprehensive catalog of human DNasel hypersensitive sites,7410206,U54HG004592,"['Algorithms', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Biological Testing', 'Biology', 'Boundary Elements', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Categories', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Class', 'Classification', 'Cleaved cell', 'Communities', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Quality', 'Deoxyribonuclease I', 'Deoxyribonucleases', 'Detection', 'Digestion', 'Distal', 'Distal Enhancer Elements', 'Elements', 'Employee Strikes', 'Enhancers', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Generations', 'Generic Drugs', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Histones', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Human Genome Project', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Laboratories', 'Locales', 'Locus Control Region', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Noise', 'Numbers', 'Physiological', 'Pilot Projects', 'Plague', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Preparation', 'Production', 'Public Domains', 'Range', 'Rate', 'Regulation', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resolution', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Score', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Staging', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Validation', 'base', 'cell type', 'cost', 'density', 'design', 'digital', 'experience', 'functional genomics', 'high throughput screening', 'human tissue', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'promoter']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,U54,2007,3114596,-0.03201686960851035
"A Comprehensive Structural and Dynamic Map of DNA Duplex Ends    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The structure and dynamics of DNA duplex ends can influence numerous enzyme-dependent processes such as transposition of phage Mu, and integration of HIV dsDNA copies into target chromosomal DNA. Despite their critical importance in biology, DNA duplex ends are significantly under-represented in NMR and crystal structure studies, and their dynamic properties have not been measured directly. The long-term goal of this project is to establish a comprehensive dynamic and structural map of DNA duplex ends. This map will be at near angstrom precision and will include all possible combinations of base pairs for the last six positions of the DNA helix (i.e. 46 = 4096 unique sequences). The approach we will use to generate the map couples NMR spectroscopy with an instrument developed in our laboratory for single molecule measurements. This instrument is based on a nanoscale pore formed by the bacterial toxin, ?-hemolysin. When individual DNA hairpins are captured in this pore by an applied electric field, the duplex stem is suspended in the pore vestibule. Preliminary results suggest that low frequency (kHz) current noise during DNA capture is caused by structural changes of the helix terminus. The aim of this R-21 proposal is to determine if the nanopore detector gives unbiased reads of DNA duplex end structure and dynamics in the Hz to MHz range. Specific questions we will address include: 1) To what extent does the pore vestibule and the applied electric field influence DNA dynamics? 2) Are the duplex end kinetics independent of hairpin loop identity and duplex stem length? 3) There is broad consensus that some sequences are unusually rigid (e.g. A tracts) while others are highly flexible (e.g. TATA). Do these sequences cause nanopore current signatures that cluster together as predicted? 4) Can pattern recognition algorithms be used to automate data analysis? We consider this research to be suited for R-21 funding because there is substantial risk that the outcome will be negative, i.e. we may find that the observed current dynamics are only relevant to the limited case of DNA hairpins captured in a nanoscale protein cavity. However, if the research is successful, it will yield a new way to observe DNA dynamics that reports precise kinetic data, and that is amenable to high throughput experiments. These nanopore experiments will be used to direct subsequent NMR experiments and vice versa.         n/a",A Comprehensive Structural and Dynamic Map of DNA Duplex Ends,7229898,R21GM073617,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Automated Pattern Recognition', 'Bacterial Toxins', 'Bacteriophage mu', 'Base Pairing', 'Bathing', 'Behavior', 'Biology', 'Caliber', 'Canada', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 5', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Couples', 'DNA', 'DNA mapping', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Devices', 'Digestion', 'Enzymes', 'Exonuclease', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'HIV', 'Helix (Snails)', 'Hemolysin', 'Individual', 'Kinetics', 'Laboratories', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'NMR Spectroscopy', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Phase', 'Pore Proteins', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Range', 'Reading', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Residual state', 'Risk', 'Robotics', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Shapes', 'Structure', 'System', 'Teflon', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tube', 'Universities', 'Vestibule', 'base', 'detector', 'ear helix', 'electric field', 'improved', 'instrument', 'interest', 'nanopore', 'nanoscale', 'polymerization', 'professor', 'research study', 'single molecule', 'stem', 'two-dimensional']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SANTA CRUZ,R21,2007,143598,0.003175006399143536
"Analysis of the Functional Impact of Coding region SNPs    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       During the current grant period, we have developed two models of the impact of missense SNPs on protein function in vivo. Through this work, and that of others, we now have a clearer understanding of the molecular mechanisms that lead to monogenic disease. We have also developed a web resource which integrates our results with a large range of other information relevant to disease. Goals for next phase fall into three categories: (1) Exploiting the present results to address basic questions concerning the relationship between genetic variation and disease. Specifically: What is the distribution of mechanisms by which mis-sense SNPs influence protein function; how common are epistatic (non-linear) interactions between SNPs with the same protein molecule and across protein-protein interfaces; what are the characteristics of the approximately 1500 proteins involved in monogenic disease, versus all the others; which SNPs are most significant in directly and indirectly affecting particular biological processes and susceptibility to common diseases? (2) Improving and extending SNP analysis methods, both to obtain a more extensive and reliable set of deleterious mis-sense SNPs, and to include analysis of SNPs that influence disease susceptibility through other processes. New models will be developed for effects on transcription, message processing and translation. Available database information will be augmented by a combination of literature analysis and   soliciting input from appropriate members of the scientific community. (3) Maintain and enhance the web resource to increase its utility to the research community. Functionality will be extended to allow users to input their own SNPs and receive a real time analysis from both models; a user annotation interface will be developed, to capture knowledge on the role of amino acids altered mis-sense SNPs, as well as which genes are most relevant to disease, and what buffering mechanisms shield the phenotype from particular deleterious SNPs; additional information sources will be incorporated, including SNP analysis by others.    Relevance to public health: Many common human diseases, such as heart attack, Alzheimer, asthma and diabetes, are partly inherited, through specific DNA features. At present, there is no common disease for which these inheritance mechanisms are understood. This work will provide specific insight into a number of diseases, and improved understanding of the inheritance process.              n/a",Analysis of the Functional Impact of Coding region SNPs,7214011,R01LM007174,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amino Acids', 'Asthma', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Process', 'Buffers', 'Catalysis', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Code', 'Communities', 'DNA', 'Databases', 'Depth', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Disease Association', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Ensure', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Ligand Binding', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molting', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Numbers', 'Online Systems', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Range', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Set protein', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Time', 'Translation Process', 'Work', 'base', 'falls', 'human disease', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'member', 'mutant', 'programs', 'protein function', 'protein structure function']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF MD BIOTECHNOLOGY INSTITUTE,R01,2007,312439,-0.01686131732082337
"Integration and Visualization of Diverse Biological Data DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Currently a gap exists between the explosion of high-throughput data generation in molecular biology and the relatively slower growth of reliable functional information extracted from the data. This gap is largely due to the lack of specificity necessary for accurate gene function prediction in the currently available large-scale experimental technologies for rapid protein function assessment. Bioinformatics methods that integrate diverse data sources in their analysis achieve higher accuracy and thus alleviate this lack of specificity, but there's a paucity of generalizable, efficient, and accurate methods for data integration. In addition, no efficient methods exist to effectively display diverse genomic data, even though visualization has been very valuable for analysis of data from large scale technologies such as gene expression microarrays. The long-term goal of this proposal is to develop an accurate and generalizable bioinformatics framework for integrated analysis and visualization of heterogeneous biological data.      We propose to address the data integration problem with a Bayesian network approach and effective visualization methods. We have shown the efficacy of this method in a proof-of-principle system that increased the accuracy of gene function prediction for Saccharomyces cerevisiae compared to individual data sources. Building on our previous work, we present a two-part plan to improve and expand our system and to develop novel visualization methods for genomic data based on the scalable display technology. First, we will investigate the computational and theoretical issues behind accurate integration, analysis and effective visualization of heterogeneous high-throughput data. Then, leveraging our existing system and algorithmic improvements developed in the first part of the project, we will design and implement a full-scale data integration and function prediction system for Saccharomyces cerevisiae that will be incorporated with the Saccharomyces Genome Database (SGD), a model organism database for yeast.      The proposed system would provide highly accurate automatic function prediction that can accelerate genomic functional annotation through targeted experimental testing. Furthermore, our system will perform general integration and will offer researchers a unified view of the diverse high-throughput data through effective integration and visualization tools, thereby facilitating hypothesis generation and data analysis. Our scalable visualization methods will enable teams of researchers to examine biological data interactively and thus support the highly collaborative nature of genomic research. In addition to contributing to S. cerevisiae genomics, the technology for efficient and accurate heterogeneous data integration and visualization developed as a result of this proposal will form a basis for systems that address the same set of issues for other organisms, including the human. n/a",Integration and Visualization of Diverse Biological Data,7214148,R01GM071966,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Binding', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Compatible', 'Computer software', 'Consultations', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Depth', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Evaluation', 'Expert Systems', 'Explosion', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Information Systems', 'Institutes', 'Investigation', 'Knock-out', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Magic', 'Methods', 'Molecular Biology', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Online Systems', 'Organism', 'Phenotype', 'Pliability', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Protein-Protein Interaction Map', 'Proteomics', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Saccharomyces', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Scientist', 'Side', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Staining method', 'Stains', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Two-Hybrid System Techniques', 'Universities', 'Visualization software', 'Work', 'Yeasts', 'base', 'comparative', 'computer based statistical methods', 'concept', 'data integration', 'design', 'functional genomics', 'gene function', 'genome database', 'high throughput analysis', 'improved', 'model organisms databases', 'novel', 'parallel computing', 'programs', 'protein function', 'prototype', 'research study', 'software development', 'tandem mass spectrometry', 'tool', 'ultra high resolution', 'web interface']",NIGMS,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,R01,2007,240927,0.007989939483026858
"Generation and Description of Dendritic Morphology    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This continuing project is directed at describing dendrite structure in a compact yet sufficiently complete and detailed fashion to allow the computer generation of morphologically accurate neuronal models. Dendrite morphology plays a fundamental role in physiological and pathological brain function by subserving and shaping network connectivity and by integrating the complex pattern of synaptic inputs received by the neuron. A parsimonious and algorithmic description of dendritic shape is a crucial step towards the quantitative characterization of the structure-activity relationship in the nervous system and it constitutes an effective way to represent, compress, store, exchange, and amplify extremely complex neuroanatomical data. Neuroanatomical algorithms and models have been developed to simulate and quantitatively analyze the three-dimensional structure of dendritic trees in the same format used to represent experimentally reconstructed neurons.      The specific aims of this project are: (1) to expand and improve neuroanatomically plausible algorithms of dendritic structure and development by including determinants of three-dimensional branch orientation and dependence of growth upon local and global influences (e.g. diameter and neuronal size, respectively); (2) to enhance and distribute the analysis, modeling, and data basing software in order to provide experimental and computational neuroscientists with web-based tools to query, retrieve, measure, classify, and synthesize dendritic morphology data; (3) to continue the experimental reconstruction and analysis of hippocampal pyramidal cells and spinal motoneurons with different experimental protocols and in early postnatal periods; and to integrate these data with detailed biophysical models of neuronal electrophysiology. The informatics and neuroscience components of this research are deeply intertwined and span a variety of scientific approaches, including ""wet"" experiments, computational simulations, statistical analysis and data mining.

"Continuous-Imaging HT Screening Instrument(RMI) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Completion of the genomes of humans and several other organisms creates the foundation for translating this rich knowledge base into new products for the improvement of human medicine. A critical component of realizing the promise of genomics efforts is access to well-characterized chemical compounds that bind to and alter the activities of specific gene products. To this end, modern technologies for genome-wide expression profiling and high throughput proteomics provide the enabling foundation for large-scale chemical biology initiatives, using chemical compounds as discovery tools to probe biological pathways, thereby revealing new protein targets that alter cellular phenotypes in potentially beneficial or insightful ways. It is becoming recognized that many critical points of biological pathway regulation are predicated on protein-protein interactions rather than enzyme-based catalysis of cellular products to substrates. Thus, traditional methods of drug discovery are limited in the scope of targets they can adequately address.   Screening scientists are finding that elucidation of cellular responses to chemical compounds at critical points of biological pathway regulation can be enabled by image-based cellular assays that automatically measure protein dynamics via computer vision of pattern and organelle translocations. Subunits of membrane and intracellular receptors often respond by reorganization or translocation. In addition, cellular heterogeneities that are both physiological (e.g., cell division cycle phase-specific) or apparently random can overwhelm whole-well conventional high throughput screening HTS readouts. These are examples of the ways that cell-image-based instruments can dramatically increase the information content of automated assays. The drawback of cell-image-based screening has been that instruments imaging at medium microscopy resolution (approximately 0.5 - 2.0 mu/m with 10-40x objectives) are typically limited to about 25,000 wells per day as compared with rates of 100,000 or more wells/per day for HTS conventional whole-well plate-reader HTS systems. While higher rates have been reported, these increases have been typically achieved by sacrificing resolution (e.g., even lower magnification objectives or substantial camera binning).   Here we propose to increase the fundamental image scanning bandwidth (measured in pixels/s) by 10- fold over the current Beckman Coulter IC-100 instrument, the prototype of which was developed in Dr. Price's academic laboratory and first commercialized by Q3DM Inc. This increase will be gained by application of fundamentally new principles that parallelize auto-focus and image acquisition to scan slides and microtiter plates in long, unbroken continuous-motion multi-color strips. This will result in screening speeds of over 100,000 wells per day using medium resolution objectives (10-40x dry magnification). n/a",Continuous-Imaging HT Screening Instrument(RMI),7264516,R01EB006200,"['Address', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Biotechnology', 'Catalysis', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cellular Assay', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Color', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Development', 'Drug Industry', 'Enzymes', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Image', 'Institutes', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intracellular Membranes', 'Investments', 'Laboratories', 'Licensing', 'Location', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Motion', 'Numbers', 'Optics', 'Organelles', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Price', 'Protein Dynamics', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Rate', 'Reader', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Robotics', 'Running', 'Scanning', 'Scientist', 'Screening procedure', 'Slide', 'Speed', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'base', 'cellular imaging', 'charge coupled device camera', 'day', 'discount', 'drug discovery', 'fluorescence imaging', 'high throughput screening', 'instrument', 'instrumentation', 'knowledge base', 'protein protein interaction', 'prototype', 'receptor', 'research and development', 'response', 'small molecule libraries', 'software systems', 'success', 'tool']",NIBIB,SANFORD-BURNHAM MEDICAL RESEARCH INSTIT,R01,2007,387827,-0.0023456352128068928
"Bayesian Methods and Experimental Design for Molecular Biology Experiments    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this proposal is to provide a suite of software tools for bioinformatics and systems biology researchers who are using molecular biology (Omics) data to identify the best experimental design and to analyze the resulting experimental data using Bayesian tools. A common problem for most bioinformatics experiments is low power due to low replication. This problem can be alleviated economically when an increase in adoption and use of a specific platform leads to a decrease in associated costs, thereby enabling an increase in samples allocated per treatment. Yet, many bioinformatics experiments remain underpowered as researchers use the offsets of decreased costs to explore more complex questions. When designing an experiment, the allocation of samples to treatment regimens, and the choice of treatments to test, are traditionally the only variables to manipulate. Bayesian experimental design provides a framework to find the optimal design out of n possible designs subject to a utility function that can include such items as time and material costs.      Bayesian statistical methods have been gaining substantial favor in bioinformatics and systems biology as they provide a highly flexible framework for fitting and exploring complex models. Bayesian models also provides to domain experts such as biologists and physicians easily interpretable models through posterior probabilities which are more naturally understood than the traditional p-value. While a number of open source tools based on Bayesian models are available, most are applied best in the context of a specific research data analysis problem or model and are not integrated into a single, complete system for data analysis.      We propose to research and develop a statistical analysis software package S+OBAYES (for S-PLUS and R) with generalized tools for Bayesian design of experiments, empirical and fully Bayesian analysis, and modeling and simulation using modern commercial software development practices. These tools will provide functionality for finding the optimal choice and layout of experimental treatments for molecular biology experiments and for fitting Bayesian linear and non-linear models to a variety of data types including time series. We propose to validate the software in molecular biology research problems such as the detection of differential gene, protein, and metabolite abundance. The benefits of this work will be a commercial-quality software package with validated statistical methodology and interactive visualization tools that will appeal to molecular biologists and systems biology investigators. The results of the proposed work will expedite discoveries in basic science, early disease detection, and drug discovery and development.          n/a",Bayesian Methods and Experimental Design for Molecular Biology Experiments,7325828,R43GM083023,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Genetics', 'Arizona', 'Basic Science', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Bayesian Method', 'Bioconductor', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Sciences', 'Biometry', 'Biotechnology', 'Cations', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Department of Defense', 'Depth', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Educational workshop', 'Employment', 'Ensure', 'Experimental Designs', 'Exposure to', 'Factor Analysis', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Government Agencies', 'Health', 'Imagery', 'Industry', 'Information Systems', 'Institution', 'Iowa', 'Libraries', 'Linear Models', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Manuscripts', 'Maps', 'Marketing', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measures', 'Medical Informatics', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Non-linear Models', 'Numbers', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Population Study', 'Principal Investigator', 'Probability', 'Property', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Proxy', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rice', 'Risk Factors', 'SNP genotyping', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Services', 'Simulate', 'Small Business Funding Mechanisms', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Software Tools', 'Software Validation', 'Solutions', 'Speed', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Telecommunications', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'Training', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Washington', 'Wisconsin', 'Work', 'animal breeding', 'base', 'cost', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'experience', 'human subject', 'improved', 'interest', 'lecturer', 'models and simulation', 'open source', 'professor', 'programs', 'protein metabolite', 'research and development', 'research study', 'skills', 'software development', 'statistics', 'success', 'theories', 'tool', 'treatment effect']",NIGMS,INSIGHTFUL CORPORATION,R43,2007,103995,0.007511262178415306
"Accelerating metabolic discovery using characterization data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long term goal of this project is to develop methods that will allow researchers to gain insight into the metabolic networks of organisms for which we have little or no high-throughput data. Such metabolic networks can reveal aspects of the organism's metabolism that might make it vulnerable to new or existing therapies. A core data set using genomic and other omic data from data-rich bacteria that are related to the organisms of interest will be assembled. The statistical tools needed to integrate these data and to infer metabolic networks using these core data plus characterization (phenotypic) data will then be built. Using the statistical inference algorithms, the characterization data can be leveraged to reveal the metabolic networks of data-poor bacteria for which we have only characterization data. This approach can eliminate the need for genome sequencing, gene expression experiments and the like for thousands of Gram-negative facultative rod bacteria (GNF). There are five tasks in the project: (1) assemble the data sets from data-rich organisms that will be used to inform the inference algorithm. These data include (a) the genomic sequences and annotation information, (b) extant pathway data and (c) gene expression data. All these data contain some level of information about the connectivity within the metabolic network; (2) process the genomic data to enhance its predictive value; (3) develop a data integration algorithm; (4) investigate modeling frameworks to be used for Bayesian data fusion and network inference; (5) validate the metabolic networks. Deliverables from this project should include: (1) a set of pathway genome databases for 35 GNF, This group includes 20 strains classified as category A or B biothreat agents, (2) a core dataset that integrates all the information we have relevant to the metabolic pathways in the 35 sequenced GNF, (3) a probabilistic graphical modeling framework capable of integrating disparate types of data and inferring networks from the integrated data, (4) a method for using characterization data, along with deliverables 2 and 3, to infer metabolic networks for bacterial strains for which we have only characterization data. The ability to rapidly construct models of metabolic networks means researchers will be able to respond to emerging infectious agents or biothreats more quickly. Relevance The methods developed as part of this proposal will allow us to quickly make metabolic maps for thousands of bacteria. Such maps can guide researchers to promising new targets for therapeutic or preventative measures against pathogenic bacteria. The fight against well-known pathogens and biothreat agents, as well as against new, emerging pathogens will be greatly aided by these tools.              n/a",Accelerating metabolic discovery using characterization data,7267998,R21AI067543,"['Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'American Type Culture Collection', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Bacteria', 'Bacteriology', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Bypass', 'Categories', 'Cholera', 'Code', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Depth', 'Disease', 'Electronics', 'Facility Construction Funding Category', 'Gammaproteobacteria', 'Gene Expression', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Gram&apos', 's stain', 'Infectious Agent', 'Information Networks', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nosocomial Infections', 'Numbers', 'Nutritional', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Oxygen', 'Pathway interactions', 'Plague', 'Predictive Value', 'Process', 'Prophylactic treatment', 'Proteomics', 'Research Personnel', 'Salmonella typhi', 'Shapes', 'Shigella', 'Shigella Infections', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Typhoid Fever', 'Variant', 'Vibrio cholerae', 'Work', 'Writing', 'Yersinia pestis', 'biothreat', 'computerized data processing', 'data integration', 'design', 'falls', 'fight against', 'genome database', 'genome sequencing', 'gram negative facultative rods', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'network models', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'programs', 'research study', 'retinal rods', 'routine Bacterial stain', 'sound', 'success', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'transcriptomics']",NIAID,AMERICAN TYPE CULTURE COLLECTION,R21,2007,185677,-0.013412795148033025
"Exon recognition during constitutive pre-mRNA splicing    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The splicing together of exons during the transcription of most eukaryotic pre-mRNA molecules is a fundamental step in the transfer of information from DNA to protein. However, how the splice sites are recognized to initiate this fast and accurate process in not at all clear, since false sequences that resemble real sites outnumber the latter by 1 or 2 orders of magnitude yet are not used. We are searching for the additional information that specifies splice site recognition during pre-mRNA splicing in mammalian cells. In previous work we have used computational analysis to discover that: 1) that exon flanks 50 nt beyond the splice site consensuses can greatly influence splicing and contain sequences that stand out from the background; and 2) there are a large number of specific 8 mers that can act either as exonic splicing enhancers or splicing silencers. We will characterize both of these types of sequences, defining their base requirements, extent, position dependence, and specificity. With regard to the last, we will develop a novel exhaustive survey method that uses massively parallel solid state sequencing to identify every possible 8-mer that can be functional in a particular context, and we will compare this profile in different intronic, exonic and cellular contexts for constitutive and alternatively spliced exons. The flanking sequences fall into 2 distinct classes according to their G+C contents; we will test the idea that the rules governing exon definition differ for the two classes. To simplify the discovery of rules that govern exon definition, we will create designer exons made up of synthetic 8-mer modules we have identified as enhancers, silencers or neutral sequences. The numbers and spacing of these modules will reveal relationships that are hidden in the complexity of natural sequences. Finally, we will continue to use computation, including new machine learning algorithms, to better define intronic elements and to discover interactions between two or more features of a local sequence that define a splice site. We will also develop a Web-based exon-finding program that integrates all the information we have accumulated. Pre-mRNA splicing goes awry in a large proportion or human genetic disease cases. An understanding of the rules that govern the recognition of splice sites should help in the design of therapeutic intervention strategies to reverse such ill effects.                           n/a",Exon recognition during constitutive pre-mRNA splicing,7261326,R01GM072740,[' '],NIGMS,COLUMBIA UNIV NEW YORK MORNINGSIDE,R01,2007,290853,-0.021789151023849655
"Artificial Intelligence Methods for Crystallization DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is widely believed that crystallization is the rate-limiting step in most X-ray structure determinations. We have therefore been developing computational tools to facilitate this process, including the XtalGrow suite of programs. Here we propose to improve the power and scope of these tools along two fronts: 1. Initial screening, the (iterative) set of experiments that hopefully, yields one or more preliminary ""hits"" (crystalline material that is demonstrably protein); and 2. Optimization experiments that begin with an initial hit and end with diffraction-quality crystals. A central concept of this proposal is that this tool building requires a knowledge-based foundation. Therefore, one of the broad goals of the proposal is to develop a framework for the acquisition and encoding of knowledge in computationally tractable forms; specifically, forms that will yield more effective crystallization procedures. We are interested in how the data interact and how that can be used to improve the crystallization process. While available data, both in the literature and from other projects in the laboratory will continue to be used wherever possible, our analysis has also demonstrated the need to be pro-active i.e. to gather selected data required to complete the knowledge base. We propose to do this by: I. Deepening the data representations is several areas including additional protein characteristics, incorporating a hierarchy of chemical additives and acquiring detailed response data. 11. Improving the efficiency of crystallization screens: Initial crystallization screens would be improved by applying inductive reasoning to the refinement of Bayesian belief nets; procedures would also be developed for dealing with the absence of promising results by identifying unexplored regions of the parameter space and using additional measurements, such as dynamic light scattering and cloud point determinations to further refine the Bayesian belief nets and steer experimentation in more promising directions. Optimization screens would be improved by applying Case-Based and Bayesian methods here as well as by further developments of automated image analysis. III.

"Technology Development for a MolBio Knowledge-Base   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Since the introduction of the Mycin system more than 25 years ago, it has widely been hypothesized that extensive, well-represented computer knowledge-bases will facilitate a wide variety of scientific and clinical tasks. Driven by growing knowledge-management challenges arising from the proliferation of high throughput instrumentation, recently created knowledge-bases in areas related to genomics and related aspects of contemporary biology, such as the Gene Ontology, EcoCyc and PharmGKB, have begun to become integrated into the laboratory practices of a growing number of molecular biologists. However, these successful molecular biology knowledge-bases (MBKBs) have two drawbacks which impede their more general application: each has been narrowed to a particular special purpose, either in its domain of applicability or in the scope of knowledge represented, and each of these knowledge-bases was constructed largely on the basis of enormous human effort. Given the current state of molecular biology data and recent advances in database integration and information extraction technology, we proposed to test the following hypothesis: Current computational technology and existing human-curated knowledge resources are sufficient to build an extensive, high-quality computational knowledge-base of molecular biology. To test this hypothesis we propose to first create tools which can (a) automatically link incommensurate knowledge sources using semantic linking, and (b) use natural language processing techniques to extract new information from NCBrs GeneRIFs and from the GO definitions fields; and second, to evaluate the results of these methods by carefully quantifying the degree to which the induced linkages and extracted assertions are complete, consistent and correct. Although we propose to construct a broad and rich knowledge-base in order to develop and test the adequacy of largely automated methods to leverage existing human-curated collections, we do not propose to build a comprehensive MBKB.            n/a",Technology Development for a MolBio Knowledge-Base,7123058,R01LM008111,"['artificial intelligence', 'bioinformatics', 'biomedical automation', 'computational biology', 'computer program /software', 'functional /structural genomics', 'information retrieval', 'molecular biology information system', 'technology /technique development']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R01,2006,611872,-0.01741918242305169
"Nurse Practitioner Access to Genetics Health Literature    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This training proposal describes a research plan which tests the application of a computer science solution to a clinical problem encountered by nurse practitioners (NPs). As our understanding of genetics health increases, NPs will need to provide care and create health promotion regimens mindful of each client's genetic profile. Access to the rapidly developing genetics health literature is critical for this practice model, but may be difficult, because existing search methods lead to many irrelevant results, and may retrieve the proper result only when precise keywords are used. The NP searching for information that would guide her practice may be forced to make a decision with less than complete or current information. This proposal outlines three studies, which investigate how the semantic web concepts of linking related ideas and terms can improve NPs' access to the genetics health literature. Study 1 explores NPs' genetics health information needs. Study 2 tests the applicability of existing ontologies (terminologies coupled with machine-readable statements about the meanings and relationships of the terms) to nursing.

"Community Deposit and Review of Biochemical Databases DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Understanding how the phenotype of an organism is produced by its genotype and environment is fundamental to modern biomedicine. Cellular biochemistry forms the best-characterized complex biochemical system available, and provides a unique opportunity to better understand the structure-function relationships that produce phenotypes. Understood mathematically, cells are a biochemical network whose topology, function, and possible behaviors are only still only dimly understood.      Our previous work has resulted in the development of several databases (END, BND, Klotho) and software systems (The Agora, Glossa) to provide, accumulate, and use data on biochemical networks by users worldwide. In this application for competitive renewal, we propose to embark on a systematic study of structure-function relationships in biochemical networks, focusing on the discovery of patterns of biochemical function --- functional motives. We will identify these motives and their distribution over all enzymatic reactions by comparing changes in reactants' structures and enzymes' specificities, rather than just examine keywords. This systematic examination will allow us to determine, at much greater resolution than ever before, what functions each molecule and reaction have. To do this we must significantly extend the functionalities of our current systems in three major ways. First, we will add significant new data on the structure of small molecules of biochemical interest, enzymatic reactions, the mechanisms of gene expression, and dementia. Second, we will further develop and test methods that produce semantic interoperability among independent, disparate databases. Third, we will develop algorithms to detect and catalogue patterns of biochemical function among thousands of reactions and molecules; to more speedily enumerate paths among molecules and subnets in the biochemical network; to determine the extent of convergent evolution among enzymes; to trace atoms through a sequence of reactions such as a metabolic pathway; and to suggest novel biochemical reactions. We will use these capabilities to define and search for functional motives among enzymatic reactions, testing their correlation with network topology and dynamics, and to estimate the extent to which functional similarities arise from convergent evolution of enzymes. n/a",Community Deposit and Review of Biochemical Databases,7107923,R01GM056529,"['artificial intelligence', 'biochemistry', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'dementia', 'enzyme mechanism', 'functional /structural genomics', 'information system analysis', 'mathematical model', 'molecular biology information system', 'molecular dynamics', 'physiology', 'protein structure function']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI-COLUMBIA,R01,2006,509027,0.0030647537729465704
"Computer System for Functional Analysis of Genomic Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In two previous stages of this project, both funded by the National Institute of General Medical Sciences and carried out successfully, we developed GeneWays, a completely automated system that efficiently distills information about molecular interactions from an astronomical number of full-text biomedical articles. The next logical stage of the project is to carry this system from the computational laboratory into a practical, useful, and even indispensable tool that researchers can use to solve complex problems currently posed in experimental medicine and biology. The central hypothesis of our work on GeneWays has been that our computational tools will generate biological predictions of a quality sufficiently high that the biomedical community will invest in serious experimental validation. Specifically, we propose the following. 1. We will improve significantly the precision and recall of the GeneWays system. 2. We will develop and implement a probabilistic belief-network formalism?a belief-graph relative of the Bayesian network formalism that allows us to place and update beliefs on both the vertices and the edges of the graph for probabilistic reasoning over the large collection of facts in the GeneWays database. We will develop and implement a coordinated collection of methods for computing and updating beliefs on individual nodes and edges of the belief graph. 3. We will develop and implement a mathematical framework for incorporating pathway information into a genetic- linkage analysis formalism in such a way that each piece of pathway knowledge includes a specified degree of confidence. 4. We will process an enormous collection of texts, such as open-access biomedical journals, PubMed abstracts, and the GeneWays corpus, and thus will build a comprehensive GeneHighWays database. We will make the GeneHighWays database easily and freely accessible to academic researchers through a web interface.

"A Comprehensive Structural and Dynamic Map of DNA Duplex Ends    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The structure and dynamics of DNA duplex ends can influence numerous enzyme-dependent processes such as transposition of phage Mu, and integration of HIV dsDNA copies into target chromosomal DNA. Despite their critical importance in biology, DNA duplex ends are significantly under-represented in NMR and crystal structure studies, and their dynamic properties have not been measured directly. The long-term goal of this project is to establish a comprehensive dynamic and structural map of DNA duplex ends. This map will be at near angstrom precision and will include all possible combinations of base pairs for the last six positions of the DNA helix (i.e. 46 = 4096 unique sequences). The approach we will use to generate the map couples NMR spectroscopy with an instrument developed in our laboratory for single molecule measurements. This instrument is based on a nanoscale pore formed by the bacterial toxin, ?-hemolysin. When individual DNA hairpins are captured in this pore by an applied electric field, the duplex stem is suspended in the pore vestibule. Preliminary results suggest that low frequency (kHz) current noise during DNA capture is caused by structural changes of the helix terminus. The aim of this R-21 proposal is to determine if the nanopore detector gives unbiased reads of DNA duplex end structure and dynamics in the Hz to MHz range. Specific questions we will address include: 1) To what extent does the pore vestibule and the applied electric field influence DNA dynamics? 2) Are the duplex end kinetics independent of hairpin loop identity and duplex stem length? 3) There is broad consensus that some sequences are unusually rigid (e.g. A tracts) while others are highly flexible (e.g. TATA). Do these sequences cause nanopore current signatures that cluster together as predicted? 4) Can pattern recognition algorithms be used to automate data analysis? We consider this research to be suited for R-21 funding because there is substantial risk that the outcome will be negative, i.e. we may find that the observed current dynamics are only relevant to the limited case of DNA hairpins captured in a nanoscale protein cavity. However, if the research is successful, it will yield a new way to observe DNA dynamics that reports precise kinetic data, and that is amenable to high throughput experiments. These nanopore experiments will be used to direct subsequent NMR experiments and vice versa.         n/a",A Comprehensive Structural and Dynamic Map of DNA Duplex Ends,7024252,R21GM073617,"['DNA', 'artificial intelligence', 'bioengineering /biomedical engineering', 'biomedical equipment', 'chemical kinetics', 'computational biology', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'electric field', 'method development', 'molecular dynamics', 'nanotechnology', 'nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy', 'nucleic acid structure', 'nucleobase', 'protein structure', 'technology /technique development']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SANTA CRUZ,R21,2006,172838,0.003175006399143536

"Annotating functional sites in 3D biological structures DESCRIPTION:    High-throughput data collection methods have revolutionized many areas of biology and medicine. The National Library of Medicine has targeted the representation, management, and manipulation of biological structure as a key element of its mission. Following upon the success of genome sequencing and functional genomics projects, the structural biology community is creating technologies to streamline the process of determining three-dimensional biological structures--with efforts in structural genomics. Like other high-throughput efforts, a major challenge for these efforts is the appropriate annotation and indexing of structures for retrieval and analysis by biologists who are trying to understand molecular function at an atomic detail: Where are the important functional sites, and how confident are we in their location?      In this proposal, we plan to develop and apply methods for annotating biological structures, so that active sites, binding sites and interaction sites in biological structures can be automatically identified and annotated. Our novel computational representation of functional sites has been successful in characterizing these sites, and recognizing them based on their biochemical and biophysical signature--a 3D motif. We propose to improve the performance of our method with basic research in the representations and algorithms used for our site models. Because our site models are manually created, our library of available models has grown slowly. We therefore further propose to accelerate the growth of our model library using a combination of supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods. First, we will use known 1D sequence motifs as ""seeds"" to create corresponding 3D motifs. Second, we will develop techniques for discovering entirely new motifs using cluster techniques. We will evaluate our models and resulting predictions through analysis of known structural sites, follow-up and dissemination of predictions with the structural genomics community, and large-scale evaluation on decoy and predicted structures. We will make the resulting models available on the Web for real-time structural annotation, and will distribute the software for open source development. n/a",Annotating functional sites in 3D biological structures,7117852,R01LM005652,"['active sites', 'binding sites', 'computer simulation', 'macromolecule', 'model design /development', 'physical model', 'structural biology']",NLM,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2006,326259,0.006541318629198215
"Exon recognition during constitutive pre-mRNA splicing    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The splicing together of exons during the transcription of most eukaryotic pre-mRNA molecules is a fundamental step in the transfer of information from DNA to protein. However, how the splice sites are recognized to initiate this fast and accurate process in not at all clear, since false sequences that resemble real sites outnumber the latter by 1 or 2 orders of magnitude yet are not used. We are searching for the additional information that specifies splice site recognition during pre-mRNA splicing in mammalian cells. In previous work we have used computational analysis to discover that: 1) that exon flanks 50 nt beyond the splice site consensuses can greatly influence splicing and contain sequences that stand out from the background; and 2) there are a large number of specific 8 mers that can act either as exonic splicing enhancers or splicing silencers. We will characterize both of these types of sequences, defining their base requirements, extent, position dependence, and specificity. With regard to the last, we will develop a novel exhaustive survey method that uses massively parallel solid state sequencing to identify every possible 8-mer that can be functional in a particular context, and we will compare this profile in different intronic, exonic and cellular contexts for constitutive and alternatively spliced exons. The flanking sequences fall into 2 distinct classes according to their G+C contents; we will test the idea that the rules governing exon definition differ for the two classes. To simplify the discovery of rules that govern exon definition, we will create designer exons made up of synthetic 8-mer modules we have identified as enhancers, silencers or neutral sequences. The numbers and spacing of these modules will reveal relationships that are hidden in the complexity of natural sequences. Finally, we will continue to use computation, including new machine learning algorithms, to better define intronic elements and to discover interactions between two or more features of a local sequence that define a splice site. We will also develop a Web-based exon-finding program that integrates all the information we have accumulated. Pre-mRNA splicing goes awry in a large proportion or human genetic disease cases. An understanding of the rules that govern the recognition of splice sites should help in the design of therapeutic intervention strategies to reverse such ill effects.                           n/a",Exon recognition during constitutive pre-mRNA splicing,7105514,R01GM072740,"['Internet', 'RNA splicing', 'binding sites', 'computational biology', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'genetic regulation', 'messenger RNA', 'molecular biology information system', 'molecular shape', 'nucleic acid sequence', 'polymerase chain reaction', 'serial analysis of gene expression', 'statistics /biometry']",NIGMS,COLUMBIA UNIV NEW YORK MORNINGSIDE,R01,2006,298611,-0.021789151023849655
"Continuous-Imaging HT Screening Instrument(RMI) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Completion of the genomes of humans and several other organisms creates the foundation for translating this rich knowledge base into new products for the improvement of human medicine. A critical component of realizing the promise of genomics efforts is access to well-characterized chemical compounds that bind to and alter the activities of specific gene products. To this end, modern technologies for genome-wide expression profiling and high throughput proteomics provide the enabling foundation for large-scale chemical biology initiatives, using chemical compounds as discovery tools to probe biological pathways, thereby revealing new protein targets that alter cellular phenotypes in potentially beneficial or insightful ways. It is becoming recognized that many critical points of biological pathway regulation are predicated on protein-protein interactions rather than enzyme-based catalysis of cellular products to substrates. Thus, traditional methods of drug discovery are limited in the scope of targets they can adequately address.   Screening scientists are finding that elucidation of cellular responses to chemical compounds at critical points of biological pathway regulation can be enabled by image-based cellular assays that automatically measure protein dynamics via computer vision of pattern and organelle translocations. Subunits of membrane and intracellular receptors often respond by reorganization or translocation. In addition, cellular heterogeneities that are both physiological (e.g., cell division cycle phase-specific) or apparently random can overwhelm whole-well conventional high throughput screening HTS readouts. These are examples of the ways that cell-image-based instruments can dramatically increase the information content of automated assays. The drawback of cell-image-based screening has been that instruments imaging at medium microscopy resolution (approximately 0.5 - 2.0 mu/m with 10-40x objectives) are typically limited to about 25,000 wells per day as compared with rates of 100,000 or more wells/per day for HTS conventional whole-well plate-reader HTS systems. While higher rates have been reported, these increases have been typically achieved by sacrificing resolution (e.g., even lower magnification objectives or substantial camera binning).   Here we propose to increase the fundamental image scanning bandwidth (measured in pixels/s) by 10- fold over the current Beckman Coulter IC-100 instrument, the prototype of which was developed in Dr. Price's academic laboratory and first commercialized by Q3DM Inc. This increase will be gained by application of fundamentally new principles that parallelize auto-focus and image acquisition to scan slides and microtiter plates in long, unbroken continuous-motion multi-color strips. This will result in screening speeds of over 100,000 wells per day using medium resolution objectives (10-40x dry magnification). n/a",Continuous-Imaging HT Screening Instrument(RMI),7125565,R01EB006200,"['NIH Roadmap Initiative tag', 'bioimaging /biomedical imaging', 'biomedical equipment development', 'biotechnology', 'charge coupled device camera', 'computer program /software', 'computer system hardware', 'high throughput technology', 'image enhancement', 'robotics']",NIBIB,SANFORD-BURNHAM MEDICAL RESEARCH INSTIT,R01,2006,399410,-0.0023456352128068928
"Artificial Intelligence Methods for Crystallization DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is widely believed that crystallization is the rate-limiting step in most X-ray structure determinations. We have therefore been developing computational tools to facilitate this process, including the XtalGrow suite of programs. Here we propose to improve the power and scope of these tools along two fronts: 1. Initial screening, the (iterative) set of experiments that hopefully, yields one or more preliminary ""hits"" (crystalline material that is demonstrably protein); and 2. Optimization experiments that begin with an initial hit and end with diffraction-quality crystals. A central concept of this proposal is that this tool building requires a knowledge-based foundation. Therefore, one of the broad goals of the proposal is to develop a framework for the acquisition and encoding of knowledge in computationally tractable forms; specifically, forms that will yield more effective crystallization procedures. We are interested in how the data interact and how that can be used to improve the crystallization process. While available data, both in the literature and from other projects in the laboratory will continue to be used wherever possible, our analysis has also demonstrated the need to be pro-active i.e. to gather selected data required to complete the knowledge base. We propose to do this by: I. Deepening the data representations is several areas including additional protein characteristics, incorporating a hierarchy of chemical additives and acquiring detailed response data. 11. Improving the efficiency of crystallization screens: Initial crystallization screens would be improved by applying inductive reasoning to the refinement of Bayesian belief nets; procedures would also be developed for dealing with the absence of promising results by identifying unexplored regions of the parameter space and using additional measurements, such as dynamic light scattering and cloud point determinations to further refine the Bayesian belief nets and steer experimentation in more promising directions. Optimization screens would be improved by applying Case-Based and Bayesian methods here as well as by further developments of automated image analysis. III.

"Technology Development for a MolBio Knowledge-Base   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Since the introduction of the Mycin system more than 25 years ago, it has widely been hypothesized that extensive, well-represented computer knowledge-bases will facilitate a wide variety of scientific and clinical tasks. Driven by growing knowledge-management challenges arising from the proliferation of high throughput instrumentation, recently created knowledge-bases in areas related to genomics and related aspects of contemporary biology, such as the Gene Ontology, EcoCyc and PharmGKB, have begun to become integrated into the laboratory practices of a growing number of molecular biologists. However, these successful molecular biology knowledge-bases (MBKBs) have two drawbacks which impede their more general application: each has been narrowed to a particular special purpose, either in its domain of applicability or in the scope of knowledge represented, and each of these knowledge-bases was constructed largely on the basis of enormous human effort. Given the current state of molecular biology data and recent advances in database integration and information extraction technology, we proposed to test the following hypothesis: Current computational technology and existing human-curated knowledge resources are sufficient to build an extensive, high-quality computational knowledge-base of molecular biology. To test this hypothesis we propose to first create tools which can (a) automatically link incommensurate knowledge sources using semantic linking, and (b) use natural language processing techniques to extract new information from NCBrs GeneRIFs and from the GO definitions fields; and second, to evaluate the results of these methods by carefully quantifying the degree to which the induced linkages and extracted assertions are complete, consistent and correct. Although we propose to construct a broad and rich knowledge-base in order to develop and test the adequacy of largely automated methods to leverage existing human-curated collections, we do not propose to build a comprehensive MBKB.            n/a",Technology Development for a MolBio Knowledge-Base,6953701,R01LM008111,"['artificial intelligence', 'bioinformatics', 'biomedical automation', 'computational biology', 'computer program /software', 'functional /structural genomics', 'information retrieval', 'molecular biology information system', 'technology /technique development']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R01,2005,613495,-0.01741918242305169
"BioMediator: Biologic Data Integration& Analysis System DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    The broad long-term objectives of this proposal are to collaborate with a group of biology researchers with real world needs to develop and distribute a general-purpose system (BioMediator) to permit integration and analysis of diverse types of biologic data. BioMediator will combine information from a variety of different public and private sources (e.g. experimental data) to help answer biologic questions. BioMediator builds on the foundations laid by the currently funded GeneSeek data integration system. The GeneSeek system was originally developed to query only public domain data sources (both structured and semi-structured) to assist in the curation of the GeneClinics genetic testing knowledge base. The specific aims leading to the development of the BioMediator system are: 1) Interface to additional public domain biological data sources (e.g. pathway databases, function databases). 2) Incorporate access to private databases of experimental results (e.g. proteomics and expression array data). 3) Extend model to include analytic tools operating across distributed biological data sources (e.g. across a set of both proteomic and expression array data). 4) Evolve centralized BioMediator system into a model peer to peer data sharing and analysis system. 5) Distribute and maintain BioMediator production software as a resource for the biological community. The health relatedness of the project is that biologists seeking to understand the molecular basis of human health and disease are struggling with large and increasing volumes of diverse data (mutation, expression array, proteomic) that need to be brought together (integrated) and analyzed in order to develop and test hypotheses about disease mechanisms and normal physiology. The research design is to develop BioMediator by combining and leverage recent developments in a) the domain of open source analytic tools for biologic data and b) ongoing theoretical and applied research by members of the current GeneSeek research team on both general purpose and biologic data integration systems. The methods are:  a) to use an iterative rapid prototyping software development model evaluated in a real-world test bed and b) to expand the existing GeneSeek research team (with expertise in informatics, computer science, and software development) to include biological expertise (four biologists forming a biology working group) and biostatistics expertise. The goal is to ensure the BioMediator system 1) meets the needs of a group of end users acquiring, integrating and analyzing diverse biologic data sets, 2) does so in a scaleable and expandable manner drawing on the latest theoretical developments in data analysis and integration. n/a",BioMediator: Biologic Data Integration& Analysis System,6946761,R01HG002288,"['artificial intelligence', 'bioengineering /biomedical engineering', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'data collection methodology /evaluation', 'information retrieval', 'molecular biology information system']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2005,100000,0.017349518604271887
"Information Integration of Heterogeneous Data Sources    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this proposal is to develop an information integration architecture and associated tools to support rapid integration of data and knowledge from distributed heterogeneous data sources. The architecture aims to play a significant role in extracting coherent knowledge bases for biomedical research and improving the accuracy, completeness and quality of the extracted knowledge. Towards achieving these goals, the proposed scalable architecture includes new innovative generalized integration algorithms and tools for the generation of mediators to capture the functional behavior of data sources, semantic representation of data sources to support automated generation of integration agents, and optimization of integrated data queries. The information integration architecture keeps pace with the evolving Internet-based XML electronic data interchange, semantic web services, and web services discovery standards. Thus, leveraging the Internet technologies and standards for the purpose of providing lasting state-of-the-art solutions for information integration. In addition, the proposed architecture is inherently scalable in terms of the number of data sources that can be integrated, the number of users of the integrated system, and the range of biomedical problems that can be tackled. During phase I of the project, prototypes of the proposed integration algorithms and tools will be developed as proofs of concept and to form the foundation for evaluation and pilot testing of the proposed integration mechanisms, using private and public data sources, in terms of scalability and integration capabilities.         n/a",Information Integration of Heterogeneous Data Sources,6881960,R43RR018667,"['artificial intelligence', 'computer data analysis', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'data collection methodology /evaluation', 'information retrieval', 'information system analysis', 'information systems', 'mathematics']",NCRR,"INFOTECH SOFT, INC.",R43,2005,260661,-0.015293297166323012
"Nurse Practitioner Access to Genetics Health Literature    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This training proposal describes a research plan which tests the application of a computer science solution to a clinical problem encountered by nurse practitioners (NPs). As our understanding of genetics health increases, NPs will need to provide care and create health promotion regimens mindful of each client's genetic profile. Access to the rapidly developing genetics health literature is critical for this practice model, but may be difficult, because existing search methods lead to many irrelevant results, and may retrieve the proper result only when precise keywords are used. The NP searching for information that would guide her practice may be forced to make a decision with less than complete or current information. This proposal outlines three studies, which investigate how the semantic web concepts of linking related ideas and terms can improve NPs' access to the genetics health literature. Study 1 explores NPs' genetics health information needs. Study 2 tests the applicability of existing ontologies (terminologies coupled with machine-readable statements about the meanings and relationships of the terms) to nursing.

"Shifting Conceptions of Human Identity DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  . One of the most important questions raised by the ongoing achievements of the Human Genome Project is how this new biological knowledge - and the powers it confers - will affect our identity and self-understanding as human beings. This book project focuses on one key aspect of this complex issue: exploring the extent to which human identity can be reconciled with deliberate design or partial redesign. The author proposes to shed new light on this question by comparing the debates surrounding two areas of scientific innovation that are not normally associated with each other, but that are in fact deeply related: the enterprise of human genetic intervention and the enterprise of building intelligent machines. Both these enterprises entail ""pushing the limits"" of traditional concepts of what it means to be human; and both ultimately confront their makers with the same core ""family"" of questions: What are the defining features of human personhood? To what extent can those features be modified or extended, before human personhood begins to break down? Can some (or all) of those features find embodiment in an entity other than a human being? These kinds of questions are no longer the sole province of science fiction writers, but have been taken up with increasing seriousness by mainstream scientists and technologists, as well as by a wide array of ""science watchers"" in academia, legislative circles, and the news media.   . Through documentary research and interviews, this project aims to deepen our understanding of the history and sociology of the debates surrounding these powerful new technologies, electro-mechanical and biological, that are perceived as destabilizing human identity. The intended audience for the book is a broad one: scientists and technological practitioners interested in the social and cultural reception of their research; legislators and other policymakers with a stake in the governance of science; general educated readers who are concerned about the role of science and technology in shaping our collective future. n/a",Shifting Conceptions of Human Identity,6915830,R03HG003298,"['adult human (21+)', 'artificial intelligence', 'behavioral /social science research tag', 'biotechnology', 'books', 'clinical research', 'ethics', 'genetic manipulation', 'history of life science', 'human subject', 'identity', 'interview', 'robotics', 'self concept', 'sociology /anthropology']",NHGRI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,R03,2005,75833,-0.014065174046525745

"Community Deposit and Review of Biochemical Databases DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Understanding how the phenotype of an organism is produced by its genotype and environment is fundamental to modern biomedicine. Cellular biochemistry forms the best-characterized complex biochemical system available, and provides a unique opportunity to better understand the structure-function relationships that produce phenotypes. Understood mathematically, cells are a biochemical network whose topology, function, and possible behaviors are only still only dimly understood.      Our previous work has resulted in the development of several databases (END, BND, Klotho) and software systems (The Agora, Glossa) to provide, accumulate, and use data on biochemical networks by users worldwide. In this application for competitive renewal, we propose to embark on a systematic study of structure-function relationships in biochemical networks, focusing on the discovery of patterns of biochemical function --- functional motives. We will identify these motives and their distribution over all enzymatic reactions by comparing changes in reactants' structures and enzymes' specificities, rather than just examine keywords. This systematic examination will allow us to determine, at much greater resolution than ever before, what functions each molecule and reaction have. To do this we must significantly extend the functionalities of our current systems in three major ways. First, we will add significant new data on the structure of small molecules of biochemical interest, enzymatic reactions, the mechanisms of gene expression, and dementia. Second, we will further develop and test methods that produce semantic interoperability among independent, disparate databases. Third, we will develop algorithms to detect and catalogue patterns of biochemical function among thousands of reactions and molecules; to more speedily enumerate paths among molecules and subnets in the biochemical network; to determine the extent of convergent evolution among enzymes; to trace atoms through a sequence of reactions such as a metabolic pathway; and to suggest novel biochemical reactions. We will use these capabilities to define and search for functional motives among enzymatic reactions, testing their correlation with network topology and dynamics, and to estimate the extent to which functional similarities arise from convergent evolution of enzymes. n/a",Community Deposit and Review of Biochemical Databases,6944266,R01GM056529,"['artificial intelligence', 'biochemistry', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'dementia', 'enzyme mechanism', 'functional /structural genomics', 'information system analysis', 'mathematical model', 'molecular biology information system', 'molecular dynamics', 'physiology', 'protein structure function']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI-COLUMBIA,R01,2005,523667,0.0030647537729465704
"The MEME suite of motif-based sequence analysis tools DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A wide variety of biological processes and signals are mediated by patterns detectable at the sequence level in proteins, DNA and RNA. For example, one facet of transcriptional regulation of genes involves proteins (transcription factors) recognizing and binding to specific DNA sequence patterns. Other examples of important biological sequence patterns include protein structural domains, microRNAs and the protein target sequences of kinases. The MEME suite of bioinformatics software tools provide biologists with powerful methods for discovering, analyzing and interpreting biological sequence patterns of many types, including those mentioned above. The suite includes one tool - MEME -- that biologists use to discover novel sequence patterns (motifs), and three tools -- Meta-MEME, MCAST and MAST -- that biologists use to search sequence databases for matches to motif-based sequence models. This grant will enable us to dramatically improve the scientific value of the suite to the thousands of biologists who already use it. These improvements will be visible to the biologist using the suite as increased availability, better support, better user-interface and documentation, more powerful algorithms, better interoperability, and faster release cycles. We will achieve these goals via a combination of three specific aims: (1) improved software engineering, (2) ongoing support and (3) continued software development of the suite. n/a",The MEME suite of motif-based sequence analysis tools,6907504,R01RR021692,"['artificial intelligence', 'bioinformatics', 'computer assisted sequence analysis', 'computer human interaction', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'computer system hardware', 'mathematical model', 'microRNAs', 'molecular biology information system', 'nucleic acid sequence', 'protein structure', 'transcription factor']",NCRR,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2005,307663,-0.05081136466670265
"Development of Bioinformatic Tools for Virtual Cloning  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The elaboration of the sequences of the human genome and those of many cellular and viral parasites has given us an unprecedented opportunity to address the causes and treatment of every major human disease. It has also resulted in the formation of an entirely new field, bioinformatics, which promises to manage and analyze the vast amount of data being generated. Bioinformatics needs to supply tools for data analysis and tools for experimental design. Most of the scientific and corporate resources being expended in bioinformatics are being spent on data analysis tools. While these are essential, we should not neglect the opportunity to accelerate the progress of actual experimental biology. Essentially every experiment in biology now begins with cloning one or more pieces of DNA. Commercial software that facilitates virtual DNA cloning does exist, but it lacks any automation features and depends on primitive and/or fragmentary gene and vector databases. It is inadequate in planning the hundreds or thousands of clones necessary to address questions posed by the proteomics initiatives, because the lack of knowledge integration. In Phase I of this SBIR grant, we have built and tested a virtual cloning expert system, along with a very useful gene database and a uniquely annotated vector database that serve as a knowledge base for automated DNA manipulations. A collection of automated cloning modules and databases is now functional. In Phase II we will complete the virtual cloning expert system and develop a flexible platform for automated experimental design, data management and analysis.

"BioHDF - Open Binary File Standards for Bioinformatics DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Geospiza Inc. and the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) are creating a standards based software framework around NCSA's Heirarchical Data Format (HDF5). The envisioned framework will integrate algorithms important in DNA and protein sequence analysis to create scalable high throughput software systems which will be accessed using new graphical user interfaces (GUIs) to provide researchers with new views of their data to finish sequencing projects in large-scale genome sequencing, microbial genome sequencing, viral epidemiology, polymorphism detection, phylogenetic analysis, multi-locus sequence typing, confirmatory sequencing, and EST analysis.    In our vision, algorithms will be either integrated into the system to directly read and write from HDF5 project files, or they will communicate with project files via filter programs that produce standardized XML formatted data. Through this model, a scalable solution will support different applications of DNA sequencing, fulfilling the many needs and requirements expressed by the medical research community now and into the future. As the first step in this process we will, define requirements for editing and versioning data in DNA sequencing, research and propose data models for the computational phases of DNA sequencing and annotating DNA sequence data using existing standards, create a prototype application for DNA sequencing based SNP discovery, and engage the bioinformatics community for BioHDF adoption.

"Annotating functional sites in 3D biological structures DESCRIPTION:    High-throughput data collection methods have revolutionized many areas of biology and medicine. The National Library of Medicine has targeted the representation, management, and manipulation of biological structure as a key element of its mission. Following upon the success of genome sequencing and functional genomics projects, the structural biology community is creating technologies to streamline the process of determining three-dimensional biological structures--with efforts in structural genomics. Like other high-throughput efforts, a major challenge for these efforts is the appropriate annotation and indexing of structures for retrieval and analysis by biologists who are trying to understand molecular function at an atomic detail: Where are the important functional sites, and how confident are we in their location?      In this proposal, we plan to develop and apply methods for annotating biological structures, so that active sites, binding sites and interaction sites in biological structures can be automatically identified and annotated. Our novel computational representation of functional sites has been successful in characterizing these sites, and recognizing them based on their biochemical and biophysical signature--a 3D motif. We propose to improve the performance of our method with basic research in the representations and algorithms used for our site models. Because our site models are manually created, our library of available models has grown slowly. We therefore further propose to accelerate the growth of our model library using a combination of supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods. First, we will use known 1D sequence motifs as ""seeds"" to create corresponding 3D motifs. Second, we will develop techniques for discovering entirely new motifs using cluster techniques. We will evaluate our models and resulting predictions through analysis of known structural sites, follow-up and dissemination of predictions with the structural genomics community, and large-scale evaluation on decoy and predicted structures. We will make the resulting models available on the Web for real-time structural annotation, and will distribute the software for open source development. n/a",Annotating functional sites in 3D biological structures,6942980,R01LM005652,"['active sites', 'binding sites', 'computer simulation', 'macromolecule', 'model design /development', 'physical model', 'structural biology']",NLM,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2005,324673,0.006541318629198215
"Exon recognition during constitutive pre-mRNA splicing    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The splicing together of exons during the transcription of most eukaryotic pre-mRNA molecules is a fundamental step in the transfer of information from DNA to protein. However, how the splice sites are recognized to initiate this fast and accurate process in not at all clear, since false sequences that resemble real sites outnumber the latter by 1 or 2 orders of magnitude yet are not used. We are searching for the additional information that specifies splice site recognition during pre-mRNA splicing in mammalian cells. In previous work we have used computational analysis to discover that: 1) that exon flanks 50 nt beyond the splice site consensuses can greatly influence splicing and contain sequences that stand out from the background; and 2) there are a large number of specific 8 mers that can act either as exonic splicing enhancers or splicing silencers. We will characterize both of these types of sequences, defining their base requirements, extent, position dependence, and specificity. With regard to the last, we will develop a novel exhaustive survey method that uses massively parallel solid state sequencing to identify every possible 8-mer that can be functional in a particular context, and we will compare this profile in different intronic, exonic and cellular contexts for constitutive and alternatively spliced exons. The flanking sequences fall into 2 distinct classes according to their G+C contents; we will test the idea that the rules governing exon definition differ for the two classes. To simplify the discovery of rules that govern exon definition, we will create designer exons made up of synthetic 8-mer modules we have identified as enhancers, silencers or neutral sequences. The numbers and spacing of these modules will reveal relationships that are hidden in the complexity of natural sequences. Finally, we will continue to use computation, including new machine learning algorithms, to better define intronic elements and to discover interactions between two or more features of a local sequence that define a splice site. We will also develop a Web-based exon-finding program that integrates all the information we have accumulated. Pre-mRNA splicing goes awry in a large proportion or human genetic disease cases. An understanding of the rules that govern the recognition of splice sites should help in the design of therapeutic intervention strategies to reverse such ill effects.                           n/a",Exon recognition during constitutive pre-mRNA splicing,6966860,R01GM072740,"['Internet', 'RNA splicing', 'binding sites', 'computational biology', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'genetic regulation', 'messenger RNA', 'molecular biology information system', 'molecular shape', 'nucleic acid sequence', 'polymerase chain reaction', 'serial analysis of gene expression', 'statistics /biometry']",NIGMS,COLUMBIA UNIV NEW YORK MORNINGSIDE,R01,2005,304845,-0.021789151023849655
"Continuous-Imaging HT Screening Instrument(RMI) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Completion of the genomes of humans and several other organisms creates the foundation for translating this rich knowledge base into new products for the improvement of human medicine. A critical component of realizing the promise of genomics efforts is access to well-characterized chemical compounds that bind to and alter the activities of specific gene products. To this end, modern technologies for genome-wide expression profiling and high throughput proteomics provide the enabling foundation for large-scale chemical biology initiatives, using chemical compounds as discovery tools to probe biological pathways, thereby revealing new protein targets that alter cellular phenotypes in potentially beneficial or insightful ways. It is becoming recognized that many critical points of biological pathway regulation are predicated on protein-protein interactions rather than enzyme-based catalysis of cellular products to substrates. Thus, traditional methods of drug discovery are limited in the scope of targets they can adequately address.   Screening scientists are finding that elucidation of cellular responses to chemical compounds at critical points of biological pathway regulation can be enabled by image-based cellular assays that automatically measure protein dynamics via computer vision of pattern and organelle translocations. Subunits of membrane and intracellular receptors often respond by reorganization or translocation. In addition, cellular heterogeneities that are both physiological (e.g., cell division cycle phase-specific) or apparently random can overwhelm whole-well conventional high throughput screening HTS readouts. These are examples of the ways that cell-image-based instruments can dramatically increase the information content of automated assays. The drawback of cell-image-based screening has been that instruments imaging at medium microscopy resolution (approximately 0.5 - 2.0 mu/m with 10-40x objectives) are typically limited to about 25,000 wells per day as compared with rates of 100,000 or more wells/per day for HTS conventional whole-well plate-reader HTS systems. While higher rates have been reported, these increases have been typically achieved by sacrificing resolution (e.g., even lower magnification objectives or substantial camera binning).   Here we propose to increase the fundamental image scanning bandwidth (measured in pixels/s) by 10- fold over the current Beckman Coulter IC-100 instrument, the prototype of which was developed in Dr. Price's academic laboratory and first commercialized by Q3DM Inc. This increase will be gained by application of fundamentally new principles that parallelize auto-focus and image acquisition to scan slides and microtiter plates in long, unbroken continuous-motion multi-color strips. This will result in screening speeds of over 100,000 wells per day using medium resolution objectives (10-40x dry magnification). n/a",Continuous-Imaging HT Screening Instrument(RMI),7012638,R01EB006200,"['bioimaging /biomedical imaging', 'biomedical equipment development', 'biotechnology', 'charge coupled device camera', 'computer program /software', 'computer system hardware', 'high throughput technology', 'image enhancement', 'robotics']",NIBIB,SANFORD-BURNHAM MEDICAL RESEARCH INSTIT,R01,2005,363523,-0.0023456352128068928

We have therefore been developing computational tools to facilitate this process, including the XtalGrow suite of programs. Here we propose to improve the power and scope of these tools along two fronts: 1. Initial screening, the (iterative) set of experiments that hopefully, yields one or more preliminary ""hits"" (crystalline material that is demonstrably protein); and 2. Optimization experiments that begin with an initial hit and end with diffraction-quality crystals. A central concept of this proposal is that this tool building requires a knowledge-based foundation. Therefore, one of the broad goals of the proposal is to develop a framework for the acquisition and encoding of knowledge in computationally tractable forms; specifically, forms that will yield more effective crystallization procedures. We are interested in how the data interact and how that can be used to improve the crystallization process. While available data, both in the literature and from other projects in the laboratory will continue to be used wherever possible, our analysis has also demonstrated the need to be pro-active i.e. to gather selected data required to complete the knowledge base.

"Technology Development for a MolBio Knowledge-Base   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Since the introduction of the Mycin system more than 25 years ago, it has widely been hypothesized that extensive, well-represented computer knowledge-bases will facilitate a wide variety of scientific and clinical tasks. Driven by growing knowledge-management challenges arising from the proliferation of high throughput instrumentation, recently created knowledge-bases in areas related to genomics and related aspects of contemporary biology, such as the Gene Ontology, EcoCyc and PharmGKB, have begun to become integrated into the laboratory practices of a growing number of molecular biologists. However, these successful molecular biology knowledge-bases (MBKBs) have two drawbacks which impede their more general application: each has been narrowed to a particular special purpose, either in its domain of applicability or in the scope of knowledge represented, and each of these knowledge-bases was constructed largely on the basis of enormous human effort. Given the current state of molecular biology data and recent advances in database integration and information extraction technology, we proposed to test the following hypothesis: Current computational technology and existing human-curated knowledge resources are sufficient to build an extensive, high-quality computational knowledge-base of molecular biology. To test this hypothesis we propose to first create tools which can (a) automatically link incommensurate knowledge sources using semantic linking, and (b) use natural language processing techniques to extract new information from NCBrs GeneRIFs and from the GO definitions fields; and second, to evaluate the results of these methods by carefully quantifying the degree to which the induced linkages and extracted assertions are complete, consistent and correct. Although we propose to construct a broad and rich knowledge-base in order to develop and test the adequacy of largely automated methods to leverage existing human-curated collections, we do not propose to build a comprehensive MBKB.            n/a",Technology Development for a MolBio Knowledge-Base,6822280,R01LM008111,"['artificial intelligence', 'bioinformatics', 'biomedical automation', 'computational biology', 'computer program /software', 'functional /structural genomics', 'information retrieval', 'molecular biology information system', 'technology /technique development']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R01,2004,577307,-0.01741918242305169
"Second Generation DNA Sequence Management Tools   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The human genome project spurred the            development of high throughput technologies, especially in the area of DNA           sequencing. Not only has this effort produced a draft of the human genome, it's      catalyzed development of an entire industry based on DNA sequencing and              genomics. Since these technologies produce enormous amounts of data they depend      on bioinformatics programs for data management. Phrap, Cross_Match,                  RepeatMasker and Consed are four programs that played an integral role in the        human genome project and became accepted as standard. However, as the                technology for sequencing has evolved, so too, have the applications. These new      applications include sequencing additional genomes, EST cluster analysis, and        genotyping and they have highlighted the need to update standard bioinformatics      programs to meet the current needs of a broader community. In this project we        will re-engineer Phrap, Cross_Match and Repeat Masker to improve performance by      optimizing these algorithms and developing a hierarchical data file to store         and manipulate assembled sequence data. Phrap and Cross_Match will also be           modified to use XML-formatted data allowing users to apply constraints to            sequence assembly. Lastly, we will develop a new program to review, edit, and        manipulate sequences, thus giving users unprecedented control over their data.

"BioMediator: Biologic Data Integration& Analysis System DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    The broad long-term objectives of this proposal are to collaborate with a group of biology researchers with real world needs to develop and distribute a general-purpose system (BioMediator) to permit integration and analysis of diverse types of biologic data. BioMediator will combine information from a variety of different public and private sources (e.g. experimental data) to help answer biologic questions. BioMediator builds on the foundations laid by the currently funded GeneSeek data integration system. The GeneSeek system was originally developed to query only public domain data sources (both structured and semi-structured) to assist in the curation of the GeneClinics genetic testing knowledge base. The specific aims leading to the development of the BioMediator system are: 1) Interface to additional public domain biological data sources (e.g. pathway databases, function databases). 2) Incorporate access to private databases of experimental results (e.g. proteomics and expression array data). 3) Extend model to include analytic tools operating across distributed biological data sources (e.g. across a set of both proteomic and expression array data). 4) Evolve centralized BioMediator system into a model peer to peer data sharing and analysis system. 5) Distribute and maintain BioMediator production software as a resource for the biological community. The health relatedness of the project is that biologists seeking to understand the molecular basis of human health and disease are struggling with large and increasing volumes of diverse data (mutation, expression array, proteomic) that need to be brought together (integrated) and analyzed in order to develop and test hypotheses about disease mechanisms and normal physiology. The research design is to develop BioMediator by combining and leverage recent developments in a) the domain of open source analytic tools for biologic data and b) ongoing theoretical and applied research by members of the current GeneSeek research team on both general purpose and biologic data integration systems. The methods are:  a) to use an iterative rapid prototyping software development model evaluated in a real-world test bed and b) to expand the existing GeneSeek research team (with expertise in informatics, computer science, and software development) to include biological expertise (four biologists forming a biology working group) and biostatistics expertise. The goal is to ensure the BioMediator system 1) meets the needs of a group of end users acquiring, integrating and analyzing diverse biologic data sets, 2) does so in a scaleable and expandable manner drawing on the latest theoretical developments in data analysis and integration. n/a",BioMediator: Biologic Data Integration& Analysis System,6805962,R01HG002288,"['artificial intelligence', 'bioengineering /biomedical engineering', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'data collection methodology /evaluation', 'information retrieval', 'molecular biology information system']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2004,100000,0.017349518604271887
"Nurse Practitioner Access to Genetics Health Literature    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This training proposal describes a research plan which tests the application of a computer science solution to a clinical problem encountered by nurse practitioners (NPs). As our understanding of genetics health increases, NPs will need to provide care and create health promotion regimens mindful of each client's genetic profile. Access to the rapidly developing genetics health literature is critical for this practice model, but may be difficult, because existing search methods lead to many irrelevant results, and may retrieve the proper result only when precise keywords are used. The NP searching for information that would guide her practice may be forced to make a decision with less than complete or current information. This proposal outlines three studies, which investigate how the semantic web concepts of linking related ideas and terms can improve NPs' access to the genetics health literature. Study 1 explores NPs' genetics health information needs. Study 2 tests the applicability of existing ontologies (terminologies coupled with machine-readable statements about the meanings and relationships of the terms) to nursing.

"Community Deposit and Review of Biochemical Databases DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Understanding how the phenotype of an organism is produced by its genotype and environment is fundamental to modern biomedicine. Cellular biochemistry forms the best-characterized complex biochemical system available, and provides a unique opportunity to better understand the structure-function relationships that produce phenotypes. Understood mathematically, cells are a biochemical network whose topology, function, and possible behaviors are only still only dimly understood.      Our previous work has resulted in the development of several databases (END, BND, Klotho) and software systems (The Agora, Glossa) to provide, accumulate, and use data on biochemical networks by users worldwide. In this application for competitive renewal, we propose to embark on a systematic study of structure-function relationships in biochemical networks, focusing on the discovery of patterns of biochemical function --- functional motives. We will identify these motives and their distribution over all enzymatic reactions by comparing changes in reactants' structures and enzymes' specificities, rather than just examine keywords. This systematic examination will allow us to determine, at much greater resolution than ever before, what functions each molecule and reaction have. To do this we must significantly extend the functionalities of our current systems in three major ways. First, we will add significant new data on the structure of small molecules of biochemical interest, enzymatic reactions, the mechanisms of gene expression, and dementia. Second, we will further develop and test methods that produce semantic interoperability among independent, disparate databases. Third, we will develop algorithms to detect and catalogue patterns of biochemical function among thousands of reactions and molecules; to more speedily enumerate paths among molecules and subnets in the biochemical network; to determine the extent of convergent evolution among enzymes; to trace atoms through a sequence of reactions such as a metabolic pathway; and to suggest novel biochemical reactions. We will use these capabilities to define and search for functional motives among enzymatic reactions, testing their correlation with network topology and dynamics, and to estimate the extent to which functional similarities arise from convergent evolution of enzymes. n/a",Community Deposit and Review of Biochemical Databases,6784554,R01GM056529,"['artificial intelligence', 'biochemistry', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'dementia', 'enzyme mechanism', 'functional /structural genomics', 'information system analysis', 'mathematical model', 'molecular biology information system', 'molecular dynamics', 'physiology', 'protein structure function']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI-COLUMBIA,R01,2004,522252,0.0030647537729465704

"Development of Bioinformatic Tools for Virtual Cloning  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The elaboration of the sequences of the human genome and those of many cellular and viral parasites has given us an unprecedented opportunity to address the causes and treatment of every major human disease. It has also resulted in the formation of an entirely new field, bioinformatics, which promises to manage and analyze the vast amount of data being generated. Bioinformatics needs to supply tools for data analysis and tools for experimental design. Most of the scientific and corporate resources being expended in bioinformatics are being spent on data analysis tools. While these are essential, we should not neglect the opportunity to accelerate the progress of actual experimental biology. Essentially every experiment in biology now begins with cloning one or more pieces of DNA. Commercial software that facilitates virtual DNA cloning does exist, but it lacks any automation features and depends on primitive and/or fragmentary gene and vector databases. It is inadequate in planning the hundreds or thousands of clones necessary to address questions posed by the proteomics initiatives, because the lack of knowledge integration. In Phase I of this SBIR grant, we have built and tested a virtual cloning expert system, along with a very useful gene database and a uniquely annotated vector database that serve as a knowledge base for automated DNA manipulations. A collection of automated cloning modules and databases is now functional. In Phase II we will complete the virtual cloning expert system and develop a flexible platform for automated experimental design, data management and analysis. We will also construct a user database, improve the user interface and establish security protocols.

"Annotating functional sites in 3D biological structures DESCRIPTION:    High-throughput data collection methods have revolutionized many areas of biology and medicine. The National Library of Medicine has targeted the representation, management, and manipulation of biological structure as a key element of its mission. Following upon the success of genome sequencing and functional genomics projects, the structural biology community is creating technologies to streamline the process of determining three-dimensional biological structures--with efforts in structural genomics. Like other high-throughput efforts, a major challenge for these efforts is the appropriate annotation and indexing of structures for retrieval and analysis by biologists who are trying to understand molecular function at an atomic detail: Where are the important functional sites, and how confident are we in their location?      In this proposal, we plan to develop and apply methods for annotating biological structures, so that active sites, binding sites and interaction sites in biological structures can be automatically identified and annotated. Our novel computational representation of functional sites has been successful in characterizing these sites, and recognizing them based on their biochemical and biophysical signature--a 3D motif. We propose to improve the performance of our method with basic research in the representations and algorithms used for our site models. Because our site models are manually created, our library of available models has grown slowly. We therefore further propose to accelerate the growth of our model library using a combination of supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods. First, we will use known 1D sequence motifs as ""seeds"" to create corresponding 3D motifs. Second, we will develop techniques for discovering entirely new motifs using cluster techniques. We will evaluate our models and resulting predictions through analysis of known structural sites, follow-up and dissemination of predictions with the structural genomics community, and large-scale evaluation on decoy and predicted structures. We will make the resulting models available on the Web for real-time structural annotation, and will distribute the software for open source development. n/a",Annotating functional sites in 3D biological structures,6825272,R01LM005652,"['active sites', 'binding sites', 'computer simulation', 'macromolecule', 'model design /development', 'physical model', 'structural biology']",NLM,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2004,396367,0.006541318629198215
"A Novel Probabilistic Engine for Virtual Screening DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this work is to provide a novel probabilistic computational engine for docking-based virtual screening. The engine is based on probabilistic model of Markov Random Fieds (MRF). MRF's have proven successful in other fields such as Computer Vision, and can be seen as a 3D analog of the successful 1D application of Hidden Markov Models to bioinformatics. The docking of a rigid ligand or ligand fragment into a protein active site is modeled as a weighted graphical match of an abstracted description of the ligand to an abstracted description of the active site. These abstracted descriptions are graphs, whose nodes are chemical entities (hydrogen bond acceptors/donors, hydrophobic spheres and etc.) and whose edges are associated distance constraints. The weighted graph-matching problem is expressed as an MRF, whose solution minimizes its associated free energy function. A fast, convergent message-passing scheme called Belief Propagation is used to solve the MRF. The result is a probability distribution that describes all possible placements of the ligand into the active site. Individual low-energy placements of the molecule are obtained by marginalizing this probability distribution. The method provides a fast and mathematically complete examination of possible fits of the ligand into the protein active site, and our prototype MRF application demonstrates excellent timing and completeness properties. The method also provides an attractive data structure enabling a variety of applications. The data structure intrinsically admits an enriched description of the active site. This description can incorporate an extended set of chemical substructures for matching at its nodes. It also can incorporate sets of probabilistic beliefs, expressed as probabilistic prior distributions. These can be used to bias matches according to known actives. Our goals in Phase I are to further develop our prototype into a robust MRF-based docking engine to positioning rigid molecules and molecular fragments into protein active sites. Our goals in Phase II will be to implement applications based on the MRF docking engine: (i) inclusion flexible ligand docking, (ii) incorporation of flexible side chains into docking, (iii) de-novo ligand design, and (iv) docking into multiple aligned proteins. We will seek corporate partners interested in collaborating on applying the technologies to specific problems in drug discovery in Phase I1. The technology developed will be sold as commercial software in Phase III. n/a",A Novel Probabilistic Engine for Virtual Screening,6786885,R43GM071055,"['binding sites', 'computational biology', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'ligands', 'statistics /biometry']",NIGMS,"BIOCOMPUTING GROUP, INC.",R43,2004,153420,-0.04660975730714422

"Ab-Initio Geometry Optimization of Large Molecules    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  While density-functional calculations of the energy are now feasible for biomolecules, the use of density-functional geometry optimizers is still confined to relatively small molecules containing no more than thirty atoms. The key limitation of conventional density-functional geometry optimizers is that the cost of the geometry optimization scales at least quadratically with the number of atoms in the molecule. In contrast the energy at a fixed geometry can be evaluated for a cost which scales linearly with molecule size, enabling very large molecules to be treated. This proposal is based on a radical change in the algorithm for density-functional geometry optimization, potentially reducing the total cost from quadratic to linear in molecule size and enabling a quantum leap in the size of molecules that can be optimized. The proposed algorithm resembles a conventional self-consistent calculation of the energy at a fixed geometry but at convergence the proposed algorithm yields not only the density but also the optimized geometry. This is achieved by simultaneous optimization of the wavefunction and the geometry via a modified self-consistent-field procedure. The proposed algorithm will be implemented in the QChem software package and, if successful, widely distributed through QChem Inc. and Spartan Inc.           n/a",Ab-Initio Geometry Optimization of Large Molecules,6583907,R43GM067335,"['artificial intelligence', ' chemical models', ' computer program /software', ' computer simulation', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' mathematics', ' molecular dynamics', ' molecular size', ' quantum chemistry']",NIGMS,"Q-CHEM, INC.",R43,2003,99639,-0.007263243418922925
"Second Generation DNA Sequence Management Tools   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The human genome project spurred the            development of high throughput technologies, especially in the area of DNA           sequencing. Not only has this effort produced a draft of the human genome, it's      catalyzed development of an entire industry based on DNA sequencing and              genomics. Since these technologies produce enormous amounts of data they depend      on bioinformatics programs for data management. Phrap, Cross_Match,                  RepeatMasker and Consed are four programs that played an integral role in the        human genome project and became accepted as standard. However, as the                technology for sequencing has evolved, so too, have the applications. These new      applications include sequencing additional genomes, EST cluster analysis, and        genotyping and they have highlighted the need to update standard bioinformatics      programs to meet the current needs of a broader community. In this project we        will re-engineer Phrap, Cross_Match and Repeat Masker to improve performance by      optimizing these algorithms and developing a hierarchical data file to store         and manipulate assembled sequence data. Phrap and Cross_Match will also be           modified to use XML-formatted data allowing users to apply constraints to            sequence assembly. Lastly, we will develop a new program to review, edit, and        manipulate sequences, thus giving users unprecedented control over their data.      PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION:                                                                                     Phrap is widely used in industry and academia for applications involving DNA sequences.  There are over 100 commercial sites that would benefit from new versions of Phrap that support incremental assemblies and utilize computer resources better.  An API for Phrap will encourage application development creating additional commercialization possibilities for algorithm and application developers. n/a",Second Generation DNA Sequence Management Tools,6622259,R44HG002244,"['artificial intelligence', ' computer data analysis', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' data management', ' genotype', ' informatics', ' mathematical model', ' nucleic acid sequence']",NHGRI,"GEOSPIZA, INC.",R44,2003,560392,0.004263642653901724
"BioMediator: Biologic Data Integration & Analysis System DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    The broad long-term objectives of this proposal are to collaborate with a group of biology researchers with real world needs to develop and distribute a general-purpose system (BioMediator) to permit integration and analysis of diverse types of biologic data. BioMediator will combine information from a variety of different public and private sources (e.g. experimental data) to help answer biologic questions. BioMediator builds on the foundations laid by the currently funded GeneSeek data integration system. The GeneSeek system was originally developed to query only public domain data sources (both structured and semi-structured) to assist in the curation of the GeneClinics genetic testing knowledge base. The specific aims leading to the development of the BioMediator system are: 1) Interface to additional public domain biological data sources (e.g. pathway databases, function databases). 2) Incorporate access to private databases of experimental results (e.g. proteomics and expression array data). 3) Extend model to include analytic tools operating across distributed biological data sources (e.g. across a set of both proteomic and expression array data). 4) Evolve centralized BioMediator system into a model peer to peer data sharing and analysis system. 5) Distribute and maintain BioMediator production software as a resource for the biological community. The health relatedness of the project is that biologists seeking to understand the molecular basis of human health and disease are struggling with large and increasing volumes of diverse data (mutation, expression array, proteomic) that need to be brought together (integrated) and analyzed in order to develop and test hypotheses about disease mechanisms and normal physiology. The research design is to develop BioMediator by combining and leverage recent developments in a) the domain of open source analytic tools for biologic data and b) ongoing theoretical and applied research by members of the current GeneSeek research team on both general purpose and biologic data integration systems. The methods are:  a) to use an iterative rapid prototyping software development model evaluated in a real-world test bed and b) to expand the existing GeneSeek research team (with expertise in informatics, computer science, and software development) to include biological expertise (four biologists forming a biology working group) and biostatistics expertise. The goal is to ensure the BioMediator system 1) meets the needs of a group of end users acquiring, integrating and analyzing diverse biologic data sets, 2) does so in a scaleable and expandable manner drawing on the latest theoretical developments in data analysis and integration. n/a",BioMediator: Biologic Data Integration & Analysis System,6681249,R01HG002288,"['artificial intelligence', ' bioengineering /biomedical engineering', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' data collection methodology /evaluation', ' information retrieval', ' molecular biology information system']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2003,100000,0.017349518604271887
"Development of Bioinformatic Tools for Virtual Cloning    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The ability to delineate (at least in theory) all the proteins encoded in the human genome and all of those encoded by the genomes of major human parasites has given us an unprecedented opportunity to address the causes and treatment of every major human disease.  However, the vast increase in biological knowledge that has resulted from the last decade of genomic DNA sequencing has led us to a a crisis in bioinformatics.  This crisis is two-fold: analysis of data and planning of experiments.  Most of the scientific resources being expended in bioinformatics are being spent on data analysis tools. While these are essential, we should not neglect the opportunity to accelerate the progress of actual experimental biology.  All modern experimental molecular biology (and, increasingly, structural biology) depends upon the availability of plasmid clones to address specific scientific questions.  Although software facilitating DNA manipulations exists, few programs advise users of optimal strategies and none automate the process of clone generation. Genomics initiatives identify proteins at the genome level and demand the generation of hundreds of expression clones for recombinant protein production in exogenous hosts such as E. coli.  Establishment of libraries of expression clones requires automation and optimization as well as effective means of data storage, archiving, annotation and query.  To address these needs, as well as to facilitate routine DNA manipulations in virtually any molecular biology laboratory, we propose (1) to test and build a task centered virtual cloning expert system that serves as a knowledge base for DNA manipulations, and (2) to test and build an information automaton for the construction of expression clone libraries in support of structural genomics initiatives and other high throughput experiments.         n/a",Development of Bioinformatic Tools for Virtual Cloning,6583437,R43GM067279,"['artificial intelligence', ' biomedical automation', ' computer program /software', ' computer simulation', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' expression cloning', ' gene expression', ' genetic library', ' genetic manipulation', ' informatics', ' molecular biology information system', ' transfection /expression vector']",NIGMS,"VIRMATICS, LLC",R43,2003,100000,-0.012446379821398674
"Community Deposit and Review of Biochemical Databases DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Understanding how the phenotype of an organism is produced by its genotype and environment is fundamental to modern biomedicine. Cellular biochemistry forms the best-characterized complex biochemical system available, and provides a unique opportunity to better understand the structure-function relationships that produce phenotypes. Understood mathematically, cells are a biochemical network whose topology, function, and possible behaviors are only still only dimly understood.      Our previous work has resulted in the development of several databases (END, BND, Klotho) and software systems (The Agora, Glossa) to provide, accumulate, and use data on biochemical networks by users worldwide. In this application for competitive renewal, we propose to embark on a systematic study of structure-function relationships in biochemical networks, focusing on the discovery of patterns of biochemical function --- functional motives. We will identify these motives and their distribution over all enzymatic reactions by comparing changes in reactants' structures and enzymes' specificities, rather than just examine keywords. This systematic examination will allow us to determine, at much greater resolution than ever before, what functions each molecule and reaction have. To do this we must significantly extend the functionalities of our current systems in three major ways. First, we will add significant new data on the structure of small molecules of biochemical interest, enzymatic reactions, the mechanisms of gene expression, and dementia. Second, we will further develop and test methods that produce semantic interoperability among independent, disparate databases. Third, we will develop algorithms to detect and catalogue patterns of biochemical function among thousands of reactions and molecules; to more speedily enumerate paths among molecules and subnets in the biochemical network; to determine the extent of convergent evolution among enzymes; to trace atoms through a sequence of reactions such as a metabolic pathway; and to suggest novel biochemical reactions. We will use these capabilities to define and search for functional motives among enzymatic reactions, testing their correlation with network topology and dynamics, and to estimate the extent to which functional similarities arise from convergent evolution of enzymes. n/a",Community Deposit and Review of Biochemical Databases,6694513,R01GM056529,"['artificial intelligence', ' biochemistry', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' dementia', ' enzyme mechanism', ' functional /structural genomics', ' information system analysis', ' mathematical model', ' molecular biology information system', ' molecular dynamics', ' physiology', ' protein structure function']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI-COLUMBIA,R01,2003,556670,0.0030647537729465704

"AUTOMATED KNOWLEDGE EXTRACTION FOR BIOMEDICAL LITERATURE It is becoming increasingly difficult for biologists to keep pace with           information being published within their own fields, let alone biology           as a whole. The ability to rapidly access specific and current                   biomedical information as well as to quickly gain an overview of current         knowledge in a given field is becoming more difficult while at the same          time more important. Traditional methods of keeping up with advances are         therefore becoming inadequate.                                                                                                                                    This project will involve a unique collaboration between a computational         linguist at Brandeis University and two biologists at Tufts University           School of Medicine. We propose to make use of recent advances in the             computational analysis of text to organize and summarize the biological          literature. Building on our previous language technology research at             Brandeis, we propose to integrate the domain knowledge of the National           Library of Medicine's Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) with                Brandeis' semantic lexicon, CoreLex, toward the development of                   normalized structured representations of the semantic content of                 abstracts in the Medline database. These data structures, called lexical         webs, accelerate the availability of information in a richly hyperlinked         index that facilitates rapid navigation and information access.                  Automated analysis of biological abstracts will be combined with                 information derived from sequence databases to provide an up-to-date and         comprehensive database of information regarding known genes and                  proteins. The results of this analysis will be used to construct a web           accessible database organized on a gene-by-gene basis.                                                                                                            Other unique aspects of this database will be the visualization of               motifs and features extracted from Medline abstracts through the                 generation of annotated structure-function maps of proteins and genes,           and the construction of gene-specific semantic indexes to the relevant           biological literature.

"AN INTEGRATED SYSTEM FOR MOLECULAR MICROSCOPY Molecular microscopy has become an increasingly important tool for structural biology but the methodology is very labor intensive and very slow.  It is generally recognized that the development of improved capabilities for three-dimensional electron microscopy are critical for progress in emerging integrative research in molecular cell biology.  We aim to develop a system for rapid routine structure determination of macromolecular assemblies.  Our ultimate goal is to develop an integrated system that can produce a three-dimensional electron density map of a structure within a few hours of inserting a specimen in the electron microscope.  The motivation for this work is to provide answers to interesting biological questions. We will initially use our work on motor-microtubule complexes and actomyosin as the driver for the development of the integrated system.  By tightly coupling the development of the new system with its implementation in a laboratory whose primary goal is answering fundamental questions in cell biology, we will obtain immediate and invaluable feedback as to how the system is used in practice. Developing this system will involve devising new approaches and integrating the results of several ongoing research projects. The primary specific aims are:  (1) To remove the requirement for using film to acquire the high magnification electron micrographs.  This will require the development of feature recognition algorithms and new imaging strategies that take into account the characteristics of currently available digital cameras.  (2) Improve and automate our existing software for helical image analysis.  We will incorporate new methods for determining the helical parameters of an unknown specimen, methods for improving the resolution, and methods for analyzing non-helical specimens.  (3) Integration of the acquisition and the analysis steps.  This will require incorporation of machine learning techniques to produce a system that is highly efficient in terms of throughput and data quality. The general framework for integrated acquisition and analysis to be developed will be readily extendible to other specimens (helical tubes, single particles, two-dimensional crystals). Thus, once the system has been successfully implemented it will be made generally available to the scientific community.  The system we plan to develop has the potential to revolutionize the field of three-dimensional electron microscopy and make this approach accessible to a wide community.  n/a",AN INTEGRATED SYSTEM FOR MOLECULAR MICROSCOPY,6636516,R01GM061939,"['actins', ' bioimaging /biomedical imaging', ' biomedical equipment development', ' digital imaging', ' electron density', ' electron microscopy', ' image processing', ' microtubules', ' myosins', ' structural biology']",NIGMS,SCRIPPS RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2003,374063,0.005082348217863736

The Specific Aims are: 1) to use a novel, general purpose knowledge representation language to capture the schema of an existing database of clinical knowledge (GeneClinics genetic testing database), 2) to build a shared schema for mediating cross database queries, by extending the schema of GeneClinics and incorporating pertinent schema elements from other structured and semi-structured information sources, 3) to create and test interfaces to the targeted genetic information sources (databases and other structured information) from the shared query mediation schema, 4) to adapt the existing Tukwila data integration system to implement cross database query planning, query execution, and query result aggregation in the context of our shared query mediation schema and the multiple structured (genetic) information sources to create the GeneSeek data integration system, 5) to evaluate the performance of the Tukwila based GeneSeek data integration system and the shared data schema for precision and recall in finding relevant information for curation of a clinical database (GeneClinics genetic testing database). The broad health relatedness of the project is that data integration tools are needed to help clinicians apply the ever- growing body of medical information to patient care.  The tools are needed by curators of databases of medical knowledge as well as by the care providers themselves.

"Improving Quantum Chemistry Calculations DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to extend the functionality of our commercial quantum chemistry program, Q-Chem, to effectively treat molecules containing transition metals. This enhanced capability will provide Q-Chem's end-users with the ability to accurately model complex molecules such as proteins, enzymes, and catalysts of industrial importance. While remarkable progress has been made over the last several years in the accurate modeling of systems containing transition metals, current numerical methods for achieving SCF convergence in these systems are problematic at best, resulting in long execution times or, in some cases, complete failure to find a solution. However, a novel computational technique developed at Q-Chem has been shown to dramatically improve convergence for organic molecules with known SCF convergence problems. We propose to adapt this method for use with transition metals. Our goal is to achieve the same robust SCF convergence that is realized for most organic molecules, thereby greatly increasing productivity and extending the capability of scientists to study molecules such as enzymes and industrial catalysts. During Phase (I, our efforts will be to further extend Q-Chem's capability in the molecular biology arena. This proposal seeks to improve the quantum chemical treatment of molecular systems containing transition metals. Transition metal elements are essential to natural biological processes. The technology developed in this research will enable the computer modeling of those systems that are difficult to handle with the current methodologies and therefore increase of the applications of computational modeling. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: Transition-metal elements play a vital role in biological systems.

Phrap and Cross_Match will also be           modified to use XML-formatted data allowing users to apply constraints to            sequence assembly. Lastly, we will develop a new program to review, edit, and        manipulate sequences, thus giving users unprecedented control over their data.      PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION:                                                                                     Phrap is widely used in industry and academia for applications involving DNA sequences.  There are over 100 commercial sites that would benefit from new versions of Phrap that support incremental assemblies and utilize computer resources better.  An API for Phrap will encourage application development creating additional commercialization possibilities for algorithm and application developers. n/a",Second Generation DNA Sequence Management Tools,6444292,R44HG002244,"['artificial intelligence', ' computer data analysis', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' data management', ' genotype', ' informatics', ' mathematical model', ' nucleic acid sequence']",NHGRI,"GEOSPIZA, INC.",R44,2002,531259,0.004263642653901724
"VIRUS STRUCTURE DETERMINATION SOFTWARE Virus structure determination using electron microscopy has become a useful research tool aimed at understanding viral assembly and infectivity to facilitate the design of anti-viral drugs and virus-based gene delivery systems. Our long term goal is to broaden the group of people able to determine virus structures by providing an integrated software suite for three-dimensional virus structure determination using electron microscopy. The software suite, called Tumbleweed, will allow easy, efficient, and routine determination of icosahedral virus structures from electron micrographs. Novel aspects of Tumbleweed will include a comprehensive suite of tools for icosahedral structure determination, incorporation of an expert system to guide users through the reconstruction procedure, and data analysis tools to ensure that structures are determined accurately. Tumbleweed will also provide a consistent easy to use graphical user interface to all reconstruction tools including data analysis, data management, and data logging. In addition, Tumbleweed will provide tools for image selection, quality assessment, and structure visualization that can be used with any electron microscopy structure determination method. Thus, in addition to virologists, target users include electron microscopists and structural biologists. The result of this Phase Il SBIR will be a completely integrated and tested software package allowing easy, efficient, and routine virus structure determination. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: Tumbleweed is targeted at a large group of users with varied knowledge, experience, and research goals. Virologists will be attracted to the extensive user guidance and intuitive design. Structural biologists and electron microscopists performing virus structure determination will be attracted to the concept of a complete integrated software package. Last, all electron microscopists and structural biologists will be attracted to the integration of all general data processing into a single extendible package.

"Genomic application of suspension array technology DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The principle of the proposed project is the application of fluorescent microsphere based suspension array technology (SAT) to the cytometry based simultaneous detection of multi analytes. The proposal consists of four overlapping subprojects: (a) Technological development of biological microbead procedures using cells or microorganisms as substitutes for polymeric microspheres to lower the cost of SAT compared to the cost of methods using microbeads manufactured by polymer chemistry. (b) Development of a test to detect gene translocations and rearragements frequently responsible for malignant transformations. A method based on measuring bead-based hybridization of specific 5' and 3' nucleotide sequences in the vicinity of chromosomal translocation breakpoints would allow large scale screening of leukemias and various types of cancers by the measurement of 5'/3' sequence ratio. (c) Development of a DNA binding protein profiling assay providing easy, reproducible and high throughput technology to determine the expression pattern of transcription factors (TFs) binding to single stranded hexamere oligonucleotide sequences anchored to the solid phase surface of microspheres. This subproject is at the R&D level and needs to be thoroughly tested. (d) Development of artificial neural network software applications to analyze and classify the ""fingerprint patterns"" produced by the SAT measurements in subprojects (b) and (c).

It will build on existing open source tools such as a data acquisition package from particle physics (ROOT), a public database system (MYSQL or PostgreSQL), statistics tools (""R""), graphics libraries, a variety of software tools that have been developed at ISB and new tools needed for the new technologies. We stress the use of an open source system as a means to build the community, creating a functioning system that can be tailored for research and education. We then propose to augment this system with tools for analysis, visualization and model building. We will use yeast as a model system owing to the wide range of data that it available for it.

"AN INTEGRATED SYSTEM FOR MOLECULAR MICROSCOPY Molecular microscopy has become an increasingly important tool for structural biology but the methodology is very labor intensive and very slow.  It is generally recognized that the development of improved capabilities for three-dimensional electron microscopy are critical for progress in emerging integrative research in molecular cell biology.  We aim to develop a system for rapid routine structure determination of macromolecular assemblies.  Our ultimate goal is to develop an integrated system that can produce a three-dimensional electron density map of a structure within a few hours of inserting a specimen in the electron microscope.  The motivation for this work is to provide answers to interesting biological questions. We will initially use our work on motor-microtubule complexes and actomyosin as the driver for the development of the integrated system.  By tightly coupling the development of the new system with its implementation in a laboratory whose primary goal is answering fundamental questions in cell biology, we will obtain immediate and invaluable feedback as to how the system is used in practice. Developing this system will involve devising new approaches and integrating the results of several ongoing research projects. The primary specific aims are:  (1) To remove the requirement for using film to acquire the high magnification electron micrographs.  This will require the development of feature recognition algorithms and new imaging strategies that take into account the characteristics of currently available digital cameras.  (2) Improve and automate our existing software for helical image analysis.  We will incorporate new methods for determining the helical parameters of an unknown specimen, methods for improving the resolution, and methods for analyzing non-helical specimens.  (3) Integration of the acquisition and the analysis steps.  This will require incorporation of machine learning techniques to produce a system that is highly efficient in terms of throughput and data quality. The general framework for integrated acquisition and analysis to be developed will be readily extendible to other specimens (helical tubes, single particles, two-dimensional crystals). Thus, once the system has been successfully implemented it will be made generally available to the scientific community.  The system we plan to develop has the potential to revolutionize the field of three-dimensional electron microscopy and make this approach accessible to a wide community.  n/a",AN INTEGRATED SYSTEM FOR MOLECULAR MICROSCOPY,6520333,R01GM061939,"['actins', ' bioimaging /biomedical imaging', ' biomedical equipment development', ' digital imaging', ' electron density', ' electron microscopy', ' image processing', ' microtubules', ' myosins', ' structural biology']",NIGMS,SCRIPPS RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2002,363261,0.005082348217863736
"GENESEEK: DATA INTEGRATION SYSTEM FOR GENETIC DATABASES The broad long-term objectives of this proposal are to create and evaluate an infrastructure (GeneSeek) to permit searching across heterogeneous source databases (genomic and citation databases) for relevant information needed for curation of an existing database of clinical knowledge (GeneClinics).  The Specific Aims are: 1) to use a novel, general purpose knowledge representation language to capture the schema of an existing database of clinical knowledge (GeneClinics genetic testing database), 2) to build a shared schema for mediating cross database queries, by extending the schema of GeneClinics and incorporating pertinent schema elements from other structured and semi-structured information sources, 3) to create and test interfaces to the targeted genetic information sources (databases and other structured information) from the shared query mediation schema, 4) to adapt the existing Tukwila data integration system to implement cross database query planning, query execution, and query result aggregation in the context of our shared query mediation schema and the multiple structured (genetic) information sources to create the GeneSeek data integration system, 5) to evaluate the performance of the Tukwila based GeneSeek data integration system and the shared data schema for precision and recall in finding relevant information for curation of a clinical database (GeneClinics genetic testing database). The broad health relatedness of the project is that data integration tools are needed to help clinicians apply the ever- growing body of medical information to patient care.  The tools are needed by curators of databases of medical knowledge as well as by the care providers themselves.  Nowhere is the growth in information more apparent than in the Human Genome project thus the choice of genetics as a domain to test this data integration system.  The specific genetics database whose curation the GeneSeek system will be evaluated against the GeneClinics database.  If successful these data integration systems could be more broadly applied to other domains in biomedicine.  The research design is to apply recent developments in data integration from the artificial intelligence and database areas of computer science to a real world clinical genetics data integration problem to evaluate the applicability of this system to biomedical information retrieval tasks.  The methods are to expand an existing collaboration between the current GeneClinics content and informatics teams and investigators in the Department of Computer science to: 1) enhance the Tukwila data integration architecture and its related CARIN knowledge representation language, and 2) to use these tools and the existing GeneClinics data model to implement and evaluate this data integration system in the specific domain of medical genetics.  n/a",GENESEEK: DATA INTEGRATION SYSTEM FOR GENETIC DATABASES,6388359,R01HG002288,"['artificial intelligence', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' data collection methodology /evaluation', ' experimental designs', ' information retrieval', ' molecular biology information system', ' vocabulary development for information system']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2001,362594,-0.003226870520542547
"Functional Genomics Software   DESCRIPTION (Applicant's abstract): A substantial commercial potential exists        for software tools that allow a biomedical research scientist to use genomic         data to form experimentally testable hypotheses. These will be used to exploit       genomic sequence data to understand the aetiology of disease, to improve             diagnostic tools, and to develop more effective therapies. The Master Catalog,       a commercial product developed jointly by EraGen Biosciences and the Benner          laboratory at the University of Florida, provides a convenient framework for         implementing heuristics that do this. The Master Catalog is a naturally              organized database that contains evolutionary trees, multiple sequence               alignments, and reconstructed evolutionary intermediates for all of the              proteins in the GenBank database. The Benner laboratory has developed and            anecdotally tested heuristics that date events in the molecular history,             provide evidence for and against functional recruitment within a protein             family, detect distant homologs, associate individual residues important for         functional changes with a crystal structure, find metabolic and regulatory           pathways, and correlate events in the molecular record with the history of life      on Earth. This Phase I proposal seeks to validate a set of these heuristics          more broadly to determine their suitability for database-wide application. In        Phase II, we will implement these within the Master Catalog, and launch a            commercial bioinformatics product to support functional analysis of genomic          databases.                                                                           PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION:  In its present version, the Master Catalog is a successful commercial product within a  niche: ""best in class"" of bioinformatics databases.  Adding a validated set of heuristics  for extracting functional information from genome databases will make it the software  of choice for most functional genomics work, and be a central tool in the pharmaceutical/  biotechnology industries.  Academic versions and student versions will find markets in most  universities.                                                                                      n/a",Functional Genomics Software,6337786,R41HG002331,"['artificial intelligence', ' biochemical evolution', ' computer human interaction', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' functional /structural genomics', ' informatics', ' molecular biology information system', ' nucleic acid sequence']",NHGRI,"ERAGEN BIOSCIENCES, INC.",R41,2001,96855,-0.011499996944250447

"AUTOMATED KNOWLEDGE EXTRACTION FOR BIOMEDICAL LITERATURE It is becoming increasingly difficult for biologists to keep pace with           information being published within their own fields, let alone biology           as a whole. The ability to rapidly access specific and current                   biomedical information as well as to quickly gain an overview of current         knowledge in a given field is becoming more difficult while at the same          time more important. Traditional methods of keeping up with advances are         therefore becoming inadequate.

We propose to make use of recent advances in the             computational analysis of text to organize and summarize the biological          literature. Building on our previous language technology research at             Brandeis, we propose to integrate the domain knowledge of the National           Library of Medicine's Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) with                Brandeis' semantic lexicon, CoreLex, toward the development of                   normalized structured representations of the semantic content of                 abstracts in the Medline database. These data structures, called lexical         webs, accelerate the availability of information in a richly hyperlinked         index that facilitates rapid navigation and information access.                  Automated analysis of biological abstracts will be combined with                 information derived from sequence databases to provide an up-to-date and         comprehensive database of information regarding known genes and                  proteins. The results of this analysis will be used to construct a web           accessible database organized on a gene-by-gene basis.

"THE STANFORD PHARMACOGENETICS KNOWLEDGE BASE We propose to create the Stanford PharmacoGenetic Knowledge Base (PharmGKB), an integrated data resource to support the NIGMS Pharmacogenetic Research Network and Database Initiative.  This initiative will focus on how genetic variation contributes to variation in the response to drugs, and will produce data from a wide range of sources.  The PharmGKB will therefore interlink genomic, molecular, cellular and clinical information about gene systems important for modulating drug responses.  The PharmGKB is based on a powerful hierarchical data representation system that allows the data model to change as new knowledge is learned, while ensuring the security and stability of the data with a relational database foundation.

"Intelligent Information Systems for Systems Biology DESCRIPTION (Provided by Applicant): Our Center will attack the challenges created by the large quantity of data generated from new high throughput technologies. We have teamed biologists, computer scientists and computational scientists from several Universities to build an experienced and distinguished team. Our first major tool building project will be an Object Oriented Framework for the integration of data and tools for genomics, proteomics, DNA arrays and protein-protein interactions. This tool will follow the data from the source through model building. It will build on existing open source tools such as a data acquisition package from particle physics (ROOT), a public database system (MYSQL or PostgreSQL), statistics tools (""R""), graphics libraries, a variety of software tools that have been developed at ISB and new tools needed for the new technologies. We stress the use of an open source system as a means to build the community, creating a functioning system that can be tailored for research and education. We then propose to augment this system with tools for analysis, visualization and model building. We will use yeast as a model system owing to the wide range of data that it available for it. Finally, we propose some novel educational programs designed to put graduate students together into interdisciplinary teams for problem solving. n/a",Intelligent Information Systems for Systems Biology,6401728,P20GM064361,"['analytical method', ' artificial intelligence', ' biotechnology', ' computer program /software', ' data management', ' educational resource design /development', ' functional /structural genomics', ' high throughput technology', ' mathematical model', ' method development', ' microarray technology', ' model design /development', ' molecular biology', ' molecular biology information system', ' protein protein interaction', ' proteomics', ' technology /technique development', ' yeasts']",NIGMS,INSTITUTE FOR SYSTEMS BIOLOGY,P20,2001,237000,0.012843381191046008
"AN INTEGRATED SYSTEM FOR MOLECULAR MICROSCOPY Molecular microscopy has become an increasingly important tool for structural biology but the methodology is very labor intensive and very slow.  It is generally recognized that the development of improved capabilities for three-dimensional electron microscopy are critical for progress in emerging integrative research in molecular cell biology.  We aim to develop a system for rapid routine structure determination of macromolecular assemblies.  Our ultimate goal is to develop an integrated system that can produce a three-dimensional electron density map of a structure within a few hours of inserting a specimen in the electron microscope.  The motivation for this work is to provide answers to interesting biological questions. We will initially use our work on motor-microtubule complexes and actomyosin as the driver for the development of the integrated system.  By tightly coupling the development of the new system with its implementation in a laboratory whose primary goal is answering fundamental questions in cell biology, we will obtain immediate and invaluable feedback as to how the system is used in practice. Developing this system will involve devising new approaches and integrating the results of several ongoing research projects. The primary specific aims are:  (1) To remove the requirement for using film to acquire the high magnification electron micrographs.  This will require the development of feature recognition algorithms and new imaging strategies that take into account the characteristics of currently available digital cameras.  (2) Improve and automate our existing software for helical image analysis.  We will incorporate new methods for determining the helical parameters of an unknown specimen, methods for improving the resolution, and methods for analyzing non-helical specimens.  (3) Integration of the acquisition and the analysis steps.  This will require incorporation of machine learning techniques to produce a system that is highly efficient in terms of throughput and data quality. The general framework for integrated acquisition and analysis to be developed will be readily extendible to other specimens (helical tubes, single particles, two-dimensional crystals). Thus, once the system has been successfully implemented it will be made generally available to the scientific community.  The system we plan to develop has the potential to revolutionize the field of three-dimensional electron microscopy and make this approach accessible to a wide community.  n/a",AN INTEGRATED SYSTEM FOR MOLECULAR MICROSCOPY,6484619,R01GM061939,"['actins', ' bioimaging /biomedical imaging', ' biomedical equipment development', ' digital imaging', ' electron density', ' electron microscopy', ' image processing', ' microtubules', ' myosins', ' structural biology']",NIGMS,SCRIPPS RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2001,337739,0.005082348217863736
"GENESEEK: DATA INTEGRATION SYSTEM FOR GENETIC DATABASES The broad long-term objectives of this proposal are to create and evaluate an infrastructure (GeneSeek) to permit searching across heterogeneous source databases (genomic and citation databases) for relevant information needed for curation of an existing database of clinical knowledge (GeneClinics).  The Specific Aims are: 1) to use a novel, general purpose knowledge representation language to capture the schema of an existing database of clinical knowledge (GeneClinics genetic testing database), 2) to build a shared schema for mediating cross database queries, by extending the schema of GeneClinics and incorporating pertinent schema elements from other structured and semi-structured information sources, 3) to create and test interfaces to the targeted genetic information sources (databases and other structured information) from the shared query mediation schema, 4) to adapt the existing Tukwila data integration system to implement cross database query planning, query execution, and query result aggregation in the context of our shared query mediation schema and the multiple structured (genetic) information sources to create the GeneSeek data integration system, 5) to evaluate the performance of the Tukwila based GeneSeek data integration system and the shared data schema for precision and recall in finding relevant information for curation of a clinical database (GeneClinics genetic testing database). The broad health relatedness of the project is that data integration tools are needed to help clinicians apply the ever- growing body of medical information to patient care.  The tools are needed by curators of databases of medical knowledge as well as by the care providers themselves.  Nowhere is the growth in information more apparent than in the Human Genome project thus the choice of genetics as a domain to test this data integration system.  The specific genetics database whose curation the GeneSeek system will be evaluated against the GeneClinics database.  If successful these data integration systems could be more broadly applied to other domains in biomedicine.  The research design is to apply recent developments in data integration from the artificial intelligence and database areas of computer science to a real world clinical genetics data integration problem to evaluate the applicability of this system to biomedical information retrieval tasks.  The methods are to expand an existing collaboration between the current GeneClinics content and informatics teams and investigators in the Department of Computer science to: 1) enhance the Tukwila data integration architecture and its related CARIN knowledge representation language, and 2) to use these tools and the existing GeneClinics data model to implement and evaluate this data integration system in the specific domain of medical genetics.  n/a",GENESEEK: DATA INTEGRATION SYSTEM FOR GENETIC DATABASES,6031661,R01HG002288,"['artificial intelligence', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' data collection methodology /evaluation', ' experimental designs', ' information retrieval', ' molecular biology information system', ' vocabulary development for information system']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2000,354198,-0.003226870520542547
"COMMUNITY DEPOSIT AND REVIEW OF BIOCHEMICAL DATABASES DESCRIPTION:  Computing with biochemical reactions is increasingly important     in studying genomes, assessing toxicity, and developing therapeutics.

Incorporation of biochemical information into             databases is extremely slow compared to that of sequence and structural          information, and will lag further as large-scale surveys of gene expression      and other reactions accelerate over the next few years.

"PATTERN RECOGNITION IN MACROMOLECULAR CRYSTALLOGRAPHY Computer algorithms based on pattern recognition are being used in many areas of science and technology to assist the scientist in solving complex, time-consuming, and often tedious real-world problems.  The basic premise is to train a computer to efficiently identify a known pattern in an unknown dataset.  This needle-in-a-haystack approach is being used in the area of genomics, where there are already several examples of very powerful computational pattern recognition approaches available for searching new sequences for structural motifs, similarities to other proteins and DNA, and predicting secondary structure, based solely on the DNA or amino acid sequence.  We believe that macromolecular crystallography can also benefit from the application of pattern recognition to the often daunting task of fitting atoms into an electron density map.  The fact that electron density maps are three-dimensional images provides an additional challenge to this technology in that the procedures we are developing in order to find matching patterns must be rotation invariant.  To test the validity of our hypothesis we will complete the following aims: 1) we will develop a set of rotation invariant features that can characterize the patterns in regions of an electron density map, 2) we will determine the optimal size of feature regions and the size and type of structural database required to find similar regions of electron density capable of accurately determining structures, and 3) we will develop a methodology to synthesize matched regions to produce coherent local and global models of protein structure. If these goals can be met, we will investigate the feasibility of incorporating knowledge-based methods, neural networks, and other AI techniques to augment the interpretation of structures from electron density maps.  In addition, we will attempt to extend this methodology to produce initial structures for electron density maps that are either of poor quality and/or low resolution.  n/a",PATTERN RECOGNITION IN MACROMOLECULAR CRYSTALLOGRAPHY,6182183,R21GM059398,"['artificial intelligence', ' bioimaging /biomedical imaging', ' computer simulation', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' electron crystallography', ' electron density', ' molecular biology information system', ' physical model', ' protein structure', ' structural biology']",NIGMS,TEXAS ENGINEERING EXPERIMENT STATION,R21,2000,101500,-0.035360579899729176
"VIRUS STRUCTURE DETERMINATION SOFTWARE Virus structure determination using electron microscopy has become a useful research tool aimed at understanding viral assembly and infectivity to facilitate the design of anti-viral drugs and virus-based gene delivery systems. Our long term goal is to broaden the group of people able to determine virus structures by providing an integrated software suite for three-dimensional virus structure determination using electron microscopy. The software suite, called Tumbleweed, will allow easy, efficient, and routine determination of icosahedral virus structures from electron micrographs. Novel aspects of Tumbleweed will include a comprehensive suite of tools for icosahedral structure determination, incorporation of an expert system to guide users through the reconstruction procedure, and data analysis tools to ensure that structures are determined accurately. Tumbleweed will also provide a consistent easy to use graphical user interface to all reconstruction tools including data analysis, data management, and data logging. In addition, Tumbleweed will provide tools for image selection, quality assessment, and structure visualization that can be used with any electron microscopy structure determination method. Thus, in addition to virologists, target users include electron microscopists and structural biologists. The result of this Phase Il SBIR will be a completely integrated and tested software package allowing easy, efficient, and routine virus structure determination. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: Tumbleweed is targeted at a large group of users with varied knowledge, experience, and research goals. Virologists will be attracted to the extensive user guidance and intuitive design. Structural biologists and electron microscopists performing virus structure determination will be attracted to the concept of a complete integrated software package. Last, all electron microscopists and structural biologists will be attracted to the integration of all general data processing into a single extendible package.

The     project will focus on the domain of childhood immunization, and will build       upon IMM/Serve, a childhood immunization forecasting program that takes as       input a child's immunization history, and produces recommendations as to         which vaccinations are due and which vaccinations should be scheduled next.      The effort required to modify and validate such a program as the clinical        field evolves over time is a challenging task.  It will be extremely             important to have a robust set of tools to assist in this process.

The project will refine and extend computer-based tools for immunization     knowledge maintenance.  These tools will include:  a) IMM/Def, a program         which automatically generates the rule-based logic for the most complex          portion (""kernel"") of IMM/Serve's knowledge, and b) IMM/Test, a program          which automatically generates a set of test cases to help test the kernel        logic.  The project will also develop an organized set of strategies for         immunization test case generation, and implement those strategies in the         refined version of IMM/Test.                                                                                                                                      2.

"STATISTICAL STUDIES OF DNA EVOLUTION Our goals are to develop methods for statistical analyses of DNA sequence data and to understand the mechanisms of DNA evolution. The specific aims are: l. To examine current methods and develop new methods for estimating evolutionary dates, which is now a central issue in molecular evolution. We shall use the new methods to study divergence dates in mammals, which have recently become very controversial. 2. To develop methods for estimating selection intensities in different regions of a gene and to carry out statistical analyses of DNA sequence data from mammals. 3. To develop fast algorithms for finding optimal trees for the following methods: maximum likelihood, maximum parsimony, and minimum evolution.

"AUTOMATED KNOWLEDGE EXTRACTION FOR BIOMEDICAL LITERATURE It is becoming increasingly difficult for biologists to keep pace with           information being published within their own fields, let alone biology           as a whole. The ability to rapidly access specific and current                   biomedical information as well as to quickly gain an overview of current         knowledge in a given field is becoming more difficult while at the same          time more important. Traditional methods of keeping up with advances are         therefore becoming inadequate.                                                                                                                                    This project will involve a unique collaboration between a computational         linguist at Brandeis University and two biologists at Tufts University           School of Medicine. We propose to make use of recent advances in the             computational analysis of text to organize and summarize the biological          literature. Building on our previous language technology research at             Brandeis, we propose to integrate the domain knowledge of the National           Library of Medicine's Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) with                Brandeis' semantic lexicon, CoreLex, toward the development of                   normalized structured representations of the semantic content of                 abstracts in the Medline database. These data structures, called lexical         webs, accelerate the availability of information in a richly hyperlinked         index that facilitates rapid navigation and information access.                  Automated analysis of biological abstracts will be combined with                 information derived from sequence databases to provide an up-to-date and         comprehensive database of information regarding known genes and                  proteins. The results of this analysis will be used to construct a web           accessible database organized on a gene-by-gene basis.                                                                                                            Other unique aspects of this database will be the visualization of               motifs and features extracted from Medline abstracts through the                 generation of annotated structure-function maps of proteins and genes,           and the construction of gene-specific semantic indexes to the relevant           biological literature. This system, called MedStract, will reduce the            time required for biomedical researchers to find information of interest         and should facilitate the development of new research insights.                   n/a",AUTOMATED KNOWLEDGE EXTRACTION FOR BIOMEDICAL LITERATURE,6165092,R01LM006649,"['Internet', ' abstracting', ' artificial intelligence', ' computer assisted sequence analysis', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' informatics', ' information retrieval', ' information system analysis', ' molecular biology information system', ' nucleic acid sequence', ' protein sequence', ' semantics', ' syntax', ' vocabulary development for information system']",NLM,BRANDEIS UNIVERSITY,R01,2000,297119,-0.03796262464652894
"THREE DIMENSIONAL RECONSTRUCTION OF SYNAPSES DESCRIPTION (Taken from application abstract):  Recent advances in               understanding neuronal functions have led to an expanded scientific interest     in defining the organization of the nervous system so the spatial correlates     of these functions can be identified.  This interest has been formalized as      the Human Brain Project, an ambitious multi disciplinary effort to map the       nervous system from the organismal to the macromolecular levels.  One of the     greatest challenges of this effort is to preserve the complex                    three-dimensional relationships that occur between neuronal structures.          This problem will require new methods for data acquisition as well as data       visualization.                                                                                                                                                    The project described here is an interdisciplinary effort to derive              three-dimensional reconstructions of synaptic architecture from stereo           electron micrographs acquired from multiple viewpoints.  The collaboration       combines advanced ultrastructural visualization techniques with massively        parallel computational methods and an innovative set of pattern recognition,     stereo correspondence and depth mapping algorithms.  Our goal is to              integrate structural information from numerous images into a single,             high-accuracy three-dimensional reconstruction of the synaptic cytoskeleton.     The immediate result of this collaboration will be an improved understanding     of the spatial relationships between synaptic macromolecules.  More              importantly, the project will produce a set of computational tools that can      be applied to stereo image data sets of various areas of the nervous system,     from the macroscopic to the molecular level.  Finally, our studies will          advance the state-of-the-art of parallel computation and interactive             reconstruction methods that can provide novel solutions to difficult             problems of neuroscience visualization.                                           n/a",THREE DIMENSIONAL RECONSTRUCTION OF SYNAPSES,6185220,R01LM006326,"['artificial intelligence', ' bioimaging /biomedical imaging', ' brain mapping', ' cell cell interaction', ' computational neuroscience', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' cytoskeleton', ' data collection', ' electron microscopy', ' image processing', ' imaging /visualization /scanning', ' macromolecule', ' method development', ' nerve endings', ' neurons', ' parallel processing', ' stereophotography', ' structural biology', ' synapses']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,R01,2000,117821,-0.016361381738355614

"AN INTEGRATED SYSTEM FOR MOLECULAR MICROSCOPY Molecular microscopy has become an increasingly important tool for structural biology but the methodology is very labor intensive and very slow.  It is generally recognized that the development of improved capabilities for three-dimensional electron microscopy are critical for progress in emerging integrative research in molecular cell biology.  We aim to develop a system for rapid routine structure determination of macromolecular assemblies.  Our ultimate goal is to develop an integrated system that can produce a three-dimensional electron density map of a structure within a few hours of inserting a specimen in the electron microscope.  The motivation for this work is to provide answers to interesting biological questions. We will initially use our work on motor-microtubule complexes and actomyosin as the driver for the development of the integrated system.  By tightly coupling the development of the new system with its implementation in a laboratory whose primary goal is answering fundamental questions in cell biology, we will obtain immediate and invaluable feedback as to how the system is used in practice. Developing this system will involve devising new approaches and integrating the results of several ongoing research projects. The primary specific aims are:  (1) To remove the requirement for using film to acquire the high magnification electron micrographs.  This will require the development of feature recognition algorithms and new imaging strategies that take into account the characteristics of currently available digital cameras.  (2) Improve and automate our existing software for helical image analysis.  We will incorporate new methods for determining the helical parameters of an unknown specimen, methods for improving the resolution, and methods for analyzing non-helical specimens.  (3) Integration of the acquisition and the analysis steps.  This will require incorporation of machine learning techniques to produce a system that is highly efficient in terms of throughput and data quality. The general framework for integrated acquisition and analysis to be developed will be readily extendible to other specimens (helical tubes, single particles, two-dimensional crystals). Thus, once the system has been successfully implemented it will be made generally available to the scientific community.  The system we plan to develop has the potential to revolutionize the field of three-dimensional electron microscopy and make this approach accessible to a wide community.  n/a",AN INTEGRATED SYSTEM FOR MOLECULAR MICROSCOPY,6193019,R01GM061939,"['actins', ' bioimaging /biomedical imaging', ' biomedical equipment development', ' digital imaging', ' electron density', ' electron microscopy', ' image processing', ' microtubules', ' myosins', ' structural biology']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R01,2000,478050,0.005082348217863736
"COMPUTER BASED SEQUENCE ANALYSIS AND RNA VIRUS EVOLUTION The goal of the proposed research is the analysis of biological sequence         data to address the molecular mechanisms of evolution and the origin(s)          of all viruses and related genetic elements. Phylogenetic trees will             provide a framework for the mapping of cell and tissue tropism,                  pathogenicity and virulence, modes of transmission and geographical              distributions, and many other higher order characteristics of viruses.           The specific aims of proposed analytical studies are: 1) determining             functionally equivalent networks and frequency of exchange among and             between retroid elements, and their potential cellular homologues,               including new studies on 300 retroviral env proteins; 2) inferring               functionally important regions of all proteins of paramyxo-, rhabdo- and         filoviruses, (with privileged access to new Ebola sequences), and Borna          Disease virus, (including potential BDV sequences from schizophrenic             patients); and 3) the analysis of the dUTPase gene, as a model system,           to address issues relevant to the structure, function and evolution of           duplicated sequences, and potential horizontal transfer among and between        host and viral genomes. The specific aims of the technical studies are:          1) evaluation of stochastic production model approaches for generation           of multiple alignments, detection of recombination, and calculation of           evolutionary distances; and 2) development and testing of new and                existing methods for historical reconstruction of functionally equivalent        networks.                                                                                                                                                         RNA viruses (e.g. HIV, or Ebola) are the major causative agents of human,        animal and plant viral diseases world wide. The heterogeneous nature of          RNA populations makes it difficult to develop effective, anti-viral              agents. The sequence database is now large enough to conduct comparative         studies on natural variants versus chemotheraputically induced mutants           for several retroviral proteins. This model study will provide new               information on the nature of selected mutations which will be useful in          future anti-viral drug development.                                                                                                                               Computational analysis of primary sequence data is an area of intense            interest in biology, mathematics, statistics and systems science. In the         last few years new approaches to problem solving and classification, such        as machine learning, neural networks, genetic algorithms, and stochastic         production models or, ""intelligent systems"" as they are referred to              collectively, have become available. Unfortunately most biologists are           unaware of these developments. Application of these methods to real data         remains unexplored. The proposed studies will go a long way in rectifying        this gap in technological utilization. These studies will continue to            define important evolutionary relationships and events, provide                  biologically informative sequence relationships for bench-marking new            software, and contribute new information relevant to the structure and           function of viral proteins suggesting new directions in laboratory               experimentation.

"Machine learning approaches for improved accuracy and speed in sequence annotation Summary/Abstract Alignment of biological sequences is a key step in understanding their evolution, function, and patterns of activity. Here, we describe Machine Learning approaches to improve both accuracy and speed of highly- sensitive sequence alignment. To improve accuracy, we develop methods to reduce erroneous annotation caused by (1) the existence of low complexity and repetitive sequence and (2) the overextension of alignments of true homologs into unrelated sequence. We describe approaches based on both hidden Markov models and Artificial Neural Networks to dramatically reduce these sorts of sequence annotation error. We also address the issue of annotation speed, with development of a custom Deep Learning architecture designed to very quickly filter away large portions of candidate sequence comparisons prior to the relatively-slow sequence-alignment step. The results of these efforts will be incorporated into forks of the open source sequence alignment tools HMMER, MMSeqs, and (where appropriate) BLAST; we will also work with community developers of annotation pipelines, such as RepeatMasker and IMG/M, to incorporate these approaches. The development and incorporation into these widely used bioinformatics tools will lead to widespread impact on sequence annotation efforts. Narrative Modern molecular biology depends on effective methods for creating sequence alignments quickly and accurately. This proposal describes a plan to develop novel Machine Learning approaches that will dramatically increase the speed of highly-sensitive sequence alignment, and will also address two significant sources of erroneous sequence annotation, (i) the presence of repetitive sequence in biological sequences, and (ii) the tendency for sequence alignment algorithms to extend alignments beyond the boundaries of true homology. The proposed methods represent a mix of applications of hidden Markov models and Artificial Neural Networks, and build on prior success in applying such methods to the problem of sensitive sequence annotation.",Machine learning approaches for improved accuracy and speed in sequence annotation,10020995,R01GM132600,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Consumption', 'Custom', 'DNA Transposable Elements', 'Data Set', 'Deletion Mutation', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Error Sources', 'Evolution', 'Foundations', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Industry Standard', 'Insertion Mutation', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Label', 'Letters', 'Licensing', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Masks', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular Biology', 'Network-based', 'Nucleotides', 'Pattern', 'Pilot Projects', 'Proteins', 'Repetitive Sequence', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Statistical Models', 'Takifugu', 'Work', 'annotation  system', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'bioinformatics tool', 'computing resources', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'density', 'design', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'markov model', 'neural network architecture', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'software development', 'statistics', 'success', 'tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MONTANA,R01,2020,287504,-0.008702125079370564
"DNA 3.0: Developing novel enzymes for DNA synthesis with deep learning and combinatorial genetics Project Summary/Abstract  DNA synthesis has played a key role in the biotechnology revolution. The ready availability of synthetic DNA oligonucleotides and of genes assembled from them, has been invaluable for elucidating and unlocking biological function and enabling the new field of synthetic biology which can create novel cells, enzymes, therapeutics, diagnostics and other reagents of commercial value. Despite this impact, DNA synthesis uses chemical strategies developed over 30 years ago which are costly and limited to molecules of 200 nucleotides or less in length.  Next-generation enzymatic DNA synthesis technologies are being explored that use template- independent DNA polymerases (TIDPs) for controlled addition of nucleotides to a growing DNA strand. Although advances have been reported recently, enzymatic DNA synthesis is still limited by the low efficiency of available TIDPs, and specifically by the relative inability of these polymerases to incorporate 3'-blocked nucleotides.  In this Phase I Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project, Primordial Genetics Inc, a synthetic biology company with differentiated combinatorial genetic technology, and Denovium Inc., an artificial intelligence company pioneering novel Al methods for genetic discovery, are joining forces to develop novel and highly efficient TIDPs for enzymatic DNA synthesis in vitro.  Denovium will use their computational capabilities based on machine learning algorithms to discover novel TIDPs with the desired activities from proprietary and public databases. Denovium will also perform proprietary artificial intelligence (AI) scans to determine the functional impact of all possible mutations on the selected TIDPs. Primordial Genetics will synthesize and express the resulting collection of sequences, and test them in vitro to identify the most active enzymes. The best 2 enzymes will be diversified using Primordial Genetics' proprietary Function Generator technology and other randomized diversification methods. Populations of genes encoding enzyme variants will be screened with ultra-high-throughput screens to identify the most active enzymes. The dataset resulting from this work will be used to train Denovium's sequence prediction algorithm to accelerate further enzyme improvements in Phase II.  The proposed work is a feasibility study for isolating and developing novel enzymes suitable for enzymatic DNA synthesis, and also for creating a pipeline of enzyme optimization tools. The enzymes discovered and in this work will be directly useful for enzymatic DNA synthesis applications, and can be licensed or sold to leading DNA and gene manufaturers. Project Narrative The principal aim of this project is to develop novel and improved DNA polymerases for the industrial synthesis of DNA, which is currently performed by synthetic chemical methods and represents one of the cornerstone technologies of the biotechnology industry. To overcome limitations of the current chemical technology in cost, efficiency and the length of DNA molecules that can be synthesized, there have been widespread attempts to develop specific DNA polymerases as efficient molecular machines for synthesizing DNA. This project will develop novel and more efficient polymerases than are currently available, which will impact the diagnosis, prevention and treatment of human diseases such as cancer, heart disease, HIV and genetic diseases such as cystic fibrosis.",DNA 3.0: Developing novel enzymes for DNA synthesis with deep learning and combinatorial genetics,10010243,R43HG010995,"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biotechnology', 'Capital', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Collection', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cost efficiency', 'Cystic Fibrosis', 'DNA', 'DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase', 'DNA biosynthesis', 'DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase', 'Data Set', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Enzymes', 'Equipment', 'Evolution', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'HIV', 'Heart Diseases', 'In Vitro', 'Industrialization', 'Industry', 'Length', 'Libraries', 'Licensing', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Molecular Machines', 'Mutation', 'Nucleotides', 'Oligonucleotides', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Polymerase', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Randomized', 'Reagent', 'Reporting', 'Research Project Grants', 'Scanning', 'Single-Stranded DNA', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'TimeLine', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'combinatorial', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'genetic technology', 'high throughput screening', 'human disease', 'improved', 'in vitro testing', 'machine learning algorithm', 'model development', 'next generation', 'novel', 'phosphoramidite', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive test', 'research and development', 'synthetic biology', 'synthetic construct', 'tool']",NHGRI,"PRIMORDIAL GENETICS, INC",R43,2020,374524,-0.00890569298349927
"Development of a joint machine learning/de novo assembly system for resolving viral quasispecies PROJECT SUMMARY Viral hepatitis from hepatitis B (HBV) establishes chronic infections in >250M people worldwide; chronicity is on the rise, and approximately one-third of the world’s population (2 billion) has serologic evidence of exposure. HBV coinfection with HCV and HIV is a hidden consequence of the substance use disorder epidemic. Viral populations have extremely high sequence diversity and rapidly evolve, which explains the vaccine failure rates and viral resistance to existing therapies and makes discovering lasting therapies extremely challenging. Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) is the method of choice to assess the intra-host virus population, termed a “quasispecies”. While a large set of short DNA sequencing reads are acquired that represent the virions in the quasispecies, computational technologies are limited in their analysis capabilities, resulting in particularly low resolution of complex HBV genomic structures. Another challenge is assembling NGS reads representing short fragment of the host genome into full strains (haplotypes) without knowledge of their true occurrence in the samples. To meet these challenges, GATACA is developing pathogen-specific bioinformatics software, GAT-ML (GATACA Assembly Tool – machine learning [ML]) to support treatment discovery and improve infection control. Its specifically designed algorithm utilizes novel ML methodologies adapted and modified for assisting genome assembly that will allow GAT-ML to reconstruct complete viral haplotypes and populations by learning the ‘language’ of the sequences. Tailored initially for HBV samples, GAT and its new ML system will be integrated for feasibility testing in this Phase I with the following Specific Aims: 1. Specific Aim 1. Build a joint learning system. Train and test natural language processing (NLP) methods on HBV genetic variation. 2. Specific Aim 2. Implement and test the machine learning methods in GAT (GAT-ML). We anticipate a working tool for characterizing HBV haplotypes, validated with multi-sourced datasets, and extensive testing and benchmarking of offline and integrated methods. The proposed project will develop and increase the capabilities of our novel computational tool, GAT, to help researchers identify the full spectrum of genetic features of a viral population—such as emergence and persistence of resistance or baseline polymorphisms regardless of their frequencies—and translate these findings to the development of new or improved antiviral drugs and other applications requiring high analytic sensitivity.

"National Resource for Network Biology (NRNB) OVERALL - PROJECT SUMMARY The mission of the National Resource for Network Biology (NRNB) is to advance the science of biological networks by creating leading-edge bioinformatic methods, software tools and infrastructure, and by engaging the scientific community in a portfolio of collaboration and training opportunities. Much of biomedical research is dependent on knowledge of biological networks of multiple types and scales, including molecular interactions among genes, proteins, metabolites and drugs; cell communication systems; relationships among genotypes and biological and clinical phenotypes; and patient and social networks. NRNB-supported platforms like Cytoscape are among the most widely used software tools in biology, with tens of thousands of active users, enabling researchers to apply network concepts and data to understand biological systems and how they are reprogrammed in disease.  NRNB’s three Technology Research and Development projects introduce innovative concepts with the potential to transform network biology, transitioning it from a static to a dynamic science (TR&D 1); from flat network diagrams to multi-scale hierarchies of biological structure and function (TR&D 2); and from descriptive interaction maps to predictive and interpretable machine learning models (TR&D 3). In previous funding periods our technology projects have produced novel and highly cited approaches, including network-based biomarkers for stratification of disease, data-driven gene ontologies assembled completely from network data, and deep learning models of cell structure and function built using biological networks as a scaffold.  During the next period of support, we introduce dynamic regulatory networks formulated from single-cell transcriptomics and advanced proteomics data (TR&D 1); substantially improved methodology for the study of hierarchical structure and pleiotropy in biological networks (TR&D 2); and procedures for using networks to seed machine learning models of drug response that are both mechanistically interpretable and transferable across biomedical contexts (TR&D 3). These efforts are developed and applied in close collaboration with outside investigators from 19 Driving Biomedical Projects who specialize in experimental generation of network data, disease biology (cancer, neuropsychiatric disorders, diabetes), single-cell developmental biology, and clinical trials. TR&Ds are also bolstered by 7 Technology Partnerships in which NRNB scientists coordinate technology development with leading resource-development groups in gene function prediction, mathematics and algorithm development, and biomedical databases. Beyond these driving collaborations, we continually support a broader portfolio of transient (non-driving) research collaborations; organize and lead international meetings including the popular Network Biology track of the Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology conference; and deliver a rich set of training opportunities and network analysis protocols. OVERALL - PROJECT NARRATIVE We are all familiar with some of the components of biological systems – DNA, proteins, cells, organs, individuals – but understanding biological systems involves more than just cataloging its component parts. It is critical to understand the many interactions of these parts within systems, and how these systems give rise to biological functions and responses and determine states of health and disease.

"Evidence Extraction Systems for the Molecular Interaction Literature Burns, Gully A. Abstract  In primary research articles, scientists make claims based on evidence from experiments, and report both the claims and the supporting evidence in the results section of papers. However, biomedical databases de- scribe the claims made by scientists in detail, but rarely provide descriptions of any supporting evidence that a consulting scientist could use to understand why the claims are being made. Currently, the process of curating evidence into databases is manual, time-consuming and expensive; thus, evidence is recorded in papers but not generally captured in database systems. For example, the European Bioinformatics Institute's INTACT database describes how different molecules biochemically interact with each other in detail. They characterize the under- lying experiment providing the evidence of that interaction with only two hierarchical variables: a code denoting the method used to detect the molecular interaction and another code denoting the method used to detect each molecule. In fact, INTACT describes 94 different types of interaction detection method that could be used in conjunction with other experimental methodological processes that can be used in a variety of different ways to reveal different details about the interaction. This crucial information is not being captured in databases. Although experimental evidence is complex, it conforms to certain principles of experimental design: experimentally study- ing a phenomenon typically involves measuring well-chosen dependent variables whilst altering the values of equally well-chosen independent variables. Exploiting these principles has permitted us to devise a preliminary, robust, general-purpose representation for experimental evidence. In this project, We will use this representation to describe the methods and data pertaining to evidence underpinning the interpretive assertions about molecular interactions described by INTACT. A key contribution of our project is that we will develop methods to extract this evidence from scientiﬁc papers automatically (A) by using image processing on a speciﬁc subtype of ﬁgure that is common in molecular biology papers and (B) by using natural language processing to read information from the text used by scientists to describe their results. We will develop these tools for the INTACT repository but package them so that they may then also be used for evidence pertaining to other areas of research in biomedicine. Burns, Gully A. Narrative  Molecular biology databases contain crucial information for the study of human disease (especially cancer), but they omit details of scientiﬁc evidence. Our work will provide detailed accounts of experimental evidence supporting claims pertaining to the study of these diseases. This additional detail may provide scientists with more powerful ways of detecting anomalies and resolving contradictory ﬁndings.",Evidence Extraction Systems for the Molecular Interaction Literature,9983144,R01LM012592,"['Area', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Burn injury', 'Classification', 'Co-Immunoprecipitations', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Consult', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Database Management Systems', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'European', 'Event', 'Experimental Designs', 'Experimental Models', 'Gel', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Graph', 'Image', 'Informatics', 'Information Retrieval', 'Institutes', 'Intelligence', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Weight', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Paper', 'Pattern', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Privatization', 'Process', 'Protein Structure Initiative', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Reading', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Scientist', 'Source Code', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Taxonomy', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Typology', 'Western Blotting', 'Work', 'base', 'data modeling', 'experimental study', 'human disease', 'image processing', 'machine learning method', 'open source', 'optical character recognition', 'protein protein interaction', 'repository', 'software systems', 'structured data', 'text searching', 'tool']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2020,264232,-0.00904027807458019
"Image-guided robot for high-throughput microinjection of Drosophila embryos PROJECT SUMMARY This proposal is submitted in response to the NIH Development of Animal Models and Related Biological Materials for Research (R21) program. The proposal develops an image-guided robotic platform that performs the automated delivery of molecular genetic tools and non-genetically encoded reagents such as chemical libraries, fluorescent dyes to monitor cellular processes, functionalized magnetic beads, or nanoparticles into thousands of Drosophila embryos in a single experimental session. The proposed work builds on recent engineering innovations in our collaborative group which has developed image-guided robotic systems that can precisely interface with single cells in intact tissue. The two Specific Aims provide for a systematic development of the proposed technologies. AIM 1 first engineers a robotic platform (‘Autoinjector’) that can scan and image Drosophila embryos in arrays of egg laying plates. We will utilize machine learning algorithms for automated detection of embryos, followed by thresholding and morphology analysis to detect embryo centroids and annotate injection sites. In AIM 2, we will utilize microprocessor-controlled fluidic circuits for programmatic delivery of femtoliter to nanoliter volumes of reagents into individual embryos. We will quantify the efficacy of the Autoinjector by comparing the survival, fertility, and transformation rates of transposon or PhiC31-mediated transgenesis to manual microinjection datasets. Finally, we will demonstrate the efficient delivery of sgRNAs and mutagenesis in the presence of Cas9. This project fits very well within the goals of the program by engineering a novel tool for producing and improving animal models. The Autoinjector will accelerate Drosophila research and empower scientists to perform novel experiments and genome-scale functional genomics screens that are currently too inefficient or labor intensive to be conducted on a large scale and may additionally enable other novel future applications. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal develops a technology platform that will enable automated microinjection of molecular genetic tools and non-genetically encoded tools such as chemical libraries, fluorescent dyes, functionalized magnetic beads, or nanoparticles, into thousands of Drosophila embryos in a single experimental session.

"Integrated Instrument for non-natural aptamer generation Project Summary DNA and RNA aptamers are a useful class of synthetic affinity reagents. However, their performance can be greatly improved through the site-specific incorporation of chemically modified, ‘non-natural’ nucleotides that provide a greater chemical repertoire to enable superior aptamer affinity and specificity. Because a broad spectrum of chemical functional groups can be incorporated, non-natural aptamers offer the exciting potential for targeting molecules for which the generation of monoclonal antibodies remains difficult, such as small- molecule drugs, metabolites and carbohydrates. Unfortunately, the access to non-natural aptamers is severely limited. This is because the process of generating non-natural aptamers is technically challenging and limited to a few specialized laboratories. The goal of this project is to develop an integrated instrument, the Non-Natural Aptamer Array (N2A2) that eliminates these bottlenecks and enable rapid and facile non-natural aptamer discovery at virtually any research laboratory. The N2A2 will be built on a modified version of a benchtop commercial sequencer (Illumina MiSeq), and will perform every stage of non-natural aptamer discovery— including sequencing, screening and binding measurements—as part of a single work-flow. There are three main innovative aspects of our N2A2 system. First, our approach will entirely eliminate the need for polymerase engineering, and thus allows us to incorporate virtually any chemical functional group through click chemistry. Second, N2A2 will enable us to directly obtain the binding affinity (Kd) of ~10^7 aptamers directly in complex samples (e.g. cell lysate or serum), thereby resulting in aptamers with high-specificity. Finally, we will develop a machine-learning (ML) approach to identify key motifs (“k-mers”) and predict novel sequences with potentially higher affinity and specificity that can be tested using the N2A2 instrument. We believe this powerful combination of massively parallel, sequence-linked binding measurements with ML-based predictions will allow us to explore sequence space that is currently inaccessible to traditional in vitro selection methods, and enable us to discover aptamers with superior performance. The success of this project will produce an integrated instrument that greatly streamlines and accelerates the discovery of non-natural aptamers for a wide range of targets in complex media. The instrument is based on a commercially available sequencer and we will make all software available to the public. In this way, we believe the N2A2 instrument could broadly expand access to robust, high quality, custom affinity reagents for biomedical research and clinical diagnostics. Project Narrative We will develop an integrated instrument that simplifies the discovery of non-natural aptamer reagents for a wide range of molecules that are difficult to target using conventional antibody reagents. The access to these custom reagents will accelerate biomedical research and clinical diagnostics.",Integrated Instrument for non-natural aptamer generation,9872178,R01GM129313,"['Affinity', 'Algorithms', 'Antibodies', 'Binding', 'Biomedical Research', 'Carbohydrates', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Chinese Hamster Ovary Cell', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Directed Molecular Evolution', 'Engineering', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'In Vitro', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Research', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monoclonal Antibodies', 'Nucleotides', 'Opioid', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Polymerase', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Reagent', 'Reproducibility', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'System', 'Testing', 'Tyrosine', 'Work', 'aptamer', 'base', 'clinical diagnostics', 'data analysis pipeline', 'functional group', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'machine learning algorithm', 'novel', 'programmed cell death protein 1', 'scaffold', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'success', 'virtual']",NIGMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,314000,-0.011383586305577939
"Graphical Processing Units and a Large-Memory Compute Node for Applications in Genomics, Neuroscience, and Structural Biology Project Summary  Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL) is a private, not-for-profit institution dedicated to research and education in biology, with leading research programs in genomics, neuroscience, quantitative biology, plant biology, and cancer. Many activities at CSHL depend critically on high-performance computing resources, but at present, investigators have limited access to Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) and large-memory compute nodes. This deficiency is beginning to hamper a wide variety of biomedical research activities, particularly in the key areas of genomics, neuroscience and structural biology, where such specialty hardware is becoming essential for many important computational analyses. Here, we propose to acquire four state-of-the-art GPU nodes, each equipped with eight Nvidia Tesla V100, SXM2, 32GB GPUs, two 20-core 2.5 GHz Intel Xeon-Gold 6248 (Cascade Lake) processors, and 768 GB of RAM. A second-generation Nvidia NVLink will provide for 300 GB/s inter-GPU communication. In addition, we propose to acquire one large-memory node with 3 TB of RAM and four 20-core 2.5 GHz Intel Xeon-Gold 6248 (Cascade Lake) processors, as well as a top-of-rack 10 Gb Ethernet switch to interconnect the servers with each other and with our existing computer cluster. These new resources will enable a wide variety of innovative research across fields, with direct implications for human health. In genomics, applications will include RNA-seq read mapping; alignment, base-calling, and genome assembly for long-read sequence data; clustering of single cell RNA-seq data; analysis of transposable elements; deep-learning methods for prediction of the fitness consequences of mutations; and deep-learning methods for interpreting high-throughput mutagenesis experiments. In neuroscience, they will include analysis of multi-neuron activity recordings; analysis of mouse brain images; and artificial neural network models of the human olfactory system, of audio features, and of behavior as a function of changing motivations. In structural biology, they will include image processing and 3D reconstruction from cryo-electron microscopy data. These new compute nodes will have a primary impact on the research programs of nine major users from the CSHL faculty with substantial NIH funding. They will also impact three minor users. The new GPU and large-memory nodes will be fully integrated with a soon-to-be-upgraded high-performance computer cluster and managed by the experienced Information Technology group at CSHL, with oversight from a committee of seven faculty members and two IT staff members. Altogether, these new computational resources will substantially enhance the overall computational infrastructure at CSHL. Project Narrative  Many areas of modern biomedical research depend critically on state-of-the-art computing resources. Here we propose to acquire two types of specialty computer hardware: four Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) nodes and a large-memory compute node, both of which will be fully integrated with an existing and soon-to-be-upgraded high-performance computer cluster. These resources will meet a wide variety of computing needs across research areas at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, particularly in the growing areas of genomics, neuroscience, and structural biology.","Graphical Processing Units and a Large-Memory Compute Node for Applications in Genomics, Neuroscience, and Structural Biology",9939826,S10OD028632,"['3-Dimensional', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Brain imaging', 'Communication', 'Computer Analysis', 'Cryoelectron Microscopy', 'DNA Transposable Elements', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Education', 'Faculty', 'Funding', 'Generations', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Gold', 'Health', 'High Performance Computing', 'Human', 'Information Technology', 'Institution', 'Laboratories', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Memory', 'Minor', 'Motivation', 'Mus', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutation', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Olfactory Pathways', 'Plants', 'Privatization', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'computer cluster', 'computer infrastructure', 'computing resources', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'fitness', 'high end computer', 'image processing', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'medical specialties', 'member', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'structural biology', 'transcriptome sequencing']",OD,COLD SPRING HARBOR LABORATORY,S10,2020,436882,-0.0029965771804461765
"Determination of structure, dynamics and energetics of enzyme reactions Project Summary  Understanding enzyme mechanisms is of paramount importance from both the basic biophysics perspective of understanding life processes and the role of enzymes in diseases. To achieve a detailed understanding of enzyme catalysis, the effects of protein structure and dynamics on the reaction energetics need to be elucidated. We propose a combined computational and experimental approach that combines the synthetic, computational and structural biology expertise of a team of investigators that has been working together for >15 years to create a “molecular movie” where the position, movement and energy of every atom in the system followed over the entire reaction pathway. The proposal exploits the emerging convergence of timescales accessible by molecular simulation using GPUs and time resolved structural biology. Specific Aim 1 describes the simulation of the complete reaction pathway of Pseudomonas mevalonii (Pm) HMGCoA Reductase (HMGR) and will use transition state force fields (TSFFs) generated by the quantum guided molecular mechanics method to allow the µsec MD simulations of the chemical steps. TSFFs not only circumvent the well-known boundary problem of QM/MM, but are also 102-104 times faster. This allows a realistic modeling of the coupling of µsec dynamics and catalysis that was demonstrated in the last grant period to be essential for understanding the reaction. Together with accelerated MD simulations of the conformational changes involved in the reaction using standard force fields, these computational studies cover the fsec to µsec timescale. In Specific Aim 2, the computational results will be merged with the results of a three-tiered approach to obtain structural snapshots with progressively increasing time resolution: (i) “Frozen” intermediates that map out the overall pathway on long timescales, (ii) time resolved Laue crystallography using pH jump initiation on the msec timescale and (iii) use of photocaged substrates to allow time resolved Laue experiments on the µsec timescale. This approach will be applied to the study of HMGR, an enzyme of high biophysical and biomedical significance that has a complex reaction mechanism involving three chemical steps, six large-scale conformational changes and two cofactor exchange steps. The project is highly innovative because it (i) uses a combination of MD simulations using TSFFs and time resolved crystallography to span timescales of at least 12 orders of magnitude, (ii) iteratively couples the Markov State analysis of long timescale trajectories to the Singular Value Decomposition used to analyze time resolved crystallography data, thus providing new tools to generate and experimentally validate trial structures (iii) applies global optimization and machine learning techniques to allow the automated fitting of TSFFs for proteins, which will enhance the application of this powerful method to other proteins and (iv) provides new photocaged substrates for the study of enzyme mechanisms to the chemical biology community. All tool compounds, methods and codes developed in this project will be made available to the scientific community. Public Health Statement  The detailed study of enzyme mechanisms is a cornerstone of biophysical chemistry that, while basic in nature, has had a major impact on human health including the development of new mechanism-based drugs for a range of diseases and an understanding of the mechanism of action for existing drugs that allows the design of combination therapies. The combination of Laue crystallography and long-scale MD simulations will allow simultaneous studies of structure, dynamics and energetic studies with unprecedented detail. The application to HMG CoA Reductase, arguably the single most important drug target in western industrialized countries, will demonstrate the applicability of the methodology to an enzyme of high mechanistic complexity. 1","Determination of structure, dynamics and energetics of enzyme reactions",9897100,R01GM111645,"['Active Sites', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biophysics', 'Catalysis', 'Chemicals', 'Cholesterol', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Couples', 'Coupling', 'Crystallization', 'Crystallography', 'Data', 'Developed Countries', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Targeting', 'Enzymatic Biochemistry', 'Enzymes', 'Equilibrium', 'Free Energy', 'Freezing', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Human', 'Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Movement', 'Mutagenesis', 'Nature', 'Oxidoreductase', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Protein Dynamics', 'Proteins', 'Pseudomonas', 'Public Health', 'Reaction', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Role', 'Running', 'Science', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'biophysical chemistry', 'cofactor', 'computer studies', 'design', 'electron density', 'enzyme mechanism', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'millisecond', 'molecular dynamics', 'molecular mechanics', 'molecular scale', 'movie', 'new therapeutic target', 'particle', 'protein structure', 'quantum', 'simulation', 'structural biology', 'synthetic biology', 'theories', 'tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME,R01,2020,335664,-0.02908661083137899
"Reactome: An Open Knowledgebase of Human Pathways Project Summary  We seek renewal of the core operating funding for the Reactome Knowledgebase of Human Biological Pathways and Processes. Reactome is a curated, open access biomolecular pathway database that can be freely used and redistributed by all members of the biological research community. It is used by clinicians, geneti- cists, genomics researchers, and molecular biologists to interpret the results of high-throughput experimental studies, by bioinformaticians seeking to develop novel algorithms for mining knowledge from genomic studies, and by systems biologists building predictive models of normal and disease variant pathways.  Our curators, PhD-level scientists with backgrounds in cell and molecular biology work closely with in- dependent investigators within the community to assemble machine-readable descriptions of human biological pathways. Each pathway is extensively checked and peer-reviewed prior to publication to ensure its assertions are backed up by the primary literature, and that human molecular events inferred from orthologous ones in animal models have an auditable inference chain. Curated Reactome pathways currently cover 8930 protein- coding genes (44% of the translated portion of the genome) and ~150 RNA genes. We also offer a network of reliable ‘functional interactions’ (FIs) predicted by a conservative machine-learning approach, which covers an additional 3300 genes, for a combined coverage of roughly 60% of the known genome.  Over the next five years, we will: (1) curate new macromolecular entities, clinically significant protein sequence variants and isoforms, and drug-like molecules, and the complexes these entities form, into new reac- tions; (2) supplement normal pathways with alternative pathways targeted to significant diseases and devel- opmental biology; (3) expand and automate our tools for curation, management and community annotation; (4) integrate pathway modeling technologies using probabilistic graphical models and Boolean networks for pathway and network perturbation studies; (5) develop additional compelling software interfaces directed at both computational and lab biologist users; and (6) and improve outreach to bioinformaticians, molecular bi- ologists and clinical researchers. Project Narrative  Reactome represents one of a very small number of open access curated biological pathway databases. Its authoritative and detailed content has directly and indirectly supported basic and translational research studies with over-representation analysis and network-building tools to discover patterns in high-throughput data.

"Advanced computational methods in analyzing high-throughput sequencing data Sequencing technologies have become an essential tool to the study of human evolution, to the understanding of the genetic bases of diseases and to the clinical detection and treatment of genetic disorders. Computational algorithms are indispensible to the analysis of large-scale sequencing data and have received broad attention. However, developed several years ago, many mainstream software packages for sequence alignment, assembly and variant calling have gradually lagged behind the rapid development of sequencing technologies. They are unable to process the latest long reads or assembled contigs, and will be outpaced by upcoming technologies in terms of throughput. The development of advanced algorithms is critical to the applications of sequencing technologies in the near future. This project will address this pressing need with four proposals: (1) developing a fast and accurate aligner that accelerates short-read alignment and can map megabase-long assemblies against large sequence collections of over 100 gigabases in size; (2) developing an integrated caller for small sequence variations that is faster to run, more sensitive to moderately longer insertions and more accessible to biologists without extended expertise in bioinformatics; (3) developing a generic variant filtering tool that uses a novel deep learning model to achieve human-level accuracy on identifying false positive calls; (4) developing a new de novo assembler that works with the latest nanopore reads of ~100 kilobases in length and may achieve good contiguity at low coverage. Upon completion, the proposed studies will dramatically reduce the computational cost of data processing in most research labs and commercial entities, and will enable the applications of long reads in genome assembly, in the study of structural variations and in cancer researches. Computational algorithms are essential to the analysis of high-throughput sequencing data produced for the detection, prevention and treatment of cancers and genetic disorders.

"Direct Determination of Multiple Specific Forms of DNA Chemical Modifications in Human Genome PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The information content of DNA is not limited to the primary sequence (A, C, G, T), but is also conveyed by chemical modifications of individual bases. For example, DNA methylation, specifically 5-methylcytosine (5mC), has been widely studied for its important regulatory roles in human development and diseases. In addition, the discovery of active demethylation of 5mC, mediated by TET enzymes, into 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), 5-formylcytosine (5fC) and 5-carboxylcytosine (5caC) revealed great insights into the dynamic nature of the human methylome and its close relevance to multiple human diseases. Beyond these chemical modifications to cytosine, recent studies by us and others discovered that N6-methyladenine (6mA), another form of methylation previously thought exclusively existing in bacteria and protozoa, also exists in eukaryotic genomes including the human genome. In addition to these epigenetic marks, different forms of DNA damages represent another category of DNA chemical modifications that are of important biological relevance. Although a few methods for mapping individual chemical modifications have been developed and some are widely used, it is usually hard for broad researchers to master every protocol to map each form of modification. While third- generation sequencing technologies support the direct detection of DNA modifications, they face fundamental challenges distinguishing among different forms of modifications. The objective of this project is to develop a novel technology for the direct mapping of multiple forms of DNA methylation and DNA damage events simultaneously. The core idea is that each form of nucleic acid modification has a unique signature in terms of their physical interaction with DNA polymerase, or nanopores in third-generation sequencing; and these signatures can be modeled by deep learning methods. We will develop this technology using multiple innovative strategies to address a few fundamental challenges, and then comprehensively evaluate the technology to facilitate broad applications. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Chemical DNA modifications are crucial components of human genome that controls many important biological processes in human development and human diseases. In this project, we will develop a novel technology for direct mapping of multiple and specific forms of DNA modifications, which will enable us and a large number of researchers to more effectively study the functions of DNA modifications in human genome. !",Direct Determination of Multiple Specific Forms of DNA Chemical Modifications in Human Genome,10267380,R56HG011095,"['Address', 'Antibodies', 'Bacteria', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Classification', 'Complex', 'Cytosine', 'DNA', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Modification Process', 'DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Ensure', 'Enzymes', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Event', 'Face', 'Future', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Human Characteristics', 'Human Development', 'Human Genome', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Individual', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Neurons', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Oligonucleotides', 'Ploidies', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Protocols documentation', 'Protozoa', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Technology', 'Third Generation Sequencing', 'Thymine', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'base', 'bisulfite sequencing', 'cancer risk', 'cell type', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'demethylation', 'human disease', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'methylome', 'nanopore', 'network models', 'new technology', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'sequencing platform', 'single molecule real time sequencing']",NHGRI,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R56,2020,233456,-0.029913685045235585
"Integrative approach to studying LncRNA functions ABSTRACT  Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play regulatory roles in biological cell process and disease development. It has been emerging as a key regulator of diverse cellular processes. Great efforts have been made towards investigation of lncRNA functions with both experimental determination and theoretical modeling, leading to a rudimentary understanding of this class of RNAs. However, all of these cannot keep pace with the fast growth of diverse genetic data and urgent request of individual lncRNA function annotation, which is inhibited by the tremendous amount of lncRNAs and expensive experimental cost. This propose aim to address this issue by providing efficient and user-friendly tools for key lncRNA discovery and lncRNA function annotation. To do so, we will develop a unique bioinformatics and Systems Biology integrated approach, ISSNLncFA system, which enables the integration of all sorts of omics data and a comprehensive understanding of lncRNA functions.  We propose three specific aims for the ultimate lncRNA function annotation: (1) To develop a novel Co- Modules-based LncRNA Function Annotation (CoMoLncFA) model to detect key lncRNAs and to annotate lncRNA functions at post transcription level as lncRNA-PCG co-modules, lncRNA-pathways association network and lncRNA’s triplets (lncRNA-miRNA/TF-PCG) by considering the expression profiles of lncRNA, protein coding genes and miRNAs and transcript factors, and integrating the curated protein-protein interactions and biological pathways. (2) To develop a novel Structure-based LncRNA-protein Function Annotation (STRULncFA) model to characterize lncRNAs identified from Aim 1 by using their primary sequences and secondary structures for detecting lncRNA-protein functional relations; and to further reveal the regulatory roles and mechanism of these lncRNAs by determining the binding sites in both lncRNA and protein. (3) To experimentally validate the identified abnormal lncRNAs and their cellular products, to validate the identified lncRNA-protein interacting pairs and the predicted binding sites, and to develop software tools and an environment for functional annotation of lncRNAs, use these tools to evaluate the overall proposed approach, and apply them to identify lncRNA functions that may be involved in cell states, species, diseases and cancers and build lncRNA function databases.  We believe that we will build the models, tools and databases, and make them available to the public in a timely fashion. Our achievements will lead to a complete understanding of lncRNA functions and regulatory roles in cell and disease states. Moreover, our models and tools will be feasibly transformed to other function annotation tasks and disease studies with appropriate changes, and thus will move forward the general function annotation community and disease-related drug or therapy development. Project Narrative The ISSNLncFA software package will allow the investigators to characterize the LncRNA functions by integrating RNA-Seq, micorRNA-Seq, and together with protein and RNA structure data with systems biology approaches. As a prototype to test our system, we aim to use this system to study myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs). Although MDS is used as the prototype of disease for this proposal, the system developed will be applicable to multiple diseases with complex phenotypes.",Integrative approach to studying LncRNA functions,9983714,R01GM123037,"['3-Dimensional', 'Achievement', 'Address', 'Architecture', 'Binding Sites', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Breast', 'CD34 gene', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Chronic Disease', 'Code', 'Colorectal', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dysmyelopoietic Syndromes', 'Embryonic Development', 'Environment', 'Enzymes', 'Evaluation', 'Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomic Imprinting', 'Growth', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hematopoietic stem cells', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Liver', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Network-based', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'Transcript', 'Triplet Multiple Birth', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Work', 'X Chromosome', 'base', 'chromatin modification', 'chromatin remodeling', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'gene function', 'genomic data', 'high throughput technology', 'learning network', 'next generation', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'protein function', 'protein protein interaction', 'prototype', 'scaffold', 'software development', 'structured data', 'support vector machine', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'tool development', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'user-friendly']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R01,2020,302225,-0.043056249447254474
"High-Throughput De Novo Glycan Sequencing Glycosylation fulfills important physiological functions, including protein folding, embryogenesis, cell adhesion, pathogen recognition, and immune response. The multifaceted roles glycosylation plays derive from the presence of a range of glycan epitopes, where a small structural variation can have a profound impact on functions. Further, a glycome consists of many closely related structures, with their relative amounts determined by metabolic conditions in a cell- and growth-specific manner. Altered glycosylation is linked to many diseases, including cardiovascular, pulmonary, neurological and autoimmune disorders, and cancer. Thus, there is a clear need for analytical methods that can rapidly identify and quantify the many glycoforms in a glycome from different health and disease states. Finally, no genome-predicted glycan database exists due to the unscripted nature of glycan biosynthesis, and discovery of new glycan structures must be achieved by de novo methods. Although tandem mass spectrometry-based biopolymer sequencing has been the major catalyst to the recent rapid advance of 'omics, the prevailing collisionally activated dissociation method often fails to provide sufficient glycan structural detail at the MS2 level, whereas the MSn approach lacks the speed, sensitivity, and quantitative potential for high-throughput glycome analysis. We have recently developed an electronic excitation dissociation (EED) method that can yield rich structural information in a single stage of MS/MS analysis. However, the impact of EED on glycomics research is currently limited by its poor accessibility, insufficient coupling to on-line glycan separation methods, and difficulty in interpretation of complex glycan EED tandem mass spectra. Here, we propose to develop an integrated approach that combines EED with on-line liquid chromatography (LC) separation and a novel bioinformatics tool to achieve high-throughput, de novo, and comprehensive glycome characterization. We will explore the potential of EED for analysis of glycans in various derivatized forms, study their fragmentation behaviors, and establish fragmentation rules for the development of bioinformatics software. We will optimize conditions for efficient coupling of EED to reversed-phase, and porous graphitic carbon LC, and develop an LC-EED-MS/MS approach for simultaneous characterization and quantitation of glycan mixtures. We will implement EED on a Q-TOF instrument to improve its access to the glycoscience community. Finally, we will develop and rigorously test the performance of a novel bioinformatics software that can rapidly and accurately determine each glycan's structure from its tandem MS spectra. The proposed algorithm is fundamentally different from most existing software, in that it no longer relies solely on glycosidic and cross-ring fragments for topology and linkage analysis, but rather adopts a machine learning approach that considers the contexts of various types of fragment peaks, and the spectral features associated with different linkage configurations and structural motifs. The availability of such a high-throughput, de novo glycan sequencing tool will have an immense impact on many biomedical research fields, as glycosylation plays critical roles in almost all biological pathways.

"A knowledge graph framework for automated gating analysis of cytometry data Project Summary / Abstract Flow and mass cytometry provide multiparametric single-cell data critical for understanding the cellular heterogeneity in various biological systems. Modern polychromatic flow cytometers simultaneously measure about 16 parameters routinely. The next-generation mass cytometry (CyTOF) technology allows for the simultaneous measurement of 50 or more parameters. Even as the cytometry technology is rapidly advancing, approaches for analyzing such complex data remain inadequate. The widely-used manual gating analysis is knowledge-driven and easy-to- interpret, but it is subjective, labor-intensive, and not scalable to handle the increasing complexity of the data. Recent developments of automated data-driven algorithms are able to address the issues of manual gating, but the results from data-driven algorithms are often not intuitive for biology experts to interpret. These limitations create a critical bottleneck for flow and mass cytometry analysis. The overall objective of this application is to develop a novel framework that combines both knowledge-driven and data-driven approaches to achieve automated gating analysis of flow cytometry and CyTOF data. The specific aims are: (1) build knowledge graphs to capture existing knowledge of manual gating analysis, (2) develop algorithms for automated gating analysis, and (3) validate the knowledge graph framework using large-scale studies in ImmPort. The proposed research is significant because it will enable efficient and reproducible gating analysis and provide visualizations that are easy-to-interpret, both of which are critically important to the research community. Such contributions will fundamentally impact single-cell analysis of cellular heterogeneity in diverse fields including immunology, infectious diseases, cancer, AIDS, among others. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because it is expected to develop novel computational methods for automated analysis and interpretation of single-cell analysis by flow and mass cytometry.

"Multi-Resolution Docking Methods for Electron Microscopy Summary In the past decade, we have witnessed a revolutionary progress in camera technology and the attainable resolution of macromolecular assemblies via cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and in the development of computational algorithms that relate the resulting 3D maps to atomic resolution structures. Whereas single- particle cryo-EM today is capable of directly solving atomic structures of biomolecular assemblies in isolation, electron tomography (ET) in unstained frozen-hydrated samples is widely used to capture the 3D organization of supramolecular complexes in their native (organelle, cell, or tissue) environments. We have identified three inter-related research areas where our computational modeling experience (historically rooted in pre-revolution multi-scale approaches) offers the biggest value to today's post-revolution EM community: (1) medium resolution cryo-EM modeling, (2) the segmentation and denoising of cryo-ET data, and (3) the validation of atomic models and their corresponding maps. The first aim is an extension of promising new ideas in flexible fitting as well as secondary structure prediction for medium resolution maps, which have been our key research areas in the past. medium resolution (5-10Å) maps are still widely used in EM and can be of significant biological importance. This is particularly true in the case of cryo-ET maps, which are harder to read than single particle cryo-EM maps because they often exhibit considerable noise, anisotropic resolution, and anisotropic density variations due to the low dose requirements and the missing wedge in the Fourier space. In the case of tightly packed or crowded macromolecular structures, the fusion of nearby biomolecular densities prevents an automated segmentation of geometric shapes, requiring a labor-intensive manual tracing by human experts. We are currently developing novel computational approaches to provide a more objective strategy for missing wedge correction in homogeneous specimen areas of tomograms. Our hybrid approach combines deconvolution and denoising with template matching in a unified mathematical framework that allows modeling constraints to be imposed in a least-squares optimization process. Our approach can also be extended to the flexible refinement of atomic structures using our damped dynamics flexible fitting approach by tuning the internal point-spread functions to the missing wedge of the ET data. To support these aims, we will quantitatively measure the fitness of an atomic model in local density regions and characterize the fitness of maps with reliable reference structures. The collaborative efforts supported by this grant will include the refinement of cytoskeletal filaments, molecular motors, bacterial chemoreceptor arrays, and hair cell stereocilia. The algorithmic and methodological developments will be distributed freely through the established Internet-based mechanisms used by the Situs and Sculptor packages and as plugins for the popular UCSF Chimera graphics program. Project Narrative This project will help biological electron microscopists bridge a broad range of resolution levels, from the atomic to the living organism. Macromolecular assemblies are the basic functional units of biological cells; they furnish targets for drug design because deficiencies in macromolecular assembly architecture are frequently linked to health problems.

"Tools for rapid and accurate structure elucidation of natural products Mapping the Secondary Metabolomes of Marine Cyanobacteria Bacteria are extraordinarily prolific sources of structurally unique and biologically active natural products that derive from a diversity of fascinating biochemical pathways. However, the complete structure elucidation of natural products is often the most time consuming and costly endeavor in natural product drug discovery programs. Compounding this, advancements in genome sequencing have accelerated the identification of unique modular biosynthetic gene clusters in prokaryotes and revealed a wealth of new compounds yet to be isolated and biologically and chemically characterized. Resultantly, there is an urgent and continuing need in this field to connect biosynthetic gene clusters to their respective MS fragmentation signatures in the MS2 molecular networks. The capacity to make such connections will accelerate new compound discovery as well as create associations between gene cluster and biosynthetic pathway, and aid in fast and accurate structure elucidations. Combined with this informatics approach, this proposed continuation project explores innovative methods by which to solve complex molecular structures by enhanced MS and NMR experiments, as well as the development of new algorithms by which to accelerate their analysis. Thus, the overarching goal of this grant is to develop efficient methods that facilitate automated structural classification, structural feature discovery and ultimately efficient structure elucidation of natural products (or any small molecule) and to build an infrastructure that interacts with data input from the community. We will achieve this with the following four specific aims: Aim 1. Integration of MS2 molecular networking with gene cluster networking to rapidly and efficiently locate natural products that have unique molecular architectures; Aim 2. To develop a suite of high sensitivity pulse sequences for natural product structure elucidation; Aim 3. To develop NMR based molecular networking strategies using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) to facilitate the categorization and structure elucidation of organic compounds; Aim 4. To integrate NMR molecular networking and MS2-based molecular networking as an efficient structure characterization and elucidation strategy. By achieving these aims we will develop an innovative workflow for finding new compounds and for determining their structures, both quickly and accurately. The connection between gene cluster and molecule will shed light on stereochemistry and potential halogenations and methylations. This information can then be used in combination with more efficient NMR and MS methods to accurately determine structures. These tools will be widely shared, such as through the Global Natural Products Social (GNPS) Molecular Network, to enhance the overall capacity of the natural products and organic chemistry communities to solve complex molecular structures.   Natural products are compounds produced by natural sources and about 50 % of FDA approved drugs can trace their origin back to natural products. This proposal aims to use our data set of natural products produced by cyanobacteria for development of analytical tools that will speed- up and stream-line the discovery and structure elucidation of new compounds.  ",Tools for rapid and accurate structure elucidation of natural products,9921415,R01GM107550,"['Algae', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Back', 'Bacteria', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biological', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Consumption', 'Cyanobacterium', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'FDA approved', 'Family', 'Gene Cluster', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Informatics', 'Infrastructure', 'Light', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Structure', 'Natural Product Drug', 'Natural Products', 'Organic Chemistry', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Progress Reports', 'Prokaryotic Cells', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'analog', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'drug discovery', 'experimental study', 'fascinate', 'genome sequencing', 'halogenation', 'innovation', 'metabolome', 'novel', 'programs', 'prototype', 'scaffold', 'small molecule', 'social', 'stereochemistry', 'tool']",NIGMS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2020,514429,-0.009415444408581919
"A Modeling Framework for Multi-View Data, with Applications to the Pioneer 100 Study and Protein Interaction Networks New advances in biomedical research have made it possible to collect multiple data “views” — for example, genetic, metabolomic, and clinical data — for a single patient. Such multi-view data promises to offer deeper insights into a patient's health and disease than would be possible if just one data view were available. However, in order to achieve this promise, new statistical methods are needed.  This proposal involves developing statistical methods for the analysis of multi-view data. These methods can be used to answer the following fundamental question: do the data views contain redundant information about the observations, or does each data view contain a different set of information? The answer to this question will provide insight into the data views, as well as insight into the observations. If two data views contain redundant information about the observations, then those two data views are related to each other. Furthermore, if each data view tells the same “story” about the observations, then we can be quite conﬁdent that the story is true.  The investigators will develop a uniﬁed framework for modeling multi-view data, which will then be applied in a number of settings. In Aim 1, this framework will be applied to multi-view multivariate data (e.g. a single set of patients, with both clinical and genetic measurements), in order to determine whether a single clustering can adequately describe the patients across all data views, or whether the patients cluster separately in each data view. In Aim 2, the framework will be applied to multi-view network data (e.g. a single set of proteins, with both binary and co-complex interactions measured), in order to determine whether the nodes belong to a single set of communities across the data views, or a separate set of communities in each data view. In Aim 3, the framework will be applied to multi-view multivariate data in order to determine whether the observations can be embedded in a single latent space across all data views, or whether they belong to a separate latent space in each data view. In Aims 1–3, the methods developed will be applied to the Pioneer 100 study, and to the protein interactome. In Aim 4(a), the availability of multiple data views will be used in order to develop a method for tuning parameter selection in unsupervised learning. In Aim 4(b), protein communities that were identiﬁed in Aim 2 will be validated experimentally. High-quality open source software will be developed in Aim 5.  The methods developed in this proposal will be used to determine whether the ﬁndings from multiple data views are the same or different. The application of these methods to multi-view data sets, including the Pioneer 100 study and the protein interactome, will improve our understanding of human health and disease, as well as fundamental biology. Biomedical researchers often collect multiple “types” of data (e.g. clinical data and genetic data) for a single patient, in order to get a fuller picture of that patient's health or disease status than would be possible using any single data type. This proposal involves developing new statistical methods that can be used in order to analyze data sets that consist of multiple data types. Applying these methods will lead to new insights and better understanding of human health and disease.","A Modeling Framework for Multi-View Data, with Applications to the Pioneer 100 Study and Protein Interaction Networks",9962426,R01GM123993,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Clinical Data', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Data Pooling', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Genetics', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Records', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Set protein', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trust', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'insight', 'metabolomics', 'multiple data types', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'unsupervised learning']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2020,323659,-0.020911356338919752
"Multiscale Modeling of Enzymatic Reactions and Firefly Bioluminescence Abstract Enzyme functionality is a critical component of all life systems. Whereas advances in experimental methodology have enabled a better understanding of factors that control enzyme function, critical components of the reaction space such as highly unstable intermediates and transition states are best accessed for evaluation through computational simulations. Similarly, computational methodology continues to provide a key resource for probing excited-state processes such as bioluminescence. Combined ab initio quantum mechanical molecular mechanical (ai-QM/MM) simulations are, in principle, the preferred choice in the modeling of both processes. But ai-QM/MM modeling of enzymatic reactions is now severely limited by its computational cost, where a direct ai-QM/MM free energy simulation of an enzymatic reaction can take 500,000 or more CPU hours. Meanwhile, ai-QM/MM modeling of firefly bioluminescence is also hindered by the computational accuracy, where it has yet to produce quantitatively correct predictions for the bioluminescence spectral shift with site-directed mutagenesis. The goal of this proposal is to accelerate ai-QM/MM simulations of enzymatic reaction free energy and to improve the quality of ai-QM/MM-simulated bioluminescence spectra, so that ai-QM/MM simulations can be routinely performed by experimental groups. This will be achieved via a) using a lower-level (semi-empirical QM/MM) Hamiltonian for sampling; b) an enhancement to the similarity between the two Hamiltonians by calibrating the low-level Hamiltonian using the reaction pathway force matching approach, in conjunction with several other methods. The expected outcomes of this collaborative effort include: a) advanced methodologies for accelerated reaction free energy simulations and accurate bioluminescence spectra predictions, which will be released through multiple software platforms; b) a fundamental understanding of reactions such as Kemp elimination and polymerase-eta catalyzed DNA replication; c) a deeper insight into the role of macromolecular environment in the modulation of enzyme catalytic activities or bioluminescence wavelengths, which can further enhance our capability of designing new enzymes and bioluminescence probes. Narrative This project aims to develop quantum-mechanics-based computational methods to more quickly model enzymatic reactions and more accurately model bioluminescence spectra. It will lead to reliable and efficient computational tools for use by the general scientific community. It will facilitate the probe of enzymatic reaction mechanisms and the computer-aided design of new bioluminescence probes.",Multiscale Modeling of Enzymatic Reactions and Firefly Bioluminescence,10021018,R01GM135392,"['Adopted', 'Biochemical Reaction', 'Bioluminescence', 'Calibration', 'Communities', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computer-Aided Design', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA biosynthesis', 'DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase', 'Electrostatics', 'Environment', 'Enzymes', 'Evaluation', 'Fireflies', 'Free Energy', 'Freedom', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Hour', 'Ions', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanics', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multienzyme Complexes', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Polymerase', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quantum Mechanics', 'Reaction', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Site-Directed Mutagenesis', 'System', 'Temperature', 'Thermodynamics', 'Time', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'design', 'experimental group', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'multi-scale modeling', 'mutant', 'quantum', 'simulation', 'theories']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF OKLAHOMA NORMAN,R01,2020,255238,-0.010297015345535109
"SUPPORT AND DEVELOPMENT OF EMAN FOR ELECTRON MICROSCOPY IMAGE PROCESSING EMAN is one of the most well-established and widely used scientific image processing suites targeting the rapidly growing CryoEM/CryoET community worldwide. In turn, the CryoEM and CryoET studies which it enables permit determination of the structures of interacting macromolecules both in-vitro and in-vivo, and are being used to better understand the biochemical processes taking place in cells, to better identify potential drug targets and develop novel diagnostics. With the higher resolutions now possible in this field, direct drug interaction structural studies are now possible, and being used to gain insight into the mode of action of drugs within the cell. Unlike many newer tools in the field, such as Relion, CisTEM and CryoSparc, which focus on specific refinement tasks, EMAN is a versatile, modular suite capable of performing a variety of image processing tasks with hundreds of algorithms supporting virtually all of the standard file formats and mathematical conventions used in the field, as well as other related imaging fields. It provides an ideal platform for prototyping fundamental new algorithm developments, while still able to achieve data-limited resolution in single particle reconstruction. While high resolution single particle refinement has become routine in recent years, thanks largely to the dramatic data quality improvements provided by new detector technology, there remain significant opportunities for improvements in mitigating model bias, efficient use of data, and analysis of complexes with compositional or conformational variability. Some of the most important problems from a biological perspective involve the sort of compositional and conformational variability which remain challenging problems. The field also remains susceptible to problems of initial model bias, which are exacerbated in systems exhibiting structural variability, and as a result many structures are still published with exaggerated resolution claims. The standard protocols used by many in the field typically involve discarding a very large fraction of the raw data (as much as 80-90% in some cases), often based on qualitative assessments, raising questions related to rigor and reproducibility of structural results. In this proposal, we will develop or adapt image processing techniques to help resolve these issues, based on developments or unrealized concepts from mathematics and computer science. CryoEM and CryoET are used to study the structures of interacting biomolecules in the cell at resolutions 100x better than the best possible light microscope. This methodology permits new insights into the biomolecules which underlie disease, can shed light on structural changes in diseased cells and provide direct information on how drugs interact with the molecules they target. This grant develops the software used to turn noisy 2-D electron microscope images into reliable 3-D structures of individual molecules extending to near-atomic resolution.",SUPPORT AND DEVELOPMENT OF EMAN FOR ELECTRON MICROSCOPY IMAGE PROCESSING,10021685,R01GM080139,"['3-Dimensional', 'Algorithms', 'Appearance', 'Biochemical Process', 'Biological', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Cryoelectron Microscopy', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Reporting', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Targeting', 'Electron Microscope', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Exhibits', 'Grant', 'Image', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Light', 'Light Microscope', 'Maps', 'Mathematics', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Nature', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'Reproducibility', 'Resolution', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Rotation', 'Scheme', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Work', 'algorithm development', 'artificial neural network', 'autoencoder', 'base', 'case-based', 'computer science', 'data quality', 'deep learning', 'denoising', 'detector', 'drug action', 'file format', 'image processing', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'macromolecule', 'mathematical sciences', 'microscopic imaging', 'neural network', 'novel diagnostics', 'particle', 'prototype', 'reconstruction', 'software development', 'symposium', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool', 'virtual']",NIGMS,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2020,344862,-0.010349712509449088
"Synthetic Biology: At the Crossroads of Genetic Engineering and Human Therapeutics Abstract Support is requested for a Keystone Symposia conference entitled Synthetic Biology: At the Crossroads of Genetic Engineering and Human Therapeutics, organized by Drs. Jose M. Lora and Timothy K. Lu. The conference will be held in Breckenridge, Colorado from March 29- April 1, 2019. Synthetic Biology tools and principles have matured tremendously over the last decade and have reached extraordinary levels of sophistication, both in eukaryotic and prokaryotic systems. Synthetic biology as a therapeutic modality is starting to enter multiple clinical studies and has the potential to have a significant impact on medicine across a wide range of diseases (e.g., metabolic, immune-mediated, cancer, and neurologic diseases). This Keystone Symposia conference will delve into the field of synthetic biology with a special emphasis on its applications to medicine. While there are conferences that capture synthetic biology in only a few talks mixed in among other various topics, there is a paucity of conferences focused on synthetic biology as drugs to treat disease. However, due to the rapid pace of fundamental scientific advances along with an expanding number of biotechnology companies and emerging clinical studies with synthetic biology at their core, this conference will be highly relevant for a wide audience of scientists both from academia and industry. In addition, other meetings in this field have a highly technology-driven focus on synthetic biology techniques with relatively little attention given to biological and medical context. Ultimately, this Keystone Symposia conference should inspire researchers from diverse backgrounds to discuss synthetic biology via many new angles. PROJECT NARRATIVE Over the past two decades, tremendous advances have been made in the use of biological parts to engineer systems that can effectively direct living cells for a vast variety of purposes (a.k.a. synthetic biology). Synthetic biology is being used to construct more effective therapies in diseases such as cancer, but there are remaining obstacles to the clinical translation of these therapies.

"Automated Molecular Identity Disambiguator (AutoMID) PROJECT SUMMARY Small molecules are one of the most important classes of therapeutics alleviating suffering and in many cases death for hundreds of millions of people worldwide. Small molecules also serve as invaluable tools to study biology, often with the goal to validate novel targets for the development of future therapeutic drugs. Reproducibility of experimental results and the interoperability and reusability of resulting datasets depend on accurate descriptions of associated research objects, and most critically on correct representations of small molecules that are tested in biological assays. For example, it is not possible to develop predictive models of protein target - small molecule interactions if their chemical structure representations are not correct. Many factors contribute to errors in reported chemical structures in small molecule screening and omics reference databases, scientific publications, and many other web-based resources and documents. Because of the complexity of representing small molecules chemical structure graphs and the lack of thorough curation, errors are frequently introduced by non-experts and error propagation across different digital research assets is a pervasive problem. To address this challenging problem via a scalable approach, we propose the Automated Molecular Identity Disambiguator (AutoMID). AutoMID will be usable in batch mode at scale via an API, for example to assist chemical structure standardization and registration by maintainers of digital research assets, and also via interactive (UI) mode for everyday researchers to quickly and easily validate or correct their small molecule representations. AutoMID will leverage extensive highly standardized linked databases of chemical structures and associated information including names, synonyms, biological activity and physical properties and their sources / provenance and leverage expert rules and AI to enable reliable disambiguation of chemical structure identities at scale. PROJECT NARRATIVE Small molecules are one of the most important types of drugs. They also serve as invaluable tools to study biology.

"Computational Methods for Next-Generation Comparative Genomics PROJECT SUMMARY Recent advances in regulatory genomics, especially 3D genome organization in cell nucleus, suggest that existing methods for cross-species comparisons are limited in their ability to fully understand the evolution of non-coding genome function. In particular, it is known that genomes are compartmentalized to distinct compartments in the nucleus such as nuclear lamina and nuclear speckles. Such nuclear compartmentalization is an essential feature of higher-order genome organization and is linked to various important genome functions such as DNA replication timing and transcription. Unfortunately, to date no study exists that directly compares nuclear compartmentalization between human and other mammals. In addition, there are no computational models available that consider the continuous nature of multiple features of nuclear compartmentalization and function, which is critical to integrate genome-wide functional genomic data and datasets that measure cytological distance to multiple compartments across species. In this project, we will develop novel algorithms and generate new datasets to directly address two key questions: (1) How to identify the evolutionary patterns of nuclear compartmentalization? (2) What types of sequence evolution may drive spatial localization changes across species? The proposed project represents the first endeavor in comparative genomics for nuclear compartmentalization. Our Specific Aims are: (1) Developing new probabilistic models for identifying evolutionary patterns of nuclear compartmentalization. (2) Identifying genome-wide evolutionary patterns of nuclear compartmentalization in primate species based on TSA-seq and Repli-seq. (3) Developing new algorithms to connect sequence features to nuclear compartmentalization through cross-species comparisons. Successful completion of these aims will result in novel computational tools and new datasets that will be highly valuable for the comparative genomics community. Integrating the new computational tools and unique datasets will provide invaluable insights into the relationship between sequence evolution and changes in nuclear genome organization in mammalian species. Therefore, the proposed research is expected to advance comparative genomics to a new frontier and provide new perspectives for studying human genome function PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because the outcome of the project is expected to enhance the analyses of nuclear genome organizations across primate species to better understand genome function and human biology. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to NIH’s mission that seeks to obtain fundamental knowledge that will help to improve human health.",Computational Methods for Next-Generation Comparative Genomics,9959498,R01HG007352,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Computer Models', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Crete', 'Cytology', 'DNA Insertion Elements', 'DNA Replication Timing', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Evolution', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Biology', 'Human Genome', 'Knowledge', 'Lamin Type B', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Nature', 'Nuclear', 'Nuclear Lamina', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Primates', 'Psyche structure', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Models', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Visualization', 'base', 'comparative genomics', 'computerized tools', 'frontier', 'functional genomics', 'genetic variant', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'genomic locus', 'improved', 'insight', 'mental function', 'next generation', 'novel', 'predictive modeling']",NHGRI,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,360268,-0.029205791851797665
"Discovery and validation of neuronal enhancers as development of psychiatric disorders supplement Project Summary/Abstract The mandate of the PsychENCODE Data Analysis Core (DAC) includes the development of novel integrative methodologies to construct a coherent interpretational framework for the data emerging from the consortium. The complexity of building such a framework lies in the diversity of experimental assays and their associated confounding factors, as well as in the inherent uncertainty regarding how the various target biological components function together. As a result, any analytical and computational methods would need to capture this high dimensionality of structure in the data. While classical, parallel computation advances at an incredible pace and continues to serve the needs of the research community, our experience with the ever- increasing complexity of neuropsychiatric datasets has motivated us to also look at other promising technological avenues. Accordingly, motivated by recent developments in the field of quantum computing (QC), we herein explore the use of QC algorithms as applied to two problems of relevance to the PsychENCODE DAC: (1) the prediction of brain-specific enhancers based on variants and functional genomic assays (Aim S1; related to Aim 1 of the parent grant); and (2) the calculation of the contributions of cell types to tissue-level gene expression and to the occurrence of psychiatric disorders like schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorder and bipolar disorder (Aim S2; related to Aim 1 of the parent grant). The nascency of QC hardware technologies and the complexity of simulating quantum algorithms on classical computing resources means that our exploration will be confined to smaller, judiciously chosen datasets.Nevertheless, the work in this supplement will serve to evaluate future prospects for the use of QC algorithms and hardware in genomic analyses. We also consider two different paradigms of QC, the quantum annealer and the quantum gate model, and weigh their efficiency relative to classical computing. Finally, we will incorporate the QC and classical predictions into PsychENCODE consortium's database and online portal for visualizing the relationships between different genetic and genomic elements, and evaluate corroborating evidence for the predictions (Aim S3; related to Aim 2 of the parent grant). Project Narrative The PsychENCODE consortium has conducted extensive functional genomic analyses of samples from individuals diagnosed with psychiatric disorders aim to discover the complex biological architecture that lead from genetic and epigenetic markers of disease to the observed phenotypes. To reveal this underlying structure, the consortium relies on the use of sophisticated computational methods, including machine learning techniques, implemented on cutting-edge massively parallel computing resources by the consrtium’s Data Analysis Core (DAC). However, the scale and complexity of the tasks place significant burdens on these resources, and suggest the need for exploring alternative computing hardware technologies. This supplement to the DAC parent grant evaluates the promise of the emerging field of quantum computing to speed up large-scale computations and more efficiently explore the model landscape, using a comparative analysis of classical and quantum computing algorithms applied to problems relevant to the PsychENCODE DAC: the annotation of brain-specific enhancers and the quantification of cell-type contributions to bulk tissue gene expression.",Discovery and validation of neuronal enhancers as development of psychiatric disorders supplement,10047746,U01MH116492,"['Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network', 'Elements', 'Enhancers', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurons', 'Output', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Tissues', 'Toy', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'cell type', 'comparative', 'computing resources', 'data framework', 'design', 'epigenetic marker', 'epigenomics', 'experience', 'functional genomics', 'high dimensionality', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'parallel computer', 'parent grant', 'prototype', 'quantum', 'quantum computing', 'simulation', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'web portal']",NIMH,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,U01,2020,195697,-0.015901995161473604
"Enhancing open data sharing for functional genomics experiments: Measures to quantify genomic information leakage and file formats for privacy preservation Project Summary/Abstract: With the surge of large genomics data, there is an immense increase in the breadth and depth of different omics datasets and an increasing importance in the topic of privacy of individuals in genomic data science. Detailed genetic and environmental characterization of diseases and conditions relies on the large-scale mining of functional genomics data; hence, there is great desire to share data as broadly as possible. However, there is a scarcity of privacy studies focused on such data. A key first step in reducing private information leakage is to measure the amount of information leakage in functional genomics data, particularly in different data file types. To this end, we propose to to derive information-theoretic measures for private information leakage in different data types from functional genomics data. We will also develop various file formats to reduce this leakage during sharing. We will approach the privacy analysis under three aims. First, we will develop statistical metrics that can be used to quantify the sensitive information leakage from raw reads. We will systematically analyze how linking attacks can be instantiated using various genotyping methods such as single nucleotide variant and structural variant calling from raw reads, signal profiles, Hi-C interaction matrices, and gene expression matrices. Second, we will study different algorithms to implement privacy-preserving transformations to the functional genomics data in various forms. Particularly, we will create privacy-preserving file formats for raw sequence alignment maps, signal track files, three-dimensional interaction matrices, and gene expression quantification matrices that contain information from multiple individuals. This will allow us to study the sources of sensitive information leakages other than raw reads, for example signal profiles, splicing and isoform transcription, and abnormal three-dimensional genomic interactions. Third, we will investigate the reads that can be mapped to the microbiome in the raw human functional genomics datasets. We will use inferred microbial information to characterize private information about individuals, and then combine the microbial information with the information from human mapped reads to increase the re-identification accuracy in the linking attacks described in the second aim. We will use the tools to quantify the sensitive information and privacy-preserving file formats in the available datasets from large sequencing projects, such as the ENCODE, The Cancer Genome Atlas, 1,000 Genomes, gEUVADIS, and Genotype-Tissue Expression projects. Project Narrative: Sharing large-scale functional genomics data is critical for scientific discovery, but comes with important privacy concerns related to the possible misuse of such data. This proposal will quantify and manage the rieslkasted to releasing functional genomics datasets, based on integrating inferred genotypes from the raw sequence files, signal tracks, and microbiome mapped sequences. Finally, we will develop file formats, statistical methodologies, and related software for anonymization of functional genomics data that enable open sharing.",Enhancing open data sharing for functional genomics experiments: Measures to quantify genomic information leakage and file formats for privacy preservation,9970939,R01HG010749,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Assessment tool', 'Biology', 'ChIP-seq', 'Code', 'Computer software', 'Consent', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Files', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Extravasation', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Genotype-Tissue Expression Project', 'Glean', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Laws', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical Research', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Motivation', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Privacy', 'Privatization', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Protocols documentation', 'Provider', 'Pythons', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'RNA Splicing', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sampling', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Signal Transduction', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Smoker', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Tissues', 'Variant', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'computerized data processing', 'data mining', 'data sharing', 'experimental study', 'file format', 'functional genomics', 'genome sequencing', 'genomic data', 'human tissue', 'interest', 'large datasets', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'open data', 'privacy preservation', 'social', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NHGRI,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,523409,-0.022145759890631743
"Reconstruction of heterogeneous and small macromolecules by cyro-EM PROJECT SUMMARY Single-particle electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) has recently joined X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy as a high-resolution structural method for biological macromolecules. In addition, cryo-EM produces images of individual molecules, and therefore has the potential to resolve conformational changes. The proposal aims to develop new algorithms and software for extending the application of cryo-EM to molecules that are either too small or too flexible to be mapped by existing computational tools for cryo-EM. This extension requires solving two of the most challenging computational problems posed by cryo-EM. First, mapping the structural variability of macromolecules is widely recognized as the main computational challenge in cryo-EM. Structural variations are of great significance to biologists, as they provide insight into the functioning of molecular machines. Existing computational tools are limited to a small number of distinct conformations, and therefore are incapable of tackling highly mobile biomolecules with multiple, continuous spectra of conformational changes. The first area of investigation in this project is the development of a computational framework to analyze continuous variability. The proposed approach is based on a new mathematical representation of continuously changing structures and its efficient estimation using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms. MCMC algorithms have found great success in many other scientific disciplines, yet they have been mostly overlooked for cryo-EM single particle analysis. Second, a major limiting factor for present cryo-EM studies is the molecule size. Images of small molecules (below ~50kDa) have too little signal to allow existing methods to provide valid 3-D reconstructions. It is commonly believed that cryo-EM cannot be used for molecules that are too small to be reliably detected and picked from micrographs. Challenging that widespread belief, the second area of investigation focuses on developing a groundbreaking approach for reconstructing small molecules directly from micrographs without particle picking. The new approach is based on autocorrelation analysis and completely bypasses particle picking and orientation assignment and requires just one pass over the data. The single-pass approach opens new possibilities for real-time processing during data acquisition. PROJECT NARRATIVE Determining structures of proteins and other large molecules is an essential step in the basic understanding of biological processes, and a first step in rational drug design. We propose to develop new, faster and more reliable computer algorithms to significantly increase the power of structure-determination using electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM). Importantly, our methods will broaden the application of cryo-EM to molecules that are either too small or too flexible to be mapped by existing techniques.",Reconstruction of heterogeneous and small macromolecules by cyro-EM,9943364,R01GM136780,"['3-Dimensional', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Belief', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Bypass', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Cryoelectron Microscopy', 'Crystallization', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Dimensions', 'Discipline', 'Drug Design', 'Fostering', 'G-Protein-Coupled Receptors', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human Genome', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Investigation', 'Ion Channel', 'Ion Pumps', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Markov Chains', 'Markov chain Monte Carlo methodology', 'Mathematics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Molecular Machines', 'Molecular Motors', 'Molecular Weight', 'Motion', 'NMR Spectroscopy', 'Names', 'Noise', 'Particle Size', 'Phase', 'Polymerase', 'Preparation', 'Proteins', 'Pythons', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Ribosomes', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spliceosomes', 'Structural Protein', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Update', 'Variant', 'Work', 'X-Ray Crystallography', 'base', 'computer framework', 'computerized data processing', 'computerized tools', 'data acquisition', 'expectation', 'flexibility', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'macromolecule', 'molecular mass', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'particle', 'programs', 'protein complex', 'protein structure', 'receptor', 'reconstruction', 'small molecule', 'statistics', 'success', 'theories', 'three dimensional structure']",NIGMS,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,328440,-0.00920086116756276
"Multiscale Analyses of 4D Nucleome Structure and Function by Comprehensive Multimodal Data Integration PROJECT SUMMARY The cell nucleus is a heterogeneous organelle that consists of nuclear bodies such as nuclear lamina, speckles, nucleoli and PML bodies. These structures continuously tether and tug chromatin at the small and large scales to synergistically orchestrate dynamic functions in distinct spatio-temporal compartments. A major obstacle to the production of navigable 4D reference maps and relating structure to function in the nucleus remains understanding how these different scales of organization influence each other. In particular, we have a poor understanding of the large-scale genome organization. Growing evidence suggests that such nuclear compartmentalization is causally connected with vital genome functions in human health and disease. However, the principles of this nuclear compartmentalization, its dynamics during changes in cell conditions, and its functional relevance are poorly understood. One lesson from Phase 1 4DN was the huge gap in throughput between imaging methods, that directly measure large-scale multi-landmark relationships, and genomic methods, that aim for whole genome high-resolution maps but are indirect measurements and provide limited information about large-scale compartments. For this 4DN UM1 Center application, we propose to meet these needs through the following Aims: (1) Generate multi-modal imaging and genomic datasets to reveal the structure, dynamics, and function of nuclear compartmentalization; (2) Develop and apply computational tools for data-driven genome structure modeling and integrative analysis of nuclear compartmentalization; (3) Develop an integrative analysis and visualization platform with navigable 4D reference maps of nuclear organization. The combined datasets and results of our proposed approaches will advance our understanding of nuclear compartmentalization, the interwoven connections among different nuclear components, and their functional significance. Our new integrative analysis tools and data-driven predictive models will produce more complete nuclear organization reference maps that integrate large-scale chromosome structure data from live and super-resolution microscopy with multi-modal genomic data including smaller scale chromatin interaction maps and predict functional relationships and dynamic responses. Our navigable reference maps will be publicly accessible through an analysis platform that provides interactive visualization of multiple data types, thus enabling investigators with diverse expertise to simultaneously explore their own data and related datasets/tools and promoting collaborations that will open new horizons into the role of the 4D nucleome in human health and disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because it will enhance our understanding of nuclear genome organization and functions that are increasingly being linked to health and disease. Because we develop tools to disseminate this information and enable others to work with our data and their own data, we will also bring nuclear architecture to bear on a broad range of ongoing health related research. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to NIH’s mission that seeks to obtain fundamental knowledge that will help to improve human health.",Multiscale Analyses of 4D Nucleome Structure and Function by Comprehensive Multimodal Data Integration,10156141,UM1HG011593,"['Address', 'Architecture', 'Atlases', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Loop', 'Chromatin Structure', 'Chromosome Structures', 'Chromosomes', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cytology', 'DNA Replication Timing', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Formulation', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Interphase Chromosome', 'Intuition', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Nuclear', 'Nuclear Lamina', 'Nuclear Structure', 'Organelles', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Production', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Ursidae Family', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'base', 'cell cycle genetics', 'cell type', 'computer framework', 'computerized tools', 'data exploration', 'data integration', 'data tools', 'experimental study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'histone modification', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mental function', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'multiple data types', 'multiscale data', 'predictive modeling', 'response', 'spatiotemporal', 'structured data', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'user-friendly', 'whole genome']",NHGRI,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,UM1,2020,2075409,-0.023463005360492065
