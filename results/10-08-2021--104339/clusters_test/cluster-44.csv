"AI based system for longitudinal, repeated measure analyses of freely moving C. elegans worms Abstract This project aims to develop WormInvestigator™, a novel, highly innovative system for performing automated, high-throughput and longitudinal studies of the behavior of C. elegans worms freely moving and socially interacting on agar plates (hereafter: ""freely moving worms"") across multiple time points over extended times (e.g., multiple days) with repeated measures designs. Work in Phase I will focus on demonstrating feasibility of our novel, patent pending, WormRecognizer™ technology – the ability to perform automatic, image-based identification of individual C. elegans worms within a group of freely moving worms (""digital tagging of freely moving worms""). Work in Phase II will focus on creating the full functionality of WormInvestigator for the commercial release. The innovation inherent in WormRecognizer will serve as the basis for enabling a game- changing innovation in the field – the ability to perform high throughput longitudinal, repeated measures design analyses of locomotion and other behavior of freely moving C. elegans worms from discrete, non-continuous video sequences. Compared to study designs that have independent groups repeated measures designs offer more statistical power and the possibility to track an effect over time. Specifically, repeated measures designs for analyzing locomotion and other behavior of freely moving worms will allow researchers to definitively assess the likelihood that a particular behavior is associated with a prior behavior, which is impossible without repeated measures designs or impractical continuous imaging and tracking under constant illumination. WormRecognizer will leverage the Deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture to perform automatic identification of the tracks of the same worm in videos of groups of freely moving worms recorded at different time points; encouraging pilot data were generated during preparation of this application. C. elegans is increasingly used as a model organism in research focusing on brain mechanisms underlying complex behaviors and pathological alterations thereof, including research into neurodevelopment, Alzheimer's disease, autism, schizophrenia and traumatic brain injury. Thus, WormInvestigator will enable significant advancements in various mental neuroscience applications that use C. elegans as a model organism. Specifically, the fact that C. elegans express many of the neurotransmitters and associated receptors that are found in higher eukaryotes, including humans, makes C. elegans highly attractive for the (high throughput) screening of next generation therapeutics for mental diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, as well as for disorders that rely on neurotransmitter release modulation such as next generation treatments for schizophrenia. We will perform extensive feasibility studies, product validation and usability studies of WormInvestigator in close collaboration with expert neuroscientists. Market research performed during preparation of this application indicated that WormInvestigator will expand the use of C. elegans as a model organism to many laboratories that do not currently use them. A competing technology is not available. We anticipate the global market size for WormInvestigator to be more than 300 systems. Narrative Performing longitudinal studies and repeated measures design analyses in both short-term and long-term experimental assays focusing on the analysis of locomotion and other behavior of multiple C. elegans worms holds the promise of profound progress in next-generation neuroscience studies such as understanding neurodevelopmental, neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders, as well as aging research, drug discovery and toxicology. Our proposed product will be a transformative technology, using new analytical methods based on artificial intelligence algorithms that, for the first time, will enable researchers to perform these data-rich longitudinal studies and, thus, repeated measures design analyses in assays using C. elegans as a model organism. This system will allow researchers to make new discoveries based on new studies that are currently not feasible, ultimately providing the basis for developing novel treatments to prevent and fight complex brain diseases.","AI based system for longitudinal, repeated measure analyses of freely moving C. elegans worms",10258638,R43MH126834,"['Acetylcholine', 'Address', 'Agar', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animal Model', 'Appearance', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Research', 'Biological Assay', 'Biotechnology', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Classification', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dopamine', 'Eukaryota', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Glutamates', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Legal patent', 'Lighting', 'Locomotion', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Market Research', 'Massachusetts', 'Measures', 'Microscope', 'Molecular', 'Motion', 'Mus', 'Names', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nematoda', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Pathologic', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Population Analysis', 'Preparation', 'Psyche structure', 'Rattus', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Rodent', 'Schizophrenia', 'Schools', 'Serotonin', 'Speed', 'Strategic Planning', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxicology', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Validation', 'Visual Fields', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'behavioral study', 'convolutional neural network', 'design', 'digital', 'drug discovery', 'fighting', 'free behavior', 'gamma-Aminobutyric Acid', 'high throughput screening', 'innovation', 'intelligent algorithm', 'longitudinal analysis', 'neural network architecture', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neurotransmitter release', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'receptor', 'social', 'usability']",NIMH,"MICROBRIGHTFIELD, LLC",R43,2021,449987
"Personalizing Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitor and Angiotensin Receptor Blocker Therapy in Chronic Kidney Disease PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are guideline- recommended therapies for preventing end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) events in patients with CKD. However, in real-world practice, ACEIs/ARBs are frequently discontinued by providers in the setting of acute kidney injury (AKI), rapid declines in kidney function, or advanced CKD. Premature discontinuation of ACEIs/ARBs can lead to adverse clinical outcomes among patients with CKD. However, discontinuation of these agents may be appropriate for certain CKD subgroups who are at higher risk of AKI and who may derive less benefit from these agents than trial populations. Although guidelines support the use of ACEIs/ARBs in patients with CKD, they also allow for individualization of decisions surrounding their use. However, it is unclear how to best individualize these decisions as CKD progresses to optimize kidney and cardiovascular outcomes. The overall objective of this proposal is to personalize ACEI/ARB therapy for patients with CKD based on each individual's risk factors for ESKD and CVD. To accomplish this, we will use data from the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC) Study. We will first identify factors that drive the discontinuation of ACEIs/ARBs (Aim 1). Next, we will build two clinical tools that model the relationship between ACEI/ARB discontinuation and risk of ESKD (Aim 2) or CVD events (Aim 3) in individuals with CKD. Our long-term goal is to reduce the burden of kidney disease and improve patient outcomes by individualizing medication use in CKD. We expect that completion of these aims will result in the development of two prediction tools that can be further refined and implemented in real-world clinical practice as part of a career development award application. The proposed aims are integrated into a comprehensive training plan that includes a Master's Degree in Clinical Research and practical mentored experiences. Through this training plan, Dr. Chen will have the opportunity to 1) learn and apply knowledge in advanced biostatistical and epidemiological methods, including marginal structural modeling; 2) gain familiarity with the CRIC Study database, 3) apply machine learning algorithms to the development of clinical prediction tools, 4) refine skills in scientific writing and presenting research, and 5) advance towards a career development award and independence as a clinical investigator. PROJECT NARRATIVE Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) have been shown to prevent adverse kidney and cardiovascular outcomes in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) on a population level. However, ACEIs/ARBs are frequently discontinued despite guidelines recommending their use as first-line anti-hypertensive agents in CKD. This proposal aims to develop clinical tools that will predict whether individuals are likely to benefit versus be harmed by discontinuation of ACEIs/ARBs, with the goal of improving the safe and appropriate use of these agents in CKD.",Personalizing Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitor and Angiotensin Receptor Blocker Therapy in Chronic Kidney Disease,10313873,F32DK130543,"['Acute', 'Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Adverse effects', 'Age', 'Angiotensin Receptor', 'Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Antihypertensive Agents', 'Biometry', 'Biostatistical Methods', 'California', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Chronic Kidney Insufficiency', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Cohort Studies', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease Outcome', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'End stage renal failure', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Familiarity', 'Funding', 'Glomerular Filtration Rate', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Heart failure', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hypertension', 'Hypotension', 'Individual', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Longterm Follow-up', 'Machine Learning', 'Master&apos', 's Degree', 'Mediating', 'Mentors', 'Modeling', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Peripheral arterial disease', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Proteinuria', 'Provider', 'Quality of life', 'Recommendation', 'Renal function', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'San Francisco', 'Solid', 'Stroke', 'Structural Models', 'System', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Visit', 'Writing', 'base', 'clinical development', 'clinical practice', 'disorder subtype', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'functional status', 'high risk', 'hyperkalemia', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality', 'personalized care', 'personalized decision', 'predictive modeling', 'premature', 'prevent', 'programs', 'skills', 'tool']",NIDDK,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",F32,2021,88630
"Spatiotemporal control of concentration gradients with electrochemistry in extracelluar space Project Summary  The natural environment is intrinsically spatiotemporally heterogenous at both macroscopic and microscopic levels. What shapes such a heterogeneity includes the concentration gradients of biologically relevant chemical species in the extracellular medium including dioxygen (O2), reactive oxygen species (ROS), as well as essential redox-active transition metals. While a significant amount of effort has been devoted to spectroscopically image these chemical moieties, our capability to spatiotemporally control their concentration distributions in the extracellular medium remains limited. This is especially the case for biofilms and microbiota, in which the microorganisms’ small length scales pose significant challenges for concentration modulation. The inadequate control of concentration heterogeneity limits our capability of mimicking the natural environments in vitro and investigating how local concentration gradients affect microbial functionality. Therefore, there is a need for an advanced method of controlling chemical concentrations at microscopic level.  Our proposed research aims to use electrochemical nano-/micro-electrodes to spatiotemporally control the concentration gradients in the extracellular medium. When an electrochemical reaction occurs on an electrode’s surface, a concentration gradient is established near the electrode. Taking advantages of this phenomena with the assistance of numerical simulation, we will employ an array of nano-/micro-electrodes with individually addressable electrochemical potentials to program any arbitrary spatiotemporal concentration profiles. We will fine-tune the surface chemistry and the electrochemical properties of these electrodes to ensure biocompatibility and reaction specificity. The developed system will be applied to biofilms and we aim to investigate how the microbial social behavior will be affected by a perturbation of local O2 concentration. Moreover, we will use this device to mimic the heterogenous environment in the gut and culture gut microbiota in vitro. An algorithm based on machine learning will be employed to actively adjust electrode potentials, maintaining a stable concentration profile despite the accumulation of gut microorganisms.  Ultimately, our work will expand our capability of controlling the concentration heterogeneity in nature. The developed electrochemical system will serve an in vitro platform to culture microorganisms in their native environment, or as a tool to perturb the concentration profiles. Combining electrochemistry, inorganic chemistry, and nanomaterials the research will enable a deeper understanding of the spatial distribution and temporal response of microbial systems. Project Narrative The natural environment is intrinsically heterogenous yet our control of concentrations for chemical species is limited at microscopic level. The proposed research is relevant to the mission of the NIH because it describes the development of technology that will expand our capability of controlling chemical concentration profiles in a variety of microbial systems relevant to the public health. The research described here will enable a deeper understanding of disease-related microbial systems and help to formulate strategies to combat diseases.",Spatiotemporal control of concentration gradients with electrochemistry in extracelluar space,10256801,R35GM138241,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Biological', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Devices', 'Dioxygen', 'Disease', 'Electrochemistry', 'Electrodes', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Heterogeneity', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Inorganic Chemistry', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Microbial Biofilms', 'Microscopic', 'Mission', 'Nanoarray Analytical Device', 'Nature', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Reaction', 'Reactive Oxygen Species', 'Research', 'Shapes', 'Social Behavior', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Specificity', 'Surface', 'System', 'Transition Elements', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'base', 'biomaterial compatibility', 'combat', 'extracellular', 'gut microbiota', 'microbial', 'microbiota', 'microorganism', 'microorganism culture', 'nano', 'nanomaterials', 'programs', 'response', 'simulation', 'spatiotemporal', 'spectroscopic imaging', 'technology development', 'tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R35,2021,371084
"Biomechanical and Biological Predictors of Cartilage Health Following Meniscus Injury Abstract  Injury of the meniscus is frequently associated with early onset osteoarthritis (OA). Partial meniscectomy to remove the damaged meniscal tissue is the most commonly performed orthopaedic procedure. While this procedure can provide symptomatic relief in the short term, nearly 35% of patients develop radiographic evidence of OA within 5-7 years following surgery. However, the causes for this early onset OA are unknown. One potential pathway for the progression of knee OA following meniscectomy is through altered loading of the articular cartilage. However, other studies suggest that biological factors, such as joint inflammation may play an important role. Recently, through a combination of MR imaging, 3D modeling, and biplanar radiography, our team has shown that medial meniscal injury alters the cartilage-to-cartilage contact strains in both the medial and lateral compartments. In addition, we found that increased strain was correlated with increased levels of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity in the synovial fluid, a biomarker which may be indicative of joint degradation. Together, these results suggest that biomechanical and biological factors play an important role in the development of OA after meniscal injury. However, the role of partial meniscectomy on these changes is unclear. Thus, a comprehensive evaluation of the biomechanical and biological environment of the joint before and after partial meniscectomy will elucidate the factors that contribute to early onset OA. Our overall hypothesis is that following partial meniscectomy, both biomechanical and biological changes in the joint will predict cartilage degeneration. Furthermore, when biomechanical and biological predictors are combined together with patient demographics and clinical characteristics, we will identify well-defined clinical phenotypes of patients at high risk of cartilage degeneration.  Cartilage degeneration will be assessed through MR-based measures of cartilage thickness and composition. Using high speed biplanar x-ray and MR imaging, in vivo cartilage strains in both knees of patients with unilateral medial meniscus injury will be measured in response to treadmill walking prior to surgery and after surgery. Synovial fluid and serum will also be collected and a panel of pro-inflammatory mediators and tissue metabolic biomarkers will be measured. Synovial fluid immune cell analyses will be performed by flow cytometry. Using these biomechanical and biological factors, we will identify participants at increased risk for cartilage degeneration at two years after surgery. Then, using predictive models combining biomechanical factors, biological factors, demographics, and clinical characteristics, we will develop well-defined clinical phenotypes of cartilage degeneration risk. Importantly, the development of these phenotypes will enable targeted treatment approaches focused on surgery, pharmaceutical targets, and non-pharmacological interventions, such as physical rehabilitation strategies or weight loss, to prevent cartilage degeneration. Project Narrative Meniscus injuries are very common and frequently lead to early onset osteoarthritis, a leading cause of disability. This project will identify biomechanical and biological predictors of cartilage degeneration after meniscus injury and partial meniscectomy.

"A Systems Biology Approach Using Fecal Microbiota and Metabolomics to Identify Novel Subtypes in Irritable Bowel Syndrome. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Candidate: Dr. Allen Lee, MD is a gastroenterologist with advanced training in gastrointestinal motility whose research focuses on identifying abnormalities in host-microbial interactions to improve care in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Dr. Lee’s long-term career goals are to identify novel subgroups of IBS patients which inform biological responses to therapies and guide management. The proposed K23 mentored career development award includes a 3-year plan for training, didactics, and research activities that will provide Dr. Lee with the necessary skills and experience to become a successful independent investigator. Career Development: Dr. Lee will develop skills in the following four areas: 1) culture-independent approaches to study host-microbial interactions in IBS; 2) advanced biostatistical methods to study longitudinal datasets, including mixed models or generalized additive models; 3) laboratory-based translational techniques; 4) predictive analytics, such as machine learning algorithms. These training goals will directly contribute to Dr. Lee’s long-term career goals and prepare him to submit a successful R01 application. Research Context: Common treatments in diarrhea-predominant IBS (IBS-D) are effective in ≤50% patients. Additionally, there are currently no methods to identify patients more likely to respond to different treatments. The current paradigm for managing IBS patients revolves around identifying and treating the predominant symptom complexes. However, this is a hugely inefficient model and leads to frustration for both patients and health care providers. This proposal seeks to determine whether a systems biology approach, which incorporates microbiome and metabolomics data along with detailed clinical phenotype information, may identify novel subgroups that inform treatment decisions in IBS-D. Research Plan: This career development award leverages an on-going clinical trial comparing the effects of a nonabsorbable antibiotic rifaximin with a diet low in fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols (FODMAP) in IBS-D patients to identify differences in microbial community structure and function in responders vs. non-responders to therapy. Specific Aim 1 will identify fecal microbial features by 16S rRNA sequence analysis characteristic of treatment response to rifaximin or a low FODMAP diet. Specific Aim 2 will determine how treatments with rifaximin or low FODMAP diet affect the fecal metabolome, including short chain fatty acids and bile acids, in IBS-D patients. Specific Aim 3 will develop predictive models to identify subsets of IBS-D patients responsive to treatment. We will also identify risk factors for non-response to either rifaximin or low FODMAP diet. Results from this proposal will inform two future R01 proposals to validate these findings as well as to understand the mechanisms by which host-microbial interactions may mediate response to different therapies in IBS. Project Narrative Diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D) is a common but difficult condition to manage likely because it is a heterogeneous disorder. This research proposal seeks to determine whether patients with IBS- D can be better stratified by their fecal microbiome and microbiome-derived metabolites. Results from this proposal may lead to a paradigm change in the way that we manage and treat IBS and potentially lead to an era of precision medicine in IBS.",A Systems Biology Approach Using Fecal Microbiota and Metabolomics to Identify Novel Subtypes in Irritable Bowel Syndrome.,10125589,K23DK124567,"['16S ribosomal RNA sequencing', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Antibiotics', 'Area', 'Bile Acids', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biostatistical Methods', 'Butyrates', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Culture-independent methods', 'Data', 'Diarrhea', 'Diet', 'Disaccharides', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Foundations', 'Frustration', 'Future', 'Gastroenterologist', 'Gastrointestinal Motility', 'Goals', 'Health Personnel', 'Irritable Bowel Syndrome', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monosaccharides', 'Multiomic Data', 'Oligosaccharides', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Precision Health', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Randomized', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Ribosomal RNA', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Virulence Factors', 'Volatile Fatty Acids', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical phenotype', 'cohort', 'combinatorial', 'common treatment', 'dietary', 'experience', 'fecal metabolome', 'fecal microbiome', 'fecal microbiota', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'host-microbe interactions', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'longitudinal analysis', 'longitudinal dataset', 'machine learning algorithm', 'metabolomics', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'patient response', 'polyol', 'potential biomarker', 'precision medicine', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'resilience', 'response', 'rifaximin', 'skills', 'stem', 'treatment comparison', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'trial comparing']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K23,2021,194608
"Characterization of Renal Allograft Fibrosis and Prediction of Outcome Using a Quantitative MRI Approach Project Summary Renal transplantation is the treatment of choice for patients with end stage renal disease. However, improvements in long-term allograft survival have not matched the observed improvements in the management of rejection. Progressive allograft dysfunction is frequently encountered clinically. The final common pathway of cumulative and incremental renal damage from several etiologies identified by histopathology is interstitial fibrosis/tubular atrophy (IFTA), which is associated with progression of renal dysfunction and reduced allograft survival. Histopathologic assessment and staging of IFTA requires tissue sampling, which is limited due to its invasive nature, risk of complications, inter-individual variability and sampling error. In this proposal, we will test a non-contrast advanced multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) protocol comprised of advanced relaxometry (T1 mapping and T1) and advanced diffusion weighted imaging (IVIM-DWI) as noninvasive markers of renal allograft fibrosis. This is motivated by our preliminary data demonstrating that mpMRI yields highly repeatable parameter measurements that capture allograft fibrosis. Our preliminary experience correlating mpMRI with IFTA is valuable, as confounding physiologic and pathophysiologic variables such as vascular flow, edema and other Banff phenotypes commonly co-exist. The multiparametric approach allows us to simultaneously capture and characterize these concurrent physiologic and pathophysiologic processes. As a secondary objective, we will assess the value of urinary RNA level based biomarkers, which have been previously validated for the diagnosis of IFTA. In this proposal, we aim to: 1) acquire data in patients undergoing indication and surveillance biopsy, using a non-contrast mpMRI protocol comprised of advanced diffusion weighted and relaxometry methods in order to accurately detect and stage allograft IFTA, and 2) other histopathological Banff measures of inflammation. We will build and validate diagnostic models using advanced statistical methods including machine learning in independent model-building and validation sets of renal transplant patients for detection and staging of each Banff measure, and assess the added value of urinary biomarkers of fibrosis. 3) We will evaluate the performance of mpMRI and urinary biomarkers to predict renal outcomes in a longitudinal study for the entire patient cohort up to 24 months. Our long-term objective is to validate a robust quantitative advanced mpMRI approach and develop models that accurately and non-invasively measure renal allograft fibrosis and clinical outcome, which may potentially impact the care of renal transplant patients by enabling early detection, the non-invasive longitudinal monitoring of disease, therapeutic efficacy of new drugs and for prognostication. Characterization of Renal Allograft Fibrosis and Prediction of Outcome Using a Quantitative MRI Approach Project Narrative Caused by a variety of etiologies, acute and chronic renal allograft injury often results in the development of interstitial fibrosis/tubular atrophy (IFTA), is a significant cause of allograft failure and poor outcomes; the reference standard for which is tissue biopsy, which is limited due to sampling error and risk of complications. In this proposal, we will develop a short, non-contrast multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) protocol, consisting of advanced relaxometry (T1 mapping and T1) and advanced diffusion weighted imaging (IVIM-DWI) to accurately detect and stage allograft fibrosis, taking into account confounding Banff variables of inflammation and tested against biopsy. We will also assess the added value of urinary biomarkers of IFTA and if successful, this study will benefit a large population of patients with renal allograft fibrosis in the United States, enabling early diagnosis, optimized treatment planning, prognostication and longitudinal disease monitoring.",Characterization of Renal Allograft Fibrosis and Prediction of Outcome Using a Quantitative MRI Approach,10279690,R01DK129888,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Allografting', 'Area', 'Atrophic', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Blood Vessels', 'Caring', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collagen', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Edema', 'End stage renal failure', 'Endothelium', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Etiology', 'Failure', 'Fibrosis', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Histopathology', 'Immune', 'Immunosuppression', 'Infection', 'Infiltration', 'Inflammation', 'Injury', 'Injury to Kidney', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Transplantation', 'Lesion', 'Living Donors', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Proteinuria', 'Protocols documentation', 'RNA', 'Reference Standards', 'Relaxation', 'Reproducibility', 'Risk', 'Sampling Errors', 'Severities', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Tubular formation', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Water', 'base', 'clinical encounter', 'clinically significant', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'diffusion weighted', 'experience', 'feature selection', 'improved', 'insight', 'inter-individual variation', 'interstitial', 'kidney allograft', 'kidney biopsy', 'kidney dysfunction', 'macromolecule', 'model building', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome prediction', 'patient population', 'post-transplant', 'predict clinical outcome', 'prognostic', 'renal damage', 'secondary outcome', 'statistical and machine learning', 'treatment choice', 'treatment optimization', 'treatment planning', 'urinary', 'virtual']",NIDDK,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2021,625886
"A Systems Biology and Patient Stratification Approach to Improve Outcomes of Patients with Hypoxic Injury in Renal Tubular Cells in Chronic Kidney Diseases ABSTRACT  Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a global health epidemic and patients with CKD suffer from increased mortality and cardiovascular disease. Despite the severity of the disease, there are limited treatment options to hinder its progression. Tubular injury (TI) is a common finding on many kidney biopsies from patients with CKD, and there is mechanistic data supporting that TI can lead to interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy. While interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy are the strongest known pathologic predictor of progression of CKD, we have limited understand of how TI contributes to this progression. Hypoxia Inducible Factor-1α (HIF-1α) has been shown in animal studies to impact the severity of TI and is also known to trigger a fibrotic cascade, but there is limited data regarding its overall activity in kidney tissue, its cell type specific activity, its association with pathologic features or patient outcomes. It is of utmost importance to better understand this pathway as several Prolyl Hydroxylase inhibitors, which are novel therapeutic agents that increase the expression of HIF- 1α, are currently in clinical trial testing to treat anemia of CKD. The first aim of this proposal is to develop a measure of HIF-1α pathway activity that enables evaluation of clinical and morphologic features and cell-type specificity. Specifically, the candidate will a) Identify clinical and pathologic descriptors associated with increased HIF-1α pathway activity score and b) Determine the cell-type specific expression level of HIF-1α and its downstream components in tubular cells using single-cell RNA-sequencing. The second aim of this proposal is to determine the association of increased HIF-1α activity with outcomes and identify patients with increased HIF-1α activity non-invasively using biomarkers. Specifically, the candidate will a) Determine the association of increased HIF-1α activity score with patient outcomes and b) Identify serum or urine biomarkers that detect increased HIF-1α pathway activity in patients. The candidate will analyze data from 3 cohorts to accomplish these aims: Nephrotic Syndrome Study Network (NEPTUNE), Clinical Phenotyping Resource and Biobank Core (C-PROBE) and the Native Americans with Type 2 Diabetes cohort (formerly known as the Pima Indian cohort). These investigations will allow us to monitor HIF-1α activity non-invasively in trials where patients receive novel drug agents, such as Prolyl Hydroxylase Inhibitors.  The candidate will obtain formal training in analysis of gene expression data, single cell RNA- sequencing and machine learning techniques during the course of the award period to successfully integrate gene expression data, pathology data and clinical data. She will be mentored by an expert team with complementary experience in nephrology, tubular injury biology, systems biology and bioinformatics. The long-term goal of these investigations is to ultimately be able to better sub-type patients with tubular injury based on mechanistic terms.

"Machine learning to inform health services and policy for traumatic brain injury Project Summary Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is recognized as the leading cause of death and disability in all parts of the world and costs the international economy approximately US$400 billion annually, which, given an estimated standardized gross world product of US $73.7 trillion, is a striking 0.5% of the entire annual global output. To address the profound issues related to a drastic increase in emergency department visits and hospitalizations for TBI over the past decades, the United States Congress highlighted injury surveillance as a federal priority. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention defines surveillance as “use of health-related data that precede diagnosis and signal a sufficient probability of a case or an outbreak to warrant further public health response”. To prevent TBI, it is essential to understand its distribution and patterns, in addition to having strong knowledge of clinical disorders, characteristic, or other definable entity, that differentiates TBI from other clinical populations. A critical barrier to the progress of the NIH-funded program “Comorbidity in traumatic brain injury and risk of all-cause mortality, functional and financial burden: a decade-long population based cohort study” was the presence of complex and multifaceted comorbidities in a patient with TBI before and at the time of the injury, and their links to patients’ frailty, injury circumstances, severity, and outcomes. This resulted in a shift in the research paradigm, and development of a novel data mining approach used in genomics to sequence more than 70,000 clinical diagnosis codes in a TBI population, and compare them to a matched population. The developed data mining approach allowed not only the validation of previously known risk factors of TBI, but also the identification of associations previously unknown, without any preconceived human biases. This project will continue advancement of a non-hypothesis driven scientific approach, which will: (1) Characterize patients with TBI at three different time periods in relation to the TBI event – before, at the time of, and after the injury; (2) Develop individual and population level models to study the transitions between the different time states; and (3) Construct and validate predictive models of susceptibility to TBI events, adverse outcomes, and high healthcare resource use at the individual and population level. Decades- long population-based health administrative data from the publicly-funded healthcare system in Ontario, Canada is ready to be further analysed for clinical and technological advancement, to support human thinking in categorizing personal, clinical, and environmental exposure data preceding TBI. Project Narrative To detect, manage, and prevent traumatic brain injury (TBI), a complex and often lifelong disabling injury, it is essential to understand its distribution and patterns and have a comprehensive knowledge of the clinical disorder, characteristic, or other definable entity that differentiates between and within persons at risk of TBI of varying mechanisms, injury presentation, and its course. This research proposal expands an ongoing NIH-funded project that started to categorize clinical comorbidities and personal and environmental exposure data into clinically meaningful factors that increase the risk of injury and its severity at the population and individual levels. With the support of data mining and big data, this proposed program will advance research methods with a goal-directed learning process and the fields of injury surveillance and precision medicine, covering a variety of interests in public health, brain injury medicine, and behavioural and social sciences.",Machine learning to inform health services and policy for traumatic brain injury,10223453,R01NS117921,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Ambulances', 'Americas', 'Amnesia', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Brain Pathology', 'Canada', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Categories', 'Cause of Death', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Congresses', 'Data', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Elements', 'Emergency department visit', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Explosion', 'Exposure to', 'Financial Hardship', 'Funding', 'Gender', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Health', 'Health Policy', 'Health Services', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Injury', 'International', 'International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10)', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Metabolic', 'Modeling', 'Musculoskeletal System', 'Natural regeneration', 'Ontario', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Preventive', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Province', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Proposals', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Secondary to', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Standardization', 'Stratification', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'TBI Patients', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Unconscious State', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Woman', 'adverse outcome', 'assault', 'behavioral/social science', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'comorbidity', 'cost', 'data mining', 'disability', 'expectation', 'falls', 'frailty', 'functional outcomes', 'gender disparity', 'improved', 'informatics tool', 'injury recovery', 'injury surveillance', 'interest', 'medically necessary care', 'men', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized medicine', 'population based', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'response', 'risk stratification', 'sex', 'social', 'survivorship', 'vehicular accident', 'virtual']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO,R01,2021,188548
"Identifying Healthy and High-Risk Weight Loss Phenotypes to Optimize Obesity Management in End Stage Kidney Disease Project Summary/Abstract  In 2016, 47,000 individuals who initiated dialysis in the United States (~42% of all incident dialysis patients that year) had obesity, with a body mass index (BMI) of ≥ 30 kilograms per meters squared. Across the BMI spectrum, individuals with kidney disease commonly lose weight after initiating dialysis treatment. However, whereas body weight typically stabilizes after the first several months of dialysis among patients without obesity, those with obesity often continue to lose weight. Both people with and without obesity who are on dialysis may lose weight due to muscle wasting and malnutrition, and recent studies have identified weight loss as a risk factor for death among people on dialysis, independent of BMI. Yet, some of the weight loss observed among obese dialysis patients may also reflect deliberate attempts to improve health, mobility, or access to kidney transplantation. Currently, there are no guidelines to help clinicians to differentiate between healthy and high-risk weight loss among people with obesity on dialysis. Further, typical obesity management paradigms are not easily transferrable to obese people with end-stage kidney disease, given factors such as chronic malnutrition, inflammation, and sarcopenia in this population that may modify the risks and benefits of different weight loss strategies. Therefore, the overarching goal of this five-year research proposal is to define healthy and high-risk weight loss phenotypes among people with obesity who are on dialysis, and to provide clinically feasible tools to improve obesity management in the setting of end-stage kidney disease. We will accomplish this goal by conducting three distinct but interrelated studies. In the first study, we will qualitatively determine patient-prioritized endpoints of weight loss, in addition to patient, physician and other stakeholder perspectives on the key factors that differentiate healthy from high-risk weight loss on dialysis. In the second study, we will leverage a national dataset of 23,000 obese dialysis patients and apply constructs of high and low physiologic reserve to derive healthy and high-risk weight loss phenotypes. We will then develop a weight- loss risk calculator tool that predicts the risks of hospitalization and death that are associated with each weight loss phenotype, using dynamic predictive joint models and machine learning techniques. In the third study, we will enroll 250 obese dialysis patients in a prospective, longitudinal study across five regions in the United States to evaluate the association between nutritional, inflammatory, and hemodynamic biomarkers and measures of health trajectory that are not typically captured in registry data, such as sarcopenia, dynapenia, body composition, and patient-prioritized endpoints such as quality of life. In accomplishing its aims, this research will provide urgently needed knowledge and tools that will improve the medical management of tens of thousands of people with end-stage kidney disease and obesity, ensuring that clinicians will be better able to incorporate patient-prioritized outcomes into assessments of weight loss interventions, and recognize and mitigate the effects of high-risk weight loss. Project Narrative Although over 40,000 obese individuals with end-stage kidney disease initiate dialysis each year in the United States, there are no guidelines on optimal obesity management in the setting of dialysis care. Obese dialysis patients may lose weight due to chronic illness or due to intentional weight loss attempts, though it is difficult to differentiate between healthy and unhealthy weight loss in these patients. This proposal seeks to advance the science of obesity management in dialysis settings by providing new tools to differentiate between healthy and unhealthy weight loss trajectories among obese dialysis patients.",Identifying Healthy and High-Risk Weight Loss Phenotypes to Optimize Obesity Management in End Stage Kidney Disease,10179372,R01DK124388,"['Benefits and Risks', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Pressure', 'Body Composition', 'Body Weight', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Body mass index', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dialysis patients', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Dietitian', 'End stage renal failure', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Hemodialysis', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Intake', 'Interview', 'Joints', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Kidney Transplantation', 'Kilogram', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Malnutrition', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Muscle function', 'Muscular Atrophy', 'Nephrology', 'Non obese', 'Nutritional', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Centered Care', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Process', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Provider', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Services', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Transplant Recipients', 'United States', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Weight', 'adverse outcome', 'clinical care', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'data registry', 'experience', 'hazard', 'health related quality of life', 'healthy weight', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved mobility', 'inflammatory marker', 'machine learning algorithm', 'meter', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'muscle form', 'muscle strength', 'novel', 'nutrition', 'obese patients', 'obese person', 'obesity management', 'patient oriented', 'patient population', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'reduced muscle strength', 'sarcopenia', 'sleep quality', 'stakeholder perspectives', 'tool', 'weight loss intervention']",NIDDK,DREXEL UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,291877
"Affective science and smoking cessation: Real time real world assessment Tobacco use plays a causal role in almost 20 different types of cancer, and although smoking cessation is a cornerstone of cancer risk reduction, the vast majority of smoking quit attempts fail. Numerous conceptual models, as well as a large body of empirical evidence, underscore that affect is a potent determinant of smoking lapse. Unfortunately, very little is known about how the constellation and temporal dynamics of distinct emotions and other factors play out in real time in the real world to influence lapse risk. This lack of knowledge severely hampers both our conceptual models and our ability to optimally intervene. Thus, the overarching objectives of this research are to create a more detailed and comprehensive conceptual model of the role of distinct emotions in self-regulation, as well as the technical, empirical, and analytic foundation necessary to develop effective interventions for smoking cessation and other cancer risk behaviors that can target real time, real world mechanisms. The proposed research directly addresses several objectives from the PAR including the influence of distinct emotions and their time course on cancer risk behaviors, whether the role of distinct emotions is altered by the presence of other emotions (e.g., “blended” emotional states), and how the influence of affective experience is modified by context. The proposed longitudinal cohort study among 300 smokers attempting to quit is guided by a conceptual framework grounded in affective science and conceptual models of self-regulation and addiction. Participants will be followed from 1 week prior to their quit date through 6 months post-quit date. They will be assessed from 1 week pre-quit date through 2 weeks post-quit date using AutoSense, geographic positioning system (GPS), and ecological momentary assessment (EMA). AutoSense, GPS, and EMA collect real time data in natural environments, communicate wirelessly with each other, and data are processed in real time on a smartphone. AutoSense detects specific behavioral and physiologic “signatures” of smoking (the primary outcome) and self regulatory capacity (an intermediate outcome; assessed using high frequency heart rate variability) in real time. GPS real time spatial tracking will be linked with spatially and temporally relevant characteristics of the environment using geographic information system (GIS) data. EMAs assess self-reported emotions, cognition, and context. Analyses utilize advanced dynamic risk prediction models and machine learning approaches to model the dynamics of real time, real world associations among distinct emotions, SRC, and lapse. Tobacco use is the leading preventable cause of death and disability in the U.S. The proposed study will yield a more detailed and comprehensive conceptual model of the role of distinct emotions in self-regulation, as well as the technical, empirical, and analytic foundation necessary to develop more effective interventions for smoking cessation and other cancer risk behaviors that can target real time, real world mechanisms.

"Development of a multi-omic clinical decision platform to guide personalized therapy PROJECT SUMMARY The era of “big data” has opened the door for genomic and systems biology approaches to be applied to current challenges in life sciences and precision medicine. One critical challenge in these areas is how to prioritize research findings to validate and identify actionable insights that can translate into better outcomes for patients. In this regard, we have assembled a multidisciplinary group of scientists and physicians from academia and industry with a focus on creating discovery pipelines that combine high-throughput profiling technologies with advanced statistical and machine learning approaches to generate predictive tools that enable us to move rapidly from big data to better diagnoses and treatment. In this regard, we propose to apply these approaches to develop a computational clinical decision tool that will improve disease forecasting and treatment plans for Multiple Myeloma (MM), an incurable cancer that originates in bone marrow plasma cells and affects more than 30,000 patients a year. Though there have been some advances in the number and diversity of available therapeutic options for these patients, relapse remains inevitable, and MM ultimately remains a terminal diagnosis. The clinical assay and computational pipeline developed in this project will combine a targeted sequencing panel specific to myeloma patients and clonality estimates with RNA- sequencing and drug repurposing to expand therapeutic options for MM patients. We will develop this unique tool with the following specific aims: (1) Develop an integrated genomic clinical decision tool to guide precision treatment of MM and validate therapy recommendations using PDX profiling, and (2) Validate MM precision medicine platform in a prospective clinical trial and generate clone-specific treatment recommendations. To achieve these objectives, we will integrate a Cancer Genetic, Inc.'s FOCUS::Myeloma panel, a targeted panel designed to specifically interrogateall the genes and copy number alterations commonly altered in myeloma, and into a computational drug selection pipeline that utilizes RNA-sequencing data and drug repurposing algorithms to generate therapeutic recommendations matched to a patient's unique disease profile. These recommendations will be validated in mouse avatars of myeloma to confirm and refine drug predictions. We will implement our assay in a prospective clinical trial of 100 patients to determine if the treatment decisions generated by our pipeline achieves an improvement in standard-of-care. Finally, we will perform clonal modeling on relapsed patients to retrospectively evaluate clone-specific treatment responses. Completion of these studies will result in a clinic-ready assay and computational tool that will guide MM precision treatment decisions and inform new therapeutic strategies based on a patient's unique cancer profile. genomic clonal modeling PROJECT NARRATIVE Multiple Myeloma is an incurable cancer of the blood that takes the lives of over 12,000 people every year. It remains a difficult disease to treat due to its genetic complexity from the earliest stages of the disease, indicating a need for a precision medicine approach in treating these patients. In this application Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai will partner with Cancer Genetics, Inc. to develop a multi-omics clinical decision assay that will improve long-term outcomes for patients with advanced myeloma and generate valuable insights and tools that can be broadly leveraged for other disease indications.",Development of a multi-omic clinical decision platform to guide personalized therapy,10101640,R01CA244899,"['Academia', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Animal Model', 'Area', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Sciences', 'Bone Marrow', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clonality', 'Computer Models', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Drug resistance', 'Employment', 'Event', 'Gene Dosage', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'Hematopoietic Neoplasms', 'Heterogeneity', 'Industry', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Intake', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Multiple Myeloma', 'Mus', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Peripheral arterial disease', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Physicians', 'Plasma Cells', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'RNA', 'Recommendation', 'Refractory', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Scientist', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'Stream', 'Suggestion', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Xenograft procedure', 'base', 'cancer genetics', 'clinical decision support', 'clinically actionable', 'computational pipelines', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'disorder subtype', 'drug repurposing', 'efficacy testing', 'genomic data', 'genomic profiles', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'in vivo', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'longitudinal design', 'medical schools', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple omics', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient derived xenograft model', 'personalized medicine', 'personalized therapeutic', 'pilot trial', 'point of care', 'precision medicine', 'predictive tools', 'profiles in patients', 'prospective', 'relapse patients', 'risk stratification', 'standard of care', 'statistical and machine learning', 'support tools', 'targeted sequencing', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment planning', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor xenograft']",NCI,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2021,531246
"Antibody isotyping for discrimination of disease stage and diagnosis of early Lyme disease. ABSTRACT More than 3 million tests are performed each year to support the laboratory diagnosis of human Lyme disease (LD). While the CDC conventional standard two-tier (CSTT) approach for serodiagnosis of LD has worked relatively well when used as recommended, there is plenty of room for improvement. Of a number of weaknesses associated with the supplemental immunoblot of the CSTT the most significant is low reproducibility due to the subjective visual interpretation of results. To overcome these weaknesses the CDC recently updated its recommendations based on a modified STT (MSTT) in that a second EIA can replace the immunoblot. The major goal of this project is to develop an objective, quantitative, multiplex EIA that can detect four antibody isotypes (IgM/D/G/A) and all four IgG subclasses (IgG1/2/3/4) to leverage acquisition of simultaneous antibody profile information on multiple B. burgdorferi antigens to build an assay that can discriminate Lyme disease stage with increased overall sensitivity without incurring in loss of specificity. The novelty of this study relies on: 1) evaluation of B. burgdorferi antigen-specific antibody isotypes and IgG subclasses that can be correlated with Lyme disease stage; and 2) development of new diagnostic tools using machine learning techniques to train and integrate all data and produce an objective result to discriminate early Lyme from early disseminated/late Lyme disease. We expect this Phase I SBIR to allow us to develop a new EIA for serodiagnosis of Lyme disease (isoEIAplex-Ld) and to further an ongoing collaboration with DCN diagnostics for the adaptation of our biomarkers to a new rapid Lateral Flow Assay (see Letter of Support) for a follow up Phase II SBIR .

"Electrophysiological Biomarkers to Optimize DBS for Depression PROJECT SUMMARY Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subcallosal cingulate (SCC) white matter is an emerging new treatment strategy for treatment resistant depression (TRD) with published studies demonstrating sustained long-term antidepressant effects in 40-60% of implanted patients. Converging evidence from positron emission tomography (PET), electroencephalography (EEG) and diffusion tractography (DTI) strongly suggests that DBS mediates its clinical benefits by direct modulation of the SCC--a key hub in an aberrant neural circuit. Despite encouraging sustained long-term effects in this notoriously difficult to treat patient population, randomized controls trials of SCC DBS and other DBS targets for TRD are now on hold as initial results failed to meet predefined clinical endpoints. While this proposal cannot address those failures directly, a clear necessary next step for effective future testing and eventual dissemination of this treatment is the need to develop brain-based biomarkers to guide lead placement and to titrate stimulation parameters during ongoing care. In the absence of such biomarkers to guide DBS use, there will continue to be variability in the implementation of clinical procedures during testing, leading to ambiguous and possibly misleading trial outcomes, and subsequent abandonment of a potentially useful treatment. To overcome these limitations, we propose to develop and test objective methods for reliable device configuration in individuals by optimizing DBS-SCC treatment with respect to human functional anatomy and key electrophysiological variables. We will leverage the capabilities of a novel bi-directional neuromodulation system (Medtronic RC+S) that allows live streaming of oscillatory activity at the site of stimulation to define novel control strategies to guide programming decisions for DBS delivery. Ongoing measurements of SCC local field potentials (LFPs) will be combined with electroencephalography (EEG) and event related potential studies (ERP) performed as part of an experimental clinical trial of subcallosal cingulate DBS for TRD to identify an oscillatory signal that (1) is sensitive to changes in frequency and current parameters at the tractography defined optimal target and (2) tracks with depression state over time. Connectome-based and machine learning approaches will be used to define the most robust network biomarker and its response characteristics. Once defined, the control policy will be tested in a second phase feasibility study where parameters for initial stimulation will be selected based on the depression brain state biomarker and adjustments made to correct drift from the predefined target signal. If successful, the data- driven model and control strategy will enable objective, rational clinical programming of DBS stimulation for depression and provide a new model and approach for target identification, stimulation initiation and long-term monitoring and management of patients receiving this treatment. . NARRATIVE The goal of this project is to refine and optimize deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subcallosal cingulate white matter for patients with treatment resistant depression. Using a newly available bi- directional neuromodulation system that allows live streaming of oscillatory activity at the site of stimulation, this study will define novel control strategies to guide programming decisions for DBS delivery providing a new evidence-based strategy for target identification, stimulation initiation and long-term monitoring and management of patients receiving this treatment.",Electrophysiological Biomarkers to Optimize DBS for Depression,10310774,UH3NS103550,"['Address', 'Anatomy', 'Base of the Brain', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Devices', 'Diffusion', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Event-Related Potentials', 'Failure', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Mediating', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Policies', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Procedures', 'Publishing', 'Randomized', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'antidepressant effect', 'base', 'clinical implementation', 'connectome', 'control trial', 'evidence base', 'live stream', 'neural circuit', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'patient population', 'response', 'tractography', 'treatment strategy', 'treatment-resistant depression', 'white matter']",NINDS,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,UH3,2021,109980
"Development of FAST-DOSE assay system for the rapid assessment of acute radiation exposure, individual radiosensitivity and injury in victims for a large-scale radiological incident Summary Following a large scale radiological or nuclear event, hundreds of thousands of people may be exposed to ionizing radiation/s and require subsequent dose-dependent medical management. It will be crucial to collect and analyze human biofluids (such as blood, urine, saliva) as soon as possible within the first week for accurate dose prediction and early triage decision. There is a need for FDA-approved in vitro diagnostic high-throughput biodosimetry devices with the ability to determine past radiation exposure with precision and accuracy. At the Center for High Throughput Radiation Biodosimetry, the Columbia University Center for Medical Countermeasures against Radiation (CMCR), we have developed FAST-DOSE (Fluorescent Automated Screening Tool for Dosimetry) assay system, to measure radiation-responsive proteins in human peripheral blood samples for retrospective estimation of radiation dose. The protein panel also includes biomarkers for blood leukocyte subtypes to reflect hematological sensitivity and injury. The FAST- DOSE assay system is intended as an in vitro diagnostic device (IVD) as defined by 21 CFR 809.3. The platform uses a commercial imaging flow cytometry system (ImageStream®X) and associated Image Data Exploration and Analysis Software (IDEAS®) to rapidly quantify changes in biomarker expression levels within specific cellular structures using fluorescent imagery and algorithms for estimation of absorbed dose. The studies planned here are designed to develop and optimize our FAST-DOSE assay system to accurately estimate absorbed dose and assess hematopoietic injury in human lymphocytes after ionizing irradiation. The first objective is to build on our current biomarker validation data for early engagement with the FDA via the pre-submission process. We have used the human ex vivo model and humanized mouse (Hu-NSG) and non- human primate (NHP) models to validate biomarker expression and radiosensitivity in blood leukocytes after acute ionizing radiation exposure. The Specific Aims proposed here are designed to: optimize the assay protocol and identify biomarker dose/time kinetics for accurate dose predictions in vitro and test 1) inter-donor variation, 2) intra-donor variation and 3) inter-laboratory variability (Aim 1); test the effect of specific confounders: age and sex, inheritance with germline BRCA1/2 pathogenic variant, and inflammation and trauma on the biomarker response, before and after irradiation (Aim 2); measure biomarker levels and time kinetics in vivo and correlate with hematopoietic injury, based on peripheral blood leukocyte counts, and stem and progenitor cell levels in the bone marrow of Hu-NSG mice (Aim 3) and, develop mathematical models (using machine learning and regression techniques) to select the best FAST-DOSE biomarkers and their combinations for generating dose predictions based on the ex vivo and in vivo dose response of these biomarkers (Aim 4). Our vision for future development is to develop a more simplified, faster rapid FAST-DOSE assay system whereby the biomarkers could be developed and transitioned for use in a point-of-care (POC) device.

"Development of FAST-DOSE assay system for the rapid assessment of acute radiation exposure, individual radiosensitivity and injury in victims for a large-scale radiological incident Summary Following a large scale radiological or nuclear event, hundreds of thousands of people may be exposed to ionizing radiation/s and require subsequent dose-dependent medical management. It will be crucial to collect and analyze human biofluids (such as blood, urine, saliva) as soon as possible within the first week for accurate dose prediction and early triage decision. There is a need for FDA-approved in vitro diagnostic high-throughput biodosimetry devices with the ability to determine past radiation exposure with precision and accuracy. At the Center for High Throughput Radiation Biodosimetry, the Columbia University Center for Medical Countermeasures against Radiation (CMCR), we have developed FAST-DOSE (Fluorescent Automated Screening Tool for Dosimetry) assay system, to measure radiation-responsive proteins in human peripheral blood samples for retrospective estimation of radiation dose. The protein panel also includes biomarkers for blood leukocyte subtypes to reflect hematological sensitivity and injury. The FAST- DOSE assay system is intended as an in vitro diagnostic device (IVD) as defined by 21 CFR 809.3. The platform uses a commercial imaging flow cytometry system (ImageStream®X) and associated Image Data Exploration and Analysis Software (IDEAS®) to rapidly quantify changes in biomarker expression levels within specific cellular structures using fluorescent imagery and algorithms for estimation of absorbed dose. The studies planned here are designed to develop and optimize our FAST-DOSE assay system to accurately estimate absorbed dose and assess hematopoietic injury in human lymphocytes after ionizing irradiation. The first objective is to build on our current biomarker validation data for early engagement with the FDA via the pre-submission process. We have used the human ex vivo model and humanized mouse (Hu-NSG) and non- human primate (NHP) models to validate biomarker expression and radiosensitivity in blood leukocytes after acute ionizing radiation exposure. The Specific Aims proposed here are designed to: optimize the assay protocol and identify biomarker dose/time kinetics for accurate dose predictions in vitro and test 1) inter-donor variation, 2) intra-donor variation and 3) inter-laboratory variability (Aim 1); test the effect of specific confounders: age and sex, inheritance with germline BRCA1/2 pathogenic variant, and inflammation and trauma on the biomarker response, before and after irradiation (Aim 2); measure biomarker levels and time kinetics in vivo and correlate with hematopoietic injury, based on peripheral blood leukocyte counts, and stem and progenitor cell levels in the bone marrow of Hu-NSG mice (Aim 3) and, develop mathematical models (using machine learning and regression techniques) to select the best FAST-DOSE biomarkers and their combinations for generating dose predictions based on the ex vivo and in vivo dose response of these biomarkers (Aim 4). Our vision for future development is to develop a more simplified, faster rapid FAST-DOSE assay system whereby the biomarkers could be developed and transitioned for use in a point-of-care (POC) device.

"Molecular and metabolic signaling in necrotizing enterocolitis The goal of the current R35 proposal is to understand the underlying pathogenesis of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), the leading cause of death from gastrointestinal disease in premature infants, and to develop novel treatments for this devastating disease. The typical patient with NEC is a premature infant who rapidly progresses from mild feeding intolerance to systemic sepsis and then death within 24 hours. NEC disproportionately affects communities of color, and half of all patients will require laparotomy, which reveals patchy intestinal inflammation and necrosis. There is no specific treatment for NEC, which increases the urgency to develop novel therapies for this devastating disease.  The journey which has led me to write this proposal includes over two decades of research into NEC, including the advancement of a unifying theorem to explain NEC development, the discovery of several classes of anti-NEC agents which have been patented, and most recently, the completion as sole Editor-in- Chief of the first textbook devoted to NEC. This track record gives me a unique vantage point in which to identify the most important unanswered questions in the field, and the experience to create a plan to answer them. Prevailing thinking suggests that NEC arises from an exuberant inflammatory response to bacterial colonization in the premature intestine. In mice and human studies, I discovered that the receptor for gram negative bacterial lipopolysaccharide, namely toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), on the intestinal epithelium, is required for NEC development. TLR4 activity is higher in the premature human and mouse intestinal lining compared to the full-term intestine, which reflects TLR4's role in governing gut development. The subsequent activation of TLR4 by colonizing bacteria leads to inflammation and NEC. These observations formed the basis for my discovery of a novel class of anti-TLR4 molecules that prevent and treat NEC in mice, piglet and human tissue ex vivo. In the current proposal, we will now address four critical knowledge gaps in the field of NEC research: 1. What causes NEC and its hallmark patchy intestinal necrosis? To answer this, we will employ ssRNA-seq in mouse and human NEC tissue and human organoids to discover and then modify TLR4- dependent genetic pathways causing NEC; 2. How can we prevent NEC? We will assess the role of diet (breast milk vs. formula) and immunometabolism on the induction of inflammation in the preterm gut and then manipulate diet-induced inflammatory pathways to reduce NEC; 3. Can we predict NEC earlier? We will assess cellular and molecular maternal factors that contribute to NEC, image blood flow in the premature gut non-invasively, and develop machine learning algorithms for prediction; 4. What causes the long term complications of NEC on the lung, brain and gut? We will perform discovery arrays in humanized organoid platforms as well as mouse and piglet NEC models to identify the link between the inflamed gut and end organ injury. These studies promise to significantly advance the field of NEC, and to offer specific therapies for it. Project Narrative Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is the leading cause of death from gastrointestinal disease in premature infants, and for which there exists no effective cure. The current proposal has identified four major questions in the field of NEC which we now seek to answer, through a novel focus on identifying what causes NEC, how we can prevent NEC, how we can predict NEC, and how we can reduce the impact of NEC on causing long term complications on the brain, the gut and the lung.",Molecular and metabolic signaling in necrotizing enterocolitis,10206378,R35GM141956,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Bacteria', 'Blood flow', 'Brain', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Color', 'Communities', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Gastrointestinal Diseases', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Human Milk', 'Image', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Intestines', 'Knowledge', 'Laparotomy', 'Legal patent', 'Link', 'Lipopolysaccharides', 'Lung', 'Metabolic', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Necrosis', 'Necrotizing Enterocolitis', 'Organoids', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Premature Infant', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sepsis', 'Signal Transduction', 'TLR4 gene', 'Textbooks', 'Thinking', 'Tissues', 'Writing', 'experience', 'feeding', 'human tissue', 'inflammatory disease of the intestine', 'intestinal epithelium', 'machine learning algorithm', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'organ injury', 'prediction algorithm', 'premature', 'prevent', 'receptor']",NIGMS,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R35,2021,409375
"Predicting Relapse at the Time of Diagnosis in Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia PROJECT SUMMARY  Relapse is the major cause of cancer related mortality in children with leukemia. Despite improvements in overall survival for children with B-cell progenitor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), for the 600 patients who will relapse each year, half will die of their disease. The high mortality of patients who relapse underscores the need for improved risk prediction and treatment strategies to prevent recurrent leukemia. Current approaches to relapse prediction are limited by insufficient accuracy, delayed prediction and the inability to make actionable treatment adjustments based on prediction information. To address these limitations, we applied a single-cell, high-parameter proteomic approach to ALL patient samples at the time of diagnosis, accurately predicting future relapse based on the presence of pre-B cells with activated signaling. This approach was 38% more accurate than standard of care relapse prediction methods. We propose that identifying relapse-predictive cells in ALL at the time of diagnosis using their distinguishing proteomic and genetic features will result in a clinical risk prediction model that is accurate, immediate, and actionable. This approach to relapse prediction will change the clinical paradigm of relapse risk in ALL to reduce the incidence of relapse itself.  Using large multi-institutional, multimodal cohorts of molecularly and clinically annotated diagnostic patient samples, we will apply deep proteomic approaches to identify surface proteins uniquely expressed on relapse predictive pre-B cells enabling direct identification in a diagnosis sample. We will determine how genomic mutations associate with the presence of relapse predictive cells and examine their genomic mutational burden using single-cell exome sequencing. Finally, building on our data-driven, machine learning approaches, we will construct a diagnostic relapse predictor that is more accurate than standard of care models while informing on leukemia biology and targeted therapeutic options for patients at risk. This will enable a more precise approach to patient classification and treatment, reducing the number of children facing relapse and moving closer to precision medicine for children with ALL. PROJECT NARRATIVE Relapse remains a leading cause of death for patients with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Using single- cell studies of primary diagnosis samples from patients, we can identify cells responsible for future relapse at the time of diagnosis. Building a model of relapse risk prediction based on the presence of these cells will enable rapid, accurate, and actionable relapse prediction moving closer to the goal of preventing relapse.",Predicting Relapse at the Time of Diagnosis in Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia,10210902,R01CA251858,"['Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Automobile Driving', 'B-Cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Biology', 'CREB1 gene', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cells', 'Child', 'Childhood Leukemia', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Future', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Immunotherapeutic agent', 'Immunotherapy', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Leukemic Cell', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Oncogenic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Publishing', 'Recurrence', 'Recurrent disease', 'Relapse', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'SYK gene', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Surface', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Work', 'base', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical implementation', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'differential expression', 'exome sequencing', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'leukemia', 'mortality', 'multimodality', 'mutational status', 'novel', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'prospective test', 'prototype', 'relapse prediction', 'relapse risk', 'response', 'risk prediction', 'risk prediction model', 'standard of care', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'treatment strategy']",NCI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,615576
"Modeling Homeostasis of Human Blood Metabolites PROJECT SUMMARY  Metabolite levels in human blood are regulated by a relatively strict system of homeostatic control. Previous investigations of homeostasis have taken a number of approaches, and models of glucose and a few other metabolites have been developed, typically focused on a single organ. However, while potentially extremely useful, an accurate and quantitative model of blood metabolite levels under homeostasis does not currently exist.  It is well known that numerous demographic and clinical factors such as gender, age, BMI, smoking, etc., as well as pre-analytical factors and many diseases, significantly affect the levels of blood metabolites. Numerous studies in the field of metabolomics have attempted to account for the effects of many such factors. However, efforts to quantify these effects and validate them across different studies have so far been challenging, and resulted in consistent failures to validate discovered putative biomarkers. The challenges to integrate metabolite profiles with clinical and demographic factors are complicated by the high dimensionality of the data and the numerous correlations among the metabolites. Traditional statistical methods are incapable of accounting for these factors, and hence, investigations suffer from a high false discovery rate (FDR).  To overcome these challenges, we propose to develop quantitative statistical models of blood metabolite levels in healthy adults, and thereby produce a predictive model of homeostasis. Our preliminary work indicates that we can predict metabolite levels with much reduced variance using the reproducibly measured levels of a large pool of blood metabolites and clinical and demographic variables. We propose to develop sophisticated models of homeostasis based on advanced statistical methods and evaluate their predictive performance across different sample sets and metabolite classes.  The proposed project has four main Aims: (1) Obtain broad-based metabolomics data on blood samples collected from geographically distinct sites to explore the effects of a range of confounding effects on metabolite levels. (2) Model individual or biologically related groups of metabolite levels using multivariate statistical approaches to determine the contribution of clinical/demographic and pre-analytical variables and their predictability across collection site. (3) Investigate the interactions between metabolites and clinical/demographic variables using machine learning approaches to identify stable metabolites and key interactions. (4) Provide the community with user-friendly software packages for the prediction of blood metabolite levels under homeostasis.  An overall model of the metabolite concentrations in blood will be highly useful for a number of applications that include a better understanding of systems biology at the whole organism level, and ultimately improved risk prediction, disease diagnosis, treatment monitoring and outcomes analysis. PROJECT NARRATIVE A quantitative model of blood homeostasis based on predicting the normal levels of small molecules in the blood can help identify diseases or other stresses that cause changes to those levels. The proposed statistical methods that will be used to develop this homeostasis model have the potential to efficiently identify more reliable disease markers and to more accurately predict disease risk.",Modeling Homeostasis of Human Blood Metabolites,10159296,R01GM131491,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Body mass index', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Demographic Factors', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Evaluation', 'Failure', 'Gases', 'Gender', 'Geographic Locations', 'Geography', 'Glucose', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Ions', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metabolite Interaction', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'NMR Spectroscopy', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Smoking', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Stress', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Whole Organism', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical effect', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'data quality', 'disease diagnosis', 'disorder risk', 'improved', 'interoperability', 'lipidomics', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'multidimensional data', 'predictive modeling', 'risk prediction', 'sample collection', 'small molecule', 'software development', 'user friendly software', 'user-friendly', 'validation studies']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2021,376064
"Inferential methods for functional data from wearable devices Project Summary/Abstract This is a project to develop new statistical methods for comparing groups of subjects in terms of health outcomes that are assessed using data from wearable devices. Inexpensive wearable sensors for health monitoring are now capable of generating massive amounts of data collected longitudinally, up to months at a time. The project will develop inferential methods that can deal with the complexity of such data. A serious challenge is the presence of unmeasured time-dependent confounders (e.g., circadian and dietary patterns), making direct comparisons or borrowing strength across subjects untenable unless the studies are carried out in controlled experimental con- ditions. Generic data mining and machine learning tools have been widely used to provide predictions of health status from such data. However, such tools cannot be used for signiﬁcance testing of covariate effects, which is necessary for designing precision medicine interventions, for example, without taking the inherent model selection or the presence of the unmeasured confounders into account. To overcome these difﬁculties, a systematic de- velopment of inferential methods for functional outcome data obtained from wearable devices will be carried out. There are three speciﬁc aims: 1) Develop metrics for functional outcome data from wearable devices, 2) Develop nonparametric estimation and testing methods for activity proﬁles and a screening method for predictors of activity proﬁles, 3) Implement the methods in an R package and carry out two case studies using accelerometer data. For Aim 1, the approach is to reduce the sensor data to occupation time proﬁles (e.g., as a function of activity level), and formulate the statistical modeling in terms of these proﬁles using survival and functional data analytic meth- ods. This will have a number of advantages, the principal one being that time-dependent confounders become less problematic because the effect of differences in temporal alignment across subjects is mitigated. In addition, survival analysis methods can be applied by viewing the occupation time as a time-to-event outcome indexed by activity level. For Aim 2, nonparametric methods will be used to compare and order occupation time distributions between groups of subjects that are speciﬁed in terms of baseline covariate levels or treatment groups. Further, a new method of post-selection inference based on marginal screening for function-on-scalar regression will be developed to identify and formally test whether covariates are signiﬁcantly associated with activity proﬁles. Aim 3 will develop an R-package implementation, and as a test-bed for the proposed methods they will be applied to two Columbia-based clinical studies: to the study of physical activity in children enrolled in New York City Head Start, and to the study of experimental drugs for the treatment of mitochondrial depletion syndrome. Project Narrative The relevance of the project to public health is that it will develop statistical methods for the physiological eval- uation of patients on the basis of data collected by inexpensive wearable sensors (e.g., accelerometers). By introducing methods for the rigorous comparison of healthcare status among groups of patients observed longi- tudinally over time using such devices, treatment decisions that can beneﬁt targeted populations of patients in terms of continuously-assessed health outcomes will become possible.",Inferential methods for functional data from wearable devices,10135813,R01AG062401,"['Acceleration', 'Accelerometer', 'Beds', 'Bypass', 'Case Study', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinical Research', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dietary Practices', 'Drug Combinations', 'Enrollment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Grant', 'Head Start Program', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Healthcare', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mitochondria', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Nature', 'New York City', 'Obesity', 'Occupations', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patients', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Preschool Child', 'Process', 'Proxy', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regimen', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Stochastic Processes', 'Survival Analysis', 'Syndrome', 'Target Populations', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'circadian', 'data mining', 'design', 'experimental study', 'functional outcomes', 'indexing', 'interest', 'lower income families', 'novel', 'patient population', 'precision medicine', 'screening', 'sensor', 'theories', 'time use', 'tool', 'treatment group', 'wearable device', 'wearable sensor technology']",NIA,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2021,298890

"Software for sequencing human antibody proteins from polyclonal immune responses The natural immune response to foreign pathogens involves a complex coordination of cells, including an adaptive response to select and secrete antibodies into circulation. Individuals who have recovered from a pathogenic infection retain immune memory and continue to circulate pathogen-specific antibodies. For many infectious diseases like respiratory syncytial virus, Ebola, and poxviruses, antibodies with neutralizing activity to multiple viral strains have been discovered from human survivors. The discovered antibodies are highly valuable as potential biologic therapeutics for the broader population, as the antibodies have been naturally optimized to defend against human pathogens.  Efforts to discover antibodies from humans recovering from coronavirus infection are underway, SARS-CoV-2 in particular, but are hampered by the limitations of existing antibody discovery platforms. Current approaches require screening for live B cells actively producing pathogen-specific antibodies, which are sensitive to cell death and rarely found in blood. In contrast, antibody protein is stable and pathogen-reactive antibodies are abundant in serum. While protein is the ideal material to start with, characterization of polyclonal antibody (pAb) protein presents new challenges.  Recent advances in mass spectrometry and analysis have shown individual antibody candidates can be derived from affinity-purified pAb proteins when a sufficiently matched B-cell genetic antibody repertoire is provided. We aim to develop algorithms to supplant the need of a genetic antibody repertoire, and de novo identify antibody candidates from limited complexity pAb samples. This is achieved by improvements to de novo peptide sequencing using machine learning, and targeted assembly of specificity determining regions (CDR3s) and antibody frameworks using de Bruijn graphs. The proposed software will provide estimates of clonal diversity and candidate sequences that can be synthesized and tested for reactivity. In addition to addressing needs for infectious diseases, as demonstrated with an urgent unmet need to stop the COVID-19 pandemic, the software also applies to clinical and biomedical research needs in autoimmune disease, and commercial interests in replacing polyclonal antibody reagents with highly reproducible monoclonal antibody equivalents. The antibody repertoire circulating in serum is the most active component to an immune response, yet is unable to be directly queried without aid from the genetic antibody repertoire from cells. Our innovative algorithms enable querying and sequencing of antibodies directly from protein - opening the door to previously inaccessible autoimmune and infectious disease research and therapeutic antibody discovery.",Software for sequencing human antibody proteins from polyclonal immune responses,10140073,R44GM140607,"['2019-nCoV', 'Address', 'Affinity', 'Algorithms', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Affinity', 'Antibody Repertoire', 'Antibody Response', 'Antigens', 'Autoantibodies', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Biocompatible Materials', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Response Modifier Therapy', 'Biomedical Research', 'Blood', 'Blood Cells', 'Blood Circulation', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Cell Death', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Color', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complementarity Determining Regions', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Coronavirus', 'Coronavirus Infections', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Ebola', 'Exposure to', 'Fingerprint', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Graph', 'HIV', 'HIV Infections', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Immune response', 'Immunologic Memory', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infectious Diseases Research', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monoclonal Antibodies', 'Mus', 'Oncology', 'Oryctolagus cuniculus', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Peptide Sequence Determination', 'Peptides', 'Population', 'Poxviridae', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Rattus', 'Reagent', 'Reproducibility', 'Respiratory syncytial virus', 'Salvelinus', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Services', 'Specificity', 'Survivors', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic antibodies', 'Transcript', 'Vaccine Design', 'Viral', 'adaptive immune response', 'analytical method', 'communicable disease diagnosis', 'cost', 'digital', 'experimental study', 'human pathogen', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrumentation', 'interest', 'member', 'neoplastic cell', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'polyclonal antibody', 'proteogenomics', 'response', 'sample collection', 'screening', 'transcriptomics']",NIGMS,"DIGITAL PROTEOMICS, LLC",R44,2021,802944
"SMART NANPs: new molecular platform for communication with human immune system and modulation of therapeutic responses Principal Investigator/Program Director (Last, First, Middle): Afonin, Kirill, A  PROJECT SUMMARY  What if healthcare providers were equipped with biocompatible, biodegradable, robust, and affordable treatment options that combine therapeutic modalities with controlled mechanisms of action? What if this versatile technology had learning capacity and could be educated to recognize patient-specific diseases and interfere with their progression by redirecting fundamental cellular processes? What if the very same formulation could offer an additional means of control over patients’ immune responses and further advance favorable therapeutic outcomes with minimal toxicities? These next generation therapies would then become a game changer in helping to prevent, detect, diagnose, and treat diseases and disabilities at their source. With the support from MIRA (R35) funding, we envision a data-driven platform, SMART NANPs (specific, modular, adjustable, reproducible, and targeted nucleic acid nanoparticles), encoded by self-assembling nucleic acids. By controlling the flow of genetic information across all forms of life, nucleic acids have become instrumental in acquiring new knowledge about major cellular processes and origins of diseases. Besides their diverse biological roles, these biopolymers can be programmed into NANPs with specified physicochemical properties and functionalities that dictate NANPs’ biological actions with endless possibilities for reprogramming cellular behavior through molecular signaling. We recently discovered that different architectural parameters and compositions of NANPs, delivered to primary human immune cells, can activate monocytes and dendritic cells to produce type I and type III interferons. This pioneering work on NANPs’ immunorecognition highlighted an unforeseen clinical application for this technology in the field of vaccines and immunotherapy. A defined structure-function relationship for any given NANP would then allow conditional actuation of its immunorecognition or any other therapeutic activity through a set of embedded architectural codes. With this notion, we introduced two orthogonal concepts of therapeutic NANPs which can be conditionally activated in human cancer cells to release pre-programmed therapeutics. By uniting these breakthroughs and other preliminary findings from my lab, as highlighted in the current application, and integrating them into a unified network of SMART NANPs with programmable control of biodistribution, immunological activity, and therapeutic modules, we will advance the current repertoire of therapies against infectious diseases and cancers (through NANP-based vaccines and immunotherapies), cardiovascular diseases (through regulated coagulation by thrombin-targeting NANPs), and address drug overdose and safety issues (through the biodegradable nature of NANPs and their controlled deactivation). To maximize the successful translation of this technology, the proposed program will employ a multidisciplinary approach that spans the fields of nucleic acid nanotechnology, immunology, drug delivery, translational oncology, and machine learning. The long-term goal of this program is to elevate SMART NANPs to the level of clinical use. Principal Investigator/Program Director (Last, First, Middle): Afonin, Kirill, A PROJECT NARRATIVE  Beyond their traditionally known roles as carriers and regulators of genetic information, nucleic acids have auspiciously emerged as versatile therapies for taking advantage of cellular pathways to drive the sensing, targeting, and silencing of a variety of diseases. With MIRA support, we will explore additional nanotechnology- based therapeutic options that enlist a biocompatible nucleic acid-encoded platform (SMART NANPs) for the controlled immunostimulation and modulation of therapeutic responses. This research program aims to advance the envisioned technology towards personalized medicine and aid in addressing top public health challenges in the U.S. as they relate to cancer (through vaccines and immunotherapies), cardiovascular diseases (through regulated coagulation), and drug overdose and safety (through the biodegradable nature of the platform and its functional regulation).",SMART NANPs: new molecular platform for communication with human immune system and modulation of therapeutic responses,10086567,R35GM139587,"['Address', 'Architecture', 'Biodistribution', 'Biological', 'Biopolymers', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Coagulation Process', 'Code', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Dendritic Cells', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Formulation', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health Personnel', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunization', 'Immunologics', 'Immunology', 'Immunotherapy', 'Interferons', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Modality', 'Molecular', 'Nanotechnology', 'Nature', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Oncology', 'Overdose', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Principal Investigator', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Regulation', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Thrombin', 'Toxic effect', 'Translations', 'Vaccines', 'Work', 'base', 'biomaterial compatibility', 'cancer cell', 'cell behavior', 'clinical application', 'disability', 'genetic information', 'immunoregulation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'monocyte', 'nanoparticle', 'next generation', 'personalized medicine', 'prevent', 'programs', 'therapy outcome', 'treatment response']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA CHARLOTTE,R35,2021,141556
"Long non-coding RNA signatures to track treatment responses in multiple sclerosis ABSTRACT  Early detection of multiple sclerosis is key to limiting neurological damage but monitoring patient progression and response to therapy is of arguably similar if not greater importance due to the chronic nature of disease. Moreover, rates of non-adherence to therapy has been reported to be as high as 25% to 40% in the patient population suggesting the need to provide continuous monitoring and selection of optimal therapy. Identification of novel actionable biomarkers would provide clinicians with additional information for the purposes of diagnosis, prognosis, clinical subtyping as well as for the selection and monitoring of therapy. Initiation of sub-optimal therapy can be both detrimental to the patient’s health and financial well-being.  To date, the general approach to selecting a disease modifying treatment (DMT) is to weigh the risks and benefits while considering the aggressiveness of disease, efficacy of the drug and the potential side effects of treatment in a “trial and error” fashion. This approach is quite unsettling when understanding that treatment failure or inadequacy can cause irreversible neurological damage. Furthermore, many of these drugs are associated with serious adverse drug reactions such as cardiac events, opportunistic infections and secondary autoimmunity. Selection of the best therapy for a particular patient as well as the ability to identify if/when efficacy of a particular DMT dwindles is highly desirable and would be of great benefit throughout the healthcare spectrum. The course of MS disease does not manifest identically in all patients nor do all patients respond to treatment the same way. Identification of actionable biomarkers to serve as a surrogate for the efficacy of a particular therapy would allow clinicians to identify nonresponsive patients as early as possible and potentially evaluate dosing or administration to optimize patient outcomes.  Our previous work has explored lncRNAs as candidate biomarkers that can be measured in peripheral whole blood to accurately classify MS. The preliminary data provided in support of our fast track application highlights the potential for lncRNA expression levels analyzed with machine learning to not only classify MS but also indicate treatment responses. The emerging view by specialists that take care of patients with autoimmune diseases is that early diagnosis and early, aggressive and effective therapy is critical to produce the best long-term outcomes. This is very evident for multiple sclerosis with the goal of reducing damage to the central nervous system, producing longer and better disease remission, and mitigating long-term disability. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are newly discovered classes of RNAs with an array of regulatory functions. Our hypothesis to test is that classifiers can be built based upon differential expression of novel lncRNAs in blood. These classifiers will possess high levels of accuracy to monitor treatment responses in multiple sclerosis.",Long non-coding RNA signatures to track treatment responses in multiple sclerosis,10124273,R44AI145505,"['Adopted', 'Advocate', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmunity', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Cardiac', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Dose', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Europe', 'Event', 'Evoked Potentials', 'Exhibits', 'Expressed Sequence Tags', 'Face', 'Foundations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Human', 'Inflammatory', 'Invertebrates', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Messenger RNA', 'Monitor', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Nature', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurologist', 'Oligoclonal Bands', 'Opportunistic Infections', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Probability', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Site', 'Specialist', 'Spinal Cord', 'Suggestion', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment Failure', 'Treatment Side Effects', 'United States', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Vertebrates', 'Whole Blood', 'Work', 'adverse drug reaction', 'aggressive therapy', 'base', 'brain health', 'candidate marker', 'cell type', 'clinical subtypes', 'cohort', 'cost', 'differential expression', 'disability', 'disorder control', 'drug efficacy', 'effective therapy', 'experimental group', 'health organization', 'human disease', 'learning classifier', 'multiple sclerosis patient', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'outcome forecast', 'patient population', 'phase 2 study', 'preservation', 'response', 'treatment response']",NIAID,"IQUITY LABS, INC",R44,2021,499995
"Structural and functional tests of ganglion cell damage in glaucoma This project will use a combination of structural and functional measurements to test the hypothesis that early- stage damage in human glaucoma occurs first in the inner plexiform layer (IPL) of the retina – especially its OFF sub-lamina – as suggested by murine glaucoma models. In the first Aim, we will use a novel visible-light optical coherence tomograph (VIS OCT) to study structural changes in the retina of glaucoma patients. The newly developed VIS OCT has sufficient image contrast and resolution to segment the IPL boundaries and to define sub-lamination in volumetric OCT data, something not currently possible with existing near-infrared OCT instruments. We will make comparative measurements within the IPL and between the IPL, the ganglion cell layer (GCL) and the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL). Because data from mouse models of glaucoma suggests that early damage occurs preferentially within the OFF sub-lamina of the IPL, we will make separate VIS OCT measurements biased for the OFF- and ON-sublaminae of the IPL and use machine learning approaches to determine whether a similar damage process can be demonstrated in human. To test whether OFF-pathway function is preferentially lost in glaucoma, we will use a novel Steady-State Visual Evoked Potential (SSVEP) paradigm that employs sawtooth increments and decrements to bias the measurement to ON vs OFF pathways, respectively, a paradigm our data suggests discriminates glaucoma from control patients. The second Aim will optimize this SSVEP measurement for testing localized areas of the visual field. The third Aim will make comparative measurements of visual-field, VIS OCT and SSVEP loss patterns in a large sample of glaucoma patients and in age- and sex-matched controls. Thickness and interface reflectivity amplitude maps derived from VIS OCT imaging of the RNFL, GCL and IPL including sublaminae will be correlated topographically with visual field defects to assess the relative sensitivity of our structural biomarkers at and near visual field locations with demonstrable losses on conventional (Humphrey) perimetry. Similarly, SSVEP responses from different locations in the visual field will be correlated topographically with visual field loss patterns and to VIS OCT losses, with special emphasis on correlating structural damage in OFF vs ON sub-laminae of the IPL with the functional correlates derived from regional decremental and incremental SSVEPs. Separately and in combination, our structural and functional measurements are designed to provide strong tests of the biological hypothesis that the OFF pathway is preferentially damaged in human glaucoma, and to reveal new biomarkers for the disease. Improving visual outcomes in glaucoma will require a better understanding of the earliest sites and processes of damage and methods to measure them quickly and accurately in patients. This project will address both needs through a combination of novel Optical Coherence Tomography and electrophysiological measurements. The new imaging and electrophysiological tests that will be developed here, either separately or together, could eventually replace conventional visual field testing which is time-consuming and unreliable.",Structural and functional tests of ganglion cell damage in glaucoma,10150874,R01EY030361,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Animal Model', 'Area', 'Atrophic', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Testing', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Economic Burden', 'Electrodes', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'Frequencies', 'Ganglion Cell Layer', 'Glaucoma', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Human', 'Image', 'Inner Plexiform Layer', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Mus', 'Noise', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perimetry', 'Process', 'Property', 'Resolution', 'Retina', 'Retinal Ganglion Cells', 'Rodent Model', 'Sampling', 'Scotoma', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'Structural defect', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Visible Radiation', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual Fields', 'Visual evoked cortical potential', 'base', 'cell injury', 'comparative', 'contrast imaging', 'design', 'detection method', 'extrastriate visual cortex', 'field study', 'ganglion cell', 'improved', 'instrument', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'optic nerve disorder', 'response', 'retinal imaging', 'retinal nerve fiber layer', 'sex']",NEI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,499625
"Device to control circadian-effective light in Alzheimer's disease environments Project Summary This proposed project will develop and field-test a device that accurately monitors and controls the circadian stimulus (CS) for Alzheimer disease (AD) and Alzheimer-disease-related dementia (ADRD) patients in nursing homes. Human biology has evolved to have two distinct optical systems: the visual system, by which we see and process images, and the circadian system, which regulates our biological clock and associated biological systems. These two systems have significantly different spectral and temporal responses to optical input. Specifically, circadian stimulation peaks at 460 nm and responds after several minutes of optical activation, while the visual system peaks at 555 nm and responds nearly instantaneously to inputs. All lighting systems are designed and installed in buildings with consideration only given to the photopic (visual) system and all light meters used to characterize lighting buildings are calibrated to measure photopic light, not CS. While a broad and growing body of research has documented the impacts of the circadian system on human health, including regulating sleep and improving cognition in AD/ADRD patients, research on the CS experienced by AD/ADRD patients is extremely limited. Researchers at the Lighting Research Center at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute developed the Daysimeter, a calibrated light meter that measures circadian light and circadian stimulus. In Phase I of this project, researchers modified an existing workstation-based lighting control system they previously developed for the visual system to include Daysimeter technology, allowing this control system to record CS measurements. The accuracy of these CS measurements was confirmed in the laboratory and field-testing of 20 of devices is currently ongoing in AD/ADRD nursing homes. In this Phase II application, researchers propose adding control features to this device so that lighting can be controlled to optimize CS dosages in AD/ADRD patient environments. Machine learning-based lighting control algorithms will be driven by continuous light level and spectrum measurements as well as periodic (e.g., daily) patient health data. Data from these devices would be wirelessly transmitted to researchers via an Internet gateway and associated cloud-based data management systems. These data would be of immediate value for gaining a better understanding of AD/ADRD patients' CS exposure and could ultimately result in new lighting systems and/or building codes that consider both our visual and circadian systems. Following the development phase, 30 CS-enabled lighting control systems will be field tested over a 22-week test period. Researchers aim to commercialize this CS-enabled lighting control system shortly after the completion of this field test and the Phase II project specifically targeting AD/ADRD nursing home applications. Project Narrative A growing body of research has demonstrated how light impacts human circadian systems and how these impacts can affect sleep, alertness, cognition and agitation in people with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Alzheimer's-disease-related dementia (ADRD). Still, significant knowledge gaps exist in determining how much circadian stimulation is typically provided to AD/ADRD patients and there are no commercial products designed to control lighting in AD/ADRD environments in ways that promote circadian-related health. This project aims to fill in these gaps by developing and testing a device specifically designed to measure and control the circadian stimulation experienced by AD/ADRD patients in nursing homes.",Device to control circadian-effective light in Alzheimer's disease environments,10312690,R44AG060857,"['Affect', 'Agitation', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Biological Clocks', 'Building Codes', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Data', 'Database Management Systems', 'Development', 'Device or Instrument Development', 'Devices', 'Dose', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Feeds', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Human Biology', 'Image', 'Institutes', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'Nursing Homes', 'Optics', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Periodicity', 'Phase', 'Phototherapy', 'Planet Earth', 'Population', 'Process', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Retina', 'Rotation', 'Running', 'Sleep', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual system structure', 'Wakefulness', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'active control', 'alertness', 'appropriate dose', 'awake', 'base', 'biological systems', 'circadian', 'circadian pacemaker', 'cloud based', 'commercialization', 'design', 'dosage', 'effectiveness testing', 'experience', 'falls', 'field study', 'health data', 'improved', 'interest', 'meter', 'next generation', 'novel', 'prototype', 'residence', 'response', 'success', 'therapy design']",NIA,"ERIK PAGE AND ASSOCIATES, INC.",R44,2021,28487
"Optimizing sleep spindle measurements as translational assays of memory consolidation This research proposal addresses a key challenge to drug development: the paucity of biomarkers that reveal whether interventions affect implicated brain circuitry at early stages, in animals and humans, before embarking on lengthy and expensive clinical trials. Studies of humans and rodents have established sleep spindles, defining EEG oscillations of stage 2 non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, as a mechanism of memory consolidation. A growing body of work implicates sleep spindle abnormalities in neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders characterized by memory impairment. In schizophrenia, sleep spindle deficits predict impaired sleep- dependent memory consolidation. Findings that increasing spindles via drugs or auditory or transcranial brain stimulation during sleep improves memory in healthy people, provides the impetus to target spindles to improve memory in disorders. But targeting spindles does not inevitably improve memory. Complementary rodent and human studies provide an explanation: sleep-dependent memory consolidation relies not on spindles alone, but on their precise temporal coordination with the other two cardinal NREM sleep oscillations: cortical slow oscillations (SOs) and hippocampal sharp-wave ripples. These findings make it clear that while spindles are promising targets for improving memory, (i) effective therapies need to increase spindles AND preserve or enhance their coupling with SOs and ripples, and (ii) to evaluate efficacy, we need new assays to identify spindles that couple with SOs and ripples to mediate memory versus those that do not. We propose to: (i) identify the most powerful translational measures of sleep spindles as assays of sleep-dependent memory consolidation (UG3), and (ii) to noninvasively manipulate them to compare their responses in healthy humans and rodents (UH3). Using invasive recordings in epilepsy patients and local field potentials (LFPs) in rats, we will first demonstrate that spindles that couple with both SOs and ripples (TriCS: triple-coupled spindles) are associated with memory consolidation, thereby validating TriCS as a translational biomarker of memory. We will then use machine learning to develop a classifier that identifies TriCS based solely on their scalp EEG features. We will validate the EEG spindle classifier by applying it to a dataset from healthy humans to demonstrate that TriCS, but not non-coupled spindles, correlate with memory consolidation. In both species, we will determine which spindle assay TriCS, SO-coupled spindles (SOCS) or total spindles predicts memory best. Finally, we will noninvasively manipulate the spindle assays in humans and rats. Genetic studies are implicating specific pathophysiologic mechanisms of spindle deficits in schizophrenia and autism and identifying novel targets and treatments. The rodent and human spindle assays that we will develop will facilitate the translation of these advances to the clinic by allowing the efficient evaluation of potential interventions early in the treatment development pipeline and the identification of the most promising candidates for clinical trials. A fundamental challenge to finding effective treatments for neuropsychiatric disorders is the paucity of biomarkers that can gauge whether a potential intervention affects abnormal circuitry early in the treatment development pipeline, before embarking on expensive and lengthy clinical trials. This research proposal will develop novel physiological assays of sleep-dependent memory consolidation in humans and rodents that can be used to predict the efficacy of newly emerging treatments. These assays will enable the efficient screening and identification of treatments that can alleviate highly disabling cognitive deficits in schizophrenia.",Optimizing sleep spindle measurements as translational assays of memory consolidation,10112344,UG3MH125273,"['Acoustic Stimulation', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Animals', 'Auditory', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Clinic', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Coupled', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Early Intervention', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Epilepsy', 'Eszopiclone', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Future', 'Genetic study', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Intervention', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Memory impairment', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Polysomnography', 'Rattus', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Rodent', 'Scalp structure', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sleep', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'brain circuitry', 'clinical candidate', 'density', 'drug development', 'effective therapy', 'efficacy evaluation', 'improved', 'memory consolidation', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'non rapid eye movement', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'preservation', 'response', 'screening', 'sleep spindle', 'therapeutic target', 'therapy development']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,UG3,2021,734247
"Biomarker-Based Tools for Treatment Response Decision Support of Bladder Cancer PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Bladder cancer is a common type of cancer that can cause substantial morbidity and mortality among both men and women. Bladder cancer causes over 16,870 deaths per year in the United States with 79,030 new bladder cancer cases diagnosed in 2017. A reliable assessment of the response to neoadjuvant therapy at an early stage is vital for identifying tumors that do not respond and allowing the patient a chance of alternative treatment. We have successfully developed a computer decision support system (CDSS-T) for monitoring of bladder cancer treatment response. A quantitative image analysis tool for bladder cancer (QIBC) that quantifies the bladder gross tumor volume (GTV) and image characteristics is an important component of CDSS-T. Advanced machine learning techniques are used to merge the GTV and radiomic biomarkers into an effective predictive model. The goal of this project is to validate the effectiveness of CDSS-T as an aid to the radiologists and the oncologists in assessment of bladder cancer change as a result of treatment through pilot clinical trials. We will (1) perform a preparatory clinical trial with the clinicians at UM, which will simulate the real prospective clinical trial with high quality retrospective data, (2) deploy the QIBC and CDSS-T tools at the three collaborating clinical sites, (3) use the QIBC and CDSS-T tools at the different clinical sites in the prospective pilot clinical trial (standard clinical workflow) utilizing the decision support in parallel to the standard clinical patient care, and (4) analyze the impact of the QIBC and CDSS-T tools on the clinicians' performance in the pilot clinical trial and assess the potential impact on clinical outcome. We hypothesize that this innovative approach can improve clinicians' accuracy, consistency and efficiency in bladder GTV estimation and assessment of treatment response. To test these hypotheses, we will perform the following specific tasks: (1) to evaluate the performance of the QIBC and CDSS-T tools on cases not previously used, new to the system, for both the prediction accuracy and the automatic standalone functionality, refine and optimize the design of the user interface based on clinicians' feedback after their hands-on experience with the system to ensure its practicality and robustness, familiarize clinicians with the performance of the CDSS-T tools and the interpretation of the CDSS-T outputs as a part of user training for the prospective pilot clinical trial, (2) to optimize the QIBC and CDSS-T tools for the clinical workflow at the different clinical sites based on the site clinicians' feedback in order to operate efficiently and in a standalone mode by clinicians, (3) to record the clinicians' predicted outcomes without and with the use of the tools during the pilot clinical trials, estimate the accuracy of assessing response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in the current clinical treatment paradigm by comparing the estimated response to the histopathologically determined response after radical cystectomy, and (4) to statistically analyze the impact of the QIBC and CDSS-T tools on the performance of the clinicians in the pilot clinical trial and statistically assess the potential impact on clinical outcome. PROJECT NARRATIVE We have previously developed a computer decision support system for (CDSS-T) for monitoring of bladder cancer treatment response. If successfully deployed and utilized, CDSS-T will be a useful tool to aid clinicians in improving the accuracy and reproducibility of tumor treatment response assessment. Improving the reliability in assessment of treatment response to neoadjuvant therapy at an early stage is vital for identifying patients who do not respond to preserve their physical condition, thus allowing them to seek alternative treatment, which may reduce morbidity and improve the quality of life of patients suffering from bladder cancer. In addition, the multi-site pilot clinical trial will provide an excellent opportunity to experience the process of bringing laboratory research from bench to bedside, which will serve as a valuable guide for future development of clinically practical tools for various diseases.",Biomarker-Based Tools for Treatment Response Decision Support of Bladder Cancer,10152531,U01CA232931,"['Biological Markers', 'Bladder', 'Bladder Neoplasm', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Laboratory Research', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neoadjuvant Therapy', 'Oncologist', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Radical Cystectomy', 'Reproducibility', 'Site', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Tumor Volume', 'United States', 'Woman', 'alternative treatment', 'base', 'bench to bedside', 'cancer imaging', 'cancer type', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical development', 'clinical research site', 'design', 'effectiveness validation', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'men', 'mortality', 'outcome prediction', 'predictive modeling', 'preservation', 'prospective', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiologist', 'radiomics', 'responders and non-responders', 'response', 'support tools', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'tumor']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U01,2021,625260
"TEMPORAL DIETARY PATTERNS: DEVELOPMENT AND EVALUATION AGAINST ADIPOSITY AND METABOLIC BIOMARKERS ABSTRACT There is a growing interest in dietary patterns that capture the overall quality of diet as well as its constituent foods and nutrients. Commonly used dietary patterns are a priori diet score/index based on a set of dietary recommendations for a healthy diet (e.g., Mediterranean diet, Healthy Eating Index) or data-driven dietary patterns (e.g., prudent diet, western diet). Numerous studies have shown that those dietary patterns were related to the risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, and cancer. However, none of these dietary patterns incorporates eating behavior such as when we eat (i.e., eating time) and how often we eat (i.e. eating frequency) during a day. Since the amount of foods and nutrients consumed at one eating occasion influences the food consumption at the subsequent eating occasion and overall intake of the day, eating time and frequency are integral parts of dietary patterns. Furthermore, several lines of evidence consistently suggest that eating time and frequency as well as a meal composition play roles in body weight regulation and metabolic health and also regulate circadian rhythms, all of which may lead to metabolic dysfunctions and ultimately chronic diseases. Given a clear need to expand the dietary patterns framework and close a gap in dietary patterns methodological work, we propose to 1) develop a “temporal” dietary patterns based on temporal distribution of eating time and frequency during a day; and 2) evaluate if the identified temporal dietary patterns are associated with i) overall diet quality and nutrient intakes, ii) adiposity (e.g., BMI, waist circumference), and iii) metabolic biomarkers (e.g., insulin, HOMA-IR, LDL-cholesterol, c-reactive protein). To overcome a limitation that a conventional statistical method cannot capture multidimensional aspects of temporal dietary patterns (e.g., 24-dimensional feature vectors, multivariate dietary intake time-series data), we will use a novel approach combining nutrition and systems science—machine learning method. The Interactive Diet and Activity Tracking in AARP (IDATA) study that repeatedly collected diet, anthropometry, and blood samples from 1,021 men and women, 50-74 years old will be used. During one year, the IDATA study collected 24-hour recalls with clock time for each eating occasion, every other month (total six 24-hour recalls); measured anthropometry three times (baseline and at month 6 and 12); and collected blood twice, 6-month apart. Successful completion of our proposed study will identify temporal dietary patterns that are related to diet quality and metabolic health and validate the utility of temporal dietary patterns as a new tool for future research on diet-health relations and prevention of chronic diseases. NARRATIVE Eating behaviors and its impact on health are complex and multidimensional. The proposed study provides an excellent opportunity to develop new dietary patterns that capture eating behaviors such as when we eat and how often we eat during a day. The findings of the study about healthy eating patterns will also improve dietary recommendations by adding messages on when and how often to eat during a day.",TEMPORAL DIETARY PATTERNS: DEVELOPMENT AND EVALUATION AGAINST ADIPOSITY AND METABOLIC BIOMARKERS,10053329,R01CA226937,"['Advisory Committees', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Anthropometry', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Body Weight', 'Body mass index', 'C-reactive protein', 'Calories', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Complex', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diet', 'Diet Habits', 'Dietary Practices', 'Dietary intake', 'Dimensions', 'Eating', 'Eating Behavior', 'Energy Intake', 'Evaluation', 'Fasting', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Food', 'Frequencies', 'Health', 'Healthy Eating', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Insulin', 'Intake', 'LDL Cholesterol Lipoproteins', 'Lead', 'Macronutrients Nutrition', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediterranean Diet', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic dysfunction', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Nutrient', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevention', 'Recommendation', 'Regulation', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Science', 'Series', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Waist-Hip Ratio', 'Weight maintenance regimen', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'dietary', 'dietary guidelines', 'doubly-labeled water', 'epidemiology study', 'food consumption', 'good diet', 'improved', 'indexing', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'men', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'nutrient metabolism', 'nutrition', 'obesity risk', 'prudent diet', 'tool', 'vector', 'waist circumference', 'western diet']",NCI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,224806
"Electrophysiological Biomarkers to Optimize DBS for Depression PROJECT SUMMARY Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subcallosal cingulate (SCC) white matter is an emerging new treatment strategy for treatment resistant depression (TRD) with published studies demonstrating sustained long-term antidepressant effects in 40-60% of implanted patients. Converging evidence from positron emission tomography (PET), electroencephalography (EEG) and diffusion tractography (DTI) strongly suggests that DBS mediates its clinical benefits by direct modulation of the SCC--a key hub in an aberrant neural circuit. Despite encouraging sustained long-term effects in this notoriously difficult to treat patient population, randomized controls trials of SCC DBS and other DBS targets for TRD are now on hold as initial results failed to meet predefined clinical endpoints. While this proposal cannot address those failures directly, a clear necessary next step for effective future testing and eventual dissemination of this treatment is the need to develop brain-based biomarkers to guide lead placement and to titrate stimulation parameters during ongoing care. In the absence of such biomarkers to guide DBS use, there will continue to be variability in the implementation of clinical procedures during testing, leading to ambiguous and possibly misleading trial outcomes, and subsequent abandonment of a potentially useful treatment. To overcome these limitations, we propose to develop and test objective methods for reliable device configuration in individuals by optimizing DBS-SCC treatment with respect to human functional anatomy and key electrophysiological variables. We will leverage the capabilities of a novel bi-directional neuromodulation system (Medtronic RC+S) that allows live streaming of oscillatory activity at the site of stimulation to define novel control strategies to guide programming decisions for DBS delivery. Ongoing measurements of SCC local field potentials (LFPs) will be combined with electroencephalography (EEG) and event related potential studies (ERP) performed as part of an experimental clinical trial of subcallosal cingulate DBS for TRD to identify an oscillatory signal that (1) is sensitive to changes in frequency and current parameters at the tractography defined optimal target and (2) tracks with depression state over time. Connectome-based and machine learning approaches will be used to define the most robust network biomarker and its response characteristics. Once defined, the control policy will be tested in a second phase feasibility study where parameters for initial stimulation will be selected based on the depression brain state biomarker and adjustments made to correct drift from the predefined target signal. If successful, the data- driven model and control strategy will enable objective, rational clinical programming of DBS stimulation for depression and provide a new model and approach for target identification, stimulation initiation and long-term monitoring and management of patients receiving this treatment. . NARRATIVE The goal of this project is to refine and optimize deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subcallosal cingulate white matter for patients with treatment resistant depression. Using a newly available bi- directional neuromodulation system that allows live streaming of oscillatory activity at the site of stimulation, this study will define novel control strategies to guide programming decisions for DBS delivery providing a new evidence-based strategy for target identification, stimulation initiation and long-term monitoring and management of patients receiving this treatment.",Electrophysiological Biomarkers to Optimize DBS for Depression,9869948,UH3NS103550,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Base of the Brain', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Brain', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Data', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Devices', 'Diffusion', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Event-Related Potentials', 'Failure', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Policies', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'Randomized', 'Resistance', 'Scalp structure', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Stimulus', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'algorithm development', 'antidepressant effect', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical implementation', 'connectome', 'control trial', 'evidence base', 'follow-up', 'implantation', 'improved', 'indexing', 'live stream', 'neural circuit', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'open label', 'patient population', 'response', 'support tools', 'targeted biomarker', 'tractography', 'treatment strategy', 'treatment-resistant depression', 'white matter']",NINDS,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,UH3,2021,1367977
"Predicting Short- and Long-term Future Occurrence of Atrial Fibrillation from Single-Lead ECG in Normal Sinus Rhythm with an Explainable Deep Learning Model. Project Summary/Abstract More than 30 million individuals worldwide are diagnosed with atrial fibrillation (AF), however, another 13% of individuals with AF are left undiagnosed. People with AF have a five-fold increased risk of stroke with up to one-third of all strokes shown to be related to AF. Timely administration of appropriate preventative therapies, especially anticoagulants, can significantly decrease the complications of AF, including strokes, by 65% and mortality by 30%. Digital health technologies offer new approaches to identify individuals with undiagnosed AF, in particular paroxysmal AF (PAF), characterized by occasional episodes of limited duration, for whom a 10-second 12-lead electrocardiography (ECG) performed in the clinical setting is unlikely to overlap with an AF event. Continuous monitoring is promising, but still costly and burdensome for elderly individuals, who are at higher risk. To maximize the diagnostic yield of these technologies, we propose novel methods to predict the future occurrence of AF from a single-lead ECG during normal sinus rhythm. Only recently it was shown that it is possible to predict the future occurrence of AF from 12-lead ECGs in normal sinus rhythm collected in a clinical setting. Here, we propose to predict the occurrence of AF with commercially available single- lead ECG devices, which will enable a scalable alternative for early detection in a non-clinical setting. To achieve this goal, we will analyze retrospectively the raw single-lead ECG data of 10,000+ individuals with PAF over 14 days of monitoring. Validation work will then be carried out in a unique set of 1,718 asymptomatic individuals who participated in the prospective mSToPS clinical trial of AF screening (mean age 73), with full clinical information and co-morbidities. The three aims of this project are:  1. Compute the probability of a future AF event in the short-term for an individual in normal sinus rhythm using classic single-lead ECG features and representation learning based features.  2. Develop a method for long-term prediction of AF onset by evaluating individuals with AF detected in 1, 3, 6 and 12 months from the initial monitored period of normal sinus rhythm and by validating the algorithms using the mSToPS dataset with 3 years of clinical follow-up and annotated co-morbidities.  3. Develop a technique to provide a preliminary interpretation of representation learning features for time-series data applied to the short- and long-term prediction. This retrospective study will develop and optimize new predictive techniques from single-lead ECGs, available through consumer devices, with the goal of identifying individuals at high risk of developing AF. A future direction to build on from this study's results would include a prospective study of AF prediction using consumer single-lead ECG to improve clinical outcomes.

"Improved tailoring of depression care using customized clinical decision support PROJECT SUMMARY Treatments for mental health conditions such as unipolar depression provide modest average benefit but have wide variation between individuals and within individuals over time. Evidence-based customized treatment protocols would improve the mental health care of many people by providing treatment recommendations for individuals that take into account potential variation because of personal characteristics such as current health status, symptoms, and response to earlier treatment. Generating customized treatment protocols requires large amounts of data, such as from networks of health systems that can link electronic health records from millions of individuals. Current statistical approaches for discovering customized treatment protocols are limited in three important ways.  First, current approaches rely on scientists to select the patient characteristics to use to customize treatments instead of using data to find the patient characteristics that will lead to improved, customized care. Second, customized treatment protocols discovered with current statistical methods assume no unobserved differences between individuals who receive various treatment options. Third, investigators do not have ways to know if the available data contain enough information to discover and compare customized treatment protocols precisely enough to make clinical decisions. We will address these three limitations by developing new statistical tools for discovering customized treatment protocols using electronic health records data. Our research team has expertise and experience in statistics, epidemiology, and mental health care. We will integrate methods that have been successfully used in other settings to improve statistical approaches for discovering customized treatment protocols and address these three important limitations.  We will extend machine learning tools for selecting important pieces of information to the time-varying data structure required for discovering customized treatment protocols. We will build approaches that use available knowledge about the size of unobserved differences between groups of people who received different treatments to assess how those differences change study results. By building on the math used to estimate the sample sizes needed for precision in randomized trials with complex designs, we will develop new formulas for determining how many people with a particular condition and who took a particular drug are needed in a health system to provide enough accurate information to discover customized treatment protocols.  Using data from the electronic health records of more than 15,000 patients, we will discover customized treatment protocols for depression. By improving statistical tools and addressing current limitations, our customized treatment protocols will have immediate impact for people living with unipolar depression. The statistical tools we develop will also be useful for discovering customized treatment protocols for people with a wide variety of mental health conditions. PROJECT NARRATIVE People living with mental health conditions and their health care providers often lack evidence for making choices about numerous treatment options and they do not have evidence-based, customized treatment plans. This project will develop customized treatment plans for unipolar depression and methods to generate these plans using data from electronic health care records. This work will address current limitations in statistical methods for selecting patient characteristics for customizing treatment, assessing bias from differences between people who take different medications, and calculating how many people are needed to accurately compare customized treatment plans using data from electronic health records.",Improved tailoring of depression care using customized clinical decision support,10164627,R01MH114873,"['13 year old', 'Address', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Biometry', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Development', 'Early treatment', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiology', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Status', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Psychotherapy', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Sample Size', 'Schizophrenia', 'Scientist', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Sequential Treatment', 'Statistical Methods', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Time', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Unipolar Depression', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'care providers', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical implementation', 'data resource', 'data structure', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'electronic data', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'large scale data', 'novel', 'practice setting', 'precision medicine', 'randomized trial', 'response', 'statistics', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'treatment strategy']",NIMH,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2021,373803
"Characterization of Novel Neural Respiratory Circuit to Counter Opioid-Induced Respiratory Depression PROJECT SUMMARY We have identified a novel property of the cervical spinal cord that modulates respiratory activity, both the rate and depth of breathing, such that the respiratory drive in opioid-suppressed states in mice and humans increases during spinal cord epidural stimulation. Respiratory rates are increased upon epidural stimulation of specific cervical spinal cord locations when there is spontaneous breathing, and rhythmic breathing can be generated when the respiratory state is depressed and spontaneous breathing is absent. This is an important observation because the brainstem, which contains the rhythm-generating center for respiration, is a difficult area for surgical and therapeutic access. If there are other accessible neural regions by surgery (i.e. epidural stimulation) or non-invasive means (i.e. transcutaneous stimulation), for example in the cervical spine, that influence respiration or contain their own rhythmic respiratory elements, these may represent potential therapeutic targets to reverse opioid-induced respiratory depression. Thus, we have proposed a strategy to characterize this novel cervical respiratory circuit. First, we will conduct extensive electrical mapping of the respiratory responsive elements of the cervical spinal cord in mice aided by machine learning strategies, and we will characterize the mechanistic basis for this response, the relation to opioid receptors to the respiratory response, and identity neurons responsible for the respiratory response using optogenetic techniques. Guided by the animal studies, we will then confirm the cervical respiratory responsive loci in humans. Third, we will subject the identified respiratory competent regions to increasing doses of opioid to further characterize the dose-response profile of these regions. Fourth, we will assess the feasibility and practical translation of this strategy to reverse opioid-induced respiratory depression in three patients implanted with spinal cord stimulators. These studies will provide an anatomical and electrophysiological characterization of the respiratory circuit within the cervical spine and provide practical information for the treatment of opioid-induced respiratory depression. The results obtained, especially because they are obtained in humans, will have an immediate translational impact on our understanding of the respiratory circuit that may, in turn, prevent deaths due to opioid overdose. PROJECT NARRATIVE Opioid overdose often leads to death due to suppression of respiration; therefore, strategies to prevent respiratory depression in addition to treatment of opioid addiction are necessary to prevent deaths in the opioid-use epidemic. Respiratory suppression occurs because neurons in the brain that drive breathing are inhibited (turned off) by narcotics; thus, understanding the neural pathways for breathing will allow us to devise effective neuromodulatory strategies to treat opioid-induced respiratory depression. We have proposed to characterize a novel breathing circuit that, when activated by stimulation of the cervical spine, has the potential to be an effective treatment of opioid-induced respiratory depression, and it is our hope that findings from these studies may lead to new and more effective treatments for respiratory depression secondary to opioid overdoses.",Characterization of Novel Neural Respiratory Circuit to Counter Opioid-Induced Respiratory Depression,10176443,R01DA047637,"['Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain Stem', 'Breathing', 'Cause of Death', 'Cells', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cervical', 'Cervical spinal cord structure', 'Cervical spine', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Complex', 'Coughing', 'Depressed mood', 'Devices', 'Dorsal', 'Dose', 'Drug Implants', 'Effectiveness', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemic', 'Exposure to', 'Frequencies', 'Gases', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Hypoxia', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Monitor', 'Motor Neurons', 'Mus', 'Muscle', 'Naloxone', 'Narcotics', 'Neural Pathways', 'Neurons', 'Neurostimulation procedures of spinal cord tissue', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Opiate Addiction', 'Opioid', 'Opioid Antagonist', 'Opioid Receptor', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Periodicity', 'Pharmacology', 'Property', 'Respiration', 'Respiration Disorders', 'Respiratory Center', 'Respiratory Muscles', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Secondary to', 'Site', 'Spinal', 'Spinal Cord', 'Strenuous Exercise', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tidal Volume', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Ventilatory Depression', 'Vital Statistics', 'Work', 'base', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'experimental study', 'exposed human population', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'mu opioid receptors', 'neuroprosthesis', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid overdose', 'opioid use', 'optogenetics', 'prescription opioid', 'prevent', 'relating to nervous system', 'respiratory', 'response', 'therapeutic target', 'transcutaneous stimulation', 'translational approach', 'translational impact', 'ventilation']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2021,701059
"A System for Xerostomia Risk Classification after Head & Neck Cancer Radiotherapy Summary Radiotherapy (RT) is a major component in the treatment of most head and neck cancer (HNC) cases. During irradiation, sensitive regions such as the salivary glands can sustain injury, resulting in xerostomia (dry mouth). This side effect is common and can significantly reduce quality of life during and post-treatment. The focus of this application is prediction during treatment planning of whether patients will suffer high-grade xerostomia (NCI CTCAE Grade 2-3) at the time of their first post-treatment follow-up visit, typically 3-6 months after RT (prevalence is approximately 40%). Predictions will enable clinicians to carry out treatment planning with improved knowledge of the likelihood of high-grade xerostomia development and allow better-informed and more timely anticipation of consequences such as eating difficulty. In this Phase 1 project, Oncospace Inc. will develop a Classification and Regression Tree (CART) prediction model using over 1200 complete HNC patient records. Associations between high-grade xerostomia and a wide range of dosimetric, clinical and demographic features will be automatically discovered and the features with the strongest associations will populate the nodes of a decision tree. The terminal leaf nodes will each contain the probability of high-grade xerostomia for the subset of patients in that node. In addition, leaf nodes will be assigned binary class labels designating a high- or low risk of high-grade xerostomia. This type of model provides transparency and interpretability, which are beneficial for clinical acceptance and for demonstration of safety to regulatory agencies. The software will be built using the Microsoft Azure cloud architecture and be deployed via a Software as a Service (SaaS) model. There are three distinct aims of this project:  1. Populate Oncospace Inc.’s Microsoft Azure CosmosDB database with data licensed from Johns Hopkins  University, including steps such as patient de-identification, data curation, and additional dataset feature engineering  2. Perform CART modeling and test model accuracy, using separate training and test datasets and a variety  of performance metrics, including sensitivity, specificity, AUC, and F1-score.  3. Design a clinically acceptable risk classification strategy and a user interface (UI) to communicate model  results. Expert input from a team of UI consultants and three radiation oncologists will be an integral part  of the development, testing, and evaluation processes. The successful completion of these aims will demonstrate the clinical and commercial feasibility of a xerostomia prediction model for HNC. Further development in Phase 2 will include deeper model personalization via incorporation of advanced image features (radiomics), as well as validation of model generalizability and commercial viability via the curation and use in model building of data from other institutions. Oncospace, formed in 2018, is uniquely positioned to carry out this work as the team includes the creators of the Pinnacle radiation therapy planning system, Tomotherapy radiation treatment delivery system, and HealthMyne Quantitative Imaging Decision Support platform. Oncospace has close clinical collaboration with Johns Hopkins University (JHU) for clinical feedback, validation and initial deployment. Oncospace has licensed three patents and subscription to complete patient treatment records for over 6,000 radiation oncology patients from JHU. The company has won the Microsoft Innovation Acceleration Award for its innovative platform to deliver AI-enabled healthcare solutions to the radiation oncology community. Page 1 of 1 Narrative During standard-of-care radiotherapy for head and neck cancer, the salivary glands often sustain radiation- induced injury leading to xerostomia (dry mouth). Machine learning-based predictions can be used to help create treatment plans that minimize the chance of severe xerostomia, and to better anticipate and manage its occurrence.

"Development of quantitative tools to predict patients with difficult intubation to minimize treatment related complications ABSTRACT Endotracheal mouth/nose breathing need 10% this to performing subjective poorly standard Unfortunately, these airway examination systems in clinical practice perform only modestly, with sensitivities of 20-62%, specificities of 82-97%, and very low positive predictive values, generally less than 30%, unless very liberal definitions of difficulty are used. There are likely a number of reasons for this poor performance, including the relative rarity of difficult intubation, the multifactorial etiology and varying definition of difficult intubation, inter-observer variability in test results, failure to validate potential systems in patients independent of those used to derive the test, and the inadequacy of the tests themselves. intubation (EI) is a common medical procedure in which a plastic tube is introduced via the into the trachea, to provide respiratory support during general anesthesia or to ameliorate difficulty in cases of respiratory failure, cardiac arrest, or other forms of critical illness. The global for EI is likely at least 150 million based on the WHO estimate of surgical need worldwide. Approximately  of EI attempts are difficult, and approximately 1/2000 are deemed impossible. The clinica l significance of “can't intubate, can't ventilate” scenario is extremely important: 25% of anesthetic related deaths are due airway mishaps. Patients are typically assessed for anatomic features that might predict difficulty in EI prior to the procedure. In practice, anesthesiologists and other airway experts likely weigh other factors in anticipating a difficult airway, including habitus, facial appearance, and perhaps other understood hunches.

"Creating an adaptive screening tool for detecting neurocognitive deficits and psychopathology across the lifespan Efforts to include behavioral measures in large-scale studies as envisioned by precision medicine are hampered by the time and expertise required. Paper-and-pencil tests currently dominating clinical assessment and neuropsychological testing are plainly unfeasible. The NIH Toolbox contains many computerized tests and clinical assessment tools varying in feasibility. Unique in the Toolbox is the Penn Computerized Neurocognitive Battery (CNB), which contains 14 tests that take one hour to administer. CNB has been validated with functional neuroimaging and in multiple normative and clinical populations across the lifespan worldwide, and is freely available for research. Clinical assessment tools are usually devoted to specific disorders, and scales vary in their concentration on symptoms that are disorder specific. We have developed a broad assessment tool (GOASSESS), which currently takes about one hour to administer. These instruments were constructed, optimized and validated with classical psychometric test theory (CTT), and are efficient as CTT allows. However, genomic studies require even more time-efficient tools that can be applied massively.  Novel approaches, based on item response theory (IRT) can vastly enhance efficiency of testing and clinical assessment. IRT shifts the emphasis from the test to the items composing it by estimating item parameters such as “difficulty” and “discrimination” within ranges of general trait levels. IRT helps shorten the length of administration without compromising data quality, and for many domains leads to computer adaptive testing (CAT) that further optimizes tests to individual abilities. We propose to develop and validate adaptive versions of the CNB and GOASSESS, resulting in a neurocognitive and clinical screener that, using machine learning tools, will be continually optimized, becoming shorter and more precise as it is deployed. The tool will be in the Toolbox available in the public domain. We have item-level information to perform IRT analyses on existing data and use this information to develop CAT implementations and generate item pools for adaptive testing. Our Specific Aims are: 1. Use available itemwise data on the Penn CNB and the GOASSESS and add new tests and items to generate item pools for extending scope while abbreviating tests using IRT-CAT and other methods. The current item pool will be augmented to allow large selection of items during CAT administration and add clinical items to GOASSESS. New items will be calibrated through crowdsourcing. 2. Produce a modular CAT version of a neurocognitive and clinical assessment battery that covers major RDoC domains and a full range of psychiatric symptoms. We have implemented this procedure on some CNB tests and clinical scales and will apply similar procedures to remaining and new tests as appropriate. 3. Validate the CAT version in 100 individuals with psychosis spectrum disorders (PS), 100 with depression/anxiety disorders (DA), and 100 healthy controls (HC). We will use this dataset to implement and test data mining algorithms that optimize prediction of specific outcomes. All tests, algorithms and normative data will be in the toolbox.

"Biomarkers of Alcoholic Hepatitis Abstract Our overarching goal is to develop minimally invasive approaches to better predict outcome and novel mechanisms in alcoholic hepatitis (AH). AH is characterized by acute hepatic decompensation and multiple organ failure. Although supportive care for AH has improved, short-term mortality has largely remained unchanged (30-40%) for decades. Effective approaches to predict risk hamper the treatment of AH. The hepatic extracellular matrix (ECM) responds dynamically to organ injury and ECM turnover increases; we propose to take advantage of this to develop new biomarkers for AH. The peptidome, low molecular weight peptides in biologic fluids, includes not only synthesized peptides, but fragments of degraded proteins (i.e., ‘degradome’). We hypothesize that the ECM degradome in plasma will yield new biomarkers to predict outcome and mechanisms in AH. We will test this hypothesis via the following Specific Aims: 1). To identify key changes in the peptidome as predictive biomarkers of outcome in AH. Unbiased peptidomics and multivariate analyses will identify degradomic features independently linked to prognosis. Protease activity that could produce significantly changed peptides will be predicted using Proteasix. We will also determine the mechanistic role of ECM turnover in the in parallel established models of alcohol-induced liver injury. 2) To develop probabilistic graphical models to predict outcome in AH. Whereas we expect the results of Aim 1 to establish that the peptidome profile in patients correlates with overall outcome, biomarkers alone are often insufficient to accurately predict individual patient outcome. We will therefore employ machine learning methods like probabilistic graphical models (PGMs) over mixed data types to integrate peptidomic and individual patient clinical data, into a single probabilistic graphical framework. The resulting graphs will then be used to infer causal interactions between variables, select informative biomarkers that will more specifically predict the outcome, and gain new mechanistic insight into the biology of AH (hypothesis generation). 3) To validate the use of the peptidome as a predictive tool for determining outcome in AH. Using a large prospectively-designed patient cohort with established outcomes, we will test the ability of the algorithms and biomarkers generated in this study to predict outcome. The successful completion of the proposed work will produce significant results at various levels: (1) Biomarker discovery: we will identify biomarkers and conditional biomarkers for AH prognosis. (2) Mechanistic understanding of AH: our models will generate hypotheses about the interactions between variables at different scales (molecular, individual) that will provide insights on the proteins that are involved in AH. (3) Algorithm development: through this project we will extend our mixed data graph learning algorithms to include censored variables (i.e., survival data). As a result of the above, this project is likely to yield novel diagnostic tools for AH that may also translate to other liver diseases. Narrative Alcoholic hepatitis (AH) is a severe acute form of alcoholic liver disease with a very high mortality rate. Despite years of research, the standard-of-care and mortality rate has not changed dramatically in over 50 years. Our goal is to develop new computational and experimental methods and discover new biomarkers for AH outcome that can efficiently identify at-risk individuals. A second goal of the project is to identify molecular mechanisms of AH, which could be targeted therapeutically.",Biomarkers of Alcoholic Hepatitis,10170180,R01AA028436,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Alcoholic Hepatitis', 'Alcoholic Liver Diseases', 'Alcohols', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Cells', 'Clinical Data', 'Collagen', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Extracellular Matrix Proteins', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Health', 'Hepatic', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Injury', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Liver Fibrosis', 'Liver diseases', 'Matrix Metalloproteinases', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Weight', 'Multiple Organ Failure', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Peptide Fragments', 'Peptide Hydrolases', 'Peptides', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Process', 'Production', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Protease Inhibitor', 'Protein Fragment', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Supportive care', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Work', 'acute liver injury', 'algorithm development', 'biomarker discovery', 'chronic alcohol ingestion', 'cohort', 'design', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'interest', 'learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'minimally invasive', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'organ injury', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'predictive marker', 'predictive tools', 'profiles in patients', 'prospective', 'standard of care', 'targeted treatment', 'tool']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2021,600979
"Flexible Piezoelectric Array for Cardiovascular MonitoringDuring Cardiac Arrest Project Summary In situations of out of hospital cardiac arrest, it is critical to quickly detect the performance of adequate cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) through clinically acceptable pulse rate and blood pressure (BP). However, the detection of adequate CPR can be difficult for someone not trained in first aid. Currently the standard for measuring BP noninvasively is using cuff-based oscillometeric approaches. Attempts at developing these into wearable devices for automated and continuous measurements have proven difficult and so researchers have looked at other methods. However, these methods have not met the criteria for flexibility, accuracy, and low power consumption. This project aims to develop a flexible patch for accurate detection of pulse rate and blood pressure superficially through the radial, brachial, carotid, and/or femoral arteries. Piezoelectric polymers, are inherently flexible and have been used in many applications for pressure sensing, offering great potential for use as a patch-like sensor for monitoring of cardiovascular function. However, in the standard form, the material is not sensitive enough to accurately detect blood pressure. In our lab we have developed a core-shell nanofiber structure of conductive and piezoelectric nanofibers, respectively. The core-shell nanostructure shows a 4.5 times improvement in pressure sensitivity when compared to standard piezoelectric nanofibers and a nearly 40 times improvement when compared to piezoelectric polymer thin films. This improvement in pressure sensitivity should allow for a wearable device composed of these materials to exceed the necessary 35 dB signal to noise ratio required for the accurate detection of pulse wave velocity, a cardiovascular parameter used to determine blood pressure. Coupled with inkjet printing patterning techniques of conductive polymers developed in our lab, we propose to fabricate a novel core-shell nanofiber piezoelectric array in a wearable patch form for cardiovascular monitoring. In order to test this piezoelectric array and develop data-driven algorithms for the detection of blood pressure, testing will occur on a controllable simulated cardiovascular system capable of replicating a human’s diastolic and systolic blood pressures, pulse rates, and arterial mechanical properties. The blood pressure attainable by the simulated system falls within the AAMI standard benchmark for accuracy and precision for noninvasive blood pressure monitoring of 5 ± 8 mmHg. We will train various regression models using the data generated from this system to relate the detected pulse wave velocities to blood pressure and we will compare the outcomes to commonly used correlation equations. We propose that the fabrication methods we will develop, when coupled together with data-driven algorithms, will allow for the development of a low- power, flexible patch, capable of detecting pulse rate and blood pressure, giving feedback on the adequacy of CPR. Project Narrative This project plans to develop a patch-like sensor for detecting cardiovascular signals including pulse rate and blood pressure for situations of out of hospital cardiac arrest. The proposed research couples a novel core-shell piezoelectric nanostructure with an inkjet printing method for fabricating flexible arrays, to create a new class of wearable patch-like sensors for cardiovascular monitoring. Testing these sensors on a controllable simulated cardiovascular system, will allow for the development of data-driven algorithms to improve the accuracy of these devices, leading to highly accurate, patch-like cardiovascular sensing.",Flexible Piezoelectric Array for Cardiovascular MonitoringDuring Cardiac Arrest,10288237,R21EB032056,"['Algorithms', 'Arteries', 'Benchmarking', 'Biosensing Techniques', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood Pressure Monitors', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation', 'Cardiovascular Physiology', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Carotid Arteries', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Consumption', 'Coupled', 'Couples', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Device Designs', 'Devices', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electrodes', 'Equation', 'Feedback', 'Film', 'First Aid', 'Goals', 'Harvest', 'Heart Arrest', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Ink', 'Liquid substance', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Nanostructures', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Photoplethysmography', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Polymers', 'Printing', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Pulse Pressure', 'Pulse Rates', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin', 'Sphygmomanometers', 'Structure', 'Sulfur', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'brachial artery', 'detection method', 'falls', 'femoral artery', 'first responder', 'flexibility', 'human subject', 'improved', 'mechanical properties', 'nanofiber', 'novel', 'out-of-hospital cardiac arrest', 'polyvinylidene fluoride', 'pressure', 'pressure sensor', 'pulse pressure wave', 'radial artery', 'random forest', 'sensor', 'spatiotemporal', 'standard measure', 'wearable device']",NIBIB,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R21,2021,232061
"Assessment of ultrasound features of knee osteoarthritis in a population-based community cohort Project summary Our long-term goal is to demonstrate the utility of ultrasound for OA assessment, standardize its acquisition and scoring, and promote increased uptake of US for use in clinical, research, and trial settings. Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) is highly prevalent and frequently debilitating. Development of potential treatments has been hampered by the heterogenous nature of this common chronic condition, which is characterized by a number of subgroups, or phenotypes, with different underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. Imaging, genetics, biochemical biomarkers, and other features can be used to characterize phenotypes, but variations in data types can make it difficult to harmonize definitions. While radiography is widely used in KOA imaging, it is limited in its ability to assess early disease (when interventions are most likely to succeed) and is insensitive to change. Ultrasound (US) is a widely accessible, time-efficient and cost-effective imaging modality that can provide detailed and reliable information about all joint tissues (e.g., cartilage, meniscus, synovium, bone), and could therefore inform phenotypes in KOA (e.g., by presence of synovitis, effusion, cartilage damage, calcium crystal deposition, and popliteal cysts). Use of US is currently limited by the lack of systematically performed studies in well-characterized non-clinical populations. To address this gap and further the use of this advantageous imaging modality for KOA, we will obtain standardized US and radiography in the population- based Johnston County Health Study (JoCoHS), the new enrollment phase of the 25+ year Johnston County OA Project which includes white, African American, and Hispanic men and women aged 35-70, to achieve three aims. In Aim 1, we will determine the population prevalence (n~3000) of knee US features including cartilage and meniscal damage, synovitis/effusion, calcium crystal deposition, popliteal cysts and osteophytes overall and in key subgroups by age, sex, race/ethnicity, and symptom status. Aim 2 will allow quantification of the associations between these US features and radiographic findings and symptom scores overall and in key subgroups (e.g., those with and without radiographic KOA, by sex, by race/ethnicity). For Aim 3, we will apply novel machine learning methodologies (e.g., Direction-projection-permutation [DiProPerm] hypothesis testing, Joint and Individual Variation [JIVE], and Distance-Weighted Discrimination [DWD]) to a) develop an overall US score for symptomatic KOA and b) identify the contribution of US variables to phenotypes relevant to KOA based on general health, physical activity, and functional assessments. This study is a crucial step to establish the foundation for US as an assessment tool for clinical use, research, and clinical trials in KOA, providing unique population-based cross-sectional data regarding the utility of US and forming the basis for future longitudinal work evaluating its value and performance characteristics related to incident and progressive KOA. Project narrative Osteoarthritis is an enormous and increasing public health problem that, like many other chronic conditions, is not a single disease but a heterogeneous condition consisting of multiple subgroups, or phenotypes, with differing underlying mechanisms. Ultrasound is an accessible, time-efficient, and cost-effective imaging modality that provides invaluable data about all joint tissues involved in osteoarthritis and has the potential to identify important phenotypes. The proposed work is relevant to the NIAMS mission and represents a crucial step to establish the foundation for ultrasound as an assessment tool for use in clinics, research, and clinical trials in osteoarthritis.",Assessment of ultrasound features of knee osteoarthritis in a population-based community cohort,10158441,R01AR077060,"['Address', 'African American', 'Age', 'Area', 'Assessment tool', 'Bilateral', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Markers', 'Bone Spur', 'Calcium', 'Cartilage', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Claustrophobias', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Assessment Tool', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communities', 'County', 'Crystal Formation', 'Crystallization', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Development', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Etiology', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hispanics', 'Image', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Knee', 'Knee Osteoarthritis', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Meniscus structure of joint', 'Methodology', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Musculoskeletal', 'National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physical activity', 'Popliteal Cyst', 'Population', 'Population Study', 'Prevalence', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Sex Differences', 'Specialist', 'Standardization', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Synovial Membrane', 'Synovitis', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Ultrasonography', 'Variant', 'Woman', 'Work', 'aged', 'base', 'bone', 'cohort', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'effusion', 'follow-up', 'imaging genetics', 'imaging modality', 'individual variation', 'interest', 'men', 'novel', 'point of care', 'population based', 'recruit', 'rheumatologist', 'sex', 'uptake']",NIAMS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2021,331837
"COVID-19 detection through scent analysis with a compact GC device Recent studies, including ours, have suggested that breath may allow us to diagnose COVID-19 infection and even monitor its progress. As compared to immunological and genetic based methods using sample media like blood, nasopharyngeal swab, and saliva, breath analysis is non-invasive, simple, safe, and inexpensive; it allows a nearly infinite amount of sample volume and can be used at the point-of-care for rapid detection. Fundamentally, breath also provides critical metabolomics information regarding how human body responds to virus infection and medical intervention (such as drug treatment and mechanical ventilation). The objectives of the proposed SCENT project are: (1) to refine automated, portable, high-performance micro-gas chromatography (GC) device and related data analysis / biomarker identification algorithms for rapid (5-6 minutes), in-situ, and sensitive (down to ppt) breath analysis and (2) to conduct breath analysis on up to 760 patients, and identify and validate the COVID-19 biomarkers in breath. Thus, in coordination with the RADx-rad Data Coordination Center (DCC), we will complete the following specific aims. (1) Refine 5 automated micro-GC devices to achieve higher speed and better separation capability. We will construct 5 new automated and portable one-dimensional micro-GC devices that require only ~6 minutes of assay time (improved from current 20 minutes) at the ppt level sensitivity (Sub-Aim 1a). Then the devices will be upgraded to 2-dimensional micro-GC to significantly increase the separation capability (Sub-Aim 1b). In the meantime, we will optimize and automate our existing data processing and biomarker identification algorithms and codes to streamline the workflow so that the GC device can automatically process and analyze the data without human intervention (Sub-Aim 1c). (2) Identify breath biomarkers that distinguish COVID-19 positive (symptomatic and asymptomatic) and negative patients. We will recruit a training cohort of 380 participants, including 190 COVID-19 positive patients (95 symptomatic and 95 asymptomatic) and 190 COVID-19 negative patients from two hospitals (Michigan Medicine – Ann Arbor and the Henry Ford Hospital – Detroit). We will conduct breath analysis using machine learning to identify VOC patterns that match each COVID-19 diagnostic status. (3) Validate the COVID-19 biomarkers using our refined micro-GC devices. Using the refined 2-D micro-GC devices from Sub-Aim 1b, we will recruit a new validation cohort of 380 participants (190 COVID-19 positive patients and 190 COVID-19 negative patients) to validate the biomarkers identified in Aim 2.  We will leverage existing engineering, data science, clinical, regulatory, and commercialization resources throughout the project to hit our milestones, ensuring a high likelihood of rapid patient impact. Upon completion of this work, we will have a portable micro-GC device and accompanying automated algorithms that can detect and monitor COVID-19 status for people in a variety of clinical and community settings. Narrative  Our team of engineers, clinicians, and data scientists has developed a portable, high performance breath analyzer that can be used to detect certain diseases. In this project, we will adapt and refine our existing device and algorithms so they can be used for rapid, safe, and non- invasive COVID-19 detection. People will simply breath into the device and it will quickly provide results, meaning that it can be used in a variety of everyday settings to help fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.",COVID-19 detection through scent analysis with a compact GC device,10266206,U18TR003812,"['Acute', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biotechnology', 'Blood', 'Breath Tests', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 detection', 'COVID-19 diagnosis', 'COVID-19 diagnostic', 'COVID-19 monitoring', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'COVID-19 patient', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Coordinating Center', 'Data Science', 'Data Scientist', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Gas Chromatography', 'Genetic', 'Health', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Human body', 'Immunologics', 'In Situ', 'Institutes', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Intervention', 'Licensing', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Monitor', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Process', 'Production', 'RADx Radical', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Respiratory Failure', 'SARS-CoV-2 infection', 'SARS-CoV-2 negative', 'SARS-CoV-2 positive', 'Saliva', 'Sampling', 'Savings', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Speed', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Virus Diseases', 'Work', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'biomarker identification', 'cohort', 'commercialization', 'community setting', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'design', 'fight against', 'fighting', 'global health', 'improved', 'metabolomics', 'multidisciplinary', 'nasopharyngeal swab', 'outcome forecast', 'pandemic disease', 'point of care', 'portability', 'rapid detection', 'recruit', 'respiratory hypoxia', 'screening', 'severe COVID-19', 'two-dimensional']",NCATS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U18,2021,999775
"An Unobtrusive Continuous Cuff-less Blood Pressure Monitor for Nocturnal Hypertension PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The objective of this project is to create an unobtrusive, wrist-worn, cuff-less blood pressure monitor for measurement and identification of nocturnal nondipping hypertension. The investigation includes extensive validation with state-of-the-art ambulatory blood pressure monitors at nighttime in presence of heterogeneous treatment paradigms. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is one of the major causes of ailments worldwide. Hypertension alone affects one in three adults according to the World Health Organization. Therefore, monitoring blood pressure has become a critical part of healthcare as it is known to be linked to many CVDs. Traditionally, clinical practitioners have relied on the mercury-based (or digital equivalent) inflatable cuff-based sphygmomanometer. However, the nature of the device allows for only infrequent measurements and its somewhat invasive nature and associated discomfort prohibits additional nocturnal measurements. There is certainly a value to measuring blood pressure continuously in the natural context of the user’s environment, in particular during sleep, without being disturbed by the instrument. Our proposed technology can provide a wealth of information to physicians, help identify certain short-term dynamics/variations of blood pressure, and allow effective monitoring of response to medication, among other things. Nocturnal measurements provide additional prognostic value in identifying risk. Despite these benefits, no wearable, non-invasive device for continuous blood pressure monitoring exists on the market simply because none have been reliable enough to be considered clinical grade. This project aims to develop a robust and reliable blood pressure monitor in the form of a wrist-worn device that uses bio-impedance sensors, and for the first time, demonstrate clinical grade reliability. These sensors measure pulse wave velocity (PWV) along with several other derivatives for cardiovascular parameters including heart rate and blood volume changes in arteries, which correlate with the blood pressure. The system will incorporate clever hardware design to localize underlying vasculature and focus on arterial sites for enhanced accuracy. The device will include a motion sensor to take into account the user’s movements and motion artifacts, the contact quality, and reliability of the measurements. Advanced machine learning techniques, leveraging both general and personalized models, will be developed to convert bio-impedance measurements to blood pressure. This project aims to then validate the system and analytics in both a healthy patient cohort and a hypertensive cohort, learning the impact that nocturnal ‘nondipping’ hypertension and anti-hypertensive treatments have on PWV/other cardiovascular correlates and blood pressure estimates. After decades of relying on the inflatable cuff- based technique, this system could represent a significant change in how we measure blood pressure. PROJECT NARRATIVE Continuous monitoring of nocturnal blood pressure can help early diagnosis of developing cardiac conditions, reveal short term blood pressure variations, and also help the physician monitor differences in variations in response to medication for hypertensive patients. Moreover, the comfort and convenience of a wearable monitor would allow measurement in the natural context of daily life, including important nocturnal measurements, and reduce the burden of adherence on the user. The system will also provide feedback on quality of measurements to allow the users or care-givers to gauge reliability.",An Unobtrusive Continuous Cuff-less Blood Pressure Monitor for Nocturnal Hypertension,10166912,R01HL151240,"['Adherence', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring', 'Antihypertensive Agents', 'Arteries', 'Awareness', 'Biometry', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood Pressure Monitors', 'Blood Volume', 'Blood flow', 'Calibration', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caregivers', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Environment', 'FDA approved', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Rate', 'Home environment', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Investigation', 'Learning', 'Legal patent', 'Life', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mercury', 'Methods', 'Microfabrication', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Nature', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Participant', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Penetration', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiology', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Proxy', 'Reading', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Skin', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Deprivation', 'Sphygmomanometers', 'Structural Models', 'Supine Position', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'Wrist', 'advanced analytics', 'analytical method', 'arterial stiffness', 'base', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'design', 'digital', 'effectiveness validation', 'electric impedance', 'insight', 'instrument', 'model development', 'monitoring device', 'motion sensor', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'patient stratification', 'patient subsets', 'performance tests', 'prognostic value', 'response', 'sensor', 'sex', 'sleep position', 'supine sleep', 'wearable device', 'wearable sensor technology', 'willingness']",NHLBI,TEXAS ENGINEERING EXPERIMENT STATION,R01,2021,678001
"Photoplethysmography Analysis to Assess Cardio-Cerebrovascular Impact of Sleep Project Summary Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is common in the aging population and is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular (CV) disease, including cerebrovascular injury. Repetitive exposure to acute CV response, such as sympathetic surge and blood pressure (BP) rise following obstructive respiratory events, is an important mediating mechanism linking OSA to CV disease and cerebrovascular injury. However, such acute CV responses are not effectively captured by conventional polysomnography metrics, such as the apnea hypopnea index (AHI) commonly used in OSA evaluation. This results in imprecise classification of patients in terms of their CV risk and may be responsible for inconsistent results in epidemiologic and clinical studies. More importantly, the uncertainty of the effectiveness of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy in reducing the CV risk poses a significant challenge in therapeutic decision-making in older individuals. Therefore, the identification of additional phenotypic markers that better quantify the unfavorable CV effects of OSA and provide improved prediction of CV outcomes is crucial to improving risk stratification and clinical therapeutic decision-making. Herein, we propose to study novel physiologic measurements that can readily be retrieved from a single photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor and investigate whether PPG features are associated with markers of subclinical, clinical CV disease, and cerebrovascular injury. We will extract PPG features from polysomnography obtained in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) Sleep study and examine whether PPG features are associated with CV outcomes, including left ventricular mass, aortic stiffness, and incident cardiovascular events, as well as markers of cerebrovascular injury, including brain structural abnormalities by MRI and cognitive impairment by Cognitive Abilities Screening Instrument in the older men and women. We will compare the association of PPG features with these outcomes with that of conventional OSA assessment metrics (such as apnea hypopnea index). The main PPG feature of interest is slope transit time. To assess the utility of the various PPG features for use in estimating and classifying outcomes, we will use novel machine learning methods, such as are based on the GNOSIS (Generalized Networks for the Optimal Synthesis of Information Systems) information-theory-based modeling tool. Subsequently, we will determine how PPG features predict BP treatment response to CPAP and O2 therapy using data from the HeartBEAT randomized controlled trial. This study attempts to identify novel PSG metrics that are cardiovascular-centric and to assess their clinical utility in the older adults. The findings of the study will provide a basis for further development of a simpler method by which to assess and monitor OSA. Considering the high prevalence of OSA in older populations, coupled with its impact on adverse health outcomes, the proposal has significant public health implications. Project Narrative Currently used conventional metrics for sleep apnea assessment has many limitations including insufficient consideration of acute cardiovascular response to sleep apnea event. We propose to study a novel physiologic measurements that can be readily retrieved from a single photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor and investigate whether they are associated with markers of subclinical, clinical CVD and neurocognitive outcomes. We will use data from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) Sleep study to evaluate PPG features in their associations with outcomes and examine whether these features help identify people who respond better to CPAP therapy in terms of blood pressure in the Heart Biomarker Evaluation in Apnea Treatment (HeartBEAT) randomized controlled trial data.",Photoplethysmography Analysis to Assess Cardio-Cerebrovascular Impact of Sleep,10266835,R21AG070576,"['Acute', 'Apnea', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biomedical Research', 'Blood Pressure', 'Brain', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular Physiology', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Continuous Positive Airway Pressure', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Frequencies', 'Health', 'Heart', 'High Prevalence', 'Hour', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Information Systems', 'Information Theory', 'Injury', 'Investigation', 'Left Ventricular Mass', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis', 'Neurocognitive', 'Obstructive Sleep Apnea', 'Older Population', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Oxygen', 'Patients', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Photoplethysmography', 'Physiologic Monitoring', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Polysomnography', 'Public Health', 'Pulse Oximetry', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Risk', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Apnea Syndromes', 'Structural defect', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Work', 'aging population', 'arm', 'base', 'biomarker evaluation', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'cerebrovascular', 'clinical practice', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'epidemiology study', 'improved', 'indexing', 'instrument', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'older men', 'older women', 'phenotypic biomarker', 'predicting response', 'prospective', 'respiratory', 'response', 'risk stratification', 'screening', 'sensor', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'white matter']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R21,2021,273213
"Acoustofluidic Separation of Placental Nanovesicle Subpopulations in Obstetrical Diseases The placenta is essential for fetal development and growth, maternal homeostasis, and broadly, pregnancy health. Yet, our ability to non-invasively probe placental health during human pregnancy is hampered by its deep intrauterine location and its highly vascular composition, rendering the placenta largely inaccessibly for safe and dynamic investigation. Whereas placental research has been advanced by cell culture, ex vivo systems, animal models, and postpartum analyses, these indirect approaches provide ex post facto information about placental health. Placental imaging has revolutionized the field of placental medicine, but resolution at the molecular, cellular, or metabolic level remains limited. To address these challenges, we and others have focused on the release of extracellular vesicles (EVs) from placental trophoblasts, which, in humans, are directly bathed in maternal blood. We focused on exosomes (now termed small EVs or sEVs), microvesicles, and apoptotic blebs, which are continuously and abundantly released from trophoblasts into the maternal circulation and are accessible throughout pregnancy by peripheral blood tests. Among these EVs, we focus mainly on placental sEVs, which harbor messages that are seldom expressed by any other cell types and execute unique placental biological functions, such as an antiviral response. While informative, recent data indicate that sEVs are not a uniform population of vesicles, but comprise several subgroups, defined as large sEVs, small sEVs, and exomeres. In addition to their size, these sEV subtypes are characterized by distinctive cargo. Although the recent discovery of sEV subpopulations has excited researchers due to their potential to revolutionize the field of non-invasive diagnostics, sEV subpopulations have yet to be utilized in clinical settings. This is largely due to the difficulties associated with separation and isolation the nano-sized sEV subpopulations. Our group has now developed advanced acoustofluidic technologies designed to effectively, reproducibly, and rapidly isolate sEVs from blood. We show that we can separate placental sEVs into their specific subpopulations, which has not been previously accomplished. Our proposed investigation therefore focuses on the production of human placental sEV subpopulations, along with their RNA and proteome cargo. We posit that, by profiling these analytes from sEV subpopulations, we can illuminate a unique landscape of bioactive molecules that are relevant to placental health. To reduce data complexity, we propose a machine learning pipeline that will be used to probe the sub-sEV spectra during normal and pathological pregnancies. Further, we will improve our ability to purify sEV subpopulations from lipoproteins, and generate a single, integrated device that can reliably separate vesicles in real time across human gestation. We believe that our automated acoustofluidic approach to separating sEV subpopulations in a high-yield, biocompatible manner is critical to unlocking the clinical utility of sEVs. Insights gained from our investigation will improve non-invasive diagnostics during pregnancy and may uncover new targets for personalized placental therapeutics. Our proposal centers on the discovery and analysis of previously unrecognized nanovesicle subpopulations that are produced by placental cells and are released to the maternal-fetal circulation. By studying these nanovesicle subpopulations in health and diseases of human pregnancy and by innovating new technologies to efficiently, rapidly, and reproducibly purify these nanovesicles from the blood and other biological media, we enable pioneering tools to interrogate the placenta in real time and improve clinical care during pregnancy.",Acoustofluidic Separation of Placental Nanovesicle Subpopulations in Obstetrical Diseases,10099051,R01HD103727,"['Address', 'Animal Model', 'Antiviral Response', 'Apoptotic', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Blood', 'Blood Circulation', 'Blood Tests', 'Blood Vessels', 'Bulla', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Culture Media', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Discipline of obstetrics', 'Disease', 'Fetal Development', 'Fetal Growth Retardation', 'Field Flow Fractionation', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Genomics', 'Glean', 'Grant', 'Growth Factor', 'Growth and Development function', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Homeostasis', 'Hormones', 'Human', 'Image', 'Inherited', 'Injury', 'Investigation', 'Lipoproteins', 'Location', 'MLLT2 gene', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuscripts', 'Maternal-Fetal Exchange', 'Medicine', 'Metabolic', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Nature', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Physiological', 'Placenta', 'Placenta Diseases', 'Placental Biology', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postpartum Period', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Pregnancy', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'RNA', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Subgroup', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Ultrasonography', 'Uterus', 'Vesicle', 'Woman', 'bioinformatics tool', 'biomaterial compatibility', 'cell type', 'clinical care', 'clinically relevant', 'design', 'differential expression', 'epigenomics', 'exosome', 'extracellular vesicles', 'fetal', 'first responder', 'human disease', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'liquid biopsy', 'microvesicles', 'molecular diagnostics', 'nanosized', 'nanovesicle', 'new technology', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'novel', 'peripheral blood', 'response', 'tool', 'trait', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'trophoblast', 'vesicular release']",NICHD,MAGEE-WOMEN'S RES INST AND FOUNDATION,R01,2021,542123
"1/2 Leveraging electronic health records for pharmacogenomics of psychiatric disorders Schizophrenia (SCZ) and major depressive disorder (MDD) are highly heritable, debilitating diseases with lifetime prevalences of ~1% and 15%, respectively. Both disorders carry substantial morbidity and mortality and are associated with severe societal and personal costs. Despite the availability of efficacious treatments for both disorders, ~1/3 of individuals will not achieve symptomatic improvement even after multiple rounds of medication. Identifying individuals at greater risk for such treatment nonresponse, or treatment resistance, could facilitate more targeted interventions for these individuals.  A burgeoning literature has identified genomic variation associated with treatment response. IN particular, antidepressant response has been suggested to be highly heritable; convergent data from rodent studies likewise suggest that antipsychotic and antidepressant response phenotypes are influenced by genetic variation. However, treatment studies to date have had minimal success in identifying variants associated with psychotropic response, likely as a result of limited sample sizes: prior efforts required sequential treatment trials and prospective assessment to characterize outcomes. Longitudinal electronic health records (EHR) data provide an opportunity to efficiently characterize treatment response in many individuals in real-world settings. Coupled with large and expanding biobanks, these cohorts allow for low- cost, large-scale genomic studies that finally achieve sufficient power to detect realistic effect sizes.  The investigators now propose to apply these approaches to the EHRs of two large regional health systems, each linked to a large biobank, to investigate treatment resistance in SCZ and MDD. They will apply canonical indicators of treatment resistance - clozapine treatment for SCZ, and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) for MDD - to identify coded and uncoded clinical features associated with high probability of treatment resistance in EHR data. These predictors will themselves provide a useful baseline for identifying high risk individuals. Then, they will apply these to study the entire affected population of each biobank, extending existing genomic data with additional genome-wide association, yielding more than 26,000 antidepressant-treated individuals and 2,500 antipsychotic-treated individuals. Rather than simply conducting a case-control study, they will examine treatment resistance as a quantitative trait, applying a method developed by the investigators and shown to substantially increase power for such traits.  The project combines expertise in clinical informatics, machine learning, and analysis of large scale genomics, as well as domain-specific expertise in psychiatric treatment resistance. Spanning two distinct health systems, the algorithms and methods developed have maximal portability, facilitating next- step investigations. Successful identification of risk variants will facilitate efforts at clinical risk stratification as well as investigation of the biology underlying treatment resistance. Public Health Statement Despite the availability of effective treatments for schizophrenia and major depressive disorder, around 1/3 of individuals will not have symptomatic improvement after multiple treatment trials. If individuals at high risk for treatment resistance could be identified early, it might be possible to find more effective treatments for them. In particular, this study seeks to use electronic health records and biobanks to identify genomic variation associated with treatment resistance.",1/2 Leveraging electronic health records for pharmacogenomics of psychiatric disorders,10064583,R01MH116270,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Biology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clozapine', 'Code', 'Consumption', 'Coupled', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Development', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Electroconvulsive Therapy', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Functional disorder', 'General Hospitals', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heritability', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Massachusetts', 'Measures', 'Medical Genetics', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Outcome', 'Patient Triage', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Pharmacology', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Probability', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Psychiatry', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sequential Treatment', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Suicide attempt', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Treatment Failure', 'Treatment Step', 'Treatment outcome', 'Variant', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'algorithmic methodologies', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomedical resource', 'clinical predictors', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'cost', 'design', 'determinants of treatment resistance', 'effective therapy', 'efficacious treatment', 'genetic association', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic data', 'genomic predictors', 'genomic variation', 'high risk', 'improved', 'in silico', 'mortality', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'personalized intervention', 'portability', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'response', 'risk stratification', 'risk variant', 'success', 'symptomatic improvement', 'therapy resistant', 'trait', 'treatment response', 'treatment risk', 'treatment strategy', 'treatment trial']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2021,421250
"Multi-atlas and whole body radiomics approaches for image-guided treatment of gynecologic cancers ABSTRACT  Gynecologic cancers are among the leading causes of cancer death in women worldwide. These patients typically are socioeconomically disadvantaged, with poor access to screening and vaccination. Consequently, they often present with locoregionally advanced disease, for which pelvic radiotherapy (RT) with concurrent cisplatin (i.e., chemoradiotherapy) is the standard of care. This treatment is limited, however, by high rates of treatment failure. Intensifying treatment through the delivery of chemotherapy doublets, either concurrently or as adjuvant therapy following chemoradiotherapy, is a promising strategy to improve outcomes. However, the delivery of intensive chemotherapy is complicated by high rates of gastrointestinal and hematologic toxicity. Strategies to reduce toxicity while increasing efficacy of chemoradiotherapy are needed.  Standard pelvic RT techniques encompass large volumes of normal tissue including bowel, bone marrow, bone, bladder, and rectum, leading to preventable radiation-induced toxicity. Image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT) can improve target localization and dosimetry, optimizing target dose while minimizing dose to surrounding normal tissues. However, IGRT can be highly resource intensive, and comparative effectiveness trials have been lacking. For this reason, there is considerable controversy as to the utility of IG-IMRT in this disease. Our research group has been at the forefront of developing novel, cost-effective IGRT approaches with wide potential to facilitate better delivery of concurrent and/or adjuvant chemotherapy.  Previously we have found that radiation-induced injury to hematopoietically active bone marrow is a critical determinant of tolerance to intensive chemotherapy. Using machine learning methods, we recently developed a multi-atlas-based IGRT method that can predict canonical distributions of active bone marrow, which can obviate the need for positron emission tomography (PET) in settings where this technology is unavailable or unaffordable. The proposed new research will study the ability of multi-atlas-based IGRT to reduce hematologic toxicity and improve chemotherapy delivery compared to standard treatment, using data from 450 patients enrolled to a randomized phase III trial (NRG-GY006). Furthermore, we will use serial whole body PET/CT to study the impact of radiation dose and chemotherapy intensity on the compensatory hematopoietic response, and have developed novel whole body radiomics biomarkers to quantify the inflammatory state, which we hypothesize can influence patients' outcomes and tolerance to chemotherapy.  The new research extends our work associated with a current R01 grant (1R01CA197059-01) to conduct correlative science associated with the GY006 trial. The overarching goal of this research line is to augment the therapeutic ratio of chemoradiotherapy for pelvic cancers using advanced image-guided radiation techniques. If successful, this research would significantly alter the approach to the treatment of many pelvic malignancies for which chemoradiotherapy is standard. PROJECT NARRATIVE In this study, we will test the ability of a novel method called multi-atlas-based image guided radiation therapy (IGRT) to reduce acute hematologic toxicity and improve chemotherapy delivery compared to conventional RT, which could obviate the need for expensive functional imaging in socioeconomically disadvantaged and resource constrained populations, such as patients with gynecologic cancers. In addition, we will use serial positron emission tomography to study effects of chemotherapy and radiation on the subacute compensatory hematopoietic response, and will seek to develop and validate novel whole body radiomics models of the inflammatory state as predictive biomarkers for gynecologic cancers. We are in an optimal situation to conduct impactful and innovative research in the context of an ongoing phase III cooperative group randomized registration trial (NRG GY006), affording us the opportunity to conduct rigorous correlative science on a large sample with high data quality, quality assurance, and carefully controlled treatment effects.",Multi-atlas and whole body radiomics approaches for image-guided treatment of gynecologic cancers,10108128,R01CA255780,"['Acute', 'Adjuvant Chemotherapy', 'Adjuvant Therapy', 'Aftercare', 'Aging', 'Atlases', 'Biological Markers', 'Bladder', 'Bone Marrow', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cessation of life', 'Chemotherapy and/or radiation', 'Cisplatin', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Disease', 'Distant', 'Dose', 'Effectiveness', 'Enrollment', 'Functional Imaging', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hematology', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic', 'Inflammatory', 'Injury', 'Intensity-Modulated Radiotherapy', 'Intestines', 'Malignant Female Reproductive System Neoplasm', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neck', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patient Selection', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pelvic Cancer', 'Pelvis', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Predictive Factor', 'Process', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation therapy', 'Randomized', 'Rectum', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Site', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Treatment Failure', 'Treatment outcome', 'Triapine', 'Vaccination', 'Woman', 'Work', 'advanced disease', 'base', 'bone', 'chemoradiation', 'chemotherapy', 'comparative effectiveness trial', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'data quality', 'dosimetry', 'fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography', 'gastrointestinal', 'image guided', 'image guided radiation therapy', 'image-guided radiation', 'imaging approach', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'phase III trial', 'predictive marker', 'quality assurance', 'radiation-induced injury', 'radiomics', 'recruit', 'response', 'screening', 'socioeconomic disadvantage', 'standard care', 'standard of care', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'trial design', 'whole body imaging']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2021,276286

"Design and Evaluation of a Decision Support Engine for Advanced Treatment of Type 1 Diabetes Project Summary Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a disease characterized by pancreatic beta destruction with subsequent insulin depletion. The alterations in glucose dynamics are incredibly difficult to manage and are confounded by meals, exercise, menstruation, and stress. Although automated insulin delivery systems are becoming commercially available, the large majority of people with T1D are treated with multiple daily injections of insulin (MDI). Dangerous complications of hypoglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis can occur from failure to dose insulin correctly, however vigilant adherence to tedious insulin dosing strategies are difficult for MDI users maintain. This difficulty is magnified during exercise, which is critical to ameliorating long-term complications of diabetes; even when guidelines for insulin dosage adjustments are followed, acute hypoglycemia during exercise and night-time hypoglycemia can occur. In our recent survey of 1400 subjects living with T1D, the majority of subjects on MDI therapy were not confident in managing their glucose during exercise and felt they lacked tools to do so. In aggregate, difficult treatment schedules and bolus calculations, associated acute complications from daily activities, and the emotional and psychological toll of this chronic disease can result in treatment non-adherence and poor glycemic outcomes. Therefore, there is a critical need for decision support tools designed for MDI users to improve glycemic control surrounding meals, daily activities and exercise. The goal of this proposal to develop a decision support tool for patients with type 1 diabetes who utilize continuous glucose monitoring systems and multiple daily injection therapy. This tool will be called miTREAT, the multiple injection treatment recommender system for exercise-aware therapies. We hypothesize that use of a novel decision support tool equipped with content-based collaborative filtering methods and dynamic exercise hypoglycemia prediction algorithms will improve overall euglycemia and reduce time spent in hypoglycemia for patients on MDI therapy. In our first aim, we will leverage decades of research in computer science recommender systems and machine learning optimization strategies to develop a novel decision support system that identifies issues in glycemic control and recommends appropriate insulin dose and behavioral modifications. In our second aim, we will develop a new exercise model that reflects both the dynamics of rapid-uptake of glucose through GLUT-4 channels and the longitudinal biphasic insulin sensitivity profile. This new model structure will be used to predict hypoglycemia during and after the exercise period. In our third aim, we will explore the performance of our decision support engine in an in-vivo clinical trial. This clinical trial will assess the usability of a new smart-phone app designed to assist MDI users that we have developed at OHSU. In achieving these goals, we will develop the first decision support system that provides treatment and behavioral recommendations to patients on CGM-augmented MDI therapy. This system will improve overall time in euglycemia, and reduce the occurrence of acute complications surrounding exercise. Project Narrative Type 1 Diabetes is difficult to manage through multiple daily injections, and there is a paucity of tools available to assist patients with treatment decisions. In this proposal, the fields of computer science, machine learning, constrained optimization and clinical science are united to develop a novel decision support tool for multiple daily injection users. This is accomplished in three parts: 1) we will tune a decision support system to correctly identify issues in patient glycemic control and recommend appropriate treatment modifications; 2) we will develop a new hypoglycemia prediction tool that reflects the longitudinal dynamics of glucose uptake during and after exercise; and 3) we will explore the performance of this decision support system and hypoglycemia prediction tool in a clinical trial.",Design and Evaluation of a Decision Support Engine for Advanced Treatment of Type 1 Diabetes,10126842,F31DK121436,"['Acute', 'Adherence', 'Adult', 'Aerobic Exercise', 'Assimilations', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Bolus Infusion', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Clinical Trials', 'Closure by clamp', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Cross-Over Trials', 'Cutaneous', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Diabetic Ketoacidosis', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Emotional', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Exercise Physiology', 'Failure', 'Fright', 'Glucose', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Hypoglycemia', 'Infusion procedures', 'Injection of therapeutic agent', 'Injections', 'Insulin', 'Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Mediating', 'Medical Technology', 'Menstruation', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Outcome Study', 'Output', 'Pancreas', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pilot Projects', 'Plant Roots', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recurrence', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Running', 'SLC2A1 gene', 'Site', 'Stress', 'Structural Models', 'Study Subject', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Telephone', 'Time', 'Tracer', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Trust', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'base', 'blood glucose regulation', 'computer science', 'design', 'diabetes management', 'dosage', 'e-commerce', 'euglycemia', 'exercise intensity', 'glucose disposal', 'glucose monitor', 'glucose uptake', 'glycemic control', 'heuristics', 'human subject', 'improved', 'in silico', 'in vivo', 'insulin sensitivity', 'mathematical model', 'novel', 'prediction algorithm', 'prevent', 'primary outcome', 'psychologic', 'resistance exercise', 'response', 'secondary outcome', 'smartphone Application', 'standard of care', 'support tools', 'tool', 'usability']",NIDDK,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,F31,2021,51036
"Structural, Biochemical and Functional Connectivity in Osteoarthritis using Quantitative Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Skeletal Biomechanics Osteoarthritis (OA), a multifactorial disease that causes joint degeneration, affects 27 million U.S. adults, and often leads to severe disability. The prevalence of OA is 33.6% in adults older than 65 years. Despite the fact that OA is a widespread and debilitating disease, treatment options are currently extremely limited, and established disease-modifying therapies do not exist. The solution generally offered to treat late stage, symptomatic knee OA is joint replacement (total knee/hip arthroplasty, TKA/THA), and while this surgically invasive and expensive remedy offers temporary relief, replacements often fail after 10-15 years, with shorter life spans in obese individuals. In order to reduce the number of TKA/THA procedures, preventive efforts and interventions targeting early stage OA are essential – the first step would be identifying subjects at high risk for disease development, at a stage when tissue is not yet lost, and cartilage matrix abnormalities are potentially reversible. Understanding the complex pathophysiology of joint degeneration, knee and hip joint interactions, impact of gait biomechanics, are all critical to determine the mechanistic basis of hip OA.  Hip OA progression marked by changes in cartilage biochemistry has complex multi-joint interactions with several mechanistic factors, including morphological features, gait biomechanics and demographics. However, studies to date have mostly focused on the relationship between single mechanistic factors and semi-quantitative/ quantitative imaging measures, gait biomechanics, or non-objective symptomatic evidence of hip OA. The overall goal of this competitive renewal is to extend our longitudinal work to determine the structure-function-connectivity and mechanistic factors that mediate biochemical degeneration of hip cartilage associated with OA progression over the mid-term (6-8-year) period.  In this proposal, subjects will be recruited for a longitudinal study (covering 5-8 year follow up) from our existing cohort (n=184 hips, 92 subjects), with the availability of existing 3-year follow-up data including bi- lateral hip radiographs and MR images, gait biomechanics and patient reported outcomes. We will use novel, fully automated and translational methods to measure MRI-based T1ρ and T2 relaxation time on a voxel basis, which will provide precise and localized information on cartilage proteoglycan and collagen integrity and water content. Automatic segmentation techniques combined with machine learning algorithms will be used to analyze cartilage T1ρ/T2 in a well-characterized dataset with quantifiable T1ρ/T2 values on a voxel-level, and to automatically detect the patterns of focal T1ρ/T2 elevations that lead to later stage OA and drive progression of degenerative disease (over 8 years). Detailed analysis of gait biomechanics using functional principal component analysis will utilize the rich skeletal biomechanics data and imaging (over 8 years). Imaging the knee and hip longitudinally will provide a multi-joint analysis of OA progression (over 4 years) not done previously and will provide unique insights in the mechanisms in hip OA, connections with knee changes. Osteoarthritis (OA), a multifactorial disease and understanding the complex pathophysiology of joint degeneration, knee and hip joint interactions, and the impact of gait biomechanics, are all critical to determine the mechanistic basis of hip OA. In this proposal subjects will be recruited for a longitudinal study (covering 5-8 year follow up) from our existing cohort and we will use novel, fully automated and translational methods to measure MRI-based measures of cartilage degeneration and determine the role of gait biomechanics on disease progression.","Structural, Biochemical and Functional Connectivity in Osteoarthritis using Quantitative Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Skeletal Biomechanics",10317687,R01AR069006,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'American', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemistry', 'Biomechanics', 'Cartilage', 'Cartilage Matrix', 'Collagen', 'Complex', 'Contralateral', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Degenerative Disorder', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Financial Hardship', 'Functional disorder', 'Gait', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Health', 'Hip Joint', 'Hip Osteoarthritis', 'Hip region structure', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Ipsilateral', 'Joints', 'Kinetics', 'Knee', 'Knee Osteoarthritis', 'Knee joint', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Limb structure', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Motivation', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pain', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Prevalence', 'Preventive', 'Preventive treatment', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Procedures', 'Progress Reports', 'Proteoglycan', 'Relaxation', 'Replacement Arthroplasty', 'Reporting', 'Role', 'Rotation', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Water', 'Work', 'automated segmentation', 'base', 'bone', 'cartilage degradation', 'cohort', 'demographics', 'disability', 'disorder risk', 'follow-up', 'functional outcomes', 'gait examination', 'high risk', 'hip replacement arthroplasty', 'innovation', 'insight', 'joint destruction', 'kinematics', 'knee replacement arthroplasty', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multidimensional data', 'novel', 'obese person', 'quantitative imaging', 'rate of change', 'recruit', 'skeletal']",NIAMS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2021,709418
"Mitochondrial regulation of stress reactivity in humans Chronic dysregulation of physiological systems manifests systemically as allostatic load (AL) and in abnormal stress reactivity profiles, which are features of psychopathological conditions that increase future disease risk. But the biological basis underlying inter-individual differences in stress regulation and reactivity remains unknown. Even among populations of healthy individuals exposed to standardized laboratory challenges, such as the Trier social stress test (TSST), there are substantial differences in the magnitude of responses in multiple physiological systems, including but not limited to the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, the autonomic nervous system (ANS) and cardiovascular system, metabolic changes, and immune and pro-inflammatory systems. One common factor to all stress systems is their dependence on energy supply, which fuels every aspect of the stress response including molecular, cellular, systemic and cognitive/psychological functioning. At the cellular level, energy is provided by mitochondria, unique organelles that populate the cell cytoplasm and contain their own genome, the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), that is essential to mitochondrial health. MtDNA defects cause dysregulation of multiple aspects of mitochondrial structure and function, known as mitochondrial allostatic load (MAL). Three main lines of evidence suggest that MAL contributes to AL and regulates stress responses in humans: i) we recently discovered that the mtDNA is released following psychological stress in humans (PNEC 2019), ii) experimentally-induced MAL in animals caused specific alterations in the multisystem physiological responses to psychological stress (PNAS 2015), and iii) mitochondria are the source of stress hormones, including cortisol that is synthesized in mitochondria within the adrenal glands (Nat Genetics 2012). Together, this evidence suggests that MAL may alter both baseline AL and stress reactivity profiles, potentially providing new insight into the source of interindividual differences in stress regulation and health in general. In this project, we perform the first comprehensive assessment of MAL, systemic AL, multisystem stress reactivity to a laboratory challenge (TSST) in three groups of individuals who have rare genetic mtDNA defects that selectively causes different forms of MAL and in a healthy control group. Multisystem stress biomarker profiling under fasting baseline and stress reactive conditions will provide a comprehensive test of pathways linking MAL to stress physiology in humans. The resulting high-dimensionality data will be treated using integrative data analytic approaches and classifying algorithms, including cross-validated machine learning models, to identify resting and stress-reactive biomarker signatures responsive to MAL. In parallel, assessments of executive function and key domains of psychosocial functioning including mood, stress, anxiety, depressive symptoms, and well-being will contribute to provide a comprehensive picture of novel mitochondrial psychobiological pathways. NARRATIVE There are large unexplained inter-individual differences in systemic allostatic load and stress reactivity, which may in part be explained by mitochondria. Here we study the effects of chronic dysregulation of mitochondrial function – mitochondrial allostatic load (MAL) – on multisystem stress regulation in humans. This project will establish the influence of MAL on baseline AL as well as multisystem stress reactivity profiles, defining novel psychobiological pathways by which mitochondria may contribute to the maintenance of health and resilience, and to disease risk.",Mitochondrial regulation of stress reactivity in humans,10145795,R01MH122706,"['Adrenal Glands', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Anxiety', 'Autonomic nervous system', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Blood', 'Blood Pressure', 'Brain', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Catecholamines', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cognitive', 'Control Groups', 'Cytoplasm', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Defect', 'Dependence', 'Disease', 'Disease Pathway', 'Energy Supply', 'Esthesia', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Fasting', 'Fatigue', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Galvanic Skin Response', 'Gatekeeping', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Glucocorticoids', 'Hair', 'Health', 'Heart', 'Hematology', 'Hormones', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Hydrocortisone', 'Hypothalamic structure', 'IL6 gene', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Inflammatory', 'Inherited', 'Laboratories', 'Leukocytes', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Mitochondria', 'Mitochondrial DNA', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'Mus', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neuropsychology', 'Neurosecretory Systems', 'Organelles', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Pituitary Gland', 'Ploidies', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychological Stress', 'Psychophysiology', 'Psychosocial Factor', 'Recovery', 'Regulation', 'Respiratory Chain', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Saliva', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Standardization', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Trier Social Stress Test', 'allostatic load', 'base', 'biological adaptation to stress', 'biomarker signature', 'cognitive function', 'cytokine', 'depressive symptoms', 'disorder risk', 'epigenome', 'executive function', 'experience', 'heart rate variability', 'hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis', 'indexing', 'insight', 'instrument', 'mouse model', 'multidimensional data', 'negative affect', 'negative mood', 'novel', 'personalized predictions', 'pre-clinical', 'preclinical study', 'psychobiologic', 'psychologic', 'psychosocial', 'resilience', 'respiratory', 'response', 'stress reactivity', 'trait', 'urinary']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2021,764882
"Blood and Urine Biomarkers for Predicting Long-Term Adverse Kidney and Cardiovascular Outcomes after Cardiac Surgery PROJECT SUMMARY In the United States over 500,000 cardiac surgeries are performed annually. Postoperative acute kidney injury (AKI) occurs in ~20% of cardiac surgical patients. Several cohort and registry studies have reported that AKI defined by rise in serum creatinine after cardiac surgery associates with development of chronic kidney disease and cardiovascular events. However, it is unclear which patients will develop long-term adverse kidney events, adverse cardiovascular events, or both. In recent years blood and urine AKI biomarkers have been identified that reflect different aspects of AKI biology and that detect serum creatinine defined AKI earlier than rise in serum creatinine or detect subclinical AKI that is not revealed by traditional serum creatinine assessment. Clinical outcomes and biomarker research has focused mainly on detecting cardiac surgery- associated AKI itself, but not on predicting which patients are at greatest risk for long-term adverse kidney and cardiovascular outcomes after AKI. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that perioperative blood and urine AKI biomarkers significantly associate with increased long-term (2 to 5 years) postoperative major adverse kidney events (MAKE) and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). MAKE is defined as the composite of dialysis, death, renal hospitalization, or ≥ 30 day postoperative eGFR decline >25% from preoperative baseline. MACE is defined as the composite of death or hospitalizations for heart failure, myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization, arrhythmia, or stroke. We propose a prospective observational cohort study of 610 patients undergoing cardiac surgery at UT Southwestern Medical Center who will be followed for a minimum of 2 years and up to 5 years following cardiac surgery. Based on preliminary data we will assess plasma NT-pro- B-type natriuretic peptide, plasma intact fibroblast growth factor 23, serum cystatin C, urine TIMP-2*IGFBP7, and urine Kidney Injury Molecule-1 AKI biomarkers preoperatively and at 5 postoperative time points. This proposal will address three specific aims: 1) To determine the association between in-hospital AKI biomarkers and occurrence of MAKE during long-term follow-up; 2) To determine the association between in-hospital AKI biomarkers and occurrence of MACE during long-term follow-up; and 3) To develop clinical prediction models for long-term MAKE and MACE after cardiac surgery. In addition to traditional regression modeling, we will use machine learning that leverages detailed perioperative data including time-varying intraoperative and intensive care unit clinical data and blood and urine AKI biomarker data to create high performing prediction models. Our proposal is significant because knowing what blood and urine AKI biomarkers and clinical parameters accurately predict long-term major adverse kidney and cardiovascular outcomes after cardiac surgery provides the foundation for clinical trials that will identify effective short and long-term interventions for patients at highest risk. Our proposal is innovative because clinical and biomarker data has not been leveraged in this way to predict long-term MAKE and MACE after cardiac surgery. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because combining blood and urine acute kidney injury biomarkers and clinical data to identify cardiac surgical patients at highest risk for long-term major adverse kidney and cardiovascular outcomes will allow interventional studies to better individualize clinical management to prevent these outcomes. While acute kidney injury after cardiac surgery is associated with increased long-term adverse kidney and cardiovascular outcomes (~25% incidence), it remains unclear which patients with postoperative acute kidney injury are at highest risk. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the NIH's mission to develop fundamental knowledge that can be applied to enhancing health, lengthening life, and reducing illness and disability.",Blood and Urine Biomarkers for Predicting Long-Term Adverse Kidney and Cardiovascular Outcomes after Cardiac Surgery,10161608,R01HL148448,"['Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Address', 'Anesthesiology', 'Angiotensin Receptor', 'Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Applications Grants', 'Arrhythmia', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Brain natriuretic peptide', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Surgery procedures', 'Cardiac rehabilitation', 'Cardiology', 'Cardiopulmonary Bypass', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cohort Studies', 'Computational Science', 'Coronary', 'Creatinine', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Dose', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Foxes', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Incidence', 'Information Systems', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Intraoperative Care', 'Kidney', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Longterm Follow-up', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Nephrology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Perioperative', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Plasma', 'Postoperative Period', 'Prospective Studies', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Questionnaires', 'Records', 'Registries', 'Regression Analysis', 'Renal function', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'Source', 'Stroke', 'Time', 'Transfusion', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Urine', 'base', 'biobank', 'clinical biomarkers', 'cohort', 'design', 'disability', 'fibroblast growth factor 23', 'health record', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'post gamma-globulins', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'rat KIM-1 protein']",NHLBI,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,787916
"AUDITORY NEURAL FUNCTION IN IMPLANTED PATIENTS WITH USHER SYNDROME PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Usher syndrome (USH) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by hearing loss, visual impairment, and in some cases, vestibular dysfunction. It is the leading cause of hereditary deaf-blindness in humans. USH causes extensive degeneration in the cochlear nerve (CN), especially in CN fibers innervating the base of the cochlea. Whereas there is no treatment for arresting this degenerative process or for restoring visual loss, the restoration of auditory input is possible with cochlear implantation. Due to the progressive deterioration in vision, using visual cues for communication will eventually become impossible. Therefore, the importance of optimizing auditory inputs through cochlear implants (CIs) for patients with USH is paramount. However, patients with USH have much higher rates of neurological, mental, or behavioral disorders than the general CI patient population, which limits their ability to provide reliable behavioral responses or sufficient verbal descriptions of their auditory perception, especially for pediatric patients. In addition, optimal programming parameters for CI users with CN damage differ from those used in typical CI users due to declined CN responsiveness to electrical stimulation. As a result, the clinical programming process in implanted patients with USH can be extremely challenging. To date, auditory neural encoding of electrical stimulation in patients with USH has not been systematically evaluated. Consequently, the field lacks evidence-based practice guidelines for managing implanted patients with USH. For patients who cannot provide reliable feedback, clinicians rely on a “trial-and-error” approach for adjusting CI programming settings, which ultimately may not result in appropriate programming maps for individual patients. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop objective clinical tools for optimizing CI settings for these patients. As the first step toward developing evidence-based practice for managing patients with USH, this study evaluates local neural health, as well as the neural encoding of temporal and spectral cues at the CN in implanted patients with USH. Aim 1 will determine local CN health in patients with USH by assessing the sensitivity of the electrically evoked compound action potential to changes in interphase gap and pulse polarity. Aim 2 will determine group differences in neural encoding of temporal and spectral cues at the CN between patients with USH and patients with idiopathic hearing loss. Aim 3 will use supervised machine learning techniques to develop an objective tool for assessing the electrode-neuron interface at individual electrode locations. Results of this study have high scientific significance because they will establish how CN degeneration affects neural encoding and processing of electrical stimulation, and identify tests that distinguish the loss of spiral ganglion neurons from the loss of peripheral axons. Results of this study also have high clinical significance because they will 1) lay the groundwork for developing effective, evidence-based clinical practice guidelines for managing patients with USH, and 2) yield an objective tool for assessing the site-specific electrode-neuron interface in all CI users, which is foundational for creating optimal programming maps for individual patients. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed study is relevant to public health because it aims to better understand neural encoding and processing of electrical stimulation in patients with Usher syndrome (USH) – an autosomal recessive disorder that is the leading cause of hereditary deaf-blindness. Results from this study will have a broad impact on the field by 1) establishing how cochlear nerve degeneration affects neural encoding and processing of electrical stimulation, 2) identifying tests that distinctly evaluate the loss in the spiral ganglion cells vs the loss in the peripheral axon, and 3) yielding an objective tool for assessing the site-specific electrode-neural interface in all cochlear implant users. Results from this study will also have a targeted impact on implanted patients with USH by laying the groundwork for developing an effective, evidence-based clinical practice for managing these patients. This project is relevant to the mission of NIH because it seeks fundamental knowledge about the nature of electrical hearing in patients with USH and strives to apply this knowledge to reduce disability in all patients with cochlear implants.",AUDITORY NEURAL FUNCTION IN IMPLANTED PATIENTS WITH USHER SYNDROME,10192995,R21DC019458,"['Accounting', 'Action Potentials', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Auditory', 'Auditory Perception', 'Auditory system', 'Axon', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Blindness', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Practice Guideline', 'Cochlea', 'Cochlear Implants', 'Cochlear Nerve', 'Cochlear implant procedure', 'Communication', 'Cues', 'Data Set', 'Degenerative Disorder', 'Deterioration', 'Disease', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electrodes', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Evidence based practice', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Gap Junctions', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hearing', 'Human', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Interphase', 'Knowledge', 'Location', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Nerve Fibers', 'Neurons', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Play', 'Practice Management', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Recovery of Function', 'Refractory', 'Research', 'Retinitis Pigmentosa', 'Sensorineural Hearing Loss', 'Site', 'Speech', 'Speech Perception', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Usher Syndrome', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual impairment', 'axonal degeneration', 'base', 'behavioral response', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'clinically significant', 'comorbidity', 'daily functioning', 'deaf', 'disability', 'evidence base', 'evidence based guidelines', 'ganglion cell', 'hearing impairment', 'histological studies', 'individual patient', 'model development', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuron loss', 'patient population', 'pediatric patients', 'point of care', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'restoration', 'spiral ganglion', 'supervised learning', 'temporal measurement', 'tool']",NIDCD,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,R21,2021,196406
"Defining the Pathogenesis and Prognosis of Human Acute Interstitial Nephritis Acute interstitial nephritis (AIN), resulting from drug exposure, infection or autoimmune disease, is the cause of acute kidney injury (AKI) in up to 20% of patients who undergo a kidney biopsy. Even though we currently have 2 clinical interventions available to treat patients with AIN (withdrawal of the offending drug and corticosteroids), 40-60% of patients with AIN go on to develop chronic kidney disease (CKD) even when appropriately treated. Kidney damage in AIN is believed to result from immune-mediated tubular injury that eventually leads to fibrosis and permanent kidney damage.  The recent dileniation of the immune underpinnings of multiple autoimmune diseases and cancers has led to the development of targeted therapies that exhibit improved efficacy and less toxicity compared to corticosteroids. Therefore, an analysis of the immune infiltrate and resulting resident cell (tubular and vascular) responses that provides pathogenic understanding of the specific immune events that initiate and propogate AIN should lead to development and/or repurposing of targeted therapies that are more effective at resolving AIN and preventing the progression to CKD, as well as potentially less toxic.  Data from several groups, including our own, suggest that CD4+ T-helper cells (particularly the TH2/TH9 subsets) are potential drivers of AIN. We have found that TH2/TH9 cytokines IL-5 and IL-9 and some cells of type 2 immunity, mast cells and eosinophils, are higher in the urine or kidneys of patients with AIN. Based on these data, it is our hypothesis that TH2/TH9 T-helper cells in the kidney itself play an important pathogenic role in promoting tubular or vascular injury in AIN. We will test this hypothesis by performing a quantitative evaluation of the kidney immune infiltrate and accompanying tubular and vascular response in humans with AIN. We will use existing kidney biopsies, adjudicated by 3 nephropathologists as exhibiting AIN, from two university health centers (Yale and Johns Hopkins), as discovery and validation cohorts for this study. To perform the quantitative analysis we will use an imaging technique called Imaging Mass Cytometry (IMC) that supports the simultaneous, spatially-preserved quantification of up to 42 antibodies on a single tissue section. We have an existing library of 27 validated kidney and immune antibodies and have developed a machine learning protocol to rapidly and accurately quantify and localize all cells in the human kidney identified using IMC.  We will first increase our validated antibody panel and optimize our IMC protocol for use in the study of AIN (SA 1). We will then use IMC to identify, quantify and localize the immune and resident cell responses in 30 AIN cases and 60 non-AIN control biopsies from Yale (discovery cohort), followed by 30 AIN cases and 60 non-AIN controls from JHU (validation cohort, SA 2). Finally, we will define the relationship between cellular determinants of AIN and recovery of kidney function as well as response to steroids (SA3). Our findings will not only lead to identification of novel druggable targets in AIN, but also lead to improving clinical histological diagnosis of AIN. Acute Interstitial Nephritis (AIN) is an important cause of kidney dysfunction, and can lead to chronic kidney disease in many patients. We know that AIN occurs as an immune response in the kidney to certain drugs or infections, but do not have a clear understanding of the cell sources of the inflammation or the tubular and vascular responses. This proposal is designed to define these immune events in human kidney biopsy samples left over after clinical diagnosis has been completed, and to determine how they relate to the development of chronic kidney disease.",Defining the Pathogenesis and Prognosis of Human Acute Interstitial Nephritis,10264054,R01DK126815,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acute', 'Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Adrenal Cortex Hormones', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Antibiotics', 'Antibodies', 'Antigens', 'Archives', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Biopsy', 'Biopsy Specimen', 'Blood', 'Blood Vessels', 'CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes', 'Cell Communication', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cytometry', 'Data', 'Delayed Hypersensitivity', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Drug Exposure', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Fibrosis', 'Formalin', 'Health', 'Helper-Inducer T-Lymphocyte', 'Histologic', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Immune', 'Immune checkpoint inhibitor', 'Immune response', 'Immunity', 'Infection', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Injury', 'Interleukin-5', 'Interleukin-9', 'Interstitial Nephritis', 'Intervention', 'Kidney', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Libraries', 'Location', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediating', 'Neighborhoods', 'Optics', 'Organ', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Participant', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Protocols documentation', 'Proton Pump Inhibitors', 'Quantitative Evaluations', 'Reaction', 'Recovery', 'Recovery of Function', 'Renal function', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Skin', 'Source', 'Steroids', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Tissue Preservation', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Tubular formation', 'Tumor-infiltrating immune cells', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'Virus Diseases', 'Withdrawal', 'adjudicate', 'adverse event risk', 'base', 'biobank', 'cell type', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'cytokine', 'design', 'eosinophil', 'exhaust', 'improved', 'injured', 'kidney biopsy', 'kidney dysfunction', 'mast cell', 'multiphoton imaging', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'preservation', 'prevent', 'renal damage', 'response', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'targeted treatment', 'vascular injury']",NIDDK,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,528629

"A Dental implant registry of treatment outcomes of implant therapy by practitioners in the National Dental Practice Based Research Network There is a substantial body of literature to support that biological and prosthetic complications occur which may interfere with the health of the peri-implant tissues, the function and esthetics of the implant restoration. Peri-implant diseases are classified into peri-implant mucositis, inflammation restricted to the peri-implant mucosa, and peri-implantitis, characterized by peri-implant bone loss. The limitations of the current body of literature of biologic and prosthetic complications are based on many small studies and in large part conducted in an academic and specialty setting. We propose to create an implant registry within the National Dental Practice Based Research Network (NDPBRN) that will record the setting and implant therapy, the implants used, the prosthetic therapy provided and the rate of complications. The registry will create an opportunity for subsequent, additional targeted studies on specific complications available from the registry data and will lead to diagnosis driven therapy strategies. The target enrollment is a total of 2000 implants with prosthesis across the whole network. The one year UG3 Phase will be used to create a strategy to be able to meet the recruitment and enrollment objectives and to develop the protocol for data collection to facilitate the data gathering of the practitioners for the subjects they enroll. The data collection model we propose will be designed to be validated, concise, and easy to use for practitioners. We will develop a web based decision tree that will guide the practitioner through the data collection. The UH3 phase will recruit practitioners with representation of all 6 regions of the network that will enroll subjects with 2000 implants. Data collection will be detailed and comprehensive and will include surgical, prosthetic, and biologic aspects of implant therapy and radiographs for bone level assessments for a period of 3 years. The data will present clinically meaningful information about the prevalence of the various implant therapies, the incidence of prosthetic and biologic implant complications, risk factors for implant complications and evidence-based implant therapy strategies in every dental practices. We expect that the results from this study will significantly impact the clinical practice of implant dentistry and the quality of care provided for the patients. We propose to create an Implant Registry capturing implant therapy that is provided by practitioners within the NDPBRN. The aim is to determine the therapies associated with the greatest amount of success and the least amount of complications. With the data generated through this registry, we will add to the generalizable knowledge about implant therapy, the complications and therapies associated with implant success at the fixture level and the patient level.",A Dental implant registry of treatment outcomes of implant therapy by practitioners in the National Dental Practice Based Research Network,10101988,UG3DE030090,"['Biological', 'Biological Factors', 'Biometry', 'Budgets', 'Client satisfaction', 'Clinical', 'Complication', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Decision Trees', 'Dental General Practice', 'Dental Implants', 'Dentistry', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Esthetics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Image', 'Implant', 'Incidence', 'Inflammation', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Mucositis', 'Mucous Membrane', 'National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research', 'Online Systems', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Oral health', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Predictive Factor', 'Prevalence', 'Private Practice', 'Prosthesis', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of Care', 'Registries', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'System', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'adjudicate', 'base', 'bone', 'clinical practice', 'data registry', 'design', 'evidence base', 'health related quality of life', 'medical specialties', 'peri-implant bone loss', 'peri-implantitis', 'personalized therapeutic', 'practice setting', 'practice-based research network', 'recruit', 'restoration', 'success', 'tool']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,UG3,2021,202410
"Functional and Structural Optical Coherence Tomography for Glaucoma PROJECT SUMMARY Glaucoma is a leading cause of blindness in the US. The management of glaucoma is based on early detection, followed by careful evaluation and monitoring to identify those with rapid disease progression and high risk for vision loss. This allows for the rational use of medical, laser, and surgical treatments. Current methods of assessing glaucoma have significant limitations. Visual field (VF) testing has a low sensitivity for detecting early disease, and its reproducibility worsens in advanced stages, reducing its reliability for monitoring disease progression. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) precisely measure the peripapillary nerve fiber layer (NFL) thickness and is the most commonly used technology for objective glaucoma evaluation. However, NFL thickness has limited sensitivity in detecting early glaucoma, and reaches a floor value in moderate glaucoma, which prevents it from tracking glaucoma progress into later stages. The goal of the proposed research is to develop advanced OCT technology that will enhance detection of early glaucoma, improve the sensitivity of detecting significant disease progression, and increase the accuracy of measuring progression speed. The Specific Aims are: 1. Develop a directional high-resolution OCT and OCT angiography prototype to improve imaging of  structure and perfusion. The prototype will have real-time control of beam direction to maintain  perpendicular incidence on the NFL for accurate reflectance analysis, which has shown promise for very  sensitive detection of early glaucoma. Sensorless adaptive-optics aberration correction will enable high  transverse resolution to enhance the detection of nerve fiber bundle and capillary defects. Ultrahigh axial  resolution will enable assessment of the pentalaminar structure of the inner plexiform layer. 2. Wide-field OCT and OCT angiography analyses and visual field simulation. Wide peripapillary and  macular scans, using a next-generation commercial spectral-domain OCT system, will allow visualization of  nerve fiber and perfusion defects from the disc margin to temporal raphe, thus improving early glaucoma  detection. VF simulation will be performed to convert OCTA perfusion measurement to a VF-equivlaent dB-  scale familiar to clinicians for monitoring progression. The simulation has higher reproducibility than actual  VF, which improves detection of disease progression and measurement of progression speed. 3. Clinical studies in glaucoma diagnosis and monitoring. The clinical study will test whether the  proposed new technologies can improve the detection of pre-perimetric glaucoma, detection of disease  progression, and the accuracy of measuring the speed of progression. This research is likely to transform the clinical practice of glaucoma by developing novel objective functional and structural tests that can be practically implemented on the next generation of clinical OCT systems. This will save vision by achieving accurate diagnosis in early glacuoma and timely intervention in rapid progressors. PROJECT NARRATIVE Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a high-resolution imaging technology that is already commonly used to diagnose and monitor glaucoma, a leading cause of blindness. The proposed research will further improve this technology so that it can detect earlier stages of glaucoma, evaluate the location and severity of glaucoma damage, and provide more accurate monitoring of disease progression. Directional OCT technology will be developed to accurately measure nerve fiber layer reflectance; sensorless adaptive-optics OCT technology will be used to improve imaging of nerve fiber bundles and capillaries; ultrahigh axial resolution will enable imaging of detailed internal retinal structures such as the lamellae of the inner plexiform layer; and capillary perfusion measurements will be used to simulate visual field function.",Functional and Structural Optical Coherence Tomography for Glaucoma,10211838,R01EY023285,"['3-Dimensional', 'Angiography', 'Blindness', 'Blood capillaries', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Floor', 'Future', 'Ganglion Cell Layer', 'Glaucoma', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Incidence', 'Inner Plexiform Layer', 'Intervention', 'Lasers', 'Location', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Nerve Fibers', 'Nose', 'Open-Angle Glaucoma', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optic Disk', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Questionnaires', 'Real-Time Systems', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Retina', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'Visual Fields', 'Visualization', 'accurate diagnosis', 'adaptive optics', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'deep neural network', 'field study', 'high resolution imaging', 'high risk', 'improved', 'macula', 'new technology', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'optic nerve disorder', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'quantitative imaging', 'simulation', 'tool']",NEI,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,624917
"Learning to Predict Delayed Cerebral Ischemia with Novel Continuous Cerebral Arterial State Index Project Summary  Delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) is the most devastating complication after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) and has an incidence rate of 30%. Current practice relies on intermittent assessment of neurological status and daily cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV) by Transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD) to guide medical management to prevent DCI. Only after medical management fails, is endovascular treatment (EVT) including intraarterial vasodilator infusion and/or intracranial angioplasty initiated. This reactive practice does not account for early predictors of DCI and may miss the optimal EVT window at an early stage of DCI development before symptoms or severe deviations from normal hemodynamics. The goal of this project is to develop algorithms to predict DCI and related targets at an early stage in their development. An accurate prediction of DCI will enable a more proactive strategy to prevent and treat the underlying cause of DCI.  The following three aims will be pursued towards the goal of the project: 1) Develop aSAH-specific intracranial pressure (ICP) pulse-based cerebral arterial state index; 2) Develop and validate predictive models of targets related to delayed cerebral ischemia after aSAH; 3) Conduct a prospective institution- specific adaption and validation of the developed models.  Our DCI predictive algorithms only need data available in current clinical practice hence they can be readily adopted. If validated, these algorithms will enable clinicians to monitor risk of DCI continuously and to proactively deliver appropriate treatment. The proposed prospective study of algorithm implementation and adaptation will well prepare future clinical trials to test the efficacy of algorithm-informed interventions.

"Development and Validation of Computational Algorithms to Assess Kidney Health in Electronic Health Records Project Summary A key aim of this proposal is to equip the candidate, Dr.Ozrazgat Baslanti, with the necessary protected time and additional training and resources to develop her skillset on quantitative methods and understanding of underlying mechanism of progression of kidney disease and facilitate her transition to an independent translational researcher in health care. The long-term career goal is to become an independent data scientist, with a focus on hospital care for acute disease and complications arising from that care. The overall objective of this application is to build the foundation of the analytical approach for identifying patients’ health trajectories during episode of acute hospitalization and quantifying the transitions in health states that can be applied to any acute illness. Our central hypothesis is that using kidney health as a paradigm for this approach we can determine individual states of change in kidney health during hospitalization using longitudinal, highly granular temporal data in electronic health records, determine transition probabilities to more severe stages of acute and chronic kidney disease, and improve understanding of the underlying processes influencing these transitions. Current diagnosis and risk evaluation for acute kidney injury (AKI) are focused on determination of severity of AKI episode and an integrated framework for assessing renal recovery does not exist. There is a clear lack of research on estimating transition probabilities among different states of kidney health through nonlinear and non-normal time- dependent domains using longitudinal electronic health records data. The complexity of underlying processes influencing the transition probabilities from renal risk to more severe stages of acute and chronic kidney disease requires application of advanced computational models in sufficiently large and granular datasets. The specific aims of the proposal are: Aim 1- Expand and validate computable phenotypes of kidney health in large-scale medical data. Aim 2- Determine the epidemiology and clinical outcomes of changes in kidney health. Aim 3- Develop and validate probabilistic graphical models to predict transition through the states of kidney health and identify risk factors for progression. The proposed research is significant as we will have phenotyping algorithms of kidney health, validated in multi-center study, that can enhance their inter-institutional sharing and that enable to study epidemiology and outcomes of changes in kidney health. The approach is innovative because it implements technological advances in data science and statistics in innovative steps to develop and validate a phenotyping algorithm that determines computable phenotypes of changes in kidney health and graphical models to predict transition through the states of kidney health through nonlinear and non-normal time- dependent domains using highly granular electronic health records. This will provide foundation for changes in the care of patients with AKI, through identification of those patients at risk of developing AKI and progressing to acute and chronic kidney disease. On completion of the proposed investigations the deliverables will be new knowledge and a diagnosis and prognostication tool for kidney health. Project Narrative Acute kidney injury (AKI) is one of the most common complication among hospitalized patients and is central to the subsequent development of chronic kidney disease and increased mortality. Besides the severity of an initial episode of acute kidney injury, the timing and duration of renal recovery are required to characterize the natural history of this complex condition and its effect on overall kidney health. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of NIH’s mission that pertains to developing fundamental knowledge that will help to enhance health, since our research may provide diagnosis and prediction tools for changes in kidney health using electronic records data that contain wealth of clinical data that could be used to identify all dimensions of AKI episode as well as key determinants of undesired outcomes.",Development and Validation of Computational Algorithms to Assess Kidney Health in Electronic Health Records,10141224,K01DK120784,"['Acute', 'Acute Disease', 'Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Admission activity', 'Algorithms', 'Award', 'Bayesian Network', 'Caring', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Complication', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Scientist', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Natural History', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Preventive therapy', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Records', 'Recovery', 'Renal function', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'acute care', 'adjudication', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'career', 'computable phenotypes', 'data repository', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'inter-institutional', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'phenotyping algorithm', 'prognostic tool', 'statistical and machine learning', 'statistics', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'translational scientist']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,K01,2021,129110
"Predictive Biomarkers for disease activity and organ damage in patients with lupus Abstract Lupus nephritis (LN) is one of the most serious manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Current clinical laboratory markers lack sufficient sensitivity and specificity to optimize individual patient care creating a need to develop novel biomarkers for LN. To address this unmet need there has been a significant effort within the lupus research community to identify novel LN biomarkers, but to date none have been qualified for clinical use. We speculate that one of the important causes of these failures is that no single biomarker can account for the heterogeneity of SLE or LN. Under the hypothesis that multiple categories of biomarkers can represent different aspects of risk for LN, we propose to assess biomarkers that are classified into categories of disease susceptibility, systemic inflammation, and kidney compartment/cell injury to build models for risk prediction. Our objective is to develop composite biomarkers for early detection of renal flares, chronic renal damage, and treatment response of LN patients. To accomplish this goal we will use biospecimens from longitudinal observational cohorts and clinical trials that have well-annotated patient samples. The Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) team therefore proposes to partner with the Ohio State University (OSU) team to combine each group's longitudinal SLE cohorts and create a well-phenotyped patient resource suited to biomarker discovery and large enough to adequately power validation studies. The combined OSU-MUSC cohort will have approximately 500 LN patients who have had rheumatology/nephrology clinic visits and biospecimens collected every two to six months for up to ten years. Using these samples, our collective team has already described several DNA, serum and urine biomarkers that are associated with disease activity, treatment response or organ damage in LN, and has considerable experience in developing biomarker panels for outcomes in LN. We have reviewed the last decade's literature, systematically ranked novel biomarkers, and propose to test the top performing LN biomarkers in this proposal to address whether: (i) Biomarkers associated with active LN can be used to predict impending renal flares in prospective longitudinal cohorts; (ii) Baseline measures of composite panels of urine or serum biomarkers can distinguish between who will and who will not achieve a renal response to one year of conventional therapy with mycophenolate mofetil; (iii) The development of genetic risk profiles of LN patients to identify those who are predisposed to develop chronic kidney damage. We will also compare biomarkers predictive of disease outcomes in LN to those in non-renal SLE, working towards developing LN specific vs general biomarker panels that are indicative of active inflammation and/or damage accrual. Our ultimate goal is to have validated LN predictors of sufficient sensitivity and specificity to be clinically relevant, and that can be easily assayed in most clinical service laboratories to improve patient care. Relevance to Public Health Systemic lupus erythematosus is a chronic debilitating autoimmune disease that can lead to serious kidney damage and death. Given the high incidence of end stage kidney disease in minority women afflicted with lupus nephritis, it is essential to develop surrogate biomarkers to be able to predict impending disease flares, treatment response, and renal damage. The development of validated biomarker panels will pave the way towards better clinical management of patients who have lupus nephritis.",Predictive Biomarkers for disease activity and organ damage in patients with lupus,10152359,R01AR071947,"['Address', 'Age', 'Aliquot', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Categories', 'Cell Compartmentation', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinic', 'Clinic Visits', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Services', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Coupled', 'Creatinine clearance measurement', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Elements', 'End stage renal failure', 'Failure', 'Flare', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Load', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'In complete remission', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inherited', 'Injury to Kidney', 'Kidney', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Markers', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Lupus', 'Lupus Nephritis', 'Maintenance Therapy', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neoadjuvant Therapy', 'Nephrology', 'Odds Ratio', 'Ohio', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Plasma', 'Probability', 'Proteinuria', 'Public Health', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rheumatology', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'South Carolina', 'Specificity', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'Systemic Lupus Erythematosus', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Failure', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Vasculitis', 'Woman', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'biomarker panel', 'cell injury', 'clinical development', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'conventional therapy', 'ds-DNA', 'early detection biomarkers', 'ethnic diversity', 'experience', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'mortality', 'mycophenolate mofetil', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'random forest', 'renal damage', 'response', 'risk prediction model', 'risk variant', 'screening', 'sex', 'systemic inflammatory response', 'therapy development', 'treatment response', 'validation studies']",NIAMS,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,R01,2021,628779
"Skeletal Myopathy in Systemic Sclerosis: Devising a Classification Schema Predictive of Outcomes PROJECT SUMMARY Skeletal myopathy in systemic sclerosis (SSc) is associated with increased disability and mortality. There is no consensus classification of SSc-associated myopathy that can be utilized to lay the groundwork for understanding muscle disease in scleroderma. We know that there is pathological, serological, and outcome heterogeneity that may be informative in defining distinct subsets of myopathy in SSc. Our preliminary data demonstrate that (1) muscle histopathology is heterogeneous in SSc, (2) patients with a fibrosing myopathy have poor outcomes, in particular cardiac death, and (3) there is intense signal uptake on advanced MRI imaging such as diffusion weighted and tensor imaging and T2 mapping in SSc-associated myopathy which may indicate early disease related changes when compared to conventional muscle MRI. This K23 proposal will first establish a Myopathy cohort (Aim 1), devise a classification schema and test its utility in predicting long term outcomes such as trajectory, cardiopulmonary disease, disability, mortality, and treatment responsiveness(Aim 2), and detect and quantify early disease related muscle changes on advanced muscle MRI (Aim 3). This application is for a K23 award for Julie Paik, MD, MHS, Assistant Professor of Medicine in the Division of Rheumatology at the Johns Hopkins University. Her long term career goal is to become a leading clinical investigator in scleroderma muscle disease in the context of observational cohort studies, state of the art imaging biomarkers, and clinical trial methodology. Her short term goal of devising this classification schema will provide a new gold standard for the validation of external myopathy cohorts in SSc and lay the framework for future studies directed at understanding biological mechanism and developing a therapeutic trial using measurable outcomes such as quantitative muscle MRI. This proposal takes advantage of the rich resources and infrastructure at the Johns Hopkins Scleroderma Center, a recently designated Precision Center of Excellence in 2018. Her mentoring team includes Dr. Laura Hummers and Dr. Fredrick Wigley, both renowned experts in SSc and clinical epidemiology, Dr. Andrew Mammen is an internationally recognized myositis expert, and Dr. Scott Zeger a leader in bio statistical and epidemiological research. Dr. Paik has recruited vital members to her Advisory Committee, composed of mentors and collaborators who have specific expertise relevant to the proposal and are fully supportive of Dr. Paik’s research and career goals. These include Dr. Michael Jacobs (advanced radiological imaging), Dr. Laura Fayad (musculoskeletal radiology), Dr. Andrea Corse (muscle histopathology), Dr. Tom Lloyd (classification schemas in inclusion body myositis), and Dr. Ami Shah (scleroderma translational research). This K23 award will allow Dr. Paik to gain the skills needed to analyze and develop a classification schema of skeletal myopathy in scleroderma, develop expertise in advanced muscle MRI analysis, and build her clinical trial skill set to ultimately support a future R01 proposal. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research will establish a comprehensive, prospective myopathy cohort in systemic sclerosis (SSc or scleroderma) to ultimately devise a novel classification schema for SSc-associated myopathy that is predictive of outcomes such as treatment response, disability, cardiopulmonary disease trajectory, and death. Advanced muscle MRI techniques include diffusion weighted imaging, diffusion tensor imaging, and T2 mapping will also be used to detect and quantify early muscle disease related changes in SSc associated myopathy. The knowledge gained from this study will lay the foundation for discovering predictive biomarkers of disease course and to allow future studies of the specific biological process involved in each phenotype.",Skeletal Myopathy in Systemic Sclerosis: Devising a Classification Schema Predictive of Outcomes,10152533,K23AR073927,"['Address', 'Advisory Committees', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biopsy', 'Cardiac Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cohort Studies', 'Consensus', 'Creatine Kinase', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Early identification', 'Edema', 'Electromyography', 'Enrollment', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Fibrosis', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Heterogeneity', 'Histologic', 'Histopathology', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Incidence', 'Inclusion Body Myositis', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammation Process', 'Inflammatory', 'Infrastructure', 'International', 'Intramuscular', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Muscle', 'Muscle Weakness', 'Musculoskeletal', 'Myopathy', 'Myositis', 'Necrosis', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Prospective cohort', 'Protocols documentation', 'Pulmonary Heart Disease', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Rheumatology', 'Sampling Biases', 'Scleroderma', 'Serology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skeletal Muscle', 'Systemic Scleroderma', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Trials', 'Translational Research', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'career', 'clinical development', 'clinical epidemiology', 'clinically significant', 'cohort', 'diffusion weighted', 'disability', 'disorder control', 'epidemiology study', 'high risk', 'illness length', 'imaging biomarker', 'interest', 'member', 'mortality', 'muscle form', 'muscle strength', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'predictive marker', 'professor', 'prospective', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiological imaging', 'random forest', 'recruit', 'skeletal', 'skills', 'treatment response', 'uptake']",NIAMS,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,K23,2021,158754
"Improving Outcomes Assessment in Chronic Graft versus Host Disease PROJECT SUMMARY Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) can cure many hematologic cancers and other life- threatening hematologic diseases but 20-50% of survivors develop chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD), the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in transplant survivors. Chronic GVHD is an iatrogenic complication that can affect multiple organs, leading to clinical manifestations similar to autoimmune diseases such as systemic sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjogren’s syndrome, and lichen planus. Chronic GVHD requires prolonged treatment with potent immunosuppressive agents and is associated with high symptom burden and poor quality of life. The precise pathophysiology is unclear in humans. There are data supporting involvement of T and B cells, macrophages, dendritic cells, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, cytokines, chemokines and other proteins. However, information is derived from studies with few patients having heterogeneous clinical manifestations. This renewal application will address key gaps in our understanding: Can we identify biologically relevant cGVHD subgroups by studying large numbers of patients and using sophisticated analytic techniques to identify “clusters” of similar patients? Is personalized medicine possible based on knowledge of underlying pathophysiology and the likelihood of response? To address these questions, we will use our extensive biorepository to test whether plasma proteins and peripheral blood cellular populations cluster with clinical manifestations. While these studies are ongoing, a new cohort will be enrolled to prospectively test the cluster findings and to investigate early biomarkers for treatment response. Participants will be enrolled prior to starting a new systemic initial or second-line cGVHD treatment, then followed at 1, 3 and 6 months later to assess clinical response. Successful completion of these aims will advance our understanding of the biologic underpinnings of the different forms of human cGVHD and guide therapeutic approaches, in order to decrease the morbidity and mortality of this common transplant complication. PROJECT NARRATIVE Chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) is the leading cause of morbidity and non-relapse mortality in survivors of allogeneic transplantation. Our understanding of the biologic abnormalities associated with different clinical phenotypes is lacking, preventing our ability to rationally choose cGVHD treatments.

"Genetic Modulators of Glaucoma Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness in the world. While elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) is a major risk factor, damage and death of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) underlies visual field loss. However, a thorough understanding of this disease is a major challenge because its genetic basis is heterogeneous and it represents a family of age-related disorders resulting from intersecting gene-regulated pathophysiologic networks. We propose to continue to use the BXD (C57BL/6 x DBA/2J) family of recombinant inbred (RI) lines of mice as a genetic reference panel (GRP) and to combine our work with human genome wide association studies (GWAS), to uncover and clarify the genetic heterogeneity that underlies optic nerve (ON) damage. We have had recent success using this combined approach in the regulation of intraocular pressure (IOP). We are very well positioned to take the next step and apply this approach to define cellular targets of RGC damage and death. We propose to uncover phenotypic diversities of glaucoma-related ON damage and uncover common underlying mechanisms that are shared with IOP modulation. Our long-term research goal is to identify disease mechanisms and develop neuroprotective therapies to preserve retinal health in patients at risk for glaucoma. Our overall objective is to identify novel gene products and related mechanisms that lead to glaucomatous endophenotypes using multi-dimensional genetic analyses, cross-species comparisons (mouse, rat and human) and validation using novel murine glaucoma models. Our central hypothesis is that molecular processes leading to glaucoma associated-endophenotypes, such as elevated IOP and ON damage, are shared across species, and that species comparisons can uncover common underlying mechanisms, and efficient testing of targeted glaucoma therapeutics. In the current investigation, we perform a systematic analysis of ON damage, and an additional species—rat. We will mine the extensive databases of IOP and ON damage that we are generating for more than 70 BXD strains across five age cohorts with the goal of defining new models of glaucoma. An overall strength of this proposal is the combination of cutting-edge systems genetics methods, species comparisons of glaucoma phenotypes, and a strong interdisciplinary team that includes investigators with extensive experience in systems genetics, glaucoma, GWAS in human and rats, and advanced computational methods. To test our hypothesis, we will perform the following thress studies: 1) Identify the candidate gene on chromosome 12 that modulates ON damage; 2) Determine if modulation of IOP and/or ON damage is shared across rodent species; and 3) Identify novel spontaneous glaucoma models through a comprehensive analysis of our enlarged BXD GRP of 100 or more BXD strains. The outcomes of these studies will define novel genes and molecular networks that underlie glaucoma-associated phenotypes and also provide unique glaucoma models for future analysis. These results are expected to fundamentally advance the field of glaucoma disease mechanisms and enable targeted therapeutic development. Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness in the world and a thorough understanding of this disease is a major challenge because its genetic basis is heterogeneous, and it likely represents a family of disorders resulting from intersecting gene-regulated pathophysiologic pathways.

"Combining Voice and Genetic Information to Detect Heterogeneity in Major Depressive Disorder PROJECT SUMMARY This application aims to advance our understanding of major depressive disorder (MDD) by combining genetic information and analyzing speech patterns of those with MDD to identify subtypes. MDD is the leading cause of disability throughout the world, yet, relative to other common disorders, less is known about its origins. There are less effective treatments and much less is spent on trying to understand how it arises and how to cure it. Current treatments are relatively ineffective, with up 50% of patients refractory and many suffering severe recurrence. Understanding the mechanisms underlying MDD has been recognized as a grand challenge in global mental health. Thus, developing new treatments for MDD is a major priority for public health. A major challenge for MDD research is the presence of heterogeneity. The existence of multiple subtypes of MDD has been suspected for a long time, and likely confounds the ability to treat the disorder appropriately with existing treatments, as well as making it hard to identify the causes of MDD as a prelude to developing new treatments. However finding subtypes has been hard. Given that the way people talk can reflect alterations in mood, we expect voice to be able to predict mood, and hence potentially be used as biomarker to recognize heterogeneity. In preliminary data show that in combination with genetic data high-dimensional vocal features extracted from recordings can be used to identify subtypes. Furthermore, the use of genetic data allows us to impute voice features into large biobanks where no recordings exist, making it possible to explore the relationship between vocal features and a rich array of clinically important indicators. We explore the power of voice to make a diagnosis of MDD, to predict severity and other clinical features. Applying our approach to will inform clinical management, improving diagnosis, refine treatment and aid the development of new treatments PROJECT NARRATIVE The research proposed here will contribute to an understanding of major depressive disorder, the commonest psychiatric disorder and a leading cause of disability throughout the world. The proposal will combine information from voice recordings and genetics to identify subtypes of depression and develop robust predictors of mood, severity of illness and other clinical indicators. Our research will thereby provide new insights into disease, and well enable the more effective targeting of therapy to those who will most benefit at the appropriate time.",Combining Voice and Genetic Information to Detect Heterogeneity in Major Depressive Disorder,10238767,R01MH122569,"['Affect', 'Alleles', 'Anxiety', 'Behavioral Genetics', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'China', 'Chinese People', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Far East', 'Frequencies', 'Genetic', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Neurobiology', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Recurrence', 'Refractory', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Speech', 'Suicide', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Ursidae Family', 'Voice', 'Voice Quality', 'Woman', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'biobank', 'clinical application', 'clinical phenotype', 'comorbidity', 'computer science', 'data sharing', 'deep neural network', 'disability', 'disorder subtype', 'effective therapy', 'efficacy evaluation', 'flexibility', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic architecture', 'genetic information', 'genetic predictors', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'long short term memory', 'multidimensional data', 'neuroimaging', 'preservation', 'psychogenetics', 'public health priorities', 'statistics', 'targeted treatment', 'trait', 'treatment response', 'vector']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2021,667757
"Improving Hypertension Treatment in African Americans Using Computational Modeling and Predictive Analytics ABSTRACT As compared to whites, African Americans (AA) develop hypertension (HTN) at an earlier age, have a greater frequency and severity of HTN, poorer control of blood pressure (BP), and have twice the mortality rate from HTN. For 47 years our department has been developing computer simulations of integrative physiology for research purposes. The current model, HumMod, is comprised of 14 organ systems, and includes neural, endocrine, circulatory, and renal physiology. We have created tools that generate and analyze large cohorts of computer-generated (virtual) patients. With these techniques HumMod has been used for hypothesis generation and for understanding underlying physiological mechanisms that are not able to be determined in either whole animal or human experiments. This proposed work will use these tools and this mathematical model of human physiology to develop a realistic AA virtual population for studying antihypertensive therapies that have well-known (diuretic or salt reduction), variable (angiotensin converting enzyme, or ACE inhibition), or unclear (renal denervation (RDX), and baroreflex activation therapy (BAT) therapeutic efficacies in AA. Published data from our laboratory show that our model is robust and can realistically simulate salt sensitivity, multiple types of HTN, and device-based antihypertensive therapy. As shown in our preliminary data, we have successfully created a virtual population that was similar to the clinical data (AA population with resistant HTN) in 5-dimensions (blood pressure, heart rate, glomerular filtration rate, cardiac output, and peripheral resistance) and have conducted in silico trials for new device-based therapy currently being evaluated for the treatment of resistant HTN—namely RDX, BAT, and arteriovenous fistula. Based on these preliminary data, we hypothesize that these techniques will allow us to investigate the physiological mechanisms responsible for the variation in response to therapy in a wide range of AA patient types and predict the likelihood of success for a particular treatment. Aim 1 of the proposal will test the hypothesis that a virtual AA population with resistant HTN can be successfully calibrated and validated. Aim 2 of the proposal will test the hypothesis that in silico trials using the calibrated populations from the first Aim can be used for testing and predicting mechanisms of nonresponse to device-based antihypertensive therapies. Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that our predictive analytic techniques can be used to identify mechanisms and proxy markers of therapeutic resistance in hypertensive AA. These proposed studies have clinical relevance because they address a leading cause of morbidity and mortality as well as potential mechanisms of therapeutic resistance in an underserved and understudied minority. Furthermore, these applications and the potential insights gleaned from our physiological model and predictive analytic tools may have broad implications for BP control in other resistant hypertensive populations. PROJECT NARRATIVE African Americans develop hypertension and its co-morbidities at an earlier age, have a greater frequency and severity of hypertension, have poorer control of blood pressure, and die disproportionately (2-fold) more from hypertension as compared to whites. Despite these known disparities, there has been little attention or advancement in the management of blood pressure in the African American population. Our laboratory’s advanced physiological model paired with novel analytic tools may mechanistically predict the types of patients that should respond to therapy, ultimately improving patient drug regimens and their success rate in this underserved and understudied population.",Improving Hypertension Treatment in African Americans Using Computational Modeling and Predictive Analytics,10268976,K99MD014738,"['Address', 'African American', 'Age', 'Aldosterone Antagonists', 'Angiotensin II', 'Animals', 'Antihypertensive Agents', 'Arterial Disorder', 'Arteriovenous fistula', 'Attention', 'Baroreflex', 'Blood Pressure', 'Calcium Channel', 'Cardiac Output', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Computer Simulation', 'Controlled Study', 'Data', 'Denervation', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Diuretics', 'Endocrine', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Generations', 'Genomics', 'Glean', 'Glomerular Filtration Rate', 'Heart Rate', 'High Prevalence', 'Hormonal', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Jackson Heart Study', 'Kidney', 'Laboratories', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentors', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Obesity', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A', 'Peripheral Resistance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Prevalence', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Proxy', 'Publishing', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Resistant Hypertension', 'Severities', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Sodium Chloride', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'blood pressure regulation', 'body system', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'computer generated', 'data warehouse', 'experimental study', 'genetic epidemiology', 'human model', 'hypertension control', 'hypertension treatment', 'improved', 'in silico', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mathematical model', 'mortality', 'novel', 'patient population', 'patient response', 'physiologic model', 'relating to nervous system', 'resistance mechanism', 'response', 'simulation', 'success', 'therapeutic biomarker', 'therapy resistant', 'tool', 'virtual', 'virtual model', 'virtual patient']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF MISSISSIPPI MED CTR,K99,2021,101117
"Transporting effects using a multicenter randomized study to different target populations PROJECT SUMMARY  Large confirmatory or pragmatic clinical trials enroll patients from multiple centers to obtain high-quality evidence useful for decision-making in diverse healthcare systems. The design of multicenter trials is particularly appealing to policymakers because many tend to be pragmatic and offer access to a large sample of diverse patient populations. Decision-makers trying to use the results of multicenter trials have specific target populations in mind. Yet, selection at both the center and individual participant level challenges the ability of even well-designed and conducted multicenter trials to draw inferences about any meaningful target population. These selection mechanisms, even in impeccably conducted multicenter trials, result in samples of trial participants that are not representative of any specific target population. When treatment effects are heterogeneous over covariates that are differentially distributed across centers, the overall trial average treatment effect estimate will not apply to any one of the populations underlying the participating centers or the target population. Consider for example, the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST), a large multicenter trial of 33 centers (53,456 individuals) across the United States, which motivated this proposal. Because the positive benefits of screening are mainly concentrated in individuals at high-risk for lung cancer it is critical that individuals are appropriately targeted for screening recommendations. Our long-term objective is to optimize the applicability of trial results into clinical practice. We will take steps toward this objective by achieving the following specific aims: (1) Develop robust and efficient statistical methods, that can be combined with modern machine learning techniques, to reinterpret a multicenter trial in the context of each of the participating centers and to transport inferences from a multicenter trial to a new target population; (2) Evaluate the performance of methods developed in Aim 1 in simulation studies that reflect real-world data by considering scenarios with different sample sizes, number of centers, treatment effects, and outcome or selection mechanisms; (3) Apply the methods in the NLST to reinterpret the trial in the context of one of the participating centers and to transport trial findings to a new target population using baseline data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, a nationally representative survey of the United States general population. The proposed work is innovative for analyzing multicenter trials because it develops new methods, clarifies the assumptions needed for obtaining valid inference, and empirically assesses method performance. This work is significant because as a result of applying these methods, policymakers will be able to learn about treatment effects in different underlying populations and produce high-quality evidence of interventions in diverse populations that are often unrepresented in trials. Insights gained from this work will improve the value of multicenter trials for decision-making. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because it will improve the value of multicenter trials for decision-making in diverse healthcare systems. Selection bias at both the individual and center level challenge the applicability of trial findings to populations often underrepresented in trials, such as women, ethnic/racial minorities, or the elderly. This work aligns with AHRQ’s mission and priority areas because as a result of applying these proposed methods, policymakers will be able to learn about treatment effects in different underlying target populations and produce high-quality evidence of interventions in diverse populations that are often unrepresented in trials, where decisions must be made.",Transporting effects using a multicenter randomized study to different target populations,10228266,R36HS028373,[' '],AHRQ,BROWN UNIVERSITY,R36,2021,43083
"Real-world outcomes of proliferative diabetic retinopathy PROJECT SUMMARY: Real-world outcomes of proliferative diabetic retinopathy Vision loss from diabetic retinopathy remains the leading cause of preventable blindness in working-aged adults in the United States (US). Advanced diabetic retinopathy is referred to as proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR). In many patients, blindness associated with PDR can be prevented with appropriate and timely diagnosis and treatment. Unfortunately, some patients at high risk for PDR are not receiving adequate eye care. More knowledge is needed about PDR outcomes in a real-world setting, and the differences between published study outcomes and real-world effectiveness. Electronic health records (EHRs) are used in nearly 90% of outpatient physician offices and can be a powerful tool for studying PDR in a real-world setting. The goal of this proposal is to develop and validate EHR-based methods to improve outcomes in PDR. The study aims are: (1) to classify patients with PDR in the EHR system using an automated method that incorporates structured (e.g., diagnosis code, medications, labs) and unstructured data (e.g., clinical notes), (2) to predict the progression of non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy to PDR using a forecasting model with time-varying covariates, and (3) to determine the real-world effectiveness of treatments for PDR in a large nationwide eye dataset. The study will utilize data from the University of California San Francisco’s (UCSF) De-Identified Clinical Data Warehouse, a de-identified EHR with over 1 million patients that has available eye exam information, and the Intelligent Research in Sight (IRIS) registry, a nationwide comprehensive eye database that includes data from over 15,000 eye providers in the US with over 1 million patients with PDR. The innovative methods and tools from this study can be applied to other eye conditions to facilitate future EHR- based clinical studies in ophthalmology. The candidate, Dr. Catherine Sun is an ophthalmologist whose long- term goal is to study real-world clinical outcomes in ophthalmology by conducting EHR-based pragmatic clinical trials and using large-scale EHR data. While she possesses the foundational skills, additional mentored training and coursework in data analytics, biomedical informatics, biostatistics, and advanced clinical trial design and implementation will help her reach her goals. Her outstanding mentorship team of primary mentor Dr. Nisha Acharya and co-mentors Dr. Travis Porco and Dr. Joshua Stein, and the exceptional environment of the Department of Ophthalmology and the F.I. Proctor Foundation at UCSF will support Dr. Sun’s development into an R01-funded independent investigator. PROJECT NARRATIVE Proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) represents advanced diabetic eye disease and can result in permanent vision loss. The electronic health record (EHR) can be a powerful tool for studying real-world outcomes of conditions like PDR to help prevent disease occurrence and improve outcomes. We will develop and validate EHR-based methods and tools to improve outcomes in PDR, which can also be applied to other eye conditions to facilitate future EHR-based clinical studies in ophthalmology.",Real-world outcomes of proliferative diabetic retinopathy,10191673,K23EY032637,"['Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Background Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Biometry', 'Blindness', 'California', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Clinical effectiveness', 'Code', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Eye', 'Eye diseases', 'Foundational Skills', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'General Hospitals', 'Goals', 'Health Insurance', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'ICD-9', 'Image', 'Infrastructure', 'Injections', 'Intelligence', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Light Coagulation', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Observational Study', 'Ophthalmic examination and evaluation', 'Ophthalmologist', 'Ophthalmology', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Outpatients', 'Participant', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians&apos', ' Offices', 'Pragmatic clinical trial', 'Prospective Studies', 'Provider', 'Publishing', 'Race', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'San Francisco', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'The Sun', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'aged', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'clinical data warehouse', 'comparison intervention', 'cost effectiveness', 'design', 'diabetic', 'follow-up', 'health disparity', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'low socioeconomic status', 'medication compliance', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'primary outcome', 'proliferative diabetic retinopathy', 'risk stratification', 'routine care', 'structured data', 'tool', 'treatment as usual', 'unstructured data']",NEI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K23,2021,252236
"Novel mechanisms and treatment of arrhythmia during resuscitation Resuscitation from sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) is typically initiated in patients with ongoing ischemia and ventricular fibrillation (VF) or tachycardia (VT) that, even if successful, is commonly followed by repeated rearrest. Despite significant efforts to improve resuscitation from SCA, survival remains poor prompting NIH to identify resuscitation as a high priority for emergency care research. Beat-to-beat alternans of cellular repolarization in the myocardium (repolarization alternans) is a substrate for arrhythmias, is rampant during resuscitation, and is manifested on the ECG as T-wave oscillations that can alternate (2:1) or as more complex oscillations. In preliminary studies, we observed in resuscitation patients and in an in vivo translational model of resuscitation from SCA, that rearrest due to VT/VF is preceded by T-wave oscillations that are complex; whereas, rearrest due to pulseless electrical activity (PEA) is preceded by increased T-wave oscillations that alternate. Accordingly, we contend that when T-wave oscillations are complex, repolarization alternans in the myocardium is spatially discordant, which is repolarization alternans occurring out-of-phase in adjacent regions and is highly arrhythmogenic. In contrast, when T-wave oscillations alternate, repolarization alternans in the myocardium is spatially in-phase (concordant), which poses no known immediate arrhythmia risk but is associated with mechanical dysfunction and, thus, PEA. Finally, in the absence of any repolarization alternans, risk of rearrest due to PEA or VT/VF is low. We hypothesize that during resuscitation rearrest due to VT/VF or PEA is strongly linked to repolarization alternans in the myocardium that is spatially discordant or not, respectively, and that specifically targeting the underlying mechanisms can prevent rearrest due to VT/VF and, possibly, PEA. In addition, the full spectrum of ECG T-wave oscillations can be utilized to predict no rearrest and rearrest from VT/VF or PEA and, thus, be used in the future as a biomarker to guide therapy and significantly improve outcomes. Our hypotheses will be tested with the following aims. 1) Determine the mechanistic relationship between cellular repolarization alternans and rearrest due to VT/VF or PEA in an in vivo model of resuscitation. 2) Determine if targeting the mechanisms of repolarization alternans can prevent rearrest during resuscitation, thereby gaining additional mechanistic insight. 3) Develop and test an ECG biomarker for predicting risk of rearrest due to VT/VF and PEA in resuscitation patients. To achieve these aims, we will utilize sophisticated instrumentation and signal processing in an in vivo translational model of resuscitation as well as in pre-hospital and in- hospital resuscitation patients. We have also established a highly translational collaboration that combines expertise in emergency medicine, cardiac arrhythmia, and clinical electrophysiology. Our scientific environment provides a unique opportunity to develop a better understanding of arrhythmia mechanisms relevant to resuscitation in order to develop novel and effective therapies. Project Narrative Sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) due to arrhythmia is a major public health problem and despite significant efforts to improve resuscitation from SCA, rearrest and survival remain poor. Consequently, improved approaches are needed, and NIH has recently identified resuscitation as a high priority for emergency care research. We propose to investigate the mechanisms of rearrest during resuscitation to develop novel and effective therapeutic strategies that improve outcomes.",Novel mechanisms and treatment of arrhythmia during resuscitation,10143285,R01HL142754,"['Acute', 'Arrhythmia', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Circulation', 'Cardiac', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Development', 'Distress', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Emergency Medicine', 'Emergency research', 'Environment', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gap Junctions', 'Heart', 'Heart Arrest', 'Hospitals', 'Ischemia', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanics', 'Metabolic', 'Modeling', 'Myocardial Ischemia', 'Myocardium', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Public Health', 'Reperfusion Therapy', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Sum', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Translating', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Ventricular Fibrillation', 'Ventricular Tachycardia', 'base', 'effective therapy', 'epicardial mapping', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'in vivo', 'in vivo Model', 'insight', 'instrument', 'instrumentation', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'predictive marker', 'prevent', 'rearrest', 'signal processing', 'therapeutically effective', 'translational model']",NHLBI,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,660343
"A novel technology to assess chronic toxicity in genetically diverse nematode populations Project Abstract The number of new products such as drugs, cosmetics and food additives introduced into the market is growing and poses a significant challenge for risk prediction. Currently, vertebrate testing is the industry standard for hazard assessment but has limitations including high costs, and the growing public and corporate sentiment against using vertebrates for chemical testing. Importantly, current toxicity assessment does not incorporate genetic diversity leading to failure of drug candidates and unintended risks to human sub-populations. The celebrated invertebrate model C. elegans has the potential to fill this gap since thousands of genetically diverse nematode populations are available. However, the main challenge is that chronic studies of chemicals in the nematode model is still tedious, precluding large-scale toxicity testing in nematode populations. This proposal aims to develop a high-throughput technology for chronic toxicity screening of diverse genetic populations in adult C. elegans. The focus of our Phase I plan is to pursue chronic toxicity studies on select toxins and generate foundational data highlighting the impact of genetic diversity, and subsequently scale the NemaLife technology to enable large-scale genetic diversity screening. AIM 1: To generate chronic dose-response data on toxins affecting diverse C. elegans strains. We will test the effects of five toxins for which we know the variability in human and rodent responses. Animals will be exposed to toxins daily, followed by scoring of survival, reproductive and neuromuscular health. About 1200 whole-life assays will be conducted with data acquired on 500+ animals per assay condition. We will generate data that will define the rank-order of C. elegans toxin response vis-à-vis mammalian systems, optimize phenotyping conditions for large numbers of strains per species, and define the amount of heritable variation in toxin responses. These pilot data will validate the capabilities afforded by our screening platform. AIM 2: To scale the throughput of NemaLife Technology for thousands of chronic toxicity assays. Currently, NemaLife’s technology has a throughput of hundreds of chronic toxicity assays. However, given the large number of toxins and vast library of genetic strains and wild isolates available, there is a significant need to increase the throughput of our technology. Therefore, we will develop the technology infrastructure and workflow to scale the throughput which includes multiplexing our approach, scale-up of chip fabrication and streamlining data analysis. Technology development at the scale of thousands of whole-life toxicity assays in a few weeks with readouts on animal death and neuromuscular impairments will be a major breakthrough in the field opening up new business opportunities in toxicity testing in the drug and consumer industry. Project Narrative Non-parasitic nematodes offer a powerful in vivo model to scale and measure toxin responses in genetically diverse species anchoring a transformative means to bridge current gaps in predictive toxicology with clinically-relevant end points. Our study aims to combine state-of-the art advances in microfluidics, computer vision, laboratory automation and a massively curated genetically diverse nematode species to produce a new screening approach capable of testing thousands of chemicals relevant to agriculture, nutraceutical and biotech markets.",A novel technology to assess chronic toxicity in genetically diverse nematode populations,10112054,R43ES032516,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Agriculture', 'Animals', 'Arsenic', 'Automation', 'Biological Assay', 'Biotechnology', 'Businesses', 'Cadmium', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Chemicals', 'Chronic', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Cosmetics', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Dose', 'Environment', 'Exposure to', 'Failure', 'Food Additives', 'Foundations', 'Gait', 'Gene Library', 'Genetic Models', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Hazard Assessment', 'Health', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Industry', 'Industry Standard', 'Infrastructure', 'Invertebrates', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Liquid substance', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Metformin', 'Methods', 'Microfluidics', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Nematoda', 'Nutraceutical', 'Paraquat', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Population Genetics', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Predisposition', 'Public Health', 'Risk', 'Rodent', 'Safety', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Toxic Environmental Substances', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicity Tests', 'Toxicology', 'Toxin', 'Variant', 'Vertebrates', 'Work', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cost', 'drug candidate', 'genetic resource', 'genetic strain', 'high throughput technology', 'in vivo Model', 'neuromuscular', 'new technology', 'reproductive', 'resistant strain', 'response', 'risk prediction', 'scale up', 'screening', 'technology development']",NIEHS,NEMALIFE INC.,R43,2021,251040
"Development/Commercialization of a Sensing Device to Detect Vaping Development/Commercialization of a Sensing Device to Detect Vaping Summary The use of e-cigarettes or vaping has been steadily increasing since its introduction. While potentially a tool to wean cigarette smokers from combustible tobacco, one consequence of the introduction of these devices has been the adoption of vaping by adolescents. While companies that offer vaping instruments for sale note that their material is directed to adults and intended as an aid for smoking cessation, recent reports have demonstrated that middle school and high school students in many countries, some as young as thirteen, have taken to vaping. Data analysis from a 2015 study in the U.S. indicated that 16% of high school students and 5% of middle school students reported vaping in the past thirty days. Most researchers speculated that the number of users would increase from these baselines and evidence indicates that this prediction is correct. Anecdotal evidence indicates that vaping in middle school and high school bathrooms is a major problem. FreshAir Sensor currently sells tobacco and marijuana smoking sensors along with 24/7 monitoring of the devices. The company has leveraged the knowledge of sensor development to produce preliminary components of an early stage sensing system capable of detecting vaping. Preliminary data to demonstrate this accomplishment is provided. The fast track research described in this proposal will enable the optimization of the sensor as well as commercialization of the resulting instrument in minimal time. The need to reduce and eventually eliminate adolescent vaping is urgent. The deployment of the proposed device in schools and other educational institutions will eliminate vaping during school hours and will, therefore, contribute to improvements in the overall health of adolescents by curtailing nicotine intake. Narrative Vaping has become a problem in schools with students, in steadily increasing numbers, using bathrooms and other less monitored spaces to indulge in the use of the newest vaping hardware. FreshAir Sensor is developing a sensor to detect vaping in otherwise unmonitored spaces. The use of this sensing system has the potential to reduce and, eventually, eliminate vaping behavior in schools, thereby reducing the harmful effects of nicotine in adolescents.",Development/Commercialization of a Sensing Device to Detect Vaping,10187539,R44DA049595,"['Adolescent', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Air', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Chemicals', 'Cigarette Smoker', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dose', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic cigarette', 'Electronics', 'Engineering', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Fatigue', 'Film', 'Goals', 'High School Student', 'Hour', 'Humidity', 'Institution', 'Intake', 'JUUL', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Longevity', 'Marijuana', 'Marijuana Smoking', 'Methods', 'Middle School Student', 'Minor', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Neurotoxins', 'Nicotine', 'Phase', 'Polymers', 'Production', 'Property', 'Public Housing', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sales', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Smoking', 'Specificity', 'Students', 'System', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco smoking behavior', 'Weaning', 'adolescent health', 'base', 'commercialization', 'design', 'detection platform', 'detector', 'electronic cigarette use', 'high school', 'instrument', 'junior high school', 'machine learning algorithm', 'monitoring device', 'prototype', 'research and development', 'response', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'smoking cessation', 'tool', 'vaping', 'vapor']",NIDA,FRESHAIR SENSOR CORPORATION,R44,2021,399000
"Creating a foundation for personalized age- and sex-based immune-targeted therapies from an ALS longitudinal cohort by identifying peripheral and central immune signatures ABSTRACT The immune system contributes to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) progression and survival, and therapies to target the immune system are of burgeoning interest. However, the changes in the immune system during the course of ALS and the sex-specific alterations in immune function warrant a more in depth analysis in order to develop personalized ALS therapies and biomarkers. The long-term goals are to harness the immune sys- tem’s potential to slow and stop the progression of ALS. The overall objective is to determine how peripheral immune profiles, sex, age, and sex hormones, link to neuronal damage, neuroinflammation, and ALS progres- sion and survival. The central hypothesis is that peripheral immune profiles are an important pathophysiologic agent of ALS progression and survival; that sex, age and sex hormone levels impact these profiles; and that insight into ALS patient-specific immune profiles will yield new drug targets and therapeutic windows. Our ra- tionale is that linking patient-specific immune cell profiles to ALS progression and survival will facilitate person- alized immunomodulatory therapeutic development for ALS and identify potential treatment windows. The cen- tral hypothesis will be pursued with three aims: 1) Identify specific immune profiles that associate with ALS pro- gression and survival rates.; 2) Evaluate the effects of sex hormones on ALS immune profiles, progression, and survival; and 3) Identify immune profiles and corresponding cellular pathways that are most toxic to neu- rons and that associate with central inflammation. In Aim 1 longitudinal immunophenotyping of peripheral blood samples from ALS subjects will generate composite immune profiles that will then be linked to ALS subject characteristics, progression, and survival. Aim 2 will determine if observed sex-dependent associations be- tween immune profiles and ALS progression and survival are mediated by sex hormones, as sex hormones can alter immune profiles. Aim 3 will enrich a cohort of ALS subjects by immune profile clusters; their periph- eral immune populations will be analyzed using 1) RNA-seq and 2) cell toxicity studies via co-cultures with iPSC-derived neurons; subjects will also have positron emission tomography (PET) imaging to quantify central neuroinflammation. Datasets will be synthesized to build prediction models and create deep neural networks capable of associating immune profiles with sex, age, disease severity, progression, and survival The research proposed is innovative, in the applicants’ opinion, because it rigorously examines the effects of sex, age, and sex hormone levels on immune cells and ALS progression and survival in a longitudinal study. It also accounts for the interactions between immune cells by forming immune profiles for individual subjects and assesses how specific profiles associate with dysregulated pathways, cytotoxicity, and neuroinflammation. The proposed re- search is significant because it will provide critical data on the distinct immune profiles and pathways associ- ated with ALS progression and survival in a sex-, age- and sex hormone- specific fashion. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because it focuses on identifying the alterations in the im- mune system that impact amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and also focuses on identifying whether these altered immune profiles are influenced by sex- and age-specific factors. The development of such strategies will greatly advance the ability to develop personalized treatment approaches for persons with ALS based on immunomodulatory drugs. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to part of the NIH’s mission that pertains to developing the fundamental knowledge about the nervous system and using that knowledge to reduce the bur- den of neurological disease.",Creating a foundation for personalized age- and sex-based immune-targeted therapies from an ALS longitudinal cohort by identifying peripheral and central immune signatures,10177640,R01NS120926,"['ALS patients', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes', 'Cell Count', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Estrogens', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Gonadal Steroid Hormones', 'Hormones', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune Targeting', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunomodulators', 'Immunophenotyping', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Induced pluripotent stem cell derived neurons', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Mediating', 'Michigan', 'Mission', 'Motor Neuron Disease', 'Natural Killer Cells', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Prostitution', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regulatory T-Lymphocyte', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Severity of illness', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Testosterone', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Tweens', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'amyotrophic lateral sclerosis therapy', 'base', 'biobank', 'cohort', 'cytotoxicity', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'drug development', 'drug repurposing', 'effective therapy', 'immune function', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroinflammation', 'neurotoxicity', 'neutrophil', 'new therapeutic target', 'peripheral blood', 'personalized medicine', 'personalized therapeutic', 'predictive modeling', 'sex', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic development', 'therapeutic target', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2021,643473
"Neutralization Fingerprinting Analysis of Polyclonal Antibody Responses against HIV-1 Project Summary HIV-1 poses a substantial health and economic burden, with more than 30 million people currently infected worldwide. The search for an effective HIV-1 vaccine remains a top priority, and a deeper understanding of how the immune system recognizes HIV-1 can help inform vaccine design. Lately, much effort has focused on understanding the antibody responses to HIV-1 infection. However, the polyclonal neutralizing antibody responses in an individual are very complex. Standard methods for mapping such responses include various experimental techniques, but more recently, computational methods were also developed. These computational methods, which we call NFP (neutralization fingerprinting), are based on analysis of serum neutralization data that is typically obtained in the very first stages of donor sample characterization, and are therefore an efficient technology for accurately mapping antibody specificities in polyclonal responses. The NFP algorithms have already become an important tool in the HIV field and are being used extensively by laboratories throughout the world, including Duke CHAVI-ID, CAPRISA, NIH VRC, and MHRP.  Here, we propose to develop next-generation NFP algorithms and apply them to address biological questions with important implications for understanding the interactions between HIV-neutralizing antibodies and the virus. Specifically, we will develop and apply novel algorithms for: (1) Antibody specificity prediction with significantly improved accuracy and reliability. These algorithms will immensely improve the utility of the NFP approach for prospective identification of antibody specificities in polyclonal sera. (2) Mapping broadly neutralizing antibody responses against novel epitopes on HIV-1 Env. We will use epitope- structural analysis and computational search algorithms to identify novel Env epitopes, and will screen donor samples for the presence of related NFP signals. Promising signals for novel antibody specificities will be characterized further through collaborations. (3) Population-level analysis of broadly neutralizing antibody responses to HIV-1. We will analyze large collections of samples from diverse HIV infection cohorts in order to determine common antibody specificities elicited in response to HIV-1, as well as patterns of potential association between features of the infecting virus sequence and the elicited epitope specificities.  The proposed NFP algorithms will be made available to the public, and will be useful in a number of high-impact areas in the HIV field, including mapping of antibody specificities in previously uncharacterized samples, identification of novel Env epitopes, and large-scale analysis of broadly neutralizing antibody responses within a cohort, or at a population level. Overall, this work will lead to a better understanding of the neutralizing antibody responses against HIV-1 and will build a more complete picture of the epitopes on Env. The proposed algorithmic framework should be generalizable to other important viruses, such as influenza and hepatitis C, and therefore has the potential for a far-reaching impact on public health.

"Digital Melt Curve Analysis Platform for Longitudinal Cancer Patient Monitoring Abstract  Building on its commercially available Absolute Q digital PCR platform, during the 24-month Phase 2 SBIR project, Combinati will complete the development of the first Digital Melt Curve Analysis (DMCA) platform to the market to further advance the adoption of digital genomics for highly accurate, sensitive and reproducible nucleic acid quantification for longitudinal patient monitoring. To provide the “whole product” solution and prove the function, we will demonstrate the DMCA platform with Luminex’s 11- plex ESR1 (Estrogen Receptor 1) assay and conduct Beta testing at Dana Farber Cancer Institute: 1. Three beta instruments and the analysis software capable of digital melt curve analysis. 2. Complete dMCA validation internally with commercially available melt calibration kits. 3. Demonstrate <0.1% Mutation Allele Frequency of 11 cell-free DNA targets using Luminex  Corporation’s discrete melt assay. 4. Beta testing at Dana Farber Cancer Institute Narrative  Since PCR was invented back in 1983, it has become the gold standard for applications requiring quantification of nucleic acids. The continuous evolution of the technology enables PCR to be more quantitative (qPCR), more accurate, precise and reproducible (digital PCR).

"Novel Designs and Methods to Remove Hidden Confounding Bias in Health Sciences Abstract A major approach in causal inference literature aimed at mitigating bias due to unmeasured confounding is the so- called instrumental variable (IV) design which relies on identifying a variable which (i) influences the treatment process, (ii) has no direct effect on the outcome other than through the treatment, and (iii) is independent of any unmeasured confounder. IV methods are very well developed and widely used in social and health science, although validity of IV inferences may not be reliable if any of required assumptions (i)-(iii) is violated. This proposal aims to develop (a) new IV methods robust to violation of any of (i)-(iii); (b) New negative control methods that can be used to detect and sometimes to nonparametrically account for unmeasured confounding bias; (c) New bracketing methods for partial inference about causal effects in comparative interrupted time series studies. The proposed methods will be used to address current scientific queries in three major substantive public health areas:(1) to understand the health effects of air pollution; (2) to quantify the causal effects of modifiable risk factors for Alzheimer's disease and related disorders; (3) To uncover the mechanism by which a randomized package of interventions produced a substantial reduction of HIV incidence in a recent major cluster randomized trial of treatment as prevention in Botswana, Africa. Our proposal will provide the best available analytical methods to date to resolve confounding concerns in these high impact public health applications and more broadly in observational studies in the health sciences. Summary This proposal aims to develop new causal inference methods to tame bias due to hidden confounding factors in obser- vational studies as well as in randomized experiments subject to non-adherence. The proposed methods are firmly grounded in modern semiparametric theory which will be used to obtain more robust and efficient inferences about causal effects in a broad range of public health applications including in Epidemiology of Aging, Environmental Health Epidemiology and HIV/AIDS Prevention.",Novel Designs and Methods to Remove Hidden Confounding Bias in Health Sciences,10159821,R01AG065276,"['AIDS prevention', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Africa', 'Aging', 'Air Pollution', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Area', 'Blood Pressure', 'Body mass index', 'Botswana', 'Cluster randomized trial', 'Data', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Environmental Health', 'Epidemiology', 'Genetic', 'HIV', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Incidence', 'Interruption', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Masks', 'Mendelian randomization', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Applications Research', 'Randomized', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Factors', 'Series', 'Social Sciences', 'Testing', 'Thromboplastin', 'Time', 'ambient air pollution', 'analytical method', 'c new', 'comparative', 'design', 'experimental study', 'genetic variant', 'high dimensionality', 'intervention effect', 'modifiable risk', 'mortality', 'novel', 'pleiotropism', 'semiparametric', 'simulation', 'theories', 'treatment as prevention', 'treatment effect', 'uptake', 'user friendly software']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2021,468961
"MUFA-SIRT1 signaling as a central node regulating healthspan PROJECT SUMMARY Macronutrients serve a multitude of roles beyond provision of energy, with numerous nutrients and/or their downstream metabolites acting as signaling molecules to coordinate cellular metabolism and function. Indeed, numerous nutrient sensing pathways (e.g. mTOR, AMPK and sirtuins) have evolved allowing us to respond to specific nutrients/metabolites, which in turn impacts healthspan. Sirtuins are largely thought to be driven by redox, whereby high levels of NAD, a cofactor in the sirtuin reaction and indicator of low energy charge, drives sirtuin-catalyzed deacylation of target proteins. SIRT1, the most-studied sirtuin, is a key nutrient sensing node that regulates a plethora of cellular functions to promote lifespan extension and healthy aging. As a result, there is immense interest in the use of SIRT1 activating compounds (STACs) to prevent or treat a wide range of aging-related disease. The links between dietary macronutrients, nutrient sensing and healthspan have historically focused upon caloric or protein restriction with limited attention given to dietary lipids. However, a small and growing body of literature has linked monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) to improved healthspan. In addition to positive effects on lifespan and healthy aging in model organisms, dietary MUFAs have been linked to wide-ranging health benefits in epidemiological studies and, since they are a primary constituent of olive oil, thought to contribute to the benefits of the Mediterranean Diet. Despite these studies, little is known about the biological underpinnings through which MUFAs elicit their beneficial health effects. We have previously shown that lipid droplet catabolism (i.e. lipolysis) increases SIRT1 and downstream PGC-1a/PPAR- a signaling as a means to increase mitochondrial biogenesis and function during times of nutrient deprivation. Our preliminary data show for the first time that MUFAs released specifically from lipolysis are trafficked to the nucleus where they allosterically activate SIRT1 towards select acetylated peptide substrates. This discovery makes MUFAs the first-known endogenous allosteric activators of SIRT1. Moreover, we show that MUFAs activate SIRT1 through a similar mechanism to resveratrol suggesting that MUFA signaling may modulate the response to exogenous SIRT1 activators. Based on these preliminary data, the objective of this application is to further characterize the role of MUFAs as endogenous SIRT1 activators. We hypothesize that MUFAs selectively activate SIRT1 to modulate the response to numerous dietary interventions known to impact healthspan. To test our objective, we propose the following aims: Aim 1: To define how MUFAs modulate SIRT1 substrate selectivity. Aim 2: To characterize the SIRT1-dependent effects of MUFAs/olive oil on healthspan. Aim 3: To determine the contribution of MUFAs in mediating the response to STACs or caloric restriction. Upon completion of the proposes studies, we will have further expanded our understanding of SIRT1 biology allowing for refined approaches to activate SIRT1 to promote healthy aging. NARRATIVE The proposed studies will advance our understanding into the underlying biology linking dietary factors to healthspan. The data gleaned from these studies will help refine therapeutic or nutritional avenues to modulate lifespan and aging-related diseases resulting in a direct, positive impact on human health.",MUFA-SIRT1 signaling as a central node regulating healthspan,10263268,R01AG069768,"['Aging', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Attention', 'Biogenesis', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Caloric Restriction', 'Catabolism', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cell physiology', 'Charge', 'Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Deacetylation', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Dietary Factors', 'Dietary Fats', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'FRAP1 gene', 'Fasting', 'Glean', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Human', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Lipolysis', 'Literature', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Macronutrients Nutrition', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Mediterranean Diet', 'Metabolism', 'Mitochondria', 'Modeling', 'Monounsaturated Fatty Acids', 'Mus', 'Nutrient', 'Nutritional', 'Oils', 'Olive oil preparation', 'Olives - dietary', 'Outcome', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'PPAR alpha', 'Pathway interactions', 'Peptides', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Reaction', 'Research', 'Resveratrol', 'Role', 'SIRT1 gene', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signaling Molecule', 'Sirtuins', 'Source', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Work', 'analog', 'base', 'cofactor', 'deacylation', 'detection of nutrient', 'dietary', 'epidemiology study', 'healthspan', 'healthy aging', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'middle age', 'mutant mouse model', 'novel', 'nutrient deprivation', 'polyphenol', 'prevent', 'red wine', 'response']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2021,317579
"Construal level as a novel pathway for affect regulation and cancer control 7. Project Summary/Abstract Lung cancer is the leading major cause of preventable death in the United States, and cigarette smoking is a contributor to lung cancer in 80%–90% of cases. Though adult cigarette smoking rates have declined substantially during the past 50 years, they remain as high as 30% in certain groups, such as individuals living in poverty. Quitting is difficult: a given quit attempt results in cessation in fewer than 10% of cases, and most adult cigarette smokers have attempted and failed to quit, and often many times. What is urgently needed are novel interventions for cigarette smoking cessation that operate through different mechanisms from those targeted by existing interventions, which are likely to have been unsuccessful for persistent smokers. A barrier to progress is that the mechanisms of action of most treatments are not known, which makes it difficult to know which treatment will work best for whom. We turn to affective science to identify a candidate technique that could serve as the basis for a novel intervention. Research on affect regulation typically focuses on down- regulation of affective states, such as craving for cigarettes, using effortful strategies such as cognitive reappraisal. However, a new insight in affect regulation is that people can construe, or subjectively understand, events with varying levels of abstraction, and that construing health-related behaviors in high- versus low-level terms promotes health behavior in several domains. For example, smokers who want to quit are more likely to resist a cigarette when they construe the same event (e.g., “abstinence”) in more abstract, high-level terms (e.g., “becoming a better me”) versus more concrete, low-level terms (e.g., “not smoking this cigarette”). There is some evidence that high-level construal might rely on distinct mechanisms from traditional affect regulation and smoking reduction interventions, but its mechanisms of action are unknown. Directly comparing its mechanisms to those of alternative affect regulation strategies and developing tools to induce high-level construal are the next steps on the path toward developing a novel intervention. Also, establishing individual differences in the effects of high-level construal will allow future interventions to be targeted to the individuals for whom they will be maximally effective. We identified two candidate mechanisms through which high-level construal might operate: down-regulation of craving and up-regulation of goal energization (i.e., motivation to quit). Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) revealed the neural systems engaged by those processes to be distinct. So, we will use multivariate analyses of fMRI data to quantify the similarity of high-level construal to each candidate (Aim 1). This will be done in a longitudinal translational experiment with 4 conditions—high- level construal, down-regulation of craving, up-regulation of goal energization, and treatment-as-usual—in a sample of persistent smokers in poverty, who are the most likely to benefit from a novel, theory-based treatment. The sample size (N = 240) affords an examination of individual differences in the effect of high-level construal on neural activity and craving, and the degree to which they predict smoking reduction (Aim 2). 8. Project Narrative Cigarette smoking is among the leading causes of preventable death in the United States because smoking increases risk for lung cancer and various diseases. Though U.S. smoking rates have declined, a substantial percentage of adults, particularly those living in poverty who have repeatedly tried and failed to quit, still smoke and therefore could benefit from novel interventions for cessation that operate through different mechanisms than those of traditional treatments. This study will use neuroimaging to uncover the mechanisms of action of a promising strategy for affect regulation and smoking cessation and also build profiles of individuals for whom this strategy does and does not work, thereby providing tangible and practical information that public health professionals and clinicians can use to inform personalized treatments for cigarette smoking cessation.",Construal level as a novel pathway for affect regulation and cancer control,10127602,R01CA240452,"['Abstinence', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Behavior', 'Cancer Control', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cigarette', 'Cigarette Smoker', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Disease', 'Down-Regulation', 'Event', 'Fire - disasters', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health Professional', 'Health Promotion', 'Health behavior', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Informal Social Control', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lateral', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Medial', 'Motivation', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Personality Traits', 'Persons', 'Poverty', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Psychology', 'Public Health', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Science', 'Smoke', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'Training', 'Triage', 'United States', 'Up-Regulation', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'cigarette craving', 'cigarette smoking', 'cognitive process', 'cognitive reappraisal', 'cost', 'craving', 'efficacy trial', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'fighting', 'insight', 'lens', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'personalized strategies', 'preventable death', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'smoking cessation', 'theories', 'tobacco control', 'tool', 'treatment as usual', 'treatment response']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF OREGON,R01,2021,595543
"High Throughput Screen and High Information Follow-Up Tests for Genotoxicants Project Summary  Current batteries of genetic toxicology assays exhibit several critical deficiencies. First, the throughput capacity of in vitro genotoxicity tests is low, and does not meet current needs, especially for early, high volume screening environments that need to prioritize chemicals for further testing and/or development. Second, conventional assays provide simplistic binary calls, genotoxic or non-genotoxic. In this scheme there is little or no information provided about genotoxic mode of action. This is severely limiting, as it does not generate key information necessary for prioritizing chemicals for further testing, guiding subsequent assays’ endpoints/experimental designs, or conducting risk assessments. Finally, most current assays do not place requisite emphasis on dose response relationships, and therefore do not contextualize the results in terms of potency. These deficiencies prevent genotoxicity data from optimally contributing to modern risk assessments, where all of these capabilities and high information content are essential. We will solve these issues by developing, optimizing, and validating a two-tiered testing strategy based on multiplexed DNA damage responsive biomarkers and high-speed flow cytometric analysis. The first-tier focuses on throughput and is used to prioritize likely genotoxicants for more comprehensive analysis in second tier testing. Specifically, it involves a collection of several multiplexed biomarkers that will be used to identify likely genotoxic agents and provide a preliminary assessment of genotoxic mode of action. The gH2AX biomarker detects DNA double strand breaks, phospho-histone H3 identifies mitotic cells, nuclear p53 content reports on p53 activation in response to DNA damage, the frequency of 8n+ cells measure polyploidization, and the ratio of nuclei to microsphere counts provides information about treatment-related cytotoxicity. The second tier focuses on information content and considers many more concentrations as well as additional biomarkers, including micronucleus formation. Collectively, the tier two results provide definitive predictions about test chemicals’ genotoxic potential, mode of action, and potency. Over the course of this project we will study more than 3,000 diverse chemicals in order to understand the performance characteristics and generalizability of the two-tiered testing strategy. An interlaboratory trial will be conducted with prototype assay kits to assess the transferability of the methods, with the ultimate goal of providing the Nation with commercially available kits and testing services. Project Narrative Some chemicals in commercial use and in the environment can cause DNA damage and this damage can contribute to the development of cancer and other severe diseases. We will develop, optimize, and validate an improved testing strategy based on highly automated processes tracking several DNA damage biomarkers that can be analyzed without the need for animal testing.

"Identification of Novel Agents to Treat PTSD using Clinical Data PROJECT SUMMARY This study will leverage large-scale clinical data from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to identify existing pharmaceutical agents commonly prescribed for a multitude of indications that are incidentally associated with improvements in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms. Through prior efforts, a data source containing almost 20 years of treatment data on all (over one million) VA users diagnosed with PTSD between October 1999 and February 2018 has been constructed, including a complete historical record of their evidence-based medication and psychotherapy receipt within the VA healthcare system. Importantly, the team has also amassed symptom-level patient-reported PTSD outcome data for hundreds of thousands of these patients. The existing data is a powerful resource with which the research team proposes to explore the following specific aims: (1) identify off-label pharmaceutical agents associated with improvements in PTSD symptoms over time; (2) further evaluate the clinical effectiveness of newly-identified off-label pharmaceutical agents for improvement in PTSD symptoms using rigorous causal methods; and (3) identify common adverse events related to off-label pharmaceutical agents associated with improvements in PTSD symptoms in this complex, psychiatrically and medically ill population The proposed project will identify agents that may merit further rigorous clinical evaluation for psychiatric benefit. New therapeutic targets may be identified that will lead to greater treatment options or specific treatments. Further, identification of off-label medications that improve or have contraindicated effects for psychiatric populations will provide critical guidance to practicing clinicians. PROJECT NARRATIVE Currently, there are few psychopharmacologic treatments for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and available medications do not work sufficiently. In a recent published statement, NIMH noted that “The National Institute of Mental Health would relish the chance to partner with our VA colleagues to exploit [VA data] with the aim of providing guidelines for evidence-based pharmacotherapy for those suffering from PTSD, Veterans and civilians alike.” The proposed study was specifically designed in response to that call; it will use exploratory methods to identify off-label medications that are effective for the treatment of PTSD using a large VA medical records-based dataset.",Identification of Novel Agents to Treat PTSD using Clinical Data,10150094,R01MH121397,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adverse event', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Biological Psychiatry', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical effectiveness', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease remission', 'Effectiveness', 'Evaluation', 'Fluoxetine', 'Future', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Label', 'Leadership', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Paroxetine', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Pharmacology', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Psychopharmacology', 'Psychotherapy', 'Psychotropic Drugs', 'Publishing', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Retrospective cohort', 'Scanning', 'Sertraline', 'Severities', 'Symptoms', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Time', 'Trees', 'United States Department of Veterans Affairs', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Veterans', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'comorbidity', 'data mining', 'data resource', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'evidence base', 'evidence based guidelines', 'improved', 'machine learning method', 'military veteran', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'off-label drug', 'prospective', 'psychopharmacologic', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'symptomatic improvement', 'therapy development', 'treatment guidelines', 'venlafaxine', 'working group']",NIMH,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,R01,2021,554790
"Improving Glycemic Management in Patients with Type 1 Diabetes Using a Context-aware Automated Insulin Delivery System Project Summary Automated insulin delivery (AID) systems offer substantial opportunities for helping people with type 1 diabetes (T1D) to improve glucose control and lower HbA1c. However, the AID has only shown a benefit during the nighttime when meals, exercise, and stress do not significantly challenge the AID. Furthermore, hypoglycemia (<70 mg/dL) remains a common occurrence in people with type 1 diabetes and continues to occur even in the setting of AID, particularly with exercise. Integrating context awareness into an AID has the potential to improve glycemic time in range (70-180 mg/dL) during the daytime and reduce and possibly eliminate hypoglycemia. Contextual information can include inferred food intake, insulin dosing, inferred exercise type and duration, as well as movement patterns. An AID can be designed to recognize contextual patterns that relate to poor glycemic responses to meals and hypoglycemia and then adjust insulin dosing in response to these patterns in advance and help mitigate these problems. In this grant, we will explore how contextual information may be used within an AID to help (1) avoid hypoglycemia and (2) reduce postprandial dysglycemia. We will first conduct a data gathering study whereby we will collect a rich data set from people with T1D who will use sensor augmented pump therapy to manage their glucose. Data will be collected from these 30 patients over 28 days; data will include multivariable contextual information including continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data, insulin data, food data, physical activity data (heart rate and accelerometry), as well as indoor/outdoor contextual movement patterns gathered using a novel beacon-based context-aware sensing system called MotioWear developed by our group in collaboration with our industry partner MotioSens. Next, we will utilize this contextual data set to construct a Bayesian glucose prediction algorithm. This will include a clustering algorithm that will group contextual sequences that are similar with each other and which lead to similar glycemic outcomes. This context-aware glucose prediction algorithm will be integrated into an adaptive, personalized, smartwatch-based context-aware AID (CA-AID) system. Contextual patterns that have a high likelihood of leading to hypoglycemia or postprandial dysglycemia will inform an insulin dosing aggressiveness factor to be adjusted for similar contextual sequences observed in the future (i.e. the CA-AID will reduce insulin for contextual sequences with high likelihood of hypoglycemia such as aerobic exercise). We expect that integrating context awareness into an AID will lead to significant improvements in time in target range during the day and will help reduce time in hypoglycemia. The CA-AID will be evaluated for safety in a small pilot study. We will then evaluate the CA-AID within a 6 week clinical study in 40 adults with type 1 diabetes on insulin pump therapy. Twenty will receive the CA-AID while the other 20 will receive a standard (non-context-aware) AID. The primary outcome measures of this study is the percent time in range. We hypothesize that the CA-AID will increase time in range by 10% as compared with a non-context aware AID. Project Narrative Diabetes is the leading cause of blindness, kidney failure, and non-traumatic amputations. While automated insulin delivery systems can help people with type 1 diabetes better manage their glucose levels during the night, improved glycemic control during the day has not been demonstrated and hypoglycemia continues to be a problem, especially during exercise. We propose to develop and evaluate in a clinical study a context-aware automated insulin delivery system that learns patterns of daily living, meal patterns, glucose patterns, insulin dosing patterns, and physical activity patterns that relate to dysglycemia and adapts the gains within the AID to improve postprandial time in target range (70-180 mg/dL) and reduce hypoglycemia.",Improving Glycemic Management in Patients with Type 1 Diabetes Using a Context-aware Automated Insulin Delivery System,10147069,R01DK122583,"['Accelerometer', 'Adult', 'Aerobic Exercise', 'Algorithms', 'Awareness', 'Beds', 'Behavior', 'Blindness', 'Calibration', 'Cellular Phone', 'Clinic', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Dose', 'Eating', 'Engineering', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Food', 'Future', 'Glucose', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'Grant', 'Heart Rate', 'Home environment', 'Hyperglycemia', 'Hypoglycemia', 'Insulin', 'Insulin Infusion Systems', 'Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Kidney Failure', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Movement', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Outpatients', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Pilot Projects', 'Pump', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Restaurants', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Safety', 'Schedule', 'Stress', 'System', 'Tactile', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Wrist', 'arm', 'base', 'blood glucose regulation', 'cohort', 'design', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'expectation', 'fitbit', 'fitness', 'glucose monitor', 'glucose sensor', 'glycemic control', 'high risk', 'improved', 'industry partner', 'machine learning algorithm', 'novel', 'prediction algorithm', 'primary outcome', 'recruit', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'sensor', 'smart watch', 'two-arm study', 'usability', 'wearable sensor technology']",NIDDK,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,561582
"Macrophage Phenotype Transition as the Biological Mechanism of Chronic Wound Healing Treated with Non-Thermal, Non-Cavitational Therapeutic Ultrasound PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT Chronic wounds affect approximately 6.5 million patients in the United States. Current standard protocols for wound management do not guarantee healing and focus on maintaining a wound environment that is conducive to passive self-healing. Hence, there is a need to develop alternative treatments that promote active healing and shorten healing time leading to reduced costs. We have previously reported that treatment with low-frequency (20-100 kHz), low-intensity (50-150 mW/cm2) ultrasound (LFLI US) significantly (p<0.03) reduces venous ulcer size in vivo as compared to wounds treated with a sham device. This proposal aims at determining the biological mechanisms by which LFLI US promotes chronic wound healing in vitro. There is evidence that the cause of impaired healing is the dysregulation of macrophage phenotype, especially the defective transition from pro- inflammatory (M1) to pro-healing (M2) macrophages. Our characterization of tissue debrided from chronic wounds has shown that healing chronic wounds contain higher proportions of M1-like than M2- like macrophages. Additionally, the signaling protein Rac2, downstream of integrin and focal adhesion kinase activation, is a key regulator of mechanotransduction in macrophages and facilitates the transition of macrophages from the M1 to M2 phenotype. The proposed study will systematically examine the effects of LFLI ultrasound on macrophage phenotype, using macrophages cultured in three-dimensional (3D) scaffolds. We hypothesize that LFLI US directly and indirectly stimulates the transition of pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages to pro-healing M2 macrophages via Rac2. This project will enhance our understanding of chronic wound healing and the potential of therapeutic ultrasound to accelerate healing. Aim 1 will elucidate the direct effects of LFLI US on macrophage function and phenotype by treating inflammatory macrophages directly with LFLI US and characterizing functional changes (proliferation, migration, and phagocytosis), protein/cytokine secretion, and gene expression. Concurrently, we will validate Rac2 as the potential mechanotransduction pathway which promotes M1 to M2 macrophages transition by analyzing integrins, focal adhesion kinases, and Rac2 via confocal microscopy and RNA characterization. [Aim 2 will validate the in vitro findings from Aim 1 using our previously developed diagnostic M1/M2 score on debrided tissue from chronic wound patients treated with LFLI US.] Aim 3 will elucidate the indirect effects of LFLI US on macrophage function and phenotype via a 3D macrophage fibroblast co-culture. The results of this study will inform the optimal design of LFLI ultrasound therapy protocols, lead to a personalized, active treatment for chronic wounds, accelerate chronic wound healing, and contribute to reduced annual wound care costs. Project Narrative Chronic wounds currently affect approximately 6.5 million patients in the United States and an excess of 25 billion dollars is spent annually on treatment. Current standards of care for chronic wounds, including months of weekly re-dressings and debridement, fails to guarantee active wound healing or closure. To address this issue, we propose to determine the biological mechanism responsible for therapeutic ultrasound mediated healing, low-intensity (<100mW/cm2), low-frequency (20kHz) ultrasound that has been shown to accelerate chronic wound closure in pilot clinical studies.","Macrophage Phenotype Transition as the Biological Mechanism of Chronic Wound Healing Treated with Non-Thermal, Non-Cavitational Therapeutic Ultrasound",10137782,F31AR074847,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adhesions', 'Affect', 'Biological', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Care', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Confocal Microscopy', 'Debridement', 'Devices', 'Diagnostic', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Exhibits', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Fibroblasts', 'Focal Adhesion Kinase 1', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Impaired healing', 'In Vitro', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Integrins', 'Lead', 'Mechanics', 'Mediating', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phagocytosis', 'Phenotype', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Prunella vulgaris', 'RNA', 'RNA analysis', 'Reporting', 'Role', 'Signaling Protein', 'Source', 'Sterile coverings', 'Stimulus', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Ultrasonic Therapy', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Varicose Ulcer', 'active method', 'alternative treatment', 'angiogenesis', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'care costs', 'cell type', 'chronic wound', 'cost', 'cytokine', 'design', 'diabetic ulcer', 'healing', 'human tissue', 'in vivo', 'knock-down', 'machine learning algorithm', 'macrophage', 'mechanotransduction', 'migration', 'rac2 GTP-binding protein', 'scaffold', 'three dimensional cell culture', 'wound', 'wound care', 'wound closure', 'wound environment', 'wound healing', 'wound treatment']",NIAMS,DREXEL UNIVERSITY,F31,2021,46036
"Quantitative and Spectroscopic Imaging of Skeletal Muscle Changes in Sarcopenia at High Field Project Summary Sarcopenia, a condition characterized by loss of muscle mass and function in the elderly, is of increasing relevance in the United States due to its aging population. It is generally agreed that the weakening of the muscle in sarcopenia cannot be explained by loss of muscle mass alone, but the mechanisms behind this remain poorly understood. This is partly due to the lack of non-invasive techniques for observing muscle structure and composition in high detail. We propose to develop MRI techniques to measure muscle morphology, microstructure, and fat content to get a detailed view of the changes in muscle quantity and quality in patients with sarcopenia and how they relate to more easily attainable measurements of muscle function such as grip strength and gait speed. This would provide an important contribution to the ongoing debate about how such measurements could be used to define sarcopenia, which would pave the way for treatment development. We aim to develop novel methods to investigate the structure and composition of muscle using ultra-high-field MRI. Specifically, we aim to (1) obtain water-based images of skeletal muscle macro- and microstructure with unparalleled efficiency, image quality, and resolution; (2) obtain images of the spatial distribution of intramyocellular lipids in skeletal muscle, measuring both methyl and methylene to estimate saturation; and (3) to conduct a study comparing skeletal muscle structure and quality by looking at MR measurements of T2 relaxation rates, diffusivity (as proxies for inflammation and fiber size, respectively), fat fraction, and lipid composition, in subjects with sarcopenia and healthy controls and see how these quantities correlate to muscle function. This project has several innovative aspects. First, we will develop a method to estimate muscle morphology, T2 relaxation rates, and diffusivity with a single MRI sequence. Importantly, this will make the developed method easy to run at other MRI sites. Second, we will devise methods to perform robust, efficient imaging of intramyocellular lipid droplet distribution and saturation in human skeletal muscle in vivo at high field. Both of these methods will have unparalleled signal-to-noise ratio and robustness against image artifacts. The significance of this work is the investigation of the role of inflammation, fiber size, and lipid distribution in the weakening of muscle in sarcopenia and how these measurements are related to muscle function. The resulting conclusions and techniques may help establish a common standard for the definition of sarcopenia and aid in the development of future treatments for this condition. Project Narrative Sarcopenia, the loss of muscle mass and function with age, is a condition bound to increase in prevalence with an aging population. The muscle changes involved include not only reduction in mass but also changes in muscle quality not easily visualized with current methods. This work aims to develop efficient MRI techniques to investigate these changes in better detail, improving scientific understanding of the mechanisms of sarcopenia and how they relate to muscle function.",Quantitative and Spectroscopic Imaging of Skeletal Muscle Changes in Sarcopenia at High Field,10125507,K99AG066815,"['3-Dimensional', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Awareness', 'Biological Markers', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Diffusion', 'Elderly', 'Evaluation', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Fiber', 'Fracture', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Gait speed', 'Geriatrics', 'Goals', 'Hand Strength', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Inflammation', 'Investigation', 'Life Expectancy', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Marker', 'Methods', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Morphology', 'Muscle', 'Muscle function', 'Muscular Atrophy', 'Noise', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Protons', 'Proxy', 'Relaxation', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Running', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Skeletal Muscle', 'Soleus Muscle', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'United States', 'Water', 'Work', 'aging population', 'base', 'bone imaging', 'carbene', 'clinical biomarkers', 'design', 'falls', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'muscle form', 'muscle strength', 'muscular structure', 'novel', 'potential biomarker', 'quantitative imaging', 'radio frequency', 'recruit', 'sarcopenia', 'spectroscopic imaging', 'therapy development']",NIA,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K99,2021,114480
"Pro-inflammatory activation of human macrophages regulated by lncRNAs Project Summary Macrophage activation promotes major inflammatory disorders, including arterial diseases. Its underlying mechanisms, however, remain obscure. The present study will establish a systems approach, involving computational prediction analyses, multi-omics, network science, and in vitro and in vivo validation, to discover long noncoding RNA (lncRNA)-mediated mechanisms for pro-inflammatory activation of macrophages and arterial disease. In Specific Aim 1, we will involve omics studies of human macrophages to identify lncRNAs and their interacting proteins and develop computational analyses to predict human lncRNAs that regulate macrophage activation. Specific Aim 2 will examine the functionality of candidate lncRNAs in macrophage activation in vitro and in vivo. The findings from the study will help to identify new mechanisms for macrophage activation and may provide molecular bases for new therapies. Project Narrative Inflammation plays a key role in coronary artery disease and other major vascular diseases, global health threats. Even with potent risk modifiers, e.g., statins, many patients still suffer vascular events. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) regulate various biological processes.

"Learning-Based Approach for Personalized Craniomaxillofacial Surgical Planning Abstract: Our main clinical objective for this project is to provide personalized precision care to patients with craniomaxillofacial (CMF) deformities by significantly improving the surgical planning method. CMF deformities involve congenital and acquired deformities of the jaws and face. A large number of patients in the US and around the world suffer from CMF deformities. The basic principles of CMF surgery involve the restoration of deformed CMF structures back to normal anatomy and functions with osteotomy, autologous, bone grafts, or vascularized free flaps. The success of CMF surgery depends on not only the technical aspects of the operation, but also, to a large extent, the precise formulation of a surgical plan. However, CMF surgical planning is extremely challenging due to the complex nature of CMF anatomy and deformity. During a routine CMF surgical planning, a surgeon first acquires a three-dimensional (3D) model of the patient's skull. He then performs 3D cephalometric analysis to quantify the deformity. Finally, the surgery is simulated by virtually cutting the 3D model into multiple bony segments. The surgeon then tries his best to move and rotate each segment individually to a desired position within the normal range of cephalometric values (the current standard of care). This is problematic as “normal” cephalometric values are the averageness of normal population, in which each value has a mean and a standard deviation. Due to the variation within the normal values, the surgeon must often guess what the exact value the patient's cephalometric measurement should be corrected to. In addition, cephalometry is a group of only linear and angular measurements, which certainly cannot represent the complex nature of human CMF structures. Therefore, surgical outcomes are often subjective and heavily dependent on the surgeons' experience and artistic talent. Because each human face is different, the average “normal values” cannot represent the complex morphology of each individual face. To this end, we hypothesize that if a surgeon can foresee what the normal CMF shape of the patient should be, the surgical plan will be objective and personalized. Therefore, in this project, we propose developing and validating a new surgical planning method of using patient-specific and anatomically-correct reference models. The feasibility of our approach has already been proven by our preliminary studies. The results of this project will significantly improve the quality of patient care by developing personalized and precise surgical plans for CMF surgery objectively. The results will be especially beneficial to patients with jaw deformities, syndromic and non-syndromic craniofacial deformities, trauma, and CMF cancer. In the future, our approach can also be used to design and print 3D patient-specific resorbable bone implants with tissue engineering capability for bone regeneration. Project Narrative:  The current standard of care of making treatment plan for patients with craniomaxillofacial (CMF)  deformities is cephalometric analysis, including a group of linear and angular measurements, which  cannot represent the complex morphology of human CMF facial structures.  We propose to develop and validate an innovative shape-based surgical planning method of using  patient-specific and anatomically-correct reference models, for replacing the current subjective  cephalometric method.  The results of this project will significantly improve the quality of patient care by developing  personalized and precise surgical plans for CMF surgery objectively, which is especially beneficial  to the patients with jaw deformities, syndromic and non-syndromic deformities, trauma, and CMF cancer.",Learning-Based Approach for Personalized Craniomaxillofacial Surgical Planning,10197880,R01DE027251,"['3-Dimensional', '3D Print', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Autologous', 'Back', 'Bilateral', 'Blood Vessels', 'Bone Regeneration', 'Bone Tissue', 'Bone Transplantation', 'Cephalometry', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computer Assisted', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Deformity', 'Development', 'Ensure', 'Face', 'Formulation', 'Future', 'Head', 'Human', 'Human Characteristics', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Jaw', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Motivation', 'Nature', 'Normal Range', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Orthodontics', 'Osteotomy', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Quality of Care', 'Research', 'Running', 'Shapes', 'Structure', 'Surgeon', 'Surgical Flaps', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Talents', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissue Engineering', 'Tissue Model', 'Trauma', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'bone', 'cone-beam computed tomography', 'craniofacial', 'craniomaxillofacial', 'cranium', 'deep learning', 'design', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'knowledge base', 'novel', 'operation', 'personalized approach', 'personalized care', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'psychologic', 'restoration', 'skull base', 'soft tissue', 'standard of care', 'success', 'surgery outcome', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'treatment planning', 'two-dimensional', 'usability', 'user-friendly', 'virtual reality simulator', 'virtual surgery']",NIDCR,METHODIST HOSPITAL RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2021,574725
"Classifying Oral Lesions with Chip-on-tip Electrical Impedance Sensing ABSTRACT No real-time quantitative devices are clinically used to assess oral lesions during routine examination, making in-clinic diagnostic and longitudinal monitoring challenging. Instead, lesions are evaluated through visual inspection and then histopathological analysis of tissue samples extracted during biopsy. Identifying premalignant and malignant oral lesions early is critical to ensuring effective treatment is provided to patients with malignancies. Oral cancer currently has one of the lowest 5-year survival rates (50% or less) among major cancer types, largely due to the challenges in identifying premalignant and malignant lesions early. Clearly, a real-time in-clinic device able to classify oral lesions as benign, premalignant, or malignant has the potential to provide immediate impact to patient care. Significantly different electrical property signatures have been observed between benign and malignant tissues in a variety of organs, including tongue; since the bioelectrical properties are so dependent on tissue architecture and morphology, we hypothesize that sensing and imaging these properties in the context of oral lesions will enable us to accurately characterize and classify morphologically-different benign, premalignant, and malignant oral lesions. We have developed an endoscopic electrical impedance imaging (EII) device for use in intraoperative surgical margin assessment that we aim to optimize for in-clinic oral lesion assessment. We aim to take the significant step of translating our extensive experience in impedance imaging to develop an oral lesion imaging device that can be deployed safely, and in the clinic, to provide real-time feedback regarding oral lesion classification. We propose constructing a novel chip-on-tip EII probe to sense and image at near microscopic resolution oral lesions in an effort to provide clinicians with real-time, accurate classification of oral lesion pathology that can be used for diagnostic and longitudinal monitoring purposes. The probe will be evaluated on a series of in vivo human oral lesions and compared with histopathological analysis of biopsy samples. The low-cost of a device such as this makes it an ideal technology for low-resource settings and the safety and real-time capabilities of the system make it ideal for continuously following lesions. PROJECT NARRATIVE Visual inspection of oral lesions is not sufficient for accurately classifying lesions as benign, premalignant, or malignant. The electrical properties of oral lesion have the potential to be used as a contrast mechanism to accurately classify oral lesions so that optimal treatment can be provided to patients with malignant lesions. We intend to deploy a novel small field of view chip-on-tip electrical impedance imaging (EII) probe in a cohort of patients with oral lesions to evaluate the efficacy of using EII for oral lesion classification.",Classifying Oral Lesions with Chip-on-tip Electrical Impedance Sensing,10287597,R21DE031095,"['Architecture', 'Area', 'Benign', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Biopsy Specimen', 'Cancerous', 'Carcinoma', 'Carcinoma in Situ', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Contralateral', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dysplasia', 'Electrodes', 'Electronics', 'Ensure', 'Epithelial', 'Excision', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Hand', 'Histologic', 'Human', 'Hyperplasia', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Ionizing radiation', 'Length', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Measurement', 'Microscopic', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Noise', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Oral Characters', 'Oral cavity', 'Organ', 'Oropharyngeal', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Research Design', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Squamous Cell', 'Surgical margins', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Tongue', 'Translating', 'Visual', 'analog', 'base', 'bioelectricity', 'cancer type', 'cohort', 'cost', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'efficacy evaluation', 'electric impedance', 'electrical impedance tomography', 'electrical property', 'experience', 'extracellular', 'imaging probe', 'imaging properties', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'malignant mouth neoplasm', 'monitoring device', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'oral lesion', 'oral tissue', 'premalignant', 'pressure', 'pressure sensor', 'programs', 'response', 'soft tissue']",NIDCR,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R21,2021,191061
"Distinguishing normal aging from age-related macular degeneration at the level of single cells int eh living human eye Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of blindness in the elderly in the developed world; no cure exists and prevalence is rising rapidly. Because only primates have a macula and since no model of AMD exists in non-human primates, the disease course can only be elucidated through in-depth study of humans. Blindness in AMD is caused by progressive and irreversible death of rod and cone photoreceptors secondary to degeneration of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) that is essential for their health and function. Clinical imaging and histology have informed us greatly about the later stages of disease but fundamental knowledge to understand how AMD diverges from normal aging at onset is lacking. With advanced adaptive optics ophthalmoscopy (AOO) imaging methods, combined with clinical imaging and visual function testing, we will characterize healthy human retinal aging in cross-sectional study, by defining the in vivo RPE-photoreceptor cellular organization and microscopic autofluorescence variation with age and wavelength. This will produce the largest quantitative in vivo normative dataset of AOO cell-based metrics to date and we will use this data to generate new quantitative analysis tools needed to evaluate emerging therapies designed to prevent or slow vision loss in AMD (Aim 1). In a case-control study, we will then compare normal photoreceptor topography and RPE cell morphometry to clinically defined early AMD to quantitatively define the earliest cellular changes in AMD that can be detected in vivo. This work will identify the cellular alterations and phenotypes that differentiate normal aging from early AMD to facilitate early onset detection. These results will be contextualized by comparison to tissue-level alterations seen with aging and early AMD in clinical imaging, specifically choriocapillaris decline and drusen (Aim 2). The results of this study will result in a paradigm shift from the use of clinical diagnosis and classification systems for AMD that rely solely on tissue- level biomarkers or traditional funduscopic clinical signs to those that rely on rigorous quantitative in vivo cell- based metrics. Together, this knowledge and these tools will lay the foundation needed to develop and evaluate new preventative therapies that are needed to limit or prevent vision loss in AMD. Project Narrative Age-related macular degeneration is the leading cause of blindness in the elderly in the US and is a significant public health issue that is projected to worsen due to the rapidly aging population. Here we aim to understand how retinal cells change in normal aging and how these normal age-related changes differ from the changes that lead to age-related macular degeneration. This project will allow us to detect age-related macular degeneration earlier and will produce new tools to monitor retinal cells that will facilitate the development and testing of preventative therapies to slow or prevent vision loss in age-related macular degeneration.",Distinguishing normal aging from age-related macular degeneration at the level of single cells int eh living human eye,10172913,R01EY030517,"['Age', 'Age related macular degeneration', 'Aging', 'Area', 'Atrophic', 'Biological Markers', 'Blindness', 'Bruch&apos', 's basal membrane structure', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Choroid', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Cytoplasmic Granules', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Disease', 'Drusen', 'Elderly', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Foundations', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Histology', 'Histopathology', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Lipofuscin', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Melanins', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Ophthalmoscopy', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Optics', 'Perfusion', 'Phenotype', 'Photoreceptors', 'Prevalence', 'Preventive therapy', 'Preventive treatment', 'Primate Diseases', 'Primates', 'Public Health', 'Retina', 'Retinal Cone', 'Retinal Degeneration', 'Retinal Photoreceptors', 'Risk', 'Secondary to', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Structure', 'Structure of retinal pigment epithelium', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapy Evaluation', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Variant', 'Vertebrate Photoreceptors', 'Vision', 'Work', 'adaptive optics', 'age related', 'aging population', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical imaging', 'cohort', 'early onset', 'fluorophore', 'healthy aging', 'imaging modality', 'imaging platform', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'macula', 'morphometry', 'multimodality', 'neurovascular unit', 'nonhuman primate', 'normal aging', 'prevent', 'restorative treatment', 'retinal imaging', 'retinal rods', 'therapy design', 'tool']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2021,524330
"Empower treatment effects evaluation of randomized clinical trials for elderly patients with integrated real-world data PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) are the gold-standard method of evaluating cancer treatment, which has immense health and economic burdens worldwide. However, practical considerations that allow an RCT to be conducted typically require a relatively small sample size and restricted eligibility criteria such that the study has inadequate power to generalize treatment effects to elderly patients or other under-represented patient pop- ulations. On the other hand, massive real-world data (RWD) are increasingly captured by population-based databases and registries, such as Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER), SEER-Medicare, and National Cancer Database (NCDB), that have much broader demographic and clinical diversity compared to RCT cohorts. Treatment evaluation using causal inference methods and RWD that were not collected purely for re- search purposes is now frequently performed but fraught with limitations such as confounding due to lack of randomization. In fact, the agreement between RCT and RWD ﬁndings is often low in the analysis of matched RCT and RWD studies with the same treatment comparisons. Although several national organizations and reg- ulatory agencies have advocated using RWD to complement RCTs, methods that integrate these two potentially complementary data sources and achieve better treatment evaluation over the use of a single data source alone have yet to be developed.  This proposal is motivated by the PIs' collaborative work to study the safety and efﬁcacy of treatment strategies for elderly non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and esophageal cancer patients by integrating data from multiple sources: RCTs from NCI cooperative groups and the real-world databases (e.g. SEER, SEER-Medicare, and NCDB). The objective of this project is to develop new statistical methods for integrative analyses of RCTs and RWD that can improve the generalizability and increase estimation efﬁciency of RCT ﬁndings to more diverse ""real-world"" patients as well as under-studied populations while avoiding confounding bias inherent in RWD. In Aim 1, we develop methods for statistical analysis of RCT data to compare chemoradiotherapy patterns for the real-world and elderly NSCLC patients by leveraging the baseline covariates of comparable patients from SEER, for whom the temporal information of chemotherapy and radiation and the outcome are both missing. Aims 2 and 3 focus on the settings when both RCT and RWD provide comparable covariates, treatment, and outcome information. In Aim 2, we develop improved analysis of RCT data to evaluate trimodality therapy versus surgery alone for the real-world and elderly esophageal cancer patients by exploiting the large sample size and predictive power offered by the NCDB/SEER-Medicare. In Aim 3, we develop new efﬁcient and data-adaptive methods to estimate individualized treatment effects of adjuvant chemotherapy versus observation, possibly modiﬁed by age and tumor size, for stage IB resected NSCLC patients by integrating RCT and NCDB data. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The proposed research is closely in line with the 21st Century Cures Act, passed in 2016, which placed additional focus on the use of big real-world data to support decision making and precision medicine. The availability of multiple data sources, namely randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and real-world databases, presents unique and novel opportunities for medical research, because the knowledge that can be acquired from integrative analyses would not be possible from any single-source analysis alone. Our effort is important to bridge RCTs and vast real-world databases and registries arising from clinical practices in order to better understand how treatment works for the real-world and under-studied patient populations outside relatively narrow RCT eligibility criteria and provide accurate and reliable evidence for patient-centered care.",Empower treatment effects evaluation of randomized clinical trials for elderly patients with integrated real-world data,10149900,R01AG066883,"['Address', 'Adjuvant Chemotherapy', 'Advocate', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Area', 'Calibration', 'Cancer Patient', 'Characteristics', 'Chemotherapy and/or radiation', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Disease', 'Economic Burden', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Ensure', 'Equilibrium', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Exclusion Criteria', 'Gold', 'Heterogeneity', 'Knowledge', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of esophagus', 'Medical Research', 'Medicare', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patient-Centered Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resected', 'SEER Program', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Source', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Target Populations', 'Therapy trial', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Treatment outcome', 'Weight', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'chemoradiation', 'clinical practice', 'clinical trial analysis', 'cohort', 'disease registry', 'esophageal cancer patient', 'health economics', 'improved', 'inclusion criteria', 'individualized medicine', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning method', 'multiple data sources', 'novel', 'older patient', 'patient population', 'population based', 'precision medicine', 'safety study', 'study population', 'treatment comparison', 'treatment effect', 'treatment group', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor']",NIA,NORTH CAROLINA STATE UNIVERSITY RALEIGH,R01,2021,391243
"Development of Non-Human Primate Models to Assess Immunological Mechanisms and Antigenic Targets of Protective Sporozoite (SPZ) Vaccines and Establish Superior Efficacy of Next Generation SPZ vaccines ABSTRACT Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) sporozoite (SPZ)-based vaccines have shown excellent safety and vaccine efficacy (VE) in more than 25 clinical trials in Africa, Europe, and the US; Phase 3 assessment will begin in mid-2020. Our goal during the next decade is to develop, license, and deploy next generation SPZ vaccines with increased breadth, magnitude, and/or durability of VE and decreased cost of goods. Current assays and animal models do not offer an alternative to clinical trials for demonstrating whether a vaccine candidate exhibits superior performance to current SPZ vaccines. In this project we aim to develop in vitro assays and/or non-human primate (NHP) models that indicate a vaccine recipient will be protected against Pf malaria by a SPZ vaccine, and use them to show superiority of new SPZ vaccines. Success could come from increased understanding of the 1) immunological effector mechanisms of protective immunity (PI), 2) antigenic targets of PI, and/or 3) organs and cells involved in induction of the PI. Despite many studies, our understanding of these 3 areas has only modestly improved in the last 2 decades. In 2000 it was hypothesized that antigen-specific, tissue resident CD8+ T cells in the liver that recognized Pf peptides bound to class I HLA molecules on the surface of Pf-infected hepatocytes were the key cells mediating PI. This hypothesis led to a seminal study that demonstrated subcutaneous administration of PfSPZ Vaccine did not lead to induction of PfSPZ-specific, CD8+ T cells in the livers of immunized NHPs, but intravenous (IV) administration did. Based in large part on these results, a clinical trial of IV administration was initiated, and the trial showed 100% VE. Subsequently, >25 clinical trials of PfSPZ vaccines have shown that empirical alteration of PfSPZ/dose, number of doses, interval between doses, and method of attenuation can improve performance of PfSPZ vaccines. However, we have learned little about mechanisms and targets of PI, or the tissues involved in induction of PI. We believe this is because the effector activity takes place in the liver, and induction of PI also takes place in the central compartment, which is inaccessible in humans. Since our last major advance came from studying the livers of immunized NHPs, we think much more information can be gleaned from this approach, including elucidation of immunological effectors and targets, and comparison and down-selection of vaccine candidates. Therefore, in this project we will develop 3 models in outbred NHPs to study SPZ vaccine-induced immunity, and use the data generated in the models and systems biology assays to establish biomarkers and groups of assays (signature) that consistently predict whether a NHP will be protected, and establish blood surrogates of tissue markers. The best assays/ biomarkers/signatures will be assessed using serum, plasma, and PBMCs from protected/unprotected subjects assessed in clinical trials of PfSPZ vaccines. Finally, we will use the assays/biomarkers/signatures and model systems to screen newly developed SPZ vaccines, especially genetically altered vaccines, to down-select which should move to process development and clinical testing. PROJECT NARRATIVE Malaria affects over two billion people, killing over 400,000 individuals each year mostly children in Africa. A powerful tool is needed for eliminating Plasmodium falciparum malaria from defined geographical areas. The ideal tool would be a highly effective, long-acting vaccine that prevents infection, and thereby disease and parasite transmission. There is currently no alternative to clinical trials for demonstrating that a vaccine candidate exhibits performance superior to current SPZ vaccines Therefore, in this project we will develop in vitro assays and/or non-human primate (NHP) models that indicate if a human will be protected against Pf infection by a SPZ vaccine, and use them to show superiority of new SPZ vaccines.",Development of Non-Human Primate Models to Assess Immunological Mechanisms and Antigenic Targets of Protective Sporozoite (SPZ) Vaccines and Establish Superior Efficacy of Next Generation SPZ vaccines,10086740,U01AI155354,"['Affect', 'Africa', 'Amino Acids', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Antibodies', 'Antigens', 'Aotus primate', 'Area', 'Attenuated', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Models', 'Blood', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'CD8B1 gene', 'Cells', 'Child', 'Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Erythrocytes', 'Europe', 'Exhibits', 'Falciparum Malaria', 'Geographic Locations', 'Germany', 'Glean', 'Goals', 'Hepatocyte', 'Human', 'Immune response', 'Immunity', 'Immunization', 'Immunize', 'Immunologics', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infection prevention', 'Interferons', 'Interleukin-12', 'Intravenous', 'Lead', 'Licensing', 'Liver', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Malaria', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Nitric Oxide', 'Organ', 'Parasites', 'Peptides', 'Performance', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Phase', 'Plasma', 'Plasmodium falciparum', 'Plasmodium falciparum vaccine', 'Process', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Radiation', 'Regimen', 'Safety', 'Seminal', 'Serum', 'Spleen', 'Sporozoite vaccine', 'Sporozoites', 'Statistical Models', 'Surface', 'Systems Biology', 'T cell response', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Transcript', 'Vaccines', 'Work', 'asexual', 'attenuation', 'base', 'biomarker signature', 'cost', 'improved', 'in vitro Assay', 'in vivo', 'lymph nodes', 'next generation', 'nonhuman primate', 'predictive test', 'prospective', 'protective efficacy', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'statistical and machine learning', 'subcutaneous', 'success', 'tissue biomarkers', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'vaccine candidate', 'vaccine development', 'vaccine efficacy', 'vaccine-induced immunity', 'volunteer']",NIAID,"SANARIA, INC.",U01,2021,942943
"Structure based design of trimer interface epitope focused universal influenza vaccines The “Computational Models of Immunity” projects in this application focus on development and implementation of new structure-based design tools for influenza hemagglutinin (HA) protein trimer interface specific antibodies or vaccine antigens. These projects will use knowledge about the structure and function of human neutralizing antibodies to the trimer interface of the HA head that we have in hand or will discover, in order to design new antibodies or vaccines in silico. We have access to peripheral blood cells from a diverse panels of subjects with prior natural infection, or exposure to experimental inoculation with vaccines encoding HA molecules with both seasonal vaccines and unusual experimental influenza subtypes, including H3variant, H5, H6, H7, H9, and H10 viruses. The immune B memory cell populations from these individuals are the ideal starting materials to isolate unusual heterosubtypic antibodies. Recently, we identified the HA head trimer interface as a major new site of vulnerability for universal influenza antibodies and candidate vaccines. Here, we will study existing and isolate additional broadly heterosubtypic human antibodies to the trimer interface of the HA head. We will determine the immunome of the responding heterosubtypic clones using high-throughput next generation sequencing of antibody gene repertoires that comprise the clonal lineages of the most heterosubtypic antibodies isolated. Once antibodies with unusual breadth or activity are isolated, the structure of these antibodies will be determined in complex with purified HA molecules in the Structural Core using crystallography and single particle electron microscopy (EM) studies. Such structures will provide the coordinates for the modeling experiments using Rosetta. We will in silico mature human antibodies to increase affinity for the HA antigen of specific virus types and use multi-state design to maximize breadth, i.e., create antibodies that recognize HAs of all clades, subtypes, groups, or even types. We then will synthesize and express these novel antibodies and determine neutralization activity, binding affinity, and competition binding groups of designed antibodies, using a diverse HA panel and pseudotyped viruses with all type A HAs in nature. The co-crystal structure of these human antibodies with HA will be the template for in silico design of structurally stable epitope-focused immunogens. We will first validate these designed immunogens by testing the interaction with the target human antibodies. Further, these immunogens will be experimentally tested by evaluating immune responses. Then, we will use the novel immunogens to isolate new antibodies from subjects naturally exposed to influenza, to show that the immunogens present antigens recognized by natural immune responses. The next generation of viral vaccines and biologics alike will be designed rationally, based on a structural understanding of how protective antibodies engage the epitope of the target. The multidisciplinary group in this application will develop and implement new structure based computational models, and then validate the power of the computational design approach with laboratory experiments focused on the structural basis of broad neutralization of influenza through recognition of the a novel site of vulnerability in the interface of the hemagglutinin head domain.",Structure based design of trimer interface epitope focused universal influenza vaccines,10126805,U01AI150739,"['Affinity', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Repertoire', 'Antigens', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Blood Cells', 'Cells', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Crystallization', 'Crystallography', 'Development', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Engineering', 'Epitopes', 'Exposure to', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Glycoproteins', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Head', 'Hemagglutinin', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunity', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Influenza', 'Influenza Hemagglutinin', 'Influenza vaccination', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Linear Programming', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Masks', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Memory B-Lymphocyte', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Polysaccharides', 'Population', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic antibodies', 'Vaccine Antigen', 'Vaccine Design', 'Vaccines', 'Validation', 'Viral', 'Viral Vaccines', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'X-Ray Crystallography', 'antibody engineering', 'base', 'combat', 'cross reactivity', 'design', 'experimental study', 'immunogenicity', 'in silico', 'in vivo', 'influenza virus strain', 'influenza virus vaccine', 'influenzavirus', 'innovation', 'laboratory experiment', 'molecular recognition', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'nanoparticle', 'neutralizing antibody', 'next generation', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'pandemic disease', 'particle', 'programs', 'protective efficacy', 'receptor binding', 'response', 'scaffold', 'screening', 'structural biology', 'therapeutic vaccine', 'tool', 'universal influenza vaccine', 'vaccine candidate']",NIAID,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,U01,2021,1224163
"Personalized Dietary Management in Type 2 Diabetes Abstract Hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes (T2D) is associated with a variety of vascular complications of the disease, but clinical trials of medication regimens designed to achieve near-normal HbA1c have been disappointing and may even increase the risk of adverse outcomes due to polypharmacy. Enhancing behavioral management of postprandial glycemia can further reduce glycemic exposure and downstream effects without the risks of polypharmacy. Postprandial glycemia is largely driven by dietary intake, but research findings regarding the best dietary approach to limit glycemic exposure are mixed and mostly negative. Studies done, to-date, have used one-size-fits-all dietary regimens that do not take into consideration the fact that glycemic response is highly individual. In this clinical trial of 255 (85/group) individuals with early-stage T2D, participants will be randomized to: (1) a Social Cognitive Theory-based behavioral lifestyle intervention that includes a one-size-fits-all Mediterranean ADA diet (hereafter Standardized), (2) Standardized plus personalized dietary guidance to minimize postprandial glycemic response to meals (hereafter Personalized), or (3) a Usual Care Control plus (hereafter UCC). We will compare the groups in terms of mean amplitude of glycemic excursion (MAGE). Hypothesis MAGEPersonalized< MAGEStandardized < MAGEUCC at 6 months. At each time point we will describe between group differences in HbA1c, β-cell function, and the need to escalate the medication regimen. We also will describe the impact of the interventions on alternative measures of glycemic variability (standard deviation, Continuous Overall Net Glycemic Action, area under the curve, and frequency of out-of-range and seriously out- of-range glucose values). We will explore the relative contribution of GV and HbA1c to observed changes in β- cell function. The proposed study is an integrative scientific undertaking, reflecting the input of experts in nursing, the behavioral sciences, computational biology, microbiome, mHealth technology, endocrinology, and nutrition for the development of personalized behavioral counseling to minimize glycemic exposure and disease progression in those with early-stage T2D. Project Narrative Limiting blood sugar peaks following meals is an important treatment goal in the management of type 2 diabetes, but evidence is mixed regarding the best dietary approach to achieve this goal. One-size-fits-all dietary recommendations may fail to limit blood sugar peaks because individuals differ greatly in their blood sugar responses to the very same foods. In this study we will compare two Mediterranean-type diabetic diets, one that has been standardized and one that has been personalized using a gut microbiome-based algorithm to limit blood sugar peaks following meals.",Personalized Dietary Management in Type 2 Diabetes,10119622,R01NR018916,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Amputation', 'Area', 'Area Under Curve', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Beta Cell', 'Blood Glucose', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood capillaries', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cell physiology', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computational Biology', 'Counseling', 'Dementia', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Diabetic Diet', 'Diet', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Dietary intake', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Education', 'Endocrinology', 'Epidemic', 'Failure', 'Food', 'Frequencies', 'Glucose', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'Goals', 'Health Technology', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hyperglycemia', 'Hypoglycemia', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Investigation', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediterranean Diet', 'Metabolic', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Nature', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Nutritional', 'Nutritional Study', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Polypharmacy', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Research Priority', 'Retinal Diseases', 'Risk', 'Schedule', 'Self Efficacy', 'Self Management', 'Standardization', 'Strategic Planning', 'Stroke', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'design', 'dietary', 'dietary approach', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'genetic testing', 'glucose monitor', 'glycemic control', 'gut microbiome', 'lifestyle intervention', 'mHealth', 'machine learning algorithm', 'medication compliance', 'microbiome', 'nutrition', 'personalized intervention', 'personalized medicine', 'preservation', 'randomized trial', 'response', 'social cognitive theory', 'success', 'treatment as usual']",NINR,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2021,743162
"Mechanisms of mechano-chemical rupture of blood clots and thrombi Mechanisms of mechano-chemical rupture of blood clots and thrombi Prashant K. Purohit, John L. Bassani, Valeri Barsegov and John W. Weisel The goal of this proposal is to explore and understand the fracture toughness of blood clots and thrombi, thus providing a mechanistic basis for life-threatening thrombotic embolization. A combination of experiments, theoretical modeling and computer simulations will reveal how mechanical stresses (due to blood flow) in synergy with enzymatic lysis induce structural damage from the molecular to continuum scales and affect the propensity of a clot to embolize. The specific aims of this proposal are: (1) Measure and model fracture toughness of fibrin gels in quasi-static conditions, (2) Investigate rate dependent dissipative effects on toughness of fibrin gels, and (3) Study the effects of blood cells, prothrombotic blood composition, and fibrinolysis on rupture of blood clots. In Specific Aim (SA) 1, we will measure toughness of fibrin clots and provide a structural basis for rupture at the micron and nanometer scales. In SA2, we will delve into the thermodynamics and rate-dependence of the fracture of fibrin gels, including fluid flow through pores and fluid drag on fibrin fibers to capture how energy dissipation increases toughness. In the translational SA3, we will investigate toughness of physiologically relevant clots with effects of platelets, red blood cells, and neutrophils in the absence and presence of the physiological fibrinolytic activator (tPA). We will also study the rupture of clots made from the blood of venous thromboembolism patients to explore the effects of (pro)thrombotic alterations of blood composition on clot mechanical stability. Our preliminary studies show that i) the toughness of cross-linked fibrin gels is in the range of those for synthetic hydrogels, ii) the addition of tPA to a crack tip reduces the loads for crack growth, iii) fibers are aligned and broken along the tensile direction at the crack tip, and iv) crack propagation results from the rupture of covalent and non-covalent bonds. We also developed v) dynamic force spectroscopy in silico to mechanically test fibrin fibers and fibrin networks using pulling simulations and vi) atomic stress approach to map the stress-strain fields using the output from simulations. We will use continuum and finite element models of swellable biopolymer hydrogels, and statistical mechanical models for the forced unfolding of fibrin molecules. We will employ multiscale computational modeling based on Molecular Dynamics simulations of atomic structures of fibrin fibers, and Langevin simulations of fibrin networks accelerated on Graphics Processing Units. The proposed experiments cover the whole gamut of macroscopic tensile tests, shear rheometry, electron microscopy and confocal microscopy to visualize and quantitate the structural alterations of ruptured blood clots. Our experiments and modeling will help us to understand the mechanisms of thrombotic embolization and will address the clinically important question: why is there a strong association between clot structure/mechanical properties and cardiovascular diseases? The new knowledge will also help to design new hydrogel-based biomaterials that are currently at the forefront of research in mechanics, materials science and bioengineering. Project Narrative The research objective of this proposal is to measure, model and predict the mechanisms of mechano-chemical rupture of blood clots and thrombi at the molecular and continuum length scales.

"Mechanoresponsive Engrailed-1-negative fibroblasts activate Engrailed-1 to promote fibrosis in wound healing 7. Project Summary/Abstract Adult human skin heals by developing fibrotic scar tissue, which can result in devastating disfigurement, growth restriction, and permanent functional loss. Despite a plethora of clinical options, no current treatment strategies successfully prevent or reverse this fibrotic process, and scars and their sequelae cost the United States over $20 billion every year. Progress towards the development of new therapies has been significantly hindered by a lack of understanding of the specific cell populations responsible for scarring. In 2015, our group reported that Engrailed-1 (En-1) lineage-positive fibroblasts (EPFs) are responsible for the vast majority of dorsal scar production in postnatal mice. In early fetal gestation, mice heal scarlessly via skin regeneration, an ideal outcome mediated by En-1 lineage-negative fibroblasts (ENFs; the predominant fetal fibroblast). However, it has not been established if ENFs contribute to postnatal wound healing. In this proposal, we explore for the first time the postnatal conversion of ENFs to pro-fibrotic EPFs (postnatally-derived EPFs; pEPFs) within the wound environment. First, histology, immunohistochemistry, and wounding in a novel transgenic mouse model will be used to study the conversion of ENFs to pEPFs during wound healing. By examining the behavior of ENF subpopulations (derived from papillary dermis, reticular dermis, and hypodermis) in the wound environment and confirming our findings in a tamoxifen-inducible mouse model of En-1 activation, we will precisely define the ENF population that gives rise to pro-fibrotic pEPFs. Second, we will establish the specific wound environment cues that drive ENF-to-EPF transition. Given that mechanical forces are known to modulate both scar burden and fibroblast activity, we will use in vitro and in vivo models to examine the effects of mechanical environment on En-1 activation. We will further use transcriptomic and epigenomic profiling to explore the role of mechanotransduction signaling in ENF-to-EPF transition and pEPF function. Third, having established a mechanotransduction mechanism underlying En-1 activation in wound ENFs, we will inhibit mechanotransduction signaling with the goal of blocking ENF-to-EPF transition. Specifically, we will assess whether blocking mechanotransduction results in ENF-mediated wound healing with reduced fibrosis. Our ultimate translational goal is to develop therapeutics that target fibrogenic fibroblasts to promote regenerative healing. Collectively, the proposed work will significantly enhance our understanding of the key molecular and cellular determinants of cutaneous scarring, inform the development of novel anti-scarring therapies, and shed light on the cellular origin of dermal scarring fibroblasts. 8. Project Narrative Scarring is the end result of injury in adult human skin and results in an enormous financial and medical burden for our society. There are currently no effective molecular therapies that prevent scarring or its sequelae, and development of therapeutics has been hindered by lack of understanding of the precise cell populations that mediate fibrosis in wound healing. Therefore, we propose to explore the contribution of a specific fibroblast subpopulation (Engrailed-1 lineage-negative fibroblasts; ENFs) in fibrotic wound healing, in order to inform novel directions for targeted treatments that minimize scarring and promote regenerative wound healing.",Mechanoresponsive Engrailed-1-negative fibroblasts activate Engrailed-1 to promote fibrosis in wound healing,10130573,R01GM136659,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomic Surface', 'Behavior', 'Cells', 'Cellular Assay', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Chromatin', 'Cicatrix', 'Clinical', 'Collagen', 'Connective Tissue', 'Cues', 'Cultured Cells', 'Cutaneous', 'Data', 'Dermal', 'Dermis', 'Development', 'Dipeptidyl-Peptidase IV', 'Dorsal', 'Elements', 'Engraftment', 'Environment', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Fiber', 'Fibroblasts', 'Fibrosis', 'Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting', 'Focal Adhesion Kinase 1', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hair follicle structure', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Hydrogels', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Light', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mechanical Stress', 'Mechanics', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Microscopy', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mus', 'Outcome', 'Papillary', 'Pathway interactions', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Process', 'Production', 'Protein Inhibition', 'Proteins', 'Reporting', 'Role', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Skin', 'Societies', 'Specimen', 'Subcutaneous Tissue', 'Surface', 'Tamoxifen', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Transposase', 'United States', 'Verteporfin', 'Visual', 'Wild Type Mouse', 'Work', 'analog', 'base', 'cost', 'digital', 'epigenomics', 'experimental study', 'fetal', 'functional loss', 'healing', 'in vivo', 'in vivo Model', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mechanical force', 'mechanotransduction', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'postnatal', 'prevent', 'reconstruction', 'regenerative', 'response', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'skin regeneration', 'skin wound', 'therapeutic development', 'therapeutic target', 'tissue culture', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment strategy', 'wound', 'wound bed', 'wound environment', 'wound healing']",NIGMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,317427
"Novel Glucose Responsive Insulin for Improved Treatment of Diabetes SUMMARY/ABSTRACT. Diabetes is rapidly becoming a global health crisis. Depending on the type of statistical methodology used, the world-wide incidence of the most common type of diabetes, adult-onset or Type II, is estimated to be in the range of 285 million. In both Type I and Type II diabetics glycemic control is paramount as the inability to maintain glycemic control results in several secondary complications including neuropathy, nephropathy and retinopathy, that often lead to amputations, dialysis and blindness as well as increased risk of cardiovascular complications. For the majority of diabetics glycemic control requires constant vigilance and monitoring of blood glucose levels. The overarching goal of this project is the development of a novel glucose responsive insulin (GRI) with a reversible, glucose dependent response at the insulin receptor. The full realization of the GRI concept would most closely mimic the benefits of a healthy pancreas and maintain euglycemia, reduce/eliminate the need for constant monitoring, and ultimately, reduce/eliminate the complications of diabetes. The scope of this proposal is the design and testing of a series of analogs that can bind glucose allosterically and demonstrate differential response at the insulin receptor. This will be achieved through completion of three aims. In Aim 1 we will use a novel computational platform to design and produce a series of GRIs with glucose binding affinity in the physiological range. In Aim 2 we will determine the glucose binding affinity of the analogues produced in Aim 1. Finally, in Aim 3 we will measure the insulin receptor (IR) and insulin like growth factor (IGF-R1) affinity of the GRI’s in the presence of glucose at physiological concentrations. Completion of these Aims will result in the identification of several GRI lead candidates with glucose binding in the physiological range and reversible glucose dependent insulin receptor binding and absence of IGF-1R binding. NARRATIVE Diabetes is rapidly becoming a global health crisis. In both Type I and Type II diabetics glycemic control is paramount as the inability to maintain glycemic control results in a number of secondary complications including neuropathy, nephropathy and retinopathy, that often lead to amputations, dialysis and blindness. A reversible glucose responsive insulin (GRI) would represent a significant improvement in diabetes care for both T1D and T2D patients. The success of this project will result in clinical candidates that will ultimately supplant basal and prandial insulins while simultaneously improving glycemic control and reducing hypoglycemic incidences known to increase cardiovascular risk as well as secondary complications.",Novel Glucose Responsive Insulin for Improved Treatment of Diabetes,10250801,R43DK126521,"['Adult', 'Affinity', 'Amputation', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Assay', 'Blindness', 'Blood Glucose', 'Calorimetry', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coupled', 'Cryoelectron Microscopy', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Fructose', 'Glucose', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Hypoglycemia', 'IGF1 gene', 'Incidence', 'Insulin', 'Insulin Infusion Systems', 'Insulin Receptor', 'Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Lead', 'Legal patent', 'Leucine', 'Ligand Binding', 'Ligands', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Monitor', 'Mutation', 'Neuropathy', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Pancreas', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Production', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Rapid screening', 'Retinal Diseases', 'Screening procedure', 'Series', 'Somatomedins', 'System', 'Testing', 'Thermodynamics', 'Time', 'Toxicology', 'Trees', 'Type 2 diabetic', 'Valine', 'Xylose', 'analog', 'base', 'biophysical properties', 'carbene', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'clinical candidate', 'computational platform', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'diabetic', 'drug candidate', 'euglycemia', 'global health', 'glycemic control', 'healthy volunteer', 'improved', 'in silico', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'insulin Wakayama', 'lead candidate', 'lead series', 'machine learning algorithm', 'milligram', 'novel', 'pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics', 'phase 2 study', 'receptor', 'receptor binding', 'response', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'standard of care', 'success', 'type I diabetic', 'vigilance', 'web server']",NIDDK,"AMIDEBIO, LLC",R43,2021,183955
"UroEDIC Bladder: Bladder Dysfunction in Type 1 Diabetes PROJECT SUMMARY The Diabetes Control and Complication Trial (DCCT) and its observational follow up Epidemiology of Diabetes Intervention and Complications (EDIC) represent landmark achievements in diabetes research. The DCCT enrolled 1441 men and women with type 1 diabetes (T1D) in a randomized trial of intensive vs. conventional insulin therapy, delaying the onset and progression of diabetic complications and dramatically changing the management of patients worldwide. Implementation of tight glycemic control has reduced the frequency of devastating complications of T1D such as early death, blindness and amputation. Women and men with T1D face new challenges including cognitive decline, autonomic dysfunction and urological disorders. UroEDIC, an ancillary study examining urological complications in the DCCT/EDIC cohort, combines over 25 years of detailed medical information and >90% participation in urological symptom assessment annually since 2010, making it the longest running most extensive urological evaluation of persons with T1D. The previous funding cycle identified lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) and urinary incontinence (UI) as urological disorders in men and women with T1D with the highest prevalence and greatest impact on quality of life (QOL). By linking powerful longitudinal urological phenotypes with extensive clinical and laboratory data of the DCCT/EDIC, we can substantially deepen our understanding of diabetes associated urinary complications. Preliminary analyses show that although many patients develop a fixed state of LUTS or UI, many others move in and out of the state over time. Our overall hypothesis is that metabolic, autonomic and epithelial dysfunctions are associated with persistent and reversible subphenotypes of LUTS and UI in men and women with diabetes. Observations also indicate bladder overactivity in both genders is increasing in this cohort. However, there is a lack of understanding of the burden and impact of other diabetic bladder problems, particularly diabetic cystopathy, classically described as decreased bladder sensation, poor contractility and high residual urine volume. The goals of UroEDIC Bladder, therefore, are to 1) characterize the full spectrum of bladder dysfunction in T1D, 2) create risk models that explain the progression and remission of LUTS/UI, and 3) identify mechanistic themes underpinning the persistence of these symptoms. The specific aims of this project are designed to incorporate newly proposed and available longitudinal data on bladder retention, autonomic dysfunction and novel transcriptional signatures with the full range of DCCT/EDIC measurements to gain deeper insight into the longitudinal patterns and mechanisms of LUTS/UI and comprehensively characterize diabetic bladder dysfunction in T1D. PROJECT NARRATIVE To advance our understanding of bladder dysfunction in type 1 diabetes (T1D), this project links existing information on diabetes severity from a large NIH study to new assessments of urinary symptoms and bladder dysfunction and urine specimens for gene expression analyses. This work will contribute comprehensive critical data to expand our knowledge about the natural history and molecular mechanisms of bladder dysfunction in T1D.",UroEDIC Bladder: Bladder Dysfunction in Type 1 Diabetes,10205344,R01DK116723,"['Achievement', 'Afferent Neurons', 'Amputation', 'Ancillary Study', 'Autonomic Dysfunction', 'Bladder', 'Bladder Dysfunction', 'Blindness', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiology', 'Epithelial', 'Esthesia', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'Goals', 'High Prevalence', 'Human', 'Hyperglycemia', 'Impaired cognition', 'Insulin', 'Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Metabolic', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Natural History', 'Overactive Bladder', 'Participant', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Residual state', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Running', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specimen', 'Symptoms', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Urinary Incontinence', 'Urine', 'Urologic Diseases', 'Urology', 'Urothelium', 'Variant', 'Woman', 'Work', 'autonomic neuropathy', 'base', 'case control', 'cohort', 'design', 'diabetes control', 'diabetic', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'glycemic control', 'incontinence symptom', 'insight', 'lower urinary tract symptoms', 'mechanotransduction', 'member', 'men', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'randomized trial', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transmission process', 'treatment strategy', 'urinary', 'urologic']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2021,722963
"Integrated proteomic and metabolomics analysis of thrombotic myocardial infarction Project Summary / Abstract: Acute myocardial infarction (MI) is defined as myocardial ischemia, the inadequate supply of blood to heart muscle, followed by myocardial cell death. Multiple causes of acute MI are widely recognized and can be categorized as thrombotic, non-thrombotic, and acute MI secondary to coronary procedures. The mechanistic cause of a thrombotic MI is the rupture or erosion of an atherosclerotic plaque that results in the formation of a thrombus, or blood clot, which occludes the flow of blood. In contrast, non-thrombotic MI occurs secondary to mechanisms which create an oxygen supply and demand imbalance, but are not associated with atherosclerotic plaque rupture or disruption. Given that myocardial cell death is the pathological characteristic that is common to all acute MI, non-invasive diagnostics for acute MI are based on the detection of myocardial cell death. Currently non-invasive diagnostics for differentiating thrombotic MI from non-thrombotic MI do not exist which results in sub-optimal treatment and diminished patient safety. Further, it is not known how the impacts on metabolism and biological processes differ between thrombotic and non-thrombotic MI. In this project, we will address both of these problems. We will develop a diagnostic method for the non-invasive differentiation of thrombotic MI versus non-thrombotic MI that will enable earlier, safer, and more precise targeting of therapeutics to patients suffering from acute MI. We will determine biological processes that differ between thrombotic and non-thrombotic MI, which will suggest targets for therapeutic intervention that are specific to the underlying cause of an acute MI. In Aim 1 we will utilize high resolution mass spectrometry to determine the absolute concentration of over 500 proteins in previously collected plasma samples from human subjects who were experiencing an acute MI for which the cause (thrombotic versus non-thrombotic) was determined. This will enable us to determine which proteins report on the cause of the acute MI as opposed to the presence of myocardial cell death. A critical advantage of our study design is that we have repeated measures from the same human subjects: at the time of presentation, 6 hours post-presentation, and at a stable event-free follow-up timepoint 3 months after the acute MI. In Aim 2 we will integrate this data with our existing data on the abundances of metabolites and lipids generated from the same human subject samples. This integrated data will facilitate an in-depth analysis of the differences between thrombotic and non-thrombotic MI in the activities of metabolic pathways, receptor-ligand binding events, and other biochemical reactions. Further we will conduct data- dependent systems biology analyses that will highlight proteins, metabolites, and lipids that are co-abundant in plasma and will evaluate how the topology of these related entities differs between thrombotic and non- thrombotic MI. In Aim 3 we will develop a statistical classifier for the determination of the underlying cause of an acute MI. We will conduct a blinded evaluation of the performance of this classifier in a second cohort. Project Narrative: Acute myocardial infarction (heart attack) is one of the leading causes of death in the United States and globally. Currently a non-invasive method of determining the underlying cause of an acute myocardial infarction does not exist, and it is unknown how different causes of acute myocardial infarction affect or alter metabolic processes. This project will use previously collected blood plasma from humans experiencing an acute myocardial infarction to develop a diagnostic method for determining the underlying cause of the event and how the different causes alter metabolic processes.",Integrated proteomic and metabolomics analysis of thrombotic myocardial infarction,10087409,SC1GM139730,"['Acute myocardial infarction', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Arterial Fatty Streak', 'Biochemical Reaction', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Blinded', 'Blood coagulation', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiac Myocytes', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Death', 'Cell-Cell Adhesion', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Coagulation Process', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Ensure', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Fibrinolysis', 'Guidelines', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Infarction', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Ligand Binding', 'Ligands', 'Lipids', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Myocardial Ischemia', 'Myocardium', 'Necrosis', 'Oxygen', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Plasma', 'Plasma Proteins', 'Platelet Activation', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Reaction', 'Reporting', 'Research Design', 'Resolution', 'Rupture', 'Sampling', 'Secondary to', 'Statistical Models', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Thrombosis', 'Thrombus', 'Time', 'United States', 'Vascular blood supply', 'Work', 'atherosclerotic plaque rupture', 'base', 'cohort', 'design', 'differential expression', 'experience', 'feature selection', 'follow-up', 'genome-wide', 'human subject', 'improved', 'insight', 'lipid metabolism', 'lipidomics', 'liquid chromatography mass spectrometry', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'mortality', 'multiple omics', 'new therapeutic target', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'novel diagnostics', 'optimal treatments', 'patient safety', 'protein metabolite', 'proteomic signature', 'receptor', 'safety outcomes', 'statistical and machine learning', 'targeted treatment', 'thrombotic', 'treatment strategy']",NIGMS,NEW MEXICO STATE UNIVERSITY LAS CRUCES,SC1,2021,222000
"Center for Translational Research in Health Disparities Abstract: Diversity in the rates of progression and mortality of COVID-19 disease within infected African American (AAs) subgroups are clearly not just a function of the underlying health conditions that increase the rate of mortality for COVID -19 patients, such as hypertension, obesity and diabetes, but may also be affected by host genetic factors. Here we propose a series of studies to advance the understanding of our knowledge in relative to the health inequity in COVID-19 disease. This is a multiple-collaborative study between Genomic, Imaging research labs and Statistical studies. Research teams in Morehouse School of Medicine (MSM) have established intimate relationships that position the institute to focus their research works on underserved minorities. We plan to develop and disseminate technological approaches in identifying host factors that disproportionately affect AAs COVID-19 infected patients. Given that the discovery, and establishment of translational implementation of novel solutions to health disparities in high-risk minority COVID-19 infected is our overall goals. Recently, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), encoded on the X-chromosome, has been shown to be a functional receptor for COVID-19 to enter host target cells and the concern might arise regarding whether ACE2 variants between and within subgroups would increase the morbidity and mortality of COVID-19 infected patients. Therefore, the long-term goal is to compare how genetic variants of the ACE2 receptor, chemokine (CCL2) and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes (influence the immune system’s response to viruses and bacteria), affects COVID-19 disease severity among people but no underlining disease like diabetes, heart or lung disease with those with mild or no disease manifestations. Short-term goal; we will focus on two aims; Aim: 1-Determine genetic variations in ACE2 gene on obtained DNA samples from COVID-19 infected patients and evaluate for potential correlation between ACE2 variant frequencies in relationship to COVID-19 disease progression and mortalities between and within AAs and non-Hispanic Caucasian CAs subgroup;. COVID-19 is caused by SARS-CoV-2 which uses host cell ACE2, TMPRSS2, EZRIN and other proteins for entry. Differences in ACE2 or TMPRSS2/EZRIN genes expression and SNPs may justify the disease disparity and aim 2 will address how COVID-19 spike engagement with host cell receptor is precisely regulated and how host cells respond to cytokines elicited by COVID-19 infection using lung organoids. A recent correlation study suggested that the decrease expression of ACE2 /TMPRSS2/EZRIN are predictors of decreased susceptibility to COVID-19 infection and could be attributed to COVID-19 morbidity in Africa American patients. Aim-2: Modeling COVID-19-elicited disease disparity using lung organoids. Clinical validation of ACE2 and EZRIN will help to develop better strategies for COVID 19 diagnosis and treatment to reduce the observed COVID-19 disease progressive outcome and mortality gaps between African American and Caucasians patients. . Given the facts of a significant racial disparity in COVID-19 disease among African American (AA) and Caucasians, there is an utmost need to understand the COVID-19 infectivity host factors biology. Apart from socioeconomic factors and underlying comorbidities, AA clearly differ from Caucasians on a number of accounts, including COVID-19 mortalities genetic predisposition, which favors for high incidence and mortality rate COVID- 19 disease manifestations. Studies clearly demonstrate that ACE 2 encoded on the X-chromosome which COVID-19 virus use to entry host may be differentially expressed among individuals, therefore, we propose to determine that ACE2 and other genes, such as Ezrin plays vital role in regulating the COVID-19 virus infectivity resulting in racial disparity and the clinical validation of ACE2 and ezrin will help to develop better strategies for COVID 19 diagnosis and treatment to reduce the observed COVID-19 disease progressive outcome gaps between African American and Caucasians.",Center for Translational Research in Health Disparities,10221307,U54MD007602,"['2019-nCoV', 'ACE2', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'African American', 'American', 'Bacteria', 'Biology', 'Blood specimen', 'CCL2 gene', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 diagnosis', 'COVID-19 morbidity', 'COVID-19 mortality', 'COVID-19 patient', 'COVID-19 severity', 'Caucasians', 'Cells', 'Center for Translational Science Activities', 'Clinical', 'Correlation Studies', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'HLA Antigens', 'Health', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hospitals', 'Hypertension', 'Image', 'Immune system', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Integration Host Factors', 'Knowledge', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morehouse School of Medicine', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Obesity', 'Organoids', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Progressive Disease', 'Proteins', 'Receptor Cell', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'SARS-CoV-2 infection', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Statistical Study', 'Subgroup', 'TMPRSS2 gene', 'Testing', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Virus', 'Work', 'X Chromosome', 'chemokine', 'comorbidity', 'cytokine', 'differential expression', 'ezrin', 'genetic variant', 'health disparity', 'health inequalities', 'high risk', 'machine learning algorithm', 'male', 'mortality', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'predictive modeling', 'racial disparity', 'receptor', 'response', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'underserved minority']",NIMHD,MOREHOUSE SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,U54,2021,177500
"A Multiwell Plate Format Microfluidic Immobilization Chip for High-Content Imaging of Whole Animals for in vivoNeurotoxicology Testing Project Summary: Neurotoxicological evaluation of new compounds intended for human use or of potential human exposure is mandated by international regulatory bodies and largely relies on lethality testing in higher-order vertebrate animals. High screening costs, long experimental times, and legislative requirements to reduce dependence on animal testing have led many industries to search for alternative technologies. In vitro toxicology testing uses isolated cells or monotypic cell culture and can only provide limited insight since these models lack biologically relevant intact multi-typic cellular network structures. While both technologies have been augmented by in silico technologies, there is still a non-trivial gap between what can be learned and translated from simple, fast, inexpensive in vitro methods versus longer, complex, and costly in vivo studies in higher order animals. Newormics’ approach to filling this gap is to enable in vivo neurotoxicological assessment in Caenorhabditis elegans, an accepted alternative invertebrate model organism, by developing neuron-specific toxicity assays, delivered via a proprietary high-density, large-scale microfluidic immobilization device for high-content, high throughput analysis. Building on advances made during Phase I and important market learnings from participation in the NIH I-Corps program, Phase II proposes several new elements of innovation to achieve our goals in 3 specific aims. In Aim 1, we will convert our first-generation microfluidic device to a high-density (384- well) vivoChip with improved microfabrication technologies, incorporate on-chip culture for transfer-less exposure and testing, and integrate automation for chip loading, imaging, and analysis. These measures will significantly increase test scale (from 80 compounds per chip to 280) and lower the consumable and labor costs per test. In Aim 2, building on our dopaminergic neurotox assay from Phase I, we will develop four neurotox assays with brightly fluorescently labeled dopaminergic, serotonergic, GABAergic, and cholinergic neurons providing the unprecedented ability to assess subtle phenotypic effects of chemicals on individual intact, functional neurons. To achieve real-time image processing, multi-parameter phenotyping, and managing the terabytes of image data generated per test, we will build a computational platform empowered by a graphic user interface. This platform will be used for image compilation, user-annotated phenotype definition and scoring, and automated report generation with appropriate statistical analysis. In Aim 3, with our industry partners, we will validate our platform and assays using reference chemicals. As more chemicals are tested, we will build a database which can be further mined. The outcome of this work will enable many industries to reduce lethal animal testing and get safer industrial and personal consumer products to market faster for economic benefit, reaching regulatory compliance for reduced animal use, and improved healthcare for neurological diseases. Narrative: The proposed work will enable the use of a small invertebrate model organism, C. elegans, for neuron-specific analysis of neurodegeneration phenotypes from high-resolution fluorescence images of individual neurons at high throughputs. The proposed imaging system and the neuron-specific assays will provide an unprecedented ability to assess developmental neurotoxicity in an intact, live, whole organism, down to a neuronal mechanism- of-action level. This project will fill the gap between in vitro and in vivo toxicology testing with an effective invertebrate model organism as alternate to vertebrate animal testing.",A Multiwell Plate Format Microfluidic Immobilization Chip for High-Content Imaging of Whole Animals for in vivoNeurotoxicology Testing,10202460,R44MH118841,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Animal Model', 'Animal Testing', 'Animals', 'Automation', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dendrites', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dopamine', 'Eating', 'Economics', 'Elements', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Gel', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Image', 'Immobilization', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Industrialization', 'Industry', 'Industry Standard', 'Innovation Corps', 'International', 'Invertebrates', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Market Research', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microfabrication', 'Microfluidic Microchips', 'Microfluidics', 'Modeling', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Organoids', 'Outcome', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Protocol Compliance', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reporting', 'Research Activity', 'Resolution', 'Robotics', 'Serotonin', 'Services', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicity Tests', 'Toxicology', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Vertebrates', 'Whole Organism', 'Work', 'base', 'cholinergic neuron', 'computational platform', 'connectome', 'consumer product', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'density', 'design', 'developmental neurotoxicity', 'developmental toxicity', 'empowered', 'experimental study', 'exposed human population', 'fluorescence imaging', 'gamma-Aminobutyric Acid', 'graphical user interface', 'high resolution imaging', 'high throughput analysis', 'image processing', 'imaging platform', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'in silico', 'in vitro Model', 'in vivo', 'in vivo Model', 'industry partner', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'nervous system disorder', 'neurotoxicity', 'neurotoxicology', 'programs', 'real-time images', 'reproductive toxicity', 'screening', 'small molecule libraries', 'success', 'terabyte', 'testing services', 'young adult']",NIMH,"NEWORMICS, LLC",R44,2021,749956
"BandPass: A Remote Monitoring System for Sarcopenia and Functional Decline ABSTRACT Clinical Need: As the US population ages, managing pathologies that largely affect older adults, including sarcopenia (e.g., loss of muscle mass and strength), represents a significant and growing clinical challenge. In addition to increased rates of sarcopenia with age, it is well-accepted that its incidence and impact increases after acute illness, placing persons at additional risk for functional decline, institutionalization, or death. Resistance-based exercises promote muscle regeneration and strength, and are an advised therapy for such patients. Yet, exercises are normally conducted either under direct clinical oversight, or unsupervised by patients at home, where compliance rates are low. Limitations: Current regimens rely on self-report diaries or verbal reports that may be inaccurate and subject to recall bias. Remote monitoring systems that measure, track, analyze, and provide patient-oriented feedback may overcome these limitations and enhance exercise regimen engagement. An at-home device that monitors and transmits exercise data to the user and clinician represents a potential solution to this clinical challenge. Our Product – BandPass is a remote-sensing, bluetooth-enabled resistance exercise band that will accurately gauge force through a potentiometric sensor rigidly fixed to elastic-tubing purposely designed for resistance training. The device is similar to currently available exercise bands familiar to clinicians and patients, with the significant novel addition of integrated force monitoring and internet-connectivity. A mobile app and cloud-based platform will provide computational resources for data visualization, storage and analysis, which will enable direct patient feedback, clinical monitoring of patient compliance and progress, and serve as a platform for more advanced operations such as automatic exercise-type classification to ease user burden (e.g., minimizing required interactions between the user and mobile device). We hypothesize that BandPass will provide clinically relevant data on compliance and use of exercise training with feedback that will be personalized. Specific Objectives: We specifically propose to design custom electronics and housing for BandPass and to perform in-lab validation studies of device accuracy, precision, and long-term stability. BandPass will be interfaced to a mobile app and cloud-based platform we will implement for data transmission, storage, and analysis. Finally, we will deploy BandPass in a human subjects pilot study to demonstrate usability and system stability in an at-home setting. Future Directions: SynchroHealth is a small company developing an mHealth platform that uses internet-connected devices to help improve quality of life in older adults. This device will complement our existing efforts. By the end of this Phase 1 effort, we will have demonstrated that BandPass is functional in a human population and we will have provided evidence that this approach can be deployed effectively in an at-home setting. This will position us for Phase 2 funding focused on optimizing our device for manufacturing, developing and optimizing a full suite of cloud-based analysis tools and mobile applications, conducting clinical trials aimed at demonstrating efficacy, and preparing to register this as a 510(k)-exempt device for marketing purposes and establishing Current Good Manufacturing Practices (CGMP). PROJECT NARRATIVE Clinical care for older adults that suffer from sarcopenia (e.g. loss of muscle mass and strength) typically involves the use of physical therapy regimens that rely on patients performing a series of at-home resistance-based exercises in order to retain or build muscle strength and prevent further atrophy. Resistance exercises using elastic bands has been a primary tool for clinicians, however remotely monitoring a patient’s compliance, confirming the quality of exercises performed, and tracking performance has been a significant challenge, with no tools currently available to provide this level of insight. Here, we propose to develop BandPass, an internet-enable resistance exercise band instrumented to automatically sense forces generated during exercise which will enable remote monitoring, compliance checking, and exercise classification and help to overcome the current shortcomings in clinical management of these patients.",BandPass: A Remote Monitoring System for Sarcopenia and Functional Decline,10152884,R41AG071290,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Android', 'Atrophic', 'Bluetooth', 'Boston', 'Businesses', 'Capital', 'Cessation of life', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Cloud Computing', 'Cloud Service', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Computer software', 'Conduct Clinical Trials', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Drops', 'Elderly', 'Electronics', 'Equipment', 'Exercise', 'Faculty', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Health', 'Home environment', 'Housing', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Infrastructure', 'Injury', 'Inpatients', 'Institutionalization', 'Internet', 'Interview', 'Legal patent', 'Machine Learning', 'Marketing', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Monitor', 'Muscular Atrophy', 'Non-Invasive Cancer Detection', 'Orthopedics', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Physical Function', 'Physical therapy', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Recovery', 'Regimen', 'Reporting', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Series', 'Services', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Students', 'Surveys', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Wireless Technology', 'acceptability and feasibility', 'age-related muscle loss', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical development', 'clinically relevant', 'cloud based', 'commercialization', 'compliance behavior', 'computerized data processing', 'computing resources', 'cost', 'data exchange', 'data visualization', 'design', 'diaries', 'exercise regimen', 'exercise training', 'functional decline', 'handheld mobile device', 'human subject', 'improved', 'insight', 'instrument', 'mHealth', 'meetings', 'mobile application', 'monitoring device', 'muscle form', 'muscle regeneration', 'muscle strength', 'novel', 'operation', 'patient oriented', 'prevent', 'remote monitoring', 'remote sensing', 'resistance exercise', 'sarcopenia', 'sensor', 'strength training', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'usability', 'validation studies']",NIA,SYNCHROHEALTH LLC,R41,2021,224700
"Integrative Molecular Epidemiology Approach to Identify Nephrotic Syndrome Subgroups ABSTRACT Although patients with Nephrotic Syndrome (NS) present with shared clinical signs and symptoms (proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, hyperlipidemia and edema), there is dramatic variability in prognosis and response to therapy, frustrating patients, families and their clinicians. Even within the histopathologic categories used in the current diagnostic approach (e.g. minimal change disease, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis), there is dramatic variability in disease progression and response to therapy, highlighting the underlying biological heterogeneity within the groups. Small studies with broad, clinical patient inclusion criteria have demonstrated that a subset of patients respond well to anti-TNF therapy, but accurate pre-treatment response of those individuals is not possible based on routine clinical parameters. This project will leverage the Nephrotic Syndrome Study Network (NEPTUNE) cohort study, a multi-center prospective study of 600 patients with FSGS, MCD and MN with rich clinical data, kidney biopsy tissue and gene expression profiles. This study will leverage the kidney tissue gene expression data to identify a subgroup of patients with TNF-alpha pathway activation, assess associated clinical outcomes and identify non- molecular predictors of the subgroup. The aims are:  Aim 1: To identify a subgroup of Nephrotic Syndrome patients with homogeneous activation of the  TNF-alpha transcriptional pathway.  Aim 2: To compare molecular subgroups with conventional clinical-pathologic classification in  clinical outcome prediction.  Aim 3: To identify non-invasive markers (e.g. demographics, blood and urine markers), standard  pathology features and novel pathologic biopsy descriptors associated with the TNF-alpha subgroup. To accomplish this project, the applicant will pursue formal training in systems biology, genetic epidemiology and bioinformatics. She will be mentored by a multi-disciplinary team with expertise in systems biology, epidemiology and bioinformatics. The long term objective is to improve the clinical care of patients with Nephrotic Syndrome by improved understanding of the underlying biology, identifying novel biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets for future validation in animal models and mechanistic-based interventional clinical trials. PROJECT NARRATIVE Nephrotic Syndrome, caused by several rare kidney diseases, is characterized by an abnormal amount of protein in the urine, swelling and kidney failure. Patients affected by the syndrome suffer complications of the disease as well as the toxicity of the immunosuppressive therapy used to treat it, but their individual presentations, response to treatment and prognosis can vary markedly. This project aims to use gene expression levels from kidney biopsy tissue to identify the subgroup patients most likely to respond to TNF- alpha blocking medications, an approach which, if validated, may help to inform targeted therapy selections for these patients.",Integrative Molecular Epidemiology Approach to Identify Nephrotic Syndrome Subgroups,10153763,K08DK115891,"['Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor Therapy', 'Award', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biopsy', 'Blood', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Course of Disease', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Descriptor', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Edema', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Family', 'Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genotype', 'Grant', 'Heterogeneity', 'Histologic', 'Histopathology', 'Hyperlipidemia', 'Hypoalbuminemia', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Kidney Failure', 'Kidney Glomerulus', 'Leadership', 'Machine Learning', 'Membranous Glomerulonephritis', 'Mentors', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Disease', 'Molecular Epidemiology', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Nephrotic Syndrome', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Selection', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Probability', 'Prospective Studies', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Proteins', 'Proteinuria', 'Publications', 'Renal glomerular disease', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Swelling', 'Syndrome', 'Systems Biology', 'TNF gene', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic immunosuppression', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Training', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'biological heterogeneity', 'biological systems', 'clinical care', 'clinical epidemiology', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'demographics', 'genetic epidemiology', 'improved', 'inclusion criteria', 'kidney biopsy', 'member', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'patient response', 'patient subsets', 'predict clinical outcome', 'response', 'skills', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'treatment response']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K08,2021,169560
"Effective, Reagent-free Detection of the Odor Signature of Covid-19 Infection Using a Nano-Enabled Sensor Array PROJECT SUMMARY COVID-19 presents a public health emergency: There is a critical need for rapid, not reagent intensive, non- invasive testing technologies. This program will lead to the production of a prototype system to diagnose COVID-19 infection using the body odor signature of the disease. Our goal is to maximize societal impact by creating a validated prototype that can be used in a community or workplace setting by minimally trained personnel for low-cost, on-the-spot diagnosis within minutes. The system will be developed in a manner that puts it on a pathway for rapid FDA approval. The Research Aims are: Aim 1. Optimization, assembly, and integration of a prototype system with the ability to odor signature of COVID-19 in samples of body odor. The system will be simple to use, pose essentially zero risk to the operator and the test subject, and report a result within minutes. The production cost at scale will be approximately $9,000 for the complete measurement system, with a per test cost of approximately $0.50. The design and construction of the prototype will be conducted by Novo Engineering, a leading firm with extensive experience in medical device development. Aim 2. Software development. Software for the system from VOC sampling to final diagnostic result will be developed to ensure error-free operation of the device. Our preliminary results suggest that simple linear discriminant analysis (LDA) does an excellent job of classifying VOCs from human body odor as COVID-19 positive or negative (92% sensitivity and 87% specificity). Optimization of the sensor array (Aim 1) and use of richer feature sets in our classifier models will lead to further performance improvements in the prototype system. Aim 3. System Benchmarking and Validation. We will benchmark the full prototype system against a number of VOC mixtures, with and without in vitro skin models. The system will undergo extensive testing against body odor samples from individuals with pathological conditions other than COVID-19 and other sources of potentially confounding VOCs. The prototype will be validated against 1000 samples drawn from the COVID-SAFE program at Penn. The screening will include all members of the Penn community, and represents incredible racial and ethnic diversity as well as a wide variance in age, sex, and gender. Aim 4. Regulatory Approval Plan The plan will be developed under the direction of Sr/Key personnel John Fuson, JD, an attorney at Crowell & Moring LLP and a former Associate Chief Counsel at FDA. Novo Engineering has extensive experience in guiding prototype design in alignment with the requirements for FDA approval. The proposed COVID-19 VOC-based testing device will be regulated by the FDA, likely as a Class I or II medical device. Because there is no clear predicate device to reference in this case, we intend to submit a direct de novo petition to FDA asking the agency to categorize and clear the proposed COVID-19 testing device as Class I or Class II without reference to any predicate. PROJECT NARRATIVE This program addresses the critical unmet need of an effective means to screen for COVID-19 infection, and potentially other novel virus infections, in a community setting based upon the body odor signature of the disease. The program will result in a validated prototype system, with a test time of minutes, a test cost of approximately $0.50, on a path to rapid FDA approval.","Effective, Reagent-free Detection of the Odor Signature of Covid-19 Infection Using a Nano-Enabled Sensor Array",10266403,U18TR003775,"['Address', 'Age', 'Astronomy', 'Benchmarking', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 diagnosis', 'COVID-19 screening', 'COVID-19 testing', 'Carbon Nanotubes', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Counseling', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Device or Instrument Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Florida', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Housekeeping', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Human body', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Information Sciences', 'International', 'Intuition', 'Laboratories', 'Lawyers', 'Mass Fragmentography', 'Measurement', 'Mechanics', 'Medical Device', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Nose', 'Occupations', 'Odors', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pennsylvania', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physics', 'Production', 'RADx', 'Reagent', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'SARS-CoV-2 infection', 'SARS-CoV-2 negative', 'SARS-CoV-2 positive', 'Sampling', 'Skin', 'Software Engineering', 'Solid', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Spottings', 'System', 'Systems Development', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Viral', 'Virus Diseases', 'Visual', 'Workplace', 'animal care', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'community setting', 'coronavirus disease', 'cost', 'design', 'design and construction', 'ethnic diversity', 'experience', 'high standard', 'machine learning algorithm', 'medical schools', 'member', 'multidisciplinary', 'nano', 'nanosensors', 'next generation', 'novel virus', 'operation', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prototype', 'public health emergency', 'racial diversity', 'sample collection', 'screening', 'screening program', 'sensor', 'sex', 'software development', 'software systems', 'vapor', 'volatile organic compound']",NCATS,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,U18,2021,999830
"Translational Outcomes Project: Visualizing Syndromic Information and Outcomes for Neurotrauma (TOP-VISION) PROJECT SUMMARY: Trauma to the spinal cord and brain (neurotrauma) together impact over 2.5 million people per year in the US, with economic costs of $80 billion in healthcare and loss-of-productivity. Yet precise pathophysiological processes impacting recovery remain poorly understood. This lack of knowledge limits the reliability of therapeutic development in animal models and limits translation across species and into humans. Part of the problem is that neurotrauma is intrinsically complex, involving heterogeneous damage to the central nervous system (CNS), the most complex organ system in the body. This results in a multifarious CNS syndrome spanning across heterogeneous data sources and multiple scales of analysis. Multi-scale heterogeneity makes spinal cord injury (SCI) and traumatic brain injury (TBI) difficult to understand using traditional analytical approaches that focus on a single endpoint for testing therapeutic efficacy. Single endpoint-testing provides a narrow window into the complex system of changes that describe the holistic syndromes of SCI and TBI. In this sense, complex neurotrauma is fundamentally a problem that requires big- data analytics to evaluate reproducibility in basic discovery and cross-species translation. For the proposed TOP-VISION cooperative agreement we will: 1) integrate preclinical neurotrauma data on a large-scale; 2) develop novel applications of cutting-edge multidimensional analytics to make sense of complex neurotrauma data; and 3) validate bio-functional patterns in targeted big-data-to-bench experiments in multi-PI single center (UG3 phase), and multicenter (UH3 phase) studies. The goal of the proposed project is to develop an integrated workflow for preclinical discovery, reproducibility testing, and translational discovery both within and across neurotrauma types. Our team is well-positioned to execute this project given that with prior NIH funding we built one of the largest multicenter, multispecies repositories of neurotrauma data to-date, housing detailed multidimensional outcome data on nearly N=5000 preclinical subjects and over 20,000 curated variables. We will leverage these existing data resources and apply recent innovations from data science to render complex multidimensional endpoint data into robust syndromic patterns that can be visualized and explored by researchers and clinicians for discovery, hypothesis-generation and ultimately translational outcome testing. PROJECT NARRATIVE: Multicenter, multispecies central nervous system (spinal cord and brain) injury data provides a unique and clinically-relevant opportunity to discover translational outcomes, if we can develop analytical workflows that fully harness these data. Our team has assembled one of largest repositories of such data spanning across spinal cord injury and traumatic brain injury models under prior NIH support. The proposed cooperative agreement will expand data-sharing and big-data analytical workflows to render raw neurotrauma data into novel insights to promote bench-to-bedside translation.",Translational Outcomes Project: Visualizing Syndromic Information and Outcomes for Neurotrauma (TOP-VISION),10199067,UH3NS106899,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Model', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Commons', 'Data Element', 'Data Pooling', 'Data Science', 'Data Sources', 'Detection', 'Drug Targeting', 'FAIR principles', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Housing', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Multiple Trauma', 'Mus', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Neuraxis', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Assessment', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Precision Health', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Rattus', 'Recovery', 'Recovery of Function', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Personnel', 'Rodent', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Spinal Cord', 'Spinal Injuries', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Trauma', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Traumatic CNS injury', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'U-Series Cooperative Agreements', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Work', 'bench to bedside', 'biobehavior', 'biomarker discovery', 'body system', 'clinically relevant', 'cost', 'data curation', 'data integration', 'data repository', 'data resource', 'diverse data', 'economic cost', 'economic impact', 'experimental study', 'functional outcomes', 'heterogenous data', 'innovation', 'insight', 'large scale data', 'neuroinflammation', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'precision medicine', 'preclinical study', 'predictive modeling', 'productivity loss', 'repository', 'response to injury', 'spinal cord and brain injury', 'success', 'therapeutic development', 'therapeutic evaluation', 'tool']",NINDS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",UH3,2021,323000
"Multiparametric mapping of Covid-19 immune responses in Kidney transplant recipients Abstract As of May 2020, over five million confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported globally with over 400,000 associated deaths. Around 5-20% of patients develop critical illness, which predominantly manifests as acute respiratory distress syndrome. When this develops, the estimated mortality is around 40%, and as high as 80% in ventilated patients. Several early reports describe the development of an excessive inflammatory response, the so-called `cytokine storm', which is strongly associated with rapid deterioration in clinical condition and mortality. Early reports of kidney transplant recipients, who are at high risk due to chronic immunosuppression and additional comorbid diseases, portray a concerning picture. In one series of 36 patients, 39% required mechanical ventilation, 21% required renal replacement therapy, and 28% died. Of the 11 patients that were intubated, 64% died. However, there is still an unmet need of understanding disease natural course, specific risk factors, identifying biomarkers, as well as potential impact of COVID-19 on graft/patient survival in vulnerable KTRs. To fill this information gap, we propose a comprehensive observational analysis of epidemiological factors and immunological assay results in COVID19-infected KTRs at 2 medical centers at the epicenter of COVID19 infection in NYC (Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan and Montefiore Hospital in the Bronx). We hypothesize that specific recipient clinical characteristics affect COVID-19 clinical course and that recipient immunosuppression in KTRs alters the ability of COVID-19 KTRs to develop protective anti-COVID-19 humoral and cell-mediated immunity that contributes to the morbidity and mortality of these individuals. We will test this hypothesis by 1) examining risk factors of COVID-19 severity in a large dataset of KTRs and individuals from the general population with COVID-19 (aim 1); 2) by characterizing the COVID-19 reactive humoral and cellular immune response in serially collected samples from COVID-19 KTRs (aim 2); and 3) by comprehensive assessment of DNA and serial serum, RNA, and PBMC from COVID-19 KTRs to identify disease mechanisms and potentially informative biomarkers for outcomes (aim 3). The proposed work is significant because of the high incidence of the disease, rate of community transmission, high mortality, and absence of clearly effective therapeutic options. Our studies will be amongst the first to define risk factors, predictors, and pathogenic mechanisms of COVID-19 in Kidney transplantation and may apply to recipients of other transplanted organs, as well as to individuals on chronic immunosuppression due to autoimmune diseases.

"Predictors of Low-risk Phenotypes  after Traumatic Brain Injury Incorporating Proteomic Biomarker Signatures PROJECT SUMMARY Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death in the US, and treatment options are limited. Therapeutic clinical trials in TBI have yielded disappointing results owing in part to the difficulty in accounting for clinically important heterogeneity within TBI. Early delivery of therapy is essential after TBI to reduce secondary brain injury, but unrestricted treatment of all brain injuries could be harmful. TBI stimulates a complex cascade of immunologic responses, both centrally and peripherally. These peripheral immune responses to TBI could serve as an early sensor of risk phenotype given the rapid, readily measurable response in the blood. An improved ability to risk-stratify patients on admission will streamline patient selection for aggressive interventions—such as invasive neuromonitoring—versus selection of those patients who can safely be observed reducing potential harms. Holly E Hinson, MD MCR is a Neurologist and Neurointensivist at Oregon Health and Science University where she cares for patients with severe acute brain injury. The objective of this application is to develop supervised learning models of actionable short- and long-term outcomes post-TBI and to interrogate if pre-specified immunoregulatory proteins add predictive power to the models over clinical features alone. Her central hypothesis is that immunoregulatory proteomic signatures improve our ability to classify a low-risk clinical phenotype after TBI. Dr. Hinson’s preliminary data suggest peripheral cytokine levels are associated with actionable clinical events acutely after TBI. The project employs a highly-sensitive, single molecule immunoarray (SIMOA) to detect immunoregulatory proteins complemented with an unbiased proteomic approach utilizing global discovery mass spectrometry. She will develop and assess a series of models incorporating proteomic signatures to classify: acute progressive intracranial hemorrhage (Aim 1A), acute neurologic deterioration (Aim 1B), and long-term outcomes measured by the 6-month Glasgow Outcome Scale (Aim 2). She will develop these models in a well-defined, clinical trial population (development set), and test their ability to correctly classify outcome in an independent, prospectively enrolled cohort at OHSU (test set). Under a multidisciplinary team of expert mentors, the project will generate new insights into low-risk phenotype recognition and outcome classification after acute TBI. The proposed patient-oriented research project will be enhanced by a structured didactic program in the principles of predictive modeling and patient phenotyping (including proteomics), which will provide Dr. Hinson with the critical skills she will need to conduct independent, innovative translational clinical research in the field of neurotrauma. PROJECT NARRATIVE Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death in the US, and treatment options are limited—we lack methods to assess a patient’s risk of deterioration at admission. An improved ability to classify patients early after injury will allow us to identify those who may benefit from aggressive interventions versus those who can safely be observed. The goal of the proposed project is to develop and assess a series of predictive models incorporating immune proteins from peripheral blood to aid in the prediction of which patients are at low-risk for complications and poor outcome after TBI.",Predictors of Low-risk Phenotypes  after Traumatic Brain Injury Incorporating Proteomic Biomarker Signatures,10155597,K23NS110828,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Acute Brain Injuries', 'Admission activity', 'Age', 'Benign', 'Blood', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain Injuries', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Disease model', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'Exclusion Criteria', 'Glasgow Outcome Scale', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Health Sciences', 'Heterogeneity', 'Holly', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Injury', 'Interleukin-6', 'Intervention', 'Intracranial Hemorrhages', 'Ion Transport', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mentors', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologist', 'Oregon', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Selection', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'ROC Curve', 'Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Series', 'Signaling Protein', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'TBI treatment', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Clinical Trial', 'Tranexamic Acid', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Universities', 'Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1', 'analog', 'base', 'biomarker signature', 'blood-based biomarker', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical risk', 'clinically actionable', 'cohort', 'cytokine', 'digital', 'effective therapy', 'high dimensionality', 'immunoregulation', 'improved', 'inclusion criteria', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient oriented research', 'patient stratification', 'peripheral blood', 'placebo group', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'prospective', 'proteomic signature', 'response', 'risk stratification', 'sensor', 'single molecule', 'skills', 'supervised learning']",NINDS,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,K23,2021,188709
"Automated Assessment for Robotic Suturing Utilizing Deep Learning Algorithms ABSTRACT Medical errors are the third leading cause of death in the US at a cost of $20 billion annually. Surgical complications account for a third of these deaths and cost. Surgical performance directly impacts patient outcomes. Prostate cancer, the most common cancer in men, is treated with surgery (robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP)) that can lead to impotence, incontinence, and even death. Reliable means of objectively assessing technique are required. In this project we will focus on assessing surgeon suturing skills during RARP through virtual reality (VR) simulation. Suturing is a common skill in many types of surgeries, can be tracked with performance metrics, and has been correlated with patient outcomes after RARP. In this proposal we seek to first determine the critical sub-step maneuvers of suturing and the technical skills necessary to achieve them successfully (Aim 1a). Further, we intend to develop an automated skills assessment pipeline through the analysis of raw kinematic data (Aim 1b), video (Aim 2b), and both kinematic/video (Aim 2c), from VR simulation performance by innovative machine learning strategies and deep-learning-based computer vision. The primary differentiator of the proposed work is determining how well granular sub-step maneuvers in suturing are performed. Surgeons participating in this study will not only provide data through their VR simulation performance, but will also contribute real patient data from the RARP to establish the relationship between surgeon skill, patient factors, and surgical outcomes. Statistical modeling will measure the differential impact of surgeon skill and patient factors to patient outcomes (Aim 3). We hypothesize that innovative application of machine learning algorithms can accurately assess surgeon technical skills, and can further anticipate likelihood of relevant clinical outcomes. The proposed work will enable scalable and actionable feedback in VR, empowering surgeons with valuable knowledge to minimize surgical risk in live surgery.

"Personalized Predictions for Glaucoma Progression Using Artificial Intelligence for Electronic Health Records Project Summary/Abstract: Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness, affecting over 60 million people worldwide. Glaucoma patients vary widely in their presentation, with some retaining long-term disease stability, and others progressing quickly to vision loss. If glaucoma patients at highest risk of progression could be identified early, clinicians could better personalize their treatment approaches. Many clinical factors that affect glaucoma progression, such as intraocular pressure, treatment history, and medication adherence, are documented within the free-text notes of the electronic health records (EHR) and are not in large-scale administrative claims databases. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language processing (NLP) have enabled the integration of the rich and complex EHR data into highly accurate predictive algorithms for health outcomes in medicine and surgery. We hypothesize that we can extend these AI and NLP techniques to build predictive algorithms for glaucoma progression that outperform traditional models reliant on only administrative features. The goal of this project is to build and evaluate predictive algorithms for glaucoma progression using large-scale EHR data, while developing Dr Wang's expertise in AI and NLP, advancing her career as an independent clinician scientist. Aim 1 focuses on using the structured clinical data within the EHR, which are numeric or coded and readily machine-readable, to build baseline machine learning models predicting glaucoma progression requiring surgery. Aim 2 focuses on using and augmenting clinical named entity recognition tools to integrate information from EHR free text into AI models predicting glaucoma progression to surgery. Aim 3 focuses on understanding, explaining, and evaluating the performance of AI algorithms in a real-world prospective setting, by evaluating their performance on key subpopulations, their reliance on key features, and investigating potential areas of bias in a new cohort of glaucoma patients. This proposal is innovative in developing AI-based predictive algorithms for glaucoma progression using numeric and textual clinical data uniquely available in the EHR. The tools and methods Dr Wang will build and evaluate will substantially impact the ophthalmology field by enabling evidence-based tailoring of treatment approaches to patients' unique clinical characteristics, a step towards precision medicine. Furthermore, the careful evaluation of AI predictive algorithms on a new cohort of patients will provide insights into their performance on key subpopulations and reliance on key features, which is critical to advancing our understanding of possible limitations of deploying AI in the clinical workflow. Dr. Wang's career and research will advance under the primary mentorship of Dr. Tina Hernandez-Boussard, a national leader in informatics and expert in using NLP on EHR to improve patient care. Her outstanding Advisory Committee, including clinician-investigators Drs. Pershing, Stein, Chang, and Goldberg, will ensure Dr. Wang's success in becoming an independent clinician-investigator integrating ophthalmology and informatics. Project Narrative/Public Health Statement: This project is relevant to public health in focusing on developing and evaluating predictive algorithms for glaucoma progression, which are necessary to tailor treatment approaches to individual glaucoma patients' needs and achieve optimal treatment outcomes to prevent blindness. The powerful artificial intelligence techniques we will develop and use for large-scale data from electronic health records can be extended to include a wide variety of data sources and shared with the research and clinical community to answer ophthalmic questions in many domains.

"Leveraging Artificial Intelligence for the assessment of severity of depressive symptoms Depression is one of the leading causes of disability worldwide, affecting an estimated 300 million people. Evidence-based treatments are available and measurement-based care has been described as the gold standard. Monitoring of depressive symptoms is currently performed with self-administered and interview- based assessment methods conducted by clinicians in their offices. However, the shortage of mental health specialists and the limited resources available to primary care physicians who often manage patients with depression, prevent close monitoring of symptoms delaying optimal treatment potentially prolonging suffering. Passive recording of behavioral data (gathering information without individual's direct input) has been identified as a potentially feasible method for long-term monitoring of depression. To date, most studies have collected passive behavioral data in ""real time"" through mobile apps (i.e. accelerometer, phone clicks) with the goal of identifying potential markers of depression. However, this method lacks critical biological indicators of depression, including sleep, arousal, and motion. Recent development in wristband sensor technology developed by out lab has allowed to measure physiological parameters like gait, heart rate variability (HRV) and electrodermal activity (EDA) continuously in “real time”, allowing a broader anatomical and neurophysiological understanding of emotion, behavior, and cognition in mood disorders as they occur during routine activity. During the past decade, along with the development of sensors, we have seen the progressive use of machine learning, a branch of artificial intelligence that enables the detection of complex patterns in multimodal data, allowing the development of complex models. The combination of sensor technology and machine learning allows detailed measurement in real time of a wealth of behaviors predicting mood variation. Over the past 2 years, our interdisciplinary team, including one of the leading lab on depression research, and one of the most innovative lab on affective computing, has conducted a study applying machine learning analytics to create a model combining wristband sensors data and phone- based passive measurements to assess severity of depressive symptoms. In our pilot study with depressed patients monitored over 8 weeks, we found that an algorithm based on biological and behavioral sensor data could estimate depression severity evaluated by a clinician with high accuracy. The proposed study will further refine our model in a sample of 100 adults with depression, assessed over 12 weeks. We anticipate that the proposed study will enable the development of an objective, passive, sensor-based algorithm able to measure depressive symptom severity. The identification of reliable, objective, passive assessment of depressive symptoms with biosensors will have significant ramifications for the monitoring of depression, early detection of response, remission and relapse and ultimately contribute to the advancement of precision medicine. Narrative  The proposed project will create a novel method to assess depressive symptoms by harnessing modern machine learning analytics, phone sensors, and wrist-band sensors. Measurement-based treatment is considered optimal and the development of a valid passive, objective, behavioral and biological assessment of depressive symptoms that does not rely on clinician interviews will improve monitoring and ultimately improve treatment significantly. Ultimately, the ability to leverage a remarkable wealth of behavioral and biological data has the potential to transform the delivery of treatment for depression.",Leveraging Artificial Intelligence for the assessment of severity of depressive symptoms,10063043,R01MH118274,"['Accelerometer', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Arousal', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biosensor', 'Caring', 'Cognition', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease remission', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Emotions', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Gait', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Individual', 'Interview', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Melancholias', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Motion', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Pilot Projects', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Primary Care Physician', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Self Administration', 'Severities', 'Sleep', 'Source', 'Specialist', 'Statistical Methods', 'Symptoms', 'Telephone', 'Temperature', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Wrist', 'affective computing', 'anxious', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'depressed patient', 'depressive symptoms', 'disability', 'heart rate variability', 'improved', 'information gathering', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'mobile application', 'multimodal data', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'portability', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'response', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'statistical and machine learning', 'wearable device']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2021,498501
"Development of an artificial intelligence-driven, imaging-based platform for pretreatment identification of extranodal extension in head and neck cancer Project Summary. The goal of this project is to develop, optimize, and evaluate an artificial intelligence (AI)- driven, medical imaging platform that utilizes computed tomography (CT) imaging to identify the presence of extranodal extension (ENE) in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). HNSCC is a debilitating disease with significant patient-related morbidity related to the disease itself and its management, which is complex and consists of a combination of surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. A key factor in determining proper HNSCC management is the presence of ENE, which occurs when tumor infiltrates through the capsule of an involved lymph node into the surrounding tissue. ENE is both an important prognostic factor and an indication for adjuvant treatment escalation with the addition of chemotherapy to radiation following surgery. This “trimodality therapy” is problematic, as it is associated with increased treatment-related morbidity and healthcare costs, but no improvement in disease control compared to upfront chemoradiation alone. The challenge is that ENE can only be definitively diagnosed pathologically after surgery, and pretreatment radiographic ENE identification has proven unreliable for even expert diagnosticians, leading to high rates of trimodality therapy and suboptimal treatment outcomes. In HNSCC management there is a critical need for improved pretreatment ENE identification to 1) select appropriate patients for surgery to avoid the excess morbidity and costs of trimodality therapy, 2) risk-stratify patients optimally, and 3) select appropriate patients for treatment de-escalation or intensification clinical trials. In recent years, Deep learning, a subtype of machine learning, under the umbrella of AI, has generated breakthroughs in computerized medical image analysis, at times outperforming human experts and discovering patterns hidden to the naked eye. While AI is poised to transform the fields of cancer imaging and personalized cancer care, there remain significant barriers to clinical implementation. The hypothesis of this project is that AI can be used to successfully identify HNSCC ENE on pretreatment imaging in retrospective and prospective patient cohorts and to develop a platform for lymph node auto-segmentation that will promote clinical utility of the platform. This hypothesis will be tested by rigorous optimization and evaluation of a deep learning ENE identification platform. Specifically, the platform will be validated for accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and discriminatory performance on two heterogeneous retrospective datasets and two prospective cohorts derived from institutional and national Phase II clinical trials for HNSCC patients. The platform will then be directly compared with head and neck radiologists to determine if radiologist performance can be augmented with AI. In parallel, AI will be utilized to develop an auto-segmentation platform for tumor and lymph nodes, which will 1) improve the platform's clinical impact and 2) provide a valuable tool for treatment planning and future imaging-based research for HNSCC patients. 1 Project Narrative Identification of extranodal extension (ENE) for head and neck cancer in the pretreatment setting would be extremely useful in selecting the optimal treatment strategy for patients. Currently, ENE can only be definitively diagnosed pathologically after surgery, and pretreatment radiographic ENE prediction has proven unreliable for expert diagnosticians. This project uses artificial intelligence to identify ENE pretreatment on Computed Tomography, with the goal of developing a clinically usable tool to help patients with newly diagnosed head and neck cancers and their physicians choose the most effective treatment strategy that minimizes the risk of side effects.","Development of an artificial intelligence-driven, imaging-based platform for pretreatment identification of extranodal extension in head and neck cancer",10105483,K08DE030216,"['Adjuvant', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biopsy', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Evaluation', 'Extranodal', 'Eye', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma', 'Head and neck structure', 'Health Care Costs', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Institution', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Medical Imaging', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neck Dissection', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Output', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phase II Clinical Trials', 'Physicians', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Process', 'Prognostic Factor', 'Prospective cohort', 'Radiation', 'Radiation therapy', 'Research', 'Scanning', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Treatment outcome', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'automated segmentation', 'base', 'cancer imaging', 'capsule', 'chemoradiation', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical implementation', 'cohort', 'computerized', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'design', 'disorder control', 'effective therapy', 'heuristics', 'imaging platform', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'lymph nodes', 'neural network', 'neural network architecture', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'patient stratification', 'personalized cancer care', 'phase II trial', 'prediction algorithm', 'prospective', 'prospective test', 'radiologist', 'radiomics', 'risk minimization', 'risk stratification', 'side effect', 'success', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor']",NIDCR,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K08,2021,168240
"Deep learning to quantify glaucomatous damage on fundus photographs for teleophthalmology PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Candidate: Atalie Carina Thompson, MD, MPH is a current glaucoma fellow and Heed fellow with a long-term career goal of becoming an independent clinician-scientist and leader in the field of glaucoma and public health. She has a long-standing interest in addressing healthcare disparities in medicine, and in improving the diagnosis of glaucoma and other ophthalmic diseases through imaging technology. While obtaining a medical degree at Stanford, she received a fellowship to complete a master’s degree in public health with additional higher-level coursework in biostatistics and epidemiology. Her immediate goal in this proposal is to refine and validate a deep learning (DL) algorithm capable of quantifying neuroretinal damage on optic disc photographs and then to apply it in a pilot teleophthalmology program. With a K23 Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award, she will acquire additional didactic training and mentored research experience in glaucoma imaging, machine learning, biostatistics, clinical research, and the responsible conduct of research. Environment: The mentorship and expertise of the advisory committee, the extensive resources at the Duke Eye Center and Departments of Biostatistics and Biomedical Engineering, and the significant institutional commitment will provide her with the support needed to transition successfully into an independent clinician-scientist. Research: This proposal will test the hypothesis that a DL algorithm trained with SDOCT detects glaucoma on optic disc photographs with greater accuracy than human graders. In Specific Aim 1, a DL algorithm that quantifies neuroretinal damage on optic disc photographs will be refined. The main hypothesis is that the quantitative output provided by the DL algorithm will allow accurate discrimination of eyes at different stages of the disease according to standard automated perimetry, and will generate cut-offs suitable for use in a screening setting. In Specific Aim 2, the short-term repeatability and reproducibility of the DL algorithm in optic disc photographs acquired over a time period of several weeks will be determined. The hypothesis is that the test-retest variability of the predictions from the DL algorithm will be similar to the original measurements acquired by SDOCT. In Specific Aim 3, the DL algorithm will be applied to optic disc photographs obtained during a pilot screening teleophthalmology program in primary care clinics and assisted living facilities. The hypothesis is that the DL algorithm will be more accurate than human graders when a full ophthalmic examination is used as the gold standard. This work will constitute the basis of an R01 grant and will advance our understanding of the application of deep learning algorithms in glaucoma and teleophthalmology. PROJECT NARRATIVE Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness in the world. However, since the disease can be asymptomatic until later stages, many patients with glaucoma will not know they have glaucoma until they suffer substantial and irreversible visual field loss.

"Machine Learning Models for Identifying Neural Predictors of TMS Treatment Response in MDD Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is an effective and easy-to-tolerate treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD). TMS is costly and time-intensive so identifying markers of response would reduce financial and psychological burden. Further, treatment response is highly variable. Clinical and diagnostic heterogeneity of depression contributes to significant variability in neural markers of response. The literature on neural markers is complicated by variability in TMS intensity and targets, which may further modify response. Electrical field models estimate the degree to which a target is stimulated by considering both the intensity and structural information of each participant but at this time there are no studies that have investigated the association between brain electrical fields and treatment response. Moreover, the neurobiological correlates of dorsolateral (dlPFC) TMS treatment response are not well understood. Machine learning may be able to help us understand these complex set of features and their association to treatment response. Thus to appropriately personalize treatments, I will develop a data-driven machine learning model that uses the following: (1) pre- treatment resting state connectivity that reflects circuit dysregulation; (2) electrical field modeling to estimate the electrical field or voltage on individual patient’s brain, as a marker of sufficiency of stimulation; and (3) expected target network connectivity as a marker of target engagement. We have previously demonstrated feasibility of machine learning to predict antidepressant response in MDD. We will optimize and expand a model developed on archival University of Toronto data that predicted dlPFC TMS response. We will validate this externally on three sets of data: data we collect at University of Pittsburgh, archival data from Brown University, and sham TMS data. As an exploratory aim, we will identify whether our model that predicts dlPFC TMS treatment response is capable of predicting response to dmPFC TMS stimulation. During my PhD in Bioengineering, I developed kernel-based machine learning models to personalize neural networks markers of antidepressant response. Given the clinical and neural heterogeneity of depression, I will leverage my machine learning and neuroimaging experience by receiving training in advanced optimization approaches and depression neurobiology to identify stable, reproducible neural predictors of TMS treatment response to achieve clinically translatable personalized treatments. This will allow me to develop optimized models of treatment response and facilitate my long-term career goal to develop personalized treatment algorithms using large-scale data. My previous experiences in machine learning, bioengineering, neuroimaging, as well as the preliminary understanding of depression uniquely position me to maximize the benefits of training aims outlined in this proposal. 1 This is a K01 application designed to develop a data-driven machine learning model that will take into account several neural markers of response to Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS). The application proposes expanded training in machine learning optimization approaches and depression neurobiology for the applicant, who has a PhD in Bioengineering. The goal of the study is to identify stable, reproducible neural predictors of TMS treatment response to achieve clinically translatable personalized treatments, which matches the candidate’s long-term goal to conduct research on and develop models that personalize medicine for depression. 1",Machine Learning Models for Identifying Neural Predictors of TMS Treatment Response in MDD,10125330,K01MH122741,"['Algorithms', 'Anterior', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Archives', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Complex', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Left', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Placebos', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transcranial magnetic stimulation', 'Universities', 'archive data', 'archived data', 'base', 'career', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinically translatable', 'cohort', 'cost', 'design', 'electric field', 'executive function', 'experience', 'individual patient', 'large scale data', 'neural network', 'neuroimaging', 'personalized medicine', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'psychologic', 'random forest', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'support vector machine', 'translational scientist', 'treatment response', 'voltage']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,K01,2021,170027
"AICORE-kids: Artificial Intelligence COVID-19 Risk AssEssment for kids This work is directed at characterizing pediatric COVID-19 and stratifying incoming patients by projected (future) disease severity. Such stratification has several implications: immediately improving treatment planning, and as disease mechanistic pathways are uncovered, directing treatment. Predicting future severity will inform the risks of outpatient treatment; to the patients themselves, their family, other caregivers/cohabitants, and to schools and employers. As varying levels of “reopening” are adopted across the country (and the world), such prognostication will inform policy on the handling of pediatric carriers in the community. Based on our preliminary analysis we assert that a combination of novel assays including quantitative serology inflammatory markers (cytokine/chemokine profiles, immune profiles), transcriptomics, epigenomics, longitudinal physiological monitoring, time series analysis, imaging, radiomics and clinical observation including social determinants of health, contains adequate information even at early stages of infection to stratify the disease and predict disease severity. We propose an artificial intelligence/machine learning approach to integrate this rich and heterogeneous dataset, characterize the spectrum of disease and identify biosignatures that predict severity in progressive disease. To facilitate translation of the approaches developed in this work to a wide user community, we incorporate a Translational Development function, to oversee the design-control process and ensure readiness of our methods for regulatory review.

"Artificial intelligence Optical Coherence Tomography Guided Deep Anterior Lamellar Keratoplasty (AUTO-DALK) PROJECT SUMMARY  Contemporary ocular surgeries are performed by skilled surgeons through operating microscopes, utilizing freehand techniques and manually operated precision micro-instruments, where the outcomes are often limited by the surgeon's skill levels and experiences. To overcome these human factors, we have assembled an interdisciplinary team including a clinician-scientist and eye surgeon, an optical device scientist and medical robotic engineers to translate existing and developing technologies in our laboratories into precision, “deep- learning” artificial intelligence (AI) guided robotic ocular surgical devices for precise automated Deep Anterior Lamellar Keratoplasty (AUTO-DALK).  DALK is a highly attractive treatment of corneal disease with normally functioning endothelium. However, the procedure is unusually challenging from a technical perspective and time-consuming, limiting its acceptance among corneal surgeons. The most challenging aspect of the procedure is related to the delamination of stroma from Descemet's membrane (DM). A procedure, commonly called “Big Bubble” is used to separate stroma from DM using deep intrastromal pneumatic injection. However, even experienced surgeons have difficulty precisely placing the injection. The most common complication of DALK is the excessive depth of the needle insertion resulting in Descemet's membrane perforation requiring conversion to full-thickness penetrating keratoplasty with its much longer recovery period and a higher risk of graft failure from rejection. The reported rates of Descemet's membrane perforation for beginner and experienced surgeons are 31.8% and 11.7% respectively. In addition, interface haze between the donor and recipient cornea is a common problem caused by the insufficient depth of needle insertion and failure to remove the host stromal tissue, which results in loss of postoperative visual acuity. These problems relate directly to the inability of the current surgical practice to precisely assess the depth of the tooltips inside the cornea layer in real-time.  Here we will build upon our previous and ongoing work in robust fiber optic common-path optical coherence tomography (CP-OCT) and AI-guide system based on convolutional neural network (CNN) robotic microsurgical tools that enable clinicians to precisely guide surgical tools at micron scale. The proposed AUTO- DALK surgical tool system is capable of one-dimensional real-time depth tracking, motion compensation, and detection of early instrument contact with tissue, which enables clinicians to perform DALK precisely and safely. The tool will be built on a handheld platform that will consist of CP-OCT probe, trephine and microinjector that allows precise and safe removal of the anterior section of cornea down to DM  We hypothesize that AI-OCT providing intelligent visualization and depth controlled optimal cornea cutting and tissue tracking will perform the task of DALK with better accuracy and efficiency over the manually performed trephine cutting and “Big Bubble” pneumodissection. Project Narrative  This proposal addresses fundamental limitations in current corneal transplant surgery by developing an artificial intelligence guided compact robotic surgical tool that could empower corneal surgeons to achieve difficult surgical objectives, reduce intraoperative complications, and improve clinical outcomes when performing Deep Anterior Lamellar Keratoplasty (DALK). Further, these capabilities are broadly applicable in other microsurgical problems, and the tools will enable further advances both for ophthalmology and for other microsurgical disciplines.",Artificial intelligence Optical Coherence Tomography Guided Deep Anterior Lamellar Keratoplasty (AUTO-DALK),10100636,R01EY032127,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adrenal Cortex Hormones', 'Animal Model', 'Anterior', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Blindness', 'Blunt Trauma', 'Burr hole procedure', 'Cadaver', 'Clinical', 'Complication', 'Consumption', 'Cornea', 'Corneal Diseases', 'Corneal Opacity', 'Corneal dystrophy', 'Data', 'Descemet&apos', 's membrane', 'Devices', 'Dimensions', 'Discipline', 'Distal', 'Drops', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Endophthalmitis', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Endothelium', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Epithelial', 'Excision', 'Expert Systems', 'Eye', 'Eye Surgeon', 'Failure', 'Fiber Optics', 'Financial compensation', 'Geometry', 'Glaucoma', 'Goals', 'Graft Survival', 'Hemorrhage', 'Human', 'Image', 'Immune', 'Incidence', 'Infection', 'Injections', 'Intelligence', 'Intraoperative Complications', 'Iris', 'Keratoconus', 'Keratoplasty', 'Laboratories', 'Lamellar Keratoplasty', 'Lead', 'Manuals', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Microscope', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Needles', 'Ocular Hypertension', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Ophthalmology', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Optics', 'Oryctolagus cuniculus', 'Outcome', 'Pathological Dilatation', 'Patients', 'Penetrating Keratoplasty', 'Perforation', 'Performance', 'Postoperative Complications', 'Postoperative Period', 'Procedures', 'Ptosis', 'Recovery', 'Repeat Surgery', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Robotics', 'Rupture', 'Safety', 'Scientist', 'Secondary to', 'Structure', 'Surgeon', 'Surgical complication', 'System', 'Systems Development', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Topical Corticosteroids', 'Translating', 'Transplantation Surgery', 'Trauma', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'Visual Acuity', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'base', 'convolutional neural network', 'corneal scar', 'curative treatments', 'deep learning', 'design', 'experience', 'graft failure', 'high risk', 'iatrogenic injury', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'instrument', 'interest', 'novel', 'phantom model', 'photonics', 'preservation', 'prototype', 'sensor', 'skills', 'surgery outcome', 'tool']",NEI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,409997
"Deep Learning Approaches for Personalized Modeling and Forecasting of Glaucomatous Changes Project Summary Glaucoma is a leading cause of vision morbidity and blindness worldwide. Early disease detection and sensitive monitoring of progression are crucial to allow timely treatment for preservation of vision. The introduction of ocular imaging technologies significantly improves these capabilities, but in clinical practice there are still substantial challenges at managing the optimal care for individual cases due to difficulties of accurately assessing the potential progression and its speed and magnitude. These difficulties are due to a variety of causes that change over the course of the disease, including large inter-subject variability, inherent measurement variability, image quality, varying dynamic ranges of measurements, minimal measurable level of tissues, etc. In this proposal, we propose novel agnostic data-driven deep learning approaches to detect glaucoma and accurately forecast its progression that are optimized to each individual case. We will use state- of-the-art automated computerized machine learning methods, namely the deep learning approach, to identify structural features embedded within OCT images that are associated with glaucoma and its progression without any a priori assumptions. This will provide novel insight into structural information, and has shown very encouraging preliminary results. Instead of relying on the conventional knowledge-based approaches (e.g. quantifying tissues known to be significantly associated with glaucoma such as retinal nerve fiber layer), the proposed cutting-edge agnostic deep learning approaches determine the features responsible for future structural and functional changes out of thousands of features autonomously by learning from the provided large longitudinal dataset. This program will advance the use of structural and functional information obtained in the clinics with a substantial impact on the clinical management of subjects with glaucoma. Furthermore, the developed methods have potentials to be applied to various clinical applications beyond glaucoma and ophthalmology. Project Narrative This research proposal is focusing on the development and refinement of innovative analytical methods and cutting-edge technologies using agnostic deep learning approaches that will substantially improve detection of glaucoma and its progression forecasting and monitoring in order to prevent blindness.",Deep Learning Approaches for Personalized Modeling and Forecasting of Glaucomatous Changes,10089451,R01EY030929,"['3-Dimensional', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Blindness', 'Brain', 'Caring', 'Clinic', 'Clinic Visits', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Collaborations', 'Color', 'Complex', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease model', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Eye', 'Future', 'Glaucoma', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Ophthalmology', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Retina', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Vision', 'Visit', 'Visual Fields', 'analytical method', 'base', 'case-by-case basis', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'computerized', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'falls', 'feature selection', 'follow-up', 'image processing', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'insight', 'knowledge base', 'longitudinal analysis', 'longitudinal dataset', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'ocular imaging', 'personalized approach', 'personalized medicine', 'personalized predictions', 'predictive modeling', 'preservation', 'prevent', 'programs', 'retinal nerve fiber layer', 'theories', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'trend']",NEI,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2021,376028
"Identifying treatment responders in medication trials for AUD using machine learning approaches ABSTRACT Alcohol use disorder (AUD), as defined in DSM-5, represents a highly prevalent, costly, and often untreated condition in the United States. Pharmacotherapy offers a promising avenue for treating AUD and for improving clinical outcomes for this debilitating disorder. While developing novel medications to treat AUD remains a high priority research area, there remain major opportunities to further elucidate clinical response in completed medication trials. To that end, a key question in randomized clinical trials (RCTs) is which patients respond to a given pharmacotherapy. Identifying treatment responders provides major opportunities to advance clinical care for AUD by personalizing medication practices on the bases of variables/predictors of good clinical response. For example, while the effect size for medications such as naltrexone is deemed small-to-moderate, a host of studies over the past decade have shown that its effect size may be considerably larger for certain subgroups of patients. Towards advancing precision medicine for AUD and leveraging data from a host of carefully conducted RCTs for AUD, this R03 application seeks to conduct secondary data analysis. Specifically, we propose to analyze data from four RCTs conducted by the NIAAA Clinical Investigations Group (NCIG). These state-of-the-art RCTs for AUD have tested the following pharmacotherapies: (a) quetiapine, (b) Levetiracetam XR (Keppra XR®), (c) Varenicline (Chantix®), and (d) HORIZANT® (Gabapentin Enacarbil) Extended-Release. In this R03 application, we propose to use a machine learning approach to identify treatment responders in the NCIG RCTs. Machine learning represents a highly promising and underutilized data analytic strategy in the field of AUD treatment response. Machine learning models prioritize the ability to predict future outcomes over creating perfectly fitting models for the data at hand. This results in models which are more generalizable to future observations, which fits well with our goal of identifying responders in RCTs. Leveraging data from these pivotal RCTs through secondary data analysis and using novel analytic methods, namely machine learning, provides a cost-effective approach to identifying AUD pharmacotherapy responders.

"Personalized Deep Learning Models of Rapid Changes in Major Depressive Disorder Symptoms using Passive Sensor Data from Smartphones and Wearable Devices ABSTRACT Major depressive disorder (MDD) is highly prevalent and the leading cause of global disease burden. Associated with over 1,000 different symptom profiles, MDD is highly heterogeneous. The majority of MDD symptom change occurs across hours. Consequently, there is a need to increasingly focus MDD research on personalized assessment of these rapid symptom fluctuations. To date, personalized models of MDD have shown promise, but relied solely on self-report measures. There is thus a critical need to develop personalized models of MDD that incorporate objective signals. Passively collected information from smartphones and wearable sensors can continuously and unobtrusively track behavioral and physiological signals related to core disturbances associated with MDD, including psychomotor retardation, sleep disturbances, social contact, behavioral activation, heart rate variability, and screen time. Preliminary data suggest that personalized artificial intelligence (i.e., personally weighted deep learning models) are well suited for creating novel personalized digital biomarkers of these passive indicators, and that these biomarkers can predict rapid changes in MDD symptoms. This proposal will investigate the ability to develop personalized deep learning models of rapid changes in MDD symptoms among a nationally representative sample of 120 treatment seeking adults with MDD across 90 days using passively collected data from smartphones and wearable sensors. This proposal aims to test the accuracy of personalized, subtyped, and cohort-based modeling techniques and uncover personalized digital biomarkers of moment-to-moment changes in MDD symptoms. The project proposes the following innovations: it will (1) conduct the first passive-sensing study of MDD in a nationally-representative cohort; (2) utilize deep learning models to aid in the discovery of novel maintenance factors of MDD symptom changes; and (3) use personalized multimodal assessments of MDD to address the heterogeneity in MDD. In line with the aims of the NIMH Research Domain Criteria (RDoC), this project will study MDD symptom changes across multiple units of analysis and integrate multiple systems. This study will provide a critical step towards uncovering novel personalized maintenance patterns of MDD symptom changes in daily life. Further, it will allow for scalable personalized treatments to be developed using technology to deliver behavioral interventions in the moments immediately preceding rapid MDD symptom changes. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project aims to utilize personalized artificial intelligence techniques and objective data (collected from smartphones and wearable devices) to create individualized digital biomarkers of rapid changes in major depressive disorder symptoms. This is important because, if we were to uncover personalized patterns between objectively measured physiology and behavioral changes and understand their resulting impact on rapid fluctuations in major depressive disorder symptoms, we would be able to define new, person-specific maintenance patterns that underlie the wide-ranging heterogeneity that is currently seen in patients suffering from major depressive disorder. Moreover, these advancements will provide a crucial step forward towards developing personalized, scalable, technology-based interventions that will be able to be delivered immediately (and, ideally, before rapid symptom changes) among those persons with major depressive disorder.",Personalized Deep Learning Models of Rapid Changes in Major Depressive Disorder Symptoms using Passive Sensor Data from Smartphones and Wearable Devices,10229551,R01MH123482,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Arousal', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cessation of life', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Deterioration', 'Devices', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Enrollment', 'Exposure to', 'Fostering', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Light', 'Location', 'Maintenance', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'Motor', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Negative Valence', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Photoplethysmography', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Positive Valence', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Subgroup', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Wrist', 'actigraphy', 'analog', 'base', 'biomarker-driven', 'burden of illness', 'cohort', 'deep learning', 'depressive symptoms', 'digital', 'disability', 'heart rate variability', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'meetings', 'microphone', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'phenomenological models', 'premature', 'prevent', 'sensor', 'social', 'treatment planning', 'treatment response', 'tv watching', 'wearable device', 'wearable sensor technology']",NIMH,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2021,173784
"Development of a Machine Learning Model for Liver Transplantation PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Currently, there are nearly 13,000 patients waitlisted for liver transplant, yet only two-thirds will receive a transplant, and in 2018 approximately 2,500 patients died or were removed from the waitlist due to medical deterioration. This shortage of donor livers available for transplant has led to the use of marginal livers – livers that are higher risk than typical donor livers but may be safely transplantable in carefully selected recipients. These include older donors (>70 years), steatotic livers, and livers procured through donation after cardiac death. Due to their riskiness, these marginal livers are often declined, yet as many as 84% of patients who died on the transplant waitlist declined one or more marginal livers prior to death. In light of this, certain waitlisted candidates might have derived a survival benefit from undergoing transplantation with a marginal organ rather than remaining on the waitlist (i.e. they would have survived longer after a transplant with a marginal liver than they would have survived on the waitlist). Currently, decisions about whether a particular marginal liver is suitable for a particular candidate are based on clinical gestalt or simple subgroup analysis using traditional regression models, which likely do not fully approximate the complex interactions between donor, recipient, and transplant factors. To account for this, we will utilize machine learning (which can incorporate complex, higher-order interactions) to predict whether a specific candidate would derive a survival benefit from undergoing transplantation with a specific marginal liver, and interview transplant candidates and surgeons to understand how best to translate these predictions into an immediately clinically-useful decision aid. To accomplish this, we will leverage Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipient (SRTR) national data (n=293,140) and use a machine technique (random forests) to address the following aims: (1) To predict waitlist survival for waitlisted liver transplant candidates; (2) To predict post-transplant survival for liver transplant recipients of a marginal liver; and (3) To create a decision aid that compares predicted waitlist survival and predicted post-transplant survival for a specific transplant candidates with marginal liver. These aims are highly feasible given our group’s expertise in liver transplantation, analysis of national registry data, and machine learning techniques. We hypothesize that utilizing SRTR and machine learning, we can accurately predict post-transplant survival for a particular candidate with a particular marginal liver, as well as waitlist survival for that same candidate without a liver. We also hypothesize that our decision aid could be utilized in real-time to inform clinical decision-making. If the proposed aims are achieved, our decision aid could be utilized to improve clinical practice by bringing high-quality risk prediction directly to patients and transplant professionals to directly inform the real-time clinical decision of whether a candidate should undergo transplant with a marginal liver. PROJECT NARRATIVE There are far fewer donor livers available for transplant than patients who need them, which has led to the use of marginal livers – livers that are riskier than typical donor livers but yet might still provide a benefit to carefully selected patients. However, the decision to use a particular marginal liver for a particular patient is based largely on clinical gestalt or traditional clinical studies, which likely do not account for the complex relationships between donor, recipient, and transplant characteristics. To optimally inform the decision to undergo transplantation with a marginal liver or not, we propose to utilize machine learning to generate personalized risk predictions of post-transplant survival with that specific marginal liver and waitlist survival without that liver, and then develop a decision aid to be used by patients and surgeons to compare predicted survival between both options.",Development of a Machine Learning Model for Liver Transplantation,10208791,F32DK124962,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Cardiac Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Decision Aid', 'Decision Making', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Enrollment', 'Focus Groups', 'Goals', 'Instruction', 'Interview', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Liver', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Observational Study', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ', 'Organ Transplantation', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Public Health Schools', 'Qualitative Research', 'Recording of previous events', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Scientist', 'Statistical Computing', 'Subgroup', 'Surgeon', 'Survey Methodology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Transplant Surgeon', 'Transplantation', 'Waiting Lists', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical investigation', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'data registry', 'high risk', 'improved', 'interest', 'liver transplantation', 'personalized decision', 'personalized predictions', 'personalized risk prediction', 'post-transplant', 'programs', 'public health research', 'random forest', 'recruit', 'risk prediction', 'survival prediction', 'theories', 'transplant registry', 'web site']",NIDDK,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,F32,2021,84562
"Artificial intelligence assisted panoramic Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography for Retinopathy of Prematurity PROJECT SUMMARY The long-term goal of this project is to determine whether optical coherence tomography (OCT) and OCT angiography (OCTA) might lead more accurate and objective diagnosis, earlier intervention, and improved outcomes in retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). International consensus and National Institute of Health (NIH) funded clinical trials over the last 30 years have defined the phenotypic classifications, natural history, prognosis, and management of ROP. However, it is well established that due to the subjectivity of the ophthalmoscopic examination, and systematic bias between examiners, there is significant variation in treatment of the most severe forms of ROP in the real world. This leads to both under-treatment (and poor outcomes due to retinal detachment) and over-treatment (exposing neonates to the ocular and systemic risks of treatment). Roughly 20,000 babies per year develop retinal detachments (RD) due to ROP and there is strong evidence that most of these are preventable. In adult retinal vascular diseases, most notably diabetic retinopathy (DR), OCT and OCTA can detect and quantify disease features such as diabetic macular edema (DME) and retinal neovascularization (NV) before they are noted clinically, enabling earlier treatment and reducing the risk of blindness from RD. However, evaluating the use of this technology in neonates requires high speed and portable technology, and the commercially available handheld OCTs are too slow for ultra-widefield (UWF) OCT and OCTA imaging. Several groups (including our own) have published preliminary results using prototype 100 to 200 kHz swept- source (SS) OCT systems, however consistent data acquisition remains challenging due to the lack of fixation and subsequent motion in an awake neonate, which has limited the evaluation of the potential benefits of the technology in this population. Recently, there has been much interest in using artificial intelligence (AI) (specifically deep learning), which relies on high speed graphics processing units (GPUs) to provide real time OCT image processing, segmentation, and tracking. This application addresses 2 fundamental gaps in knowledge: (1) Can we overcome the technical challenges through the development of a faster ultrawide-field view SS-OCT system coupled with a GPU-enabled DL software system to enable consistent data acquisition in neonates? (2) Would quantitative objective metrics of ROP improve objectivity of ROP diagnosis and detect subclinical signs of disease progression which may enable earlier intervention and improved outcomes in the future. By leveraging our institution’s OCT, AI, and ROP expertise, we will address these questions in three specific aims: (1) Develop an ultra-high speed, handheld, panoramic ultra-widefield OCT/OCTA system. (2) Develop real time GPU accelerated intelligent image acquisition software. (3) Evaluate the clinical significance OCT derived biomarkers. Successful translation of this technology to the ROP population could improve the accuracy and objectivity of ROP diagnosis, and lead to earlier intervention and improved outcomes in patients with severe ROP. PROJECT NARRATIVE Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) and OCT angiography (OCTA) have proven the ability to detect subclinical disease, provide quantitative evaluation of disease progression, and improve outcomes in the leading causes of blindness in adults, age-related macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy. Technological and practical limitations have limited the application of this technology in routine use for non-sedated children undergoing routine screening for retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), the leading cause of blindness in children. The proposed project will develop an ultra-high speed, handheld OCT system with graphics processing unit (GPU) enabled real-time processing to improve the feasibility of panoramic ultra-widefield OCT/OCTA imaging in non-sedated neonates and evaluate the clinical utility of OCT-derived biomarkers in ROP.",Artificial intelligence assisted panoramic Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography for Retinopathy of Prematurity,10198930,R01HD107494,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Aftercare', 'Age related macular degeneration', 'Algorithms', 'Angiography', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological Markers', 'Blindness', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Coupled', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Dyes', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Fluorescein Angiography', 'Funding', 'Fundus', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Injections', 'Institution', 'Intelligence', 'International', 'Knowledge', 'Lasers', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Measurement', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Natural History', 'Neonatal', 'Ophthalmic examination and evaluation', 'Ophthalmoscopes', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Peripheral', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Primary Health Care', 'Publishing', 'Quantitative Evaluations', 'Retina', 'Retinal Detachment', 'Retinal Neovascularization', 'Retinopathy of Prematurity', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systematic Bias', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Visualization', 'accurate diagnosis', 'arm', 'awake', 'base', 'blind', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinically significant', 'data acquisition', 'deep learning', 'design', 'diabetic', 'disease classification', 'disorder of macula of retina', 'image processing', 'imaging Segmentation', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'instrument', 'interest', 'lens', 'macular edema', 'neonate', 'neovascularization', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'overtreatment', 'parallel computer', 'portability', 'prototype', 'real-time images', 'research clinical testing', 'routine screening', 'sample fixation', 'software systems', 'standard of care', 'treatment response', 'treatment risk']",NICHD,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,377300
"A Quantitative Risk Model for Predicting Outcome and Identifying Structural Biomarkers of Treatment Targets in Oral Cancer on a Large Multi-Center Patient Cohort Post-resection prognostication for oral cavity cancers (OCC) is qualitative and potentially ambiguous. A significant subset (25-37%) of Stage I/II patients still develop local recurrence after treatment with surgery alone. The long-term goal of this proposal will be to create a Quantitative Risk Model (QRM) using machine learning and artificial intelligence to predict recurrence risk for Stage I/II patients using image-based biomarkers of aggression. The objective is to develop and validate state-of-the-art systems for biomarker imaging, quantification, and modeling to accurately predict risk of recurrence in cancer patients based on image analytics. The central hypothesis is that a quantitative, artificial intelligence approach to pathology will result in significantly greater prognostic value compared with manual microscope-based analysis. The rationale for this work is that tumor aggression can be predicted from patterns present in pathology images, given the existence of histological risk models that have been clinically validated in the past; however, these risk models are not in widespread use because they are less accurate, robust, and transportable to the larger community of pathologists. This proposal will test the central hypothesis through three specific aims: (1) Develop an analysis pipeline that can accurately predict recurrence risk for Stage I/II OCC patients and identify treatment targets (e.g. adaptive local immune response and angiogenesis); (2) Demonstrate robust performance across a multi-site data cohort collected from seven national and international centers; and (3) Distil the results of QRM analysis to synoptic pathology reporting, demonstrating the ability of QRM to interface with standard clinical reporting tools. The innovation for addressing these aims comes from a unique application of active learning for training artificial intelligence to recognize tissue structures, new features for quantifying tissue architecture based on the interface between tumor and host, and a novel approach for large cross-site validation. Moreover, this proposal develops a unique mapping between computational pathology and commonly-used synoptic reporting variables, enabling rapid uptake of this work into existing clinical workflows. This research is significant because it provides personalized outcome predictions for a niche group of undertreated patients with limited options and can serve as the foundation for designing future clinical trials through identification of treatment targets. Multi-site training and evaluation, combined with AI-to-report mapping, will be broadly applicable to a large group of computational approaches, bridging the gap between engineering research labs and clinical application. The expected outcome of this work is a trained model for predicting Stage I/II OCC recurrence, identification of treatment targets, and mapping to synoptic reports, as well as a broadly-applicable workflow for the broader computational pathology community. This project will have a large positive impact on patients and surgical pathologists by enabling rapid, accurate prognosis and directed treatment plans in an easy-to-use pipeline that integrates seamlessly into existing clinical workflows. We aim to develop a quantitative risk model for oral cavity cancer patients, 25-37% of whom will experience debilitating post-treatment recurrence. Using state-of-the-art machine learning and artificial intelligence methods, we will develop and validate our risk model on a large multi-site cohort of patients, and develop an AI-assisted synoptic report-filling tool for integrating into clinical practice.

"Digital Phenotyping of Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease 1  2 PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  3  4 One of the most critical gaps in management of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the lack of effective  5 methods of early identification in the population. The objective of this study is to leverage data and analytics to  6 improve healthcare outcomes by early detection and risk stratification of NAFLD, before onset of liver-related  7 complications. Artificial intelligence applications in large electronic health records have the potential to identify  8 disease traits before onset of disease. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that targeted screening with  9 machine-learning models applied to large integrated healthcare datasets can identify individuals with NAFLD 10 and, more specifically, those with a progressive phenotype. We will test the central hypothesis in 2 specific 11 AIMs. First, we will train a machine learning model of NAFLD prediction using multiple longitudinal data points 12 of all health-care encounters of a well-characterized population-based cohort of individuals diagnosed with 13 NAFLD in reference to individuals without NAFLD from the general population. We hypothesize that 14 unsupervised machine learning can identify complex processes and patterns without a human's guidance and 15 discover early comorbidity clusters (“latent traits” present prior to NAFLD development) that reflect a phenotype 16 at risk to develop NAFLD later in life. Second, we will test and optimize the model for the prediction of patient 17 outcomes (development of cirrhosis, liver-related complications and death) in the NAFLD cohort. We 18 hypothesize that machine learning approaches could be used to further stratify patients into subgroups with 19 different disease trajectories, with the goal of identifying those individuals at risk of progressive NAFLD and 20 liver-related outcomes. The research proposed in this application is innovative because it expands the 21 analytical toolbox beyond conventional methods to identify individuals with NAFLD using all health-encounters 22 of a large, well-characterized population-based cohort with long follow-up. This proposal is significant because 23 it addresses a critical need of identification and management of the most prevalent chronic liver disease and 24 offers a practical solution to large scale implementation of screening and risk-stratification strategies using 25 routinely collected data. The ultimate goal of this proposal is to improve the population health in obesity- 26 associated diseases. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal will use innovative statistical methodology to improve the understanding of factors that predict an individual’s risk to develop nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and liver-related complications using routinely collected data available during the health care course of an individual. The development of effective and accessible tools to predict the risk of future development of liver disease will enable timely intervention to prevent the disease and reduce the burden of illness and mortality associated with obesity.

"Leveraging Big Data and Deep Learning to Develop Next Generation Decision Support Tools to Improve Glycemic Outcomes in Type 1 Diabetes Project Summary The hallmark of type 1 diabetes (T1D) is insufficient insulin production caused by pancreatic beta cell dysfunction. Most people treat their T1D through multiple daily injections (MDI) of insulin or use of a transcutaneous insulin pump. Several decision support smartphone apps exist to help people estimate insulin doses based on continuous glucose monitor (CGM) data and food intake. More sophisticated decision support tools employ mathematical models of human physiology to predict future glucose levels and provide generalized insulin therapy recommendations. Exercise is a crucial component of the long-term management of T1D, however many people avoid physical activity for fear of hypoglycemia (< 70 mg/dL). While consensus guidelines exist to help people manage glucose during physical activity, people still experience acute complications. Mathematical models of aerobic exercise yield promise in predicting hypoglycemia during controlled in- clinic experiments but do not perform well in the real-world or during other types of exercise. There is a critical need for a decision support system that helps people with T1D maintain safe glucose levels around exercise of varying types. The goal of this proposal is to develop a decision support tool to help people with T1D who utilize CGM better manage their glucose surrounding exercise. This tool will be called AIDES, the Artificially Intelligent Diabetic Exercise Support system. We hypothesize that use of a novel exercise- specific decision support tool, powered by predictive physiological modelling, artificial intelligence (AI), and deep learning, can provide treatment recommendations to reduce the number of hypoglycemic events experienced by people with T1D around regular physical exercise. In our first aim, we will develop a new model of resistance exercise that describes both insulin- and non-insulin mediated effects on glucose dynamics. We will then create a novel hybrid computational framework that harnesses AI to augment physiology models of aerobic and resistance exercise. This hybrid framework, called physAI, will harness real- world, free-living exercise data from the T1Dexi project (Big Data). In our second aim, we will leverage decades of research into deep learning with the Big Data provided by the T1Dexi project to train an AI-based decision support system that gives treatment recommendations to help users maintain target glucose during exercise. In our third aim, we will assess the safety and usability of our decision support engine in a small proof-of-concept study with human participants, supported by the Sponsor. This will be the first decision support system specifically designed to provide treatment recommendations that help users maintain safe glucose levels while performing aerobic and resistance exercise. Project Narrative Type 1 diabetes is difficult to manage during exercise, and few validated tools exist to recommend treatment options to avoid dangerous complications resulting from low blood glucose. This proposal combines physiological modelling and deep learning to develop a novel artificial intelligence decision support system to help multiple daily injection users maintain safe blood glucose levels during and after exercise. We will build and validate this system in three parts: 1) we will tune a decision support system to correctly identify issues in patient glycemic control and recommend appropriate treatment modifications; 2) we will develop a new hypoglycemia prediction tool that reflects the longitudinal dynamics of glucose uptake during and after exercise; and 3) we will explore the performance of this decision support system and hypoglycemia prediction tool in a clinical trial.",Leveraging Big Data and Deep Learning to Develop Next Generation Decision Support Tools to Improve Glycemic Outcomes in Type 1 Diabetes,10231944,F30DK128914,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Aerobic', 'Aerobic Exercise', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Big Data', 'Blood Glucose', 'Carbohydrates', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'Control Groups', 'Cutaneous', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Eating', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Food', 'Fright', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Glucose', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Hypoglycemia', 'Injections', 'Insulin', 'Insulin Infusion Systems', 'Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Intake', 'Jogging', 'Mathematics', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physical Exercise', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Plant Roots', 'Production', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Resistance', 'Running', 'Safety', 'Structure of beta Cell of islet', 'Support System', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tracer', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Walking', 'base', 'computer framework', 'deep learning', 'design', 'diabetic', 'exercise regimen', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'glucose monitor', 'glucose uptake', 'glycemic control', 'human model', 'human study', 'improved', 'in silico', 'mathematical model', 'model building', 'next generation', 'novel', 'physiologic model', 'predictive modeling', 'primary outcome', 'recruit', 'resistance exercise', 'response', 'secondary outcome', 'simulation', 'smartphone Application', 'strength training', 'support tools', 'tool', 'usability']",NIDDK,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,F30,2021,51036
"Personalized Management of Intracranial Aneurysms Using Computer-aided Analytics Abstract The primary objective is to develop an artificial intelligence-centric, quantitative and noninvasive software platform that can be integrated into 3D angiographic scanners (DSA, CTA or MRA) to provide guidance regarding the diagnosis and management of intracranial aneurysms (IA). Hemorrhagic stroke secondary to ruptured IAs leads to significant morbidity and mortality and affects over 35,000 patients on a yearly basis in the United States. The diagnosis of asymptomatic IAs is on the rise with the increasing use of cerebral imaging. However, guidance regarding which aneurysms should be treated has not advanced. Leveraging recent advances in computational science and technology, particularly artificial intelligence, the proposed software platform built on two enabling technologies can (1) propel automated “patient-specific” hemodynamic evaluations into the clinical workflow and (2) conduct “data-driven” risk assessments of IA rupture on an individual basis. Specific research aims are to (1) develop a clinically-oriented CFD platform that enables automated “patient-specific” hemodynamic evaluations of IAs, (2) investigate data-driven analytics toward prediction of rupture risk for IAs and (3) evaluate the data-driven analytics in a blind study. Once validated, a follow-up R01 project is planned to examine the clinical utility of the proposed software platform in a prospective clinical study as a single gateway for computer-aided evaluation of cerebral aneurysms. Public Health Relevance/Narrative This R01 proposal is to investigate the feasibility of developing an innovative, non-invasive and artificial intelligence-centric tool that can be used as a software add-on to clinical angiographic (e.g. DSA) scanners. The software can automatically select high-risk aneurysms for immediate treatments from a pool of patients with unruptured intracranial aneurysms, impacting the clinical management of intracranial aneurysms.",Personalized Management of Intracranial Aneurysms Using Computer-aided Analytics,10121043,R01EB029570,"['3-Dimensional', 'Affect', 'Aneurysm', 'Angiography', 'Architecture', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Benign', 'Biomedical Computing', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Brain hemorrhage', 'Cerebral Aneurysm', 'Cerebrum', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computational Geometry', 'Computational Science', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Genetic', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intracranial Aneurysm', 'Knowledge', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphology', 'Natural History', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Physics', 'Play', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Role', 'Rupture', 'Ruptured Aneurysm', 'Secondary to', 'Smoker', 'Technology', 'TensorFlow', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Wisconsin', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'blind', 'computer grid', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'flexibility', 'follow-up', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'image guided', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'mortality', 'neurosurgery', 'open source', 'personalized management', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'shear stress', 'success', 'tool']",NIBIB,MICHIGAN TECHNOLOGICAL UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,346966
"A Handheld Microchip for GC analysis of breath to screen for COVID-19 Project Summary  The COVID-19 pandemic has caused unprecedented societal suffering and economic disruption. In the United States, more than six million people have contracted COVID-19 and more than one hundred ninety thousand patients have died of this disease to date. Although current COVID-19 diagnostic testing technologies are critical for slowing the spread of the virus and preventing future outbreaks, they are not practical for field use. Current diagnostic tests are cumbersome to perform because they use aqueous solutions, require multiple steps, and hours-to-days to obtain results. Since the US began to reopen the economy in May, there has been a significant increase in the number of COVID-19 cases. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop a diagnostic approach that is non-invasive, portable, and can rapidly provide test results.  The overall goal of the project is to develop a mobile breath analysis technology for rapid screening for COVID-19 using a handheld breath collection tool and a portable GC with a photoionization detector (PID). The handheld tool will be a closed system for trapping select volatile organic compounds (VOCs) on a microfabricated chip. The captured VOCs will be eluted with ethanol and then analyzed using a commercially available, portable GC-PID instrument. Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning algorithms will be applied to recognize the VOC pattern that correlates with COVID-19 infection. The central innovation is the microfabricated chip that captures carbonyl compounds in exhaled breath and thus serves as a preconcentrator, which enables analysis of carbonyl VOCs by the portable GC-PID. The hypothesis is that the carbonyl metabolome in exhaled breath is directly related to the body’s reaction to the novel coronavirus infection, and changes in the carbonyl VOC composition in exhaled breath relative to healthy controls can be used to detect both symptomatic and asymptomatic COVID-19 patients.  Three specific aims are proposed to fulfill the overall goal. Aim 1 is to build a disposable handheld breath analyzer tool for concentrating carbonyl VOCs. Aim 2 is to identify VOC patterns in the breath of COVID-19 patients by machine learning algorithms. Aim 3 is to integrate portable GC technology with the breath sampling tool for COVID-19 screening guided by an AI system. The University of Louisville is uniquely suited to rapidly transition the microchip technology to field use because of the PI and Co-PI’s experience in breath analysis and translational research, and the project team’s experience in virology, infectious diseases, biostatistics, and artificial intelligence as well as the state-of-the-art facilities that include a MicroNano Technology Center, Biosafety Level 3 Regional Biocontainment Lab, and an NIH-funded REACH program. 8. Project Narrative  This project will develop a mobile breath analysis technology for rapid screening for COVID-19 using a handheld breath collection tool and a portable GC with a photoionization detector (PID). Artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms will be used to analyze the detected signals of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in exhaled breath by the portable GC for detection of COVID-19 patients. UofL is uniquely suited to develop this approach because of the PI’s expertise in breath analysis for detection of Tuberculosis and lung cancer and the team’s experience in virology, infectious diseases, biostatistics, and artificial intelligence.",A Handheld Microchip for GC analysis of breath to screen for COVID-19,10266377,U18TR003787,"['2019-nCoV', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biochemical Process', 'Biometry', 'Breath Tests', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 detection', 'COVID-19 diagnostic', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'COVID-19 patient', 'COVID-19 screening', 'COVID-19 test', 'Cancer Detection', 'Clinic', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Contracts', 'Coronavirus Infections', 'Detection', 'Device or Instrument Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Economics', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Ethanol', 'Exhalation', 'Expert Systems', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Influenza', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Mass Fragmentography', 'Medical Device', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Nasal Epithelium', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Process', 'Production', 'Protocols documentation', 'Rapid screening', 'Reaction', 'Reagent', 'Research Project Grants', 'Role', 'SARS-CoV-2 infection', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Signal Transduction', 'Silicon', 'Sterilization', 'System', 'Technology', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Tuberculosis', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Vial device', 'Viral', 'Viral Respiratory Tract Infection', 'Virulent', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'adduct', 'aqueous', 'asymptomatic COVID-19', 'biosafety level 3 facility', 'bronchial epithelium', 'carbonyl compound', 'detection sensitivity', 'detector', 'experience', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'machine learning algorithm', 'metabolome', 'microchip', 'mobile computing', 'novel coronavirus', 'photoionization', 'point of care', 'portability', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prototype', 'reagent testing', 'tool', 'virology', 'volatile organic compound']",NCATS,UNIVERSITY OF LOUISVILLE,U18,2021,1026672
"Deep learning based antibody design using high-throughput affinity testing of synthetic sequences Project Summary We will develop and apply a new high-throughput methodology for rapidly designing and testing antibodies for a myriad of purposes, including cancer and infectious disease immunotherapeutics. We will improve upon current approaches for antibody design by providing time, cost, and humane benefits over immunized animal methods and greatly improving the power of present synthetic methods that use randomized designs. To accomplish this, we will display millions of computationally designed antibody sequences using recently available technology, test the displayed antibodies in a high-throughput format at low cost, and use the resulting test data to train molecular dynamics and machine learning methods to generate new sequences for testing. Based on our test data our computational method will identify sequences that have ideal properties for target binding and therapeutic efficacy. We will accomplish these goals with three specific aims. We will develop a new approach to integrated molecular dynamics and machine learning using control targets and known receptor sequences to refine our methods for receptor generalization and model updating from observed data (Aim 1). We will design an iterative framework intended to enable identification of highly effective antibodies within a minimal number of experiments, in which our methods automatically propose promising antibody sequences to profile in subsequent assays (Aim 2). We will employ rounds of automated synthetic design, affinity test, and model improvement to produce highly target-specific antibodies. (Aim 3). ! Project Narrative We will develop new computational methods that learn from millions of examples to design antibodies that can be used to help cure a wide variety of human diseases such as cancer and viral infection.

"Intelligent treatment planning for cancer radiotherapy PROJECT SUMMARY About 2/3 of cancer patients in US receive radiation therapy either alone or in conjunction with surgery, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, etc. Treatment planning, where an optimal treatment strategy is designed for each individual patient and executed for the whole treatment course, is analogous to the design of a blueprint for building construction. If a treatment plan is poorly designed, the desired treatment outcome cannot be achieved, no matter how well other components of radiation therapy are performed. In the current clinical workflow, a treatment planner works towards a good quality plan in a trial-and-error fashion. Many rounds of consultation between the planner and physician are needed to reach a plan of physician's satisfaction, because physician's preference for a particular patient can hardly be quantified and precisely conveyed to the planner. Consequently, planning time can be up to a week for complex cases and plan quality may be poor and can vary significantly due to varying levels of physician and planner's skills and physician-planner cooperation, etc., which substantially deteriorates treatment outcomes. For example, head and neck (H&N) cancer patients treated with suboptimal plans present 20% lower 2-year overall survival and 24% higher 2-year local-regional failure. Prolonged overall treatment process due to treatment planning reduces local-regional control rate by 12–14% per week. Furthermore, as patient's anatomy can rapidly change within the planning time, the optimally designed plan becomes inappropriate for the changed anatomy. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) has made colossal advancements. We believe that AI technologies have a great potential to revolutionize treatment planning. Treatment planning consists of two major aspects: commonality and individuality. By exploiting the commonality through deep supervised learning, we can develop a treatment plan as good as those for previously treated similar patients. The individuality can be actualized by learning physician's special considerations for a particular patient using deep reinforcement learning. Our preliminary studies have demonstrated feasibility of these ideas. We hypothesize that an AI-based intelligent treatment planning system can consistently produce high-quality treatment plans with extremely high efficiency. This hypothesis will be tested using H&N cancer patients as a test bed via two aims. Aim 1, System development. Develop two deep-learning models to realize the proposed treatment planning workflow and incorporate them into a clinical environment. Aim 2, System validation. Acquire and analyze planning data before and after system implementation. The innovation of this project is the use and customization of the state-of-the-art AI techniques to solve a clinically important problem. These technologies would revolutionize treatment planning process, leading to the efficient generation of consistently high quality plans, irrespective of human skills, experiences, and communications, etc. Besides the significance demonstrated for the H&N cancer patients, the system can be easily extended to other tumor sites, yielding more substantial impacts. NARRATIVE Treatment planning for radiation therapy, where an optimal treatment strategy is designed for each individual patient and executed for the whole treatment course, plays a central role for the success of radiation therapy treatment. The current treatment planning workflow is inefficient and produces plans with sub-optimal and varying quality, substantially deteriorating treatment outcomes.

"Evaluation of artificial intelligence-controlled CPR to improve vital organ perfusion and survival during prolonged resuscitation Project Summary / Abstract  Almost 400,000 cases of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) occur each year in the United States. In patients requiring cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) for prolonged periods, current CPR methods are unable to maintain adequate blood flow and oxygen delivery to the vital organs. Survival is <10% in patients with shockable rhythms and ~0% in those with non-shockable rhythms. Current American Heart Association (AHA) recommendations for CPR follow a “one-size-fits-all” paradigm. Our goal is to improve vital organ perfusion during prolonged CPR by “personalizing” compression/decompression therapy with a dynamic CPR method that changes compression characteristics over the course of CPR after taking into account the temporal changes of chest wall compliance and hemodynamics in order to increase the rate of neurologically intact survival after OHCA.  In this grant proposal, we are investigating the deployment of machine learning algorithms incorporated into a mechanical CPR device to predict and optimize hemodynamics during CPR. We will use state-of-the-art dynamical modeling in conjunction with closed-loop control algorithms to individualize CPR characteristics and optimize temporal blood flow. Our preliminary results suggest that deployment of machine learning prediction algorithms paired with control algorithms in a preclinical Ventricular Fibrillation model can adapt compression and decompression depth in real time, resulting in increased vital organ blood flow as compared to standard CPR techniques Based on these results, we hypothesize that optimization of compression depth, decompression depth, duty cycle, and compression rate of CPR will lead to better outcomes. Our proposed research will: 1) identify the most promising algorithm for the prediction of CPR hemodynamics 2) identify the best control algorithm to pair with this prediction algorithm in terms of optimizing CPR hemodynamics and return of spontaneous circulation 3) use the prediction and control pairing to improve 48h neurologically intact survival in a porcine model of ventricular fibrillation, as compared to standard CPR techniques. Throughout this process, we will identify non-invasive alternative measurements to provide to the algorithms with the ultimate goal of proceeding with device development and human trials. Project Narrative In light of a growing body of evidence which suggests that prolonged duration CPR is a dynamic process, without universally optimal “one-size-fits-all” parameters, advanced methods of CPR individualization may be applied to optimize cardiac and cerebral perfusion for these patients. We propose to study the effects of machine learning and optimal control techniques within the context of CPR, thus creating a closed-loop CPR system that has been trained by pre-clinical data to modify CPR characteristics and optimize blood flow. Our preliminary studies suggest that machine learning and control algorithms can be successfully deployed in a preclinical model to adapt compression and decompression depth, increasing vital organ blood flow as compared to standard CPR techniques. If our hypotheses are verified, a gateway for the first human trials is open.",Evaluation of artificial intelligence-controlled CPR to improve vital organ perfusion and survival during prolonged resuscitation,10186125,R01HL157625,"['Acute', 'Algorithms', 'American Heart Association', 'Animal Experiments', 'Applications Grants', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Basic Science', 'Biofeedback', 'Blood Circulation', 'Blood flow', 'Carbon Dioxide', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation', 'Cerebrum', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chest wall structure', 'Choices and Control', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Device or Instrument Development', 'Devices', 'E-learning', 'Early Mobilizations', 'Evaluation', 'Family suidae', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Gaussian model', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Linear Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Near-Infrared Spectroscopy', 'Neurologic', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Oxygen', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Phase I Clinical Trials', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Resuscitation', 'Shock', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Ventricular Fibrillation', 'Ventricular Tachycardia', 'algorithm training', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'coronary perfusion', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'neural network', 'out-of-hospital cardiac arrest', 'pre-clinical', 'prediction algorithm', 'pressure', 'prospective', 'time interval']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2021,547699
"Prevalence effects in visual research: Theoretical and practical implications Low prevalence searches form an important and problematic class of visual search tasks. These are tasks where the search target is rare. Many socially important tasks like airport security or cancer screening are low prevalence tasks. Previous work, much of it from our lab, has shown that low prevalence can have undesirable effects. Most notably, miss (false negative) errors are markedly elevated at low prevalence. This is a clear problem if the purpose of the search is to detect something rare but important like cancer or a terrorist threat. Our previous work has documented this pattern of increased miss errors in a number of expert domains including cytology (cervical cancer screening), airport baggage screening, and breast cancer screening. False alarm (false positive) error rates typically decline at low prevalence, moving in the opposite direction from miss errors. This indicates a shift in the observer’s decision criterion. At low prevalence, observers become more reluctant to call something a target. Several studies – ours and others - have shown that this “conservative” criterion shift is not adequate to explain the entire prevalence effect. Wolfe and VanWert (2010) developed a “Dual- Threshold” model that better captures the important aspects of the prevalence effect data by proposing two effects of low prevalence: (1) the conservative shift in the criterion for deciding if an attended item is a target, and (2) a lowering of the “quitting threshold.” The quitting threshold determines when observers end a search. Quitting too soon also increases the chance that the observer will miss a target. Prevalence effects have been studied in experimental isolation from other aspects of search. However, in tasks like breast cancer screening, other factors interact with prevalence. The four projects in the present proposal each investigate one of these interactions. Project 1 examines the relationship of prevalence to the “vigilance decrements” that are seen as time elapses in a task. In search, observers must maintain an internal, mental representation of the search target (or targets). Project 2 is concerned with the impact of prevalence on these “target templates”. Advances in artificial intelligence (notably deep learning) are producing tools to assist expert searchers. However, once deployed, these AI tools have been less effective than theory predicts. Project 3 tests the hypothesis that part of the problem is another side-effect of low prevalence and the project tests a potential intervention. Finally, clinicians, searching for one type of target (e.g. pneumonia) are supposed to report signs of other possible problems (e.g. lung cancer). Project 4 probes the role of prevalence in the failure to report such “incidental findings”. Again, we test several interventions. This is “use-inspired, basic research” whose results will provide guidance for experts performing socially important low prevalence tasks. Important tasks like breast cancer screening involve visual search for rare (“low prevalence”)  targets but, unfortunately, low prevalence is known to increase the percentage of targets that are  missed even by well-trained experts. In a task like breast cancer screening, prevalence interacts  with other factors like observer vigilance or the effectiveness of an artificial intelligence tool.  This proposal studies four of these interactions with the goal of counteracting the malign effects  of prevalence; thus making it possible for experts to perform their critical search tasks more  effectively.",Prevalence effects in visual research: Theoretical and practical implications,10111519,R01EY017001,"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Basic Science', 'Breast Cancer Detection', 'Cervical Cancer Screening', 'Collaborations', 'Cytology', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Effectiveness', 'Failure', 'Flecks', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Incidental Findings', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Low Prevalence', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Paper', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pneumonia', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevalence', 'Prevalence Study', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Screening for cancer', 'Security', 'Talents', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trust', 'Visual', 'Work', 'analog', 'base', 'clinically significant', 'deep learning', 'design', 'improved', 'mental representation', 'programs', 'side effect', 'social', 'theories', 'tool', 'vigilance', 'visual search']",NEI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2021,441020
"Personalizing AAV Management by Leveraging Big Data: Targeting Complication Clusters PROJECT SUMMARY ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV) is a small vessel vasculitis associated with disease- and treatment-related complications that contribute to reduced quality of life and excess mortality compared to the general population. In the context of improving rates of flare and mortality with contemporary treatments, increasing attention is shifting to complications (e.g., renal failure, infection, cardiovascular disease) as clinically-relevant and patient-oriented outcomes. However, our understanding of how best to address and prevent complications is limited because they are typically studied in isolation from a “single disease framework.” We do not understand how complications tend to co-occur in individuals in complication clusters. Moreover, with several available treatment options for AAV, comparative effectiveness studies using real-world experience data and relevant outcomes like complication clusters are needed to guide treatment decisions in a manner that personalizes care, improves quality of life, and reduces mortality. However, we do not have the methods to accurately and efficiently assemble an AAV cohort using state-of-the-art algorithms that leverage heterogeneous claims and electronic health record (EHR) data. The aims of this proposal are to (1) apply advanced clinical informatics methods (i.e., machine learning and natural language processing) to identify AAV cases in big data to assemble a large cohort and (2) determine complication clusters in an AAV cohort by applying latent transition analysis. To achieve these aims, we will leverage methodologic expertise developed through collaborations established during the PI’s K23 and use a novel data source that includes EHR data linked to Medicare and Medicaid claims. The PI’s team has previously demonstrated that unstructured (i.e., free-text) EHR data can be used to study topics mentioned in clinical notes of AAV patients and that keywords in these notes can help identify AAV patients but neither machine learning nor sophisticated natural language processing have been previously used to identify AAV cases. In addition, our prior work has examined AAV complications in isolation (e.g., renal disease, cardiovascular disease) but here we seek to identify phenotypes of complications (complication clusters) that tend to co-occur in patients, how patients transition between clusters over time, and what factors predict a person’s membership in a complication cluster. The major goal of this proposal is to build further preliminary data in preparation for an R01 application over the next 24 months. The planned R01 will focus on comparative effectiveness studies in AAV using cohorts assembled in big data and clinically-relevant, patient-oriented outcomes, like complication clusters. The results of these studies can then be used as inputs in simulation models built during my K23 to guide optimal patient-oriented treatment decisions. Ultimately, the goal of this research program is to improve quality of life and reduce complications and mortality by using data to inform personalized approaches to AAV treatment. PROJECT NARRATIVE Despite treatment advances, ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV) remains associated with disease- and treatment-related complications that contribute to a reduced quality of life and an increased risk of death compared to the general population. To further improve these outcomes, we need to understand which medications work best to treat AAV and this requires a large group of patients to study and a better understanding of complications in AAV. This R03 proposal focuses on applying advanced clinical informatics to assemble a large AAV cohort and characterizing how complications co-occur (i.e., complication clusters) in AAV.",Personalizing AAV Management by Leveraging Big Data: Targeting Complication Clusters,10198103,R03AR078938,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Antineutrophil Cytoplasmic Antibodies', 'Attention', 'Big Data', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Complication', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Clusterings', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiology', 'Excess Mortality', 'Flare', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hypertension', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Inflammation', 'Informatics', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Kidney Failure', 'Knowledge', 'Left', 'Link', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicaid', 'Medicare', 'Medicare claim', 'Medicare/Medicaid', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Obesity', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predictive Factor', 'Preparation', 'Provider', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Remission Induction', 'Research', 'Respiratory Tract Infections', 'Rheumatism', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Structure', 'Test Result', 'Text', 'Time', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Treatment-related toxicity', 'Vasculitis', 'Work', 'base', 'case finding', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'comparative effectiveness study', 'comparative efficacy', 'data resource', 'experience', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'models and simulation', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'patient population', 'person centered', 'personalized approach', 'personalized care', 'personalized medicine', 'prevent', 'programs', 'respiratory', 'structured data', 'treatment comparison', 'treatment strategy', 'unstructured data']",NIAMS,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R03,2021,105843
"Differential artery-vein analysis in OCT angiography for objective classification of diabetic retinopathy Abstract: This project aims to establish differential artery-vein analysis in optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA), and to validate comprehensive OCTA features for automated classification of diabetic retinopathy (DR). Early detection, prompt intervention, and reliable assessment of treatment outcomes are essential to prevent irreversible visual loss from DR. It is known that DR can target arteries and veins differently. Therefore, differential artery-vein analysis can provide better performance of DR detection and classification. However, clinical OCTA instruments lack the capability of artery-vein differentiation. During this project, we propose to use quantitative feature analysis of OCT, which is concurrently captured with OCTA, to guide artery- vein differentiation in OCTA. The first aim is to establish automated artery-vein differentiation in OCTA. In coordination with our recently demonstrated blood vessel tracking technique, OCT intensity/geometry features will be used to guide artery-vein differentiation in OCTA automatically. Differential artery-vein analysis of blood vessel tortuosity (BVT), blood vessel caliber (BVC), blood vessel density (BVD), vessel perimeter index (VPI), vessel branching coefficient (VBC), vessel branching angle (VBA), branching width ratio (BWR), fovea avascular zone area (FAZ-A) and FAZ contour irregularity (FAZ-CI) will be implemented. Key success criterion of the aim 1 study is to demonstrate robust artery-vein differentiation in OCTA, and to establish OCTA features for objective detection and classification of DR. The second aim is to validate automated OCTA classification of DR. We propose to employ ensemble machine learning to integrate multiple classifiers to achieve robust OCTA classification of DR. Key success criterion of the aim 2 study is to identify OCTA features and optimal-feature- combination to detect early DR, and to establish the correlations between the OCTA features and clinical biomarkers. The third aim is to verify OCTA prediction and evaluation of DR treatment. Our preliminary OCTA study of diabetic macular edema (DME) with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) treatment has shown that BVD can serve as a biomarker predictive of visual improvement. During this project, we plan to test differential artery-vein analysis for DME treatment evaluation. Key success criterion of the aim 3 study is to identify artery-vein features to provide robust prediction and evaluation of DME treatment outcomes. As an alternative approach, we propose a fully convolutional neural network (FCNN) for deep machine leaning based artery-vein and DR classification. Early layers in the FCNN will produce simple features, which will be convolved and filtered into deeper layers to produce complex features for artery-vein and DR classification. Further investigation of the relationship between the new features learned through the machine learning process and clinical biomarkers will allow us to optimize the design for better DR classification. Success of this project will pave the way towards using quantitative OCTA features for early DR detection, objective prediction and assessment of treatment outcomes. Project Narrative This project is to establish quantitative optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) analysis for objective classification of diabetic retinopathy (DR). By translating subjective findings into objective assessments, this study will standardize clinical OCTA for eye disease detection and treatment assessment. In addition, objective OCTA analysis based automated DR classification can foster telemedicine in rural and underserved areas where the access to experienced ophthalmologists is limited.",Differential artery-vein analysis in OCT angiography for objective classification of diabetic retinopathy,10080731,R01EY030842,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Angiography', 'Area', 'Arteries', 'Biological Markers', 'Blindness', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood capillaries', 'Caliber', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Color', 'Complex', 'Derivation procedure', 'Detection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Evaluation', 'Exudate', 'Eye diseases', 'Fostering', 'Fundus photography', 'Geometry', 'Health Expenditures', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Microaneurysm', 'Modernization', 'Ophthalmologist', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Optics', 'Performance', 'Process', 'Reflex action', 'Retina', 'Retinal Edemas', 'Retinal Hemorrhage', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Standardization', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Telemedicine', 'Testing', 'Thinness', 'Translating', 'Treatment outcome', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors', 'Veins', 'Venous', 'Visual', 'Width', 'base', 'bevacizumab', 'clinical biomarkers', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep neural network', 'density', 'design', 'diabetic', 'diabetic patient', 'experience', 'fovea centralis', 'fundus imaging', 'global health', 'image registration', 'imaging capabilities', 'improved', 'indexing', 'instrument', 'macular edema', 'predictive marker', 'prevent', 'rural area', 'success', 'support vector machine', 'underserved area', 'vascular abnormality']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,R01,2021,351666
"Machine Learning in Atrial Fibrillation Project Summary  Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common heart rhythm disorder, affecting 2 million Americans in whom it may cause skipped heart beats, dizziness or stroke. Unfortunately, therapy for AF has limited success, likely because AF represents heterogenous and poorly characterized disease entities between individuals. A central challenge is that it is not clear why a specific therapy works in a given AF patient. This uncertainty makes it challenging to develop a patient-specific approach to tailor therapy for personalized medicine.  The premise of this project is that mechanistic data is increasingly available in AF patients at scales spanning tissue, whole heart and patient levels, yet rarely integrated. We set out to use machine learning (ML), a powerful approach proven to classify complex datasets, to integrate data to address 3 clinical unmet needs. First, electrograms are rarely used to guide therapy in AF, unlike organized rhythms, because they are difficult to interpret. Second, it is difficult to understand how arrhythmia is affected by any specific ablation strategy in AF, unlike organized rhythms. This makes it difficult to improve therapy. Third, it is difficult to identify whether an individual patient will or will not have success from AF ablation. We applied machine learning and novel objective analyses to these questions to develop strategies for personalized AF therapy.  We have 3 specific aims: (1) To identify components of AF electrograms using ML trained to monophasic action potentials (MAP); (2) To identify electrical and structural features of the acute response of AF to ablation near and remote from PVs; (3) To identify patients in whom ablation is unsuccessful or successful long-term, who are poorly separated at present. Each Aim will compare ML to traditional biostatistics, and use objective explainability analysis of ML to provide mechanistic insights.  This study has potential to deliver immediate clinical and translational impact. We will apply specific ML approaches, biostatistics, and computer modeling to our rich multiscale registry. We will develop practical and shareable tools, which we will prospectively test clinically, to deliver meaningful outcomes at tissue, whole heart and patient scales. Our team is experienced in electrophysiology, computer science, signal processing and biological physics. This project is likely to reveal novel multiscale AF phenotypes to enable personalized therapy. Machine Learning in Atrial Fibrillation Narrative Atrial fibrillation (AF) is an enormous public health problem that affects 2-5 million Americans, causing stroke, rapid heart beats, heart failure and even death. In this project, the applicant will apply numerical analysis and machine learning to detailed data acquired from patients undergoing therapy, to better define individual biological types of AF, which may provide a foundation for personalized patient-tailored diagnosis and therapy.",Machine Learning in Atrial Fibrillation,10130617,R01HL149134,"['Ablation', 'Action Potentials', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Arrhythmia', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Biological', 'Biometry', 'Biostatistical Methods', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dizziness', 'Drug Controls', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Genetic', 'Heart', 'Heart Atrium', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Label', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physics', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Registries', 'Science', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'base', 'computer science', 'convolutional neural network', 'demographics', 'digital', 'experience', 'heart rhythm', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'insight', 'learning classifier', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'personalized strategies', 'prospective', 'prospective test', 'response', 'signal processing', 'success', 'tool', 'translational impact', 'voice recognition', 'voltage']",NHLBI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,771584
"SCH: Personalized Depression Treatment Support by Mobile Sensor Analytics  The current best practice guidelines for treating depression call for close monitoring of patients, and periodically adjusting treatment as needed. This project will advance personalized depression treatment by developing an innovative system, DepWatch, that leverages mobile health technologies and machine learning tools to provide clinicians objective, accurate, and timely assessment of depression symptoms to assist with their clinical decision making process. Specifically, DepWatch collects sensory data passively from smartphones and wristbands, without any user interaction, and uses simple user-friendly interfaces to collect ecological momentary assessments (EMA), medication adherence and safety related data from patients. The collected data will be fed to machine learning models to be developed in the project to provide weekly assessment of patient symptom levels and predict the trajectory of treatment response over time. The assessment and prediction results are then presented using a graphic interface to clinicians to help them make critical treatment decisions. Our project comprises two studies. Phase I collects sensory data and other data (e.g., clinical data, EMA, tolerability and safety data) from 250 adult participants with unstable depression symptomatology. The data thus collected will be used to develop and validate assessment and prediction models, which will be incorporated into DepWatch system. In Phase II, three clinicians will use DepWatch to support their clinical decision making process; a total of 50 participants under treatment by the three participating clinicians will be recruited for the study. A number of innovative machine learning techniques will be developed. These include a set of new learning formulations to construct matrix-based longitudinal predictive models, and determine the temporal contingency and the most influential features, and deep learning based data imputation methods that can handle both problems of sporadic missing data as well as missing data in an entire view. In addition, multi-task feature learning models and feature selection techniques will be expanded and refined for this challenging setting of large-scale heterogeneous data. The project is highly relevant to public and global health because it will provide a significant step forward in providing effective and patient-centric care in treating depression. It will help personalize depression treatment by identifying patients who are failing treatments early and will assist providers to take necessary actions before patients drop out of treatment.",SCH: Personalized Depression Treatment Support by Mobile Sensor Analytics ,10196980,R01MH119678,"['Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Drops', 'Early treatment', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Family', 'Formulation', 'Health Technology', 'Influentials', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Noise', 'Participant', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Practice Guidelines', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Research', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Self Administration', 'Sensory', 'Sleep', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Treatment outcome', 'autoencoder', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'data de-identification', 'deep learning', 'denoising', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'feature selection', 'global health', 'heterogenous data', 'innovation', 'mHealth', 'medication compliance', 'medication safety', 'multimodality', 'multitask', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'recruit', 'response', 'sensor', 'symptomatology', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'user-friendly']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT STORRS,R01,2021,245551
"Quantification of Liver Fibrosis with MRI and Deep Learning Project Summary/Abstract  Chronic liver disease (CLD) is a common cause of morbidity and mortality in the U.S. and throughout the world. In 2017, CLD had an age-adjusted death rate of 10.9/100,000 total population and an estimated lifetime cost of fatty liver disease alone in the U.S. of ~$222 billion. Liver fibrosis (LF) is the most important and only histologic feature known to predict outcomes from CLD. The current standard for assessing LF is biopsy, which is costly, prone to sampling error, and invasive with poor patient acceptance. Thus, there is an urgent unmet need for noninvasive, highly accurate and precise diagnostic technologies for detection and quantification of LF. Our overarching objective is to apply Deep Learning (DL) methods using conventional non-elastographic magnetic resonance (MR) images, MR elastography (MRE), and clinical data to accurately detect and measure LF in children and adults with CLD, using biopsy-derived histologic data as the reference standard. In this project, we will dedicate our efforts to accomplishing the following specific aims. In Aim 1, we will develop and validate a DL framework to accurately segment liver and spleen in order to extract radiomic (gray-scale signal intensity distribution, shape and morphology, volumetry, and inter-voxel signal intensity pattern and texture) and deep features (complex abstractions of patterns non-linearly constructed throughout the transformation estimated by data-driven DL training procedures) from conventional multiparametric MRI. These features allow detection of liver and spleen structural abnormalities/tissue aberrations. In Aim 2, we will develop and validate an “ensemble” DL model (LFNet) to predict biopsy-derived LF stage and LF percentage using the integration of conventional multimodal MRI radiomic and deep features, MRE data, as well as clinical data. In Aim 3, we will develop and validate a DL model (LSNet) to quantify MRE-derived liver stiffness (LS) using conventional multiparametric MRI radiomic and deep features as well as clinical data. The proposed models will help physicians to more accurately detect and follow CLD by 1) quantifying LS from conventional MR imaging without the need for MRE; and, more importantly, 2) predicting histologic LF stage and LF percentage without the need for biopsy, while avoiding inter- radiologist variability, reducing radiologist workload, and ultimately reducing healthcare costs. We will validate the models using both internal and independent external data from various scanners and sites. The techniques we develop are expected to improve medical diagnosis and prognostication in the same way as DL has revolutionized other fields. This study will significantly impact public health because it will allow physicians and researchers to more accurately diagnose and quantify CLD and LF as well as permit more frequent assessments in a noninvasive, patient-centric manner, thus potentially improving patient outcomes while lowering healthcare costs. The techniques we develop also can be readily extended for the prediction of other important liver-related clinical outcomes, including impending complications such as portal hypertension, time to liver transplant/transplant listing, and mortality risk, among others. Project Narrative  Chronic liver disease (CLD) is a common cause of illness and death worldwide, and it is a significant healthcare and financial burden. Liver fibrosis (LF) is a measurable feature of CLD that is important to assess the severity of disease, evaluate for progression and therapy response, and predict outcomes. We propose to apply artificial intelligence methods to noninvasive conventional magnetic resonance images and readily- available clinical data for accurate detection and quantification of LF, thus significantly impacting public health by facilitating personalized therapies without the need for liver biopsy, improved outcomes, and lower healthcare costs.",Quantification of Liver Fibrosis with MRI and Deep Learning,10096229,R01EB030582,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'American', 'Appearance', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Bilirubin', 'Biopsy', 'Body mass index', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Computer-Assisted Diagnosis', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Death Rate', 'Decision Making', 'Descriptor', 'Detection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Fatty Liver', 'Financial Hardship', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Expenditures', 'Healthcare', 'Histologic', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Laboratories', 'Length of Stay', 'Liver', 'Liver Fibrosis', 'Liver diseases', 'Magnetic Resonance Elastography', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Mathematics', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphology', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Portal Hypertension', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Reference Standards', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Residual state', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Running', 'Sampling Errors', 'Series', 'Severity of illness', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Spleen', 'Staging', 'Structural defect', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transplantation', 'Vendor', 'Viral hepatitis', 'Visual', 'Workload', 'accurate diagnosis', 'accurate diagnostics', 'chronic liver disease', 'classification algorithm', 'clinical risk', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'diagnostic technologies', 'elastography', 'hospital readmission', 'hospitalization rates', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'learning strategy', 'life time cost', 'liver biopsy', 'liver transplantation', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'multimodality', 'multitask', 'non-linear transformation', 'outcome prediction', 'personalized diagnostics', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'radiologist', 'radiomics', 'response', 'sex']",NIBIB,CINCINNATI CHILDRENS HOSP MED CTR,R01,2021,628266
"A Comprehensive Strategy to Detect Glaucoma Worsening Earlier and With Fewer Tests ABSTRACT  This is an application for a K23 Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award.

To facilitate this long-term goal, in the current proposal, the candidate’s main research goal is to reduce the time and number of tests necessary to detect glaucoma worsening by (1) correcting for errors in previously obtained visual field (VF) and peripapillary optical coherence tomography (OCT) tests by using multilevel models with Bayesian analysis (MLB) and generative adversarial networks (GAN) (2) stratifying eyes at high and low risk for rapid glaucoma worsening at the baseline clinical visit using deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN). These aims are based on high quality preliminary data which show that: (1) the effect of VF reliability metrics and OCT signal strength on test error can be quantified and thus corrected for and (2) machine learning methods can predict risk of future VF progression with fair accuracy with baseline visit VF data alone and therefore adding structural (OCT) and clinical information from the baseline visit is likely to improve model accuracy. The main hypotheses of the proposed research aims are (1) correcting for test errors with MLB and GAN will reduce the time needed to detect worsening by 10 and 20% respectively (2) combining baseline visit structural (OCT), functional (VF) and clinical data as inputs into DCNNs will allow us to achieve an area under the receiver operating curve of at least 0.8 at predicting the risk of future rapid glaucoma worsening. The candidate proposes a comprehensive training plan, combining formal coursework, meetings, seminars and workshops overseen by his diverse group of mentors. Specific training goals include: (1) Receiving training in multi-level regression modeling and Bayesian analysis techniques. (2) Becoming adept at data science with a special emphasis on learning Python for data extraction, manipulation and analysis. (3) Furthering knowledge of machine learning techniques with a specific emphasis on deep learning including DCNNs and GANs. (4) Continuing training in the ethical and responsible conduct of research. The training plan will be executed in coordination with the set of research activities mentioned above. Results from this research proposal will be used to develop a subsequent R01 research proposal that will facilitate the candidate’s transition to an independent researcher. PROJECT NARRATIVE The main aim of this study is to reduce the time and number of tests needed to accurately detect worsening of glaucoma by 1) correcting visual field and optical coherence tomography tests for errors and 2) accurately predicting future disease worsening based on baseline visit clinical, functional and structural data. This research will impact public health by identifying high risk patients earlier so that they can be appropriately managed to prevent vision loss and also by reducing unnecessary testing which places a significant burden on the healthcare system and patients.",A Comprehensive Strategy to Detect Glaucoma Worsening Earlier and With Fewer Tests,10105960,K23EY032204,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Blindness', 'Calendar', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Educational workshop', 'Effectiveness', 'Ethics', 'Eye', 'Future', 'Glaucoma', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Image', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physiologic Intraocular Pressure', 'Population', 'Public Health', 'Pythons', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Training', 'Visit', 'Visual Acuity', 'Visual Fields', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'compare effectiveness', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'demographics', 'field study', 'high risk', 'improved', 'longitudinal database', 'machine learning method', 'meetings', 'model design', 'multilevel analysis', 'neural network architecture', 'predictive modeling', 'preservation', 'prevent', 'programs', 'responsible research conduct', 'retinal nerve fiber layer', 'skills', 'tool', 'wasting']",NEI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,K23,2021,191187
"Optical design and the development of high accuracy automated tick classification using computer vision Abstract. The incidence of US tick-borne diseases has more than doubled in the last two decades. Due to lack of effective vaccines for tick-borne diseases, prevention of tick bites remains the primary focus of disease mitigation. Tick vector surveillance—monitoring an area to understand tick species composition, abundance, and spatial distribution—is key to providing the public with accurate and up-to-date information when they are in areas of high risk, and enabling precision vector control when necessary. Despite the importance of vector surveillance, current practices are highly resource intensive and require significant labor and time to collect and identify vector specimens. Acarologist or field taxonomist expertise is a limited resource required for tick identification, creating a significant capability barrier for national tick surveillance practice. While mobile applications to facilitate passive surveillance and reporting of human-tick encounters have grown in popularity, variable image quality, limited engagement, and scientist misidentification of rare, invasive, or morphologically similar tick species hinder the scalability of this approach. No automated solutions exist to build tick identification capacity. We seek to develop the first imaging and automated identification system capable of instantaneously and accurately identifying the top nine tick vectors in the US. This proposal will first characterize the optical requirements necessary to image diagnostic morphological features associated with adult ticks and develop a standardized imaging platform for tick identification. This will enable the development of a high-quality tick image dataset in partnership with the Walter Reed Biosystems Unit (WRBU) which will be used to train high-accuracy computer vision models for tick species and sex identification. Ultimately the approaches developed here will enable new tick identification tools for both the lab and citizen scientists; allowing vector surveillance managers to leverage image recognition in a practical system that will increase capacity and capability for biosurveillance, and equipping citizen scientists with improved tools to identify tick species during a human-tick encounter. Project Narrative. Despite the importance of tick vector surveillance for disease prevention, current practices to collect and identify specimens are resource intensive, limiting the quality and quantity of the data informing control efforts. Here we propose the determination of optical requirements for visualization of diagnostic features of the top nine US tick vectors, and the development of high-accuracy computer vision algorithms for the identification of tick species and sex for use in a standardized optical configuration. The high-accuracy tick classification system developed through this proposal promises to expand capacity and capability for tick vector surveillance.",Optical design and the development of high accuracy automated tick classification using computer vision,10325667,R43AI162425,"['Adult', 'Agreement', 'Algorithm Design', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Car Phone', 'Cellular Phone', 'Classification', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Culicidae', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Disease', 'Disease Surveillance', 'Disease Vectors', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Human', 'Image', 'Incidence', 'Insecta', 'Larva', 'Learning', 'Leg', 'Life', 'Lighting', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Nymph', 'Optics', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Scientist', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Specimen', 'Standardization', 'Surveillance Methods', 'System', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Tick-Borne Diseases', 'Ticks', 'Time', 'Training', 'Vaccines', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'base', 'citizen science', 'convolutional neural network', 'design', 'detection method', 'disorder prevention', 'field study', 'flexibility', 'high resolution imaging', 'high risk', 'human disease', 'imaging platform', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'insight', 'intelligent algorithm', 'interest', 'mobile application', 'novel', 'sample collection', 'sex', 'tick bite', 'tool', 'validation studies', 'vector', 'vector control', 'vector tick']",NIAID,"VECTECH, LLC",R43,2021,295705
"Computational Methods for the Study of American Sign Language Nonmanuals Using Very Large Databases ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): American Sign Language (ASL) grammar is specified by the manual sign (the hands) and by the nonmanual components, which include the face. Our general hypothesis is that nonmanual facial articulations perform significant semantic and syntactic functions by means of a more extensive set of facial expressions than that seen in other communicative systems (e.g., speech and emotion). This proposal will systematically study this hypothesis. Specifically, we will study the following three hypotheses needed to properly answer the general hypothesis stated above: First, we hypothesize (H1) that the facial muscles involved in the production of clause-level grammatical facial expressions in ASL and/or their intensity of activation are more extensive than those seen in speech and emotion. Second, we hypothesize (H2) that the temporal structure of these facial configurations are more extensive than those seen in speech and emotion. Finally, we hypothesize (H3) that eliminating these ASL nonmanual makers from the original videos, drastically reduces the chances of correctly identifying the clause type of the signed sentence. To test these three hypotheses, we define a highly innovative approach based on the design of computational tools for the analysis of nonmanuals in signing. In particular, we will examine the following three specific aims. In Aim 1, we will build a series of computer algorithms that allow us to automatically (i.e., without the need of any human intervention) detect the face, its facial features as well as the automatic detection of the movements of the facial muscles and their intensity of activation. These tools will be integrated into ELAN, a standard software used for linguistic analysis. These tools will then be used to test six specific hypotheses to successfully study H1. In Aim 2, we define computer vision and machine learning algorithms to identify the temporal structure of ASL facial configurations and examine how these compare to those seen in speech and emotion. We will study six specific hypotheses to successfully address H2. Alternative hypotheses are defined in both aims. Finally, in Aim 3 we define algorithms to automatically modify the original videos of facial expression in ASL to eliminate the identified nonmanual markers. Native users of ASL will complete behavioral experiments to examine H3 and test potential alternative hypotheses. Comparative analysis with non-signer controls will also be completed. These studies will thus further validate H1 and H2. We provide evidence of our ability to successfully complete the tasks in each of these aims. These aims address a critical need; at present, the study of nonmanuals must be carried out by hand. To be able to draw conclusive results, it is necessary to study thousands of videos. The proposed computational approach supposes at least a 50-fold reduction in time compared to methods done by hand. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Deafness limits access to information, with consequent effects on academic achievement, personal integration, and life-long financial situation, and also inhibits valuable contributions by Deaf people to the hearing world. The public benefit of our research includes: (1) the goal of a practical and useful device to enhance communication between Deaf and hearing people in a variety of settings; and (2) the removal of a barrier that prevents Deaf individuals from achieving their full potential. An understanding of the nonmanuals will also change how ASL is taught, leading to an improvement in the training of teachers of the Deaf, sign language interpreters and instructors, and crucially parents of deaf children.",Computational Methods for the Study of American Sign Language Nonmanuals Using Very Large Databases,9841303,R01DC014498,"['3-Dimensional', 'Academic achievement', 'Access to Information', 'Address', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'American Sign Language', 'Articulation', 'Behavioral', 'Child', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Emotions', 'Excision', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Facial Muscles', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Head', 'Hearing', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Linguistics', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Movement', 'Parents', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Production', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Science', 'Semantics', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Sign Language', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Speech', 'Structure', 'System', 'Teacher Professional Development', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Visual', 'Visual system structure', 'base', 'body position', 'comparative', 'computerized tools', 'deaf', 'deafness', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'face perception', 'innovation', 'instructor', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'reconstruction', 'showing emotion', 'syntax', 'tool']",NIDCD,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,317844
"Validating of Machine Learning-Based EEG Treatment Biomarkers in Depression SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The overarching aim of Alto Neuroscience is to advance brain-based biomarkers for psychiatric disorders in order to both optimize treatment pathways and drive the development of novel pharmacological and non- pharmacological interventions. Alto does this by developing and applying sophisticated machine learning computational models to electroencephalography (EEG) data collected at scale in real-world clinical treatment contexts. Specifically, in this direct-to-phase II SBIR proposal we will refine, and then independently validate, two EEG-based candidate biomarkers we have identified for stratifying patients with depression in a manner that both factors biological heterogeneity and informs treatment response. One of our biomarkers was derived in a “top-down” (i.e. supervised) manner by trying to directly predict treatment outcome, while the other biomarker presents a complimentary “bottom-up” (i.e. unsupervised) approach that begins by first identifying the most biologically homogeneous subset of patients and then testing the treatment relevance of the subtyping. Together, these findings represent very robust individual patient-level treatment-relevant EEG biomarkers, and in both cases, help define a critically-important objective approach to prospectively identifying and treating treatment- resistant depressed patients. A successful outcome of the proposed work would yield the first FDA-cleared biomarkers for stratifying psychiatric conditions. It would also provide a basis for targeted development of pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions based on the EEG biomarkers. Both outcomes hold substantial commercial value and exciting potential for transforming psychiatry.

"An artificial intelligence-driven distributed stereotactic radiosurgery strategy for multiple brain metastases management PROJECT SUMMARY Brain metastases (BMs) are a life-threatening neurological disease, but current treatment regimens cannot manage multiple (>4) BMs (mBMs) without causing strong adverse effects. Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), utilizing potent dose to irradiate BMs and quick dose falloff to spare nearby tissues, has proven to be an effective treatment regimen for limited-number and small-size BMs. However, SRS could not avoid high toxic dose when BMs are multiple, clustered, or adjacent to critical organs. To safe and effectively treat mBMs with SRS requires addressing these urgent needs: 1) to identify the maximum tolerable SRS dose; 2) to study neurocognitive decline and design strategies to preserve patients’ post-treatment quality of life; and 3) to develop and implement high-quality streamlined mBMs SRS treatment and follow-up care. To address mBMs SRS management needs, we aim to develop and implement an artificial intelligence (AI)- driven treatment planning system (TPS) and conduct a therapeutic intervention clinical trial, both dedicated to improve mBMs SRS treatment quality and efficiency. The AI-driven TPS, namely AimBMs, will have three AI- based computational modules, including AI-Segtor for automatic segmentation, AI-Predictor for treatment outcome prediction and AI-Planner for spatiotemporal distributed SRS plan optimization. AimBMs is initially developed based on retrospective data and facilitate the mBMs distributed SRS prospective phase I/II clinical trials, while the clinical trial will provide critical clinical knowledge and evidence as feedback to improve AimBMs performance. The ultimate goal of the project is to translate the AimBMs to routine clinical practice to improve mBMs SRS treatment quality, patients’ post-treatment QoL, and clinical facility workflow. In response to PAR-18-560, we have formed a multidisciplinary collaboration between radiation oncologists and medical physicists to develop a novel AI-driven distributed SRS technology and conduct a cancer-targeted therapeutic intervention for managing mBMs. The project’s innovations include: 1) novel SRS treatment planning technological capability enabled by AI-based auto-segmentation, treatment outcome prediction, and spatiotemporal plan optimization; 2) novel AI learning capability to improve developed AI tools’ performance through the coherent clinical trial. The technology development will support the therapeutic intervention clinical trial, while the clinical trial is designated to improve the developed system performance. This seamlessly integrated development mode ensures the developed system is clinically practical. Upon completion, our newly developed AimBMs will lay a solid foundation for mBMs SRS management and benefit a wide population of patients with BMs. Moreover, the AI-based treatment planning and treatment delivery infrastructure built for mBMs SRS can be transferred to other tumor sites to generate an even broader clinical impact. PROJECT NARRATIVE Patients with multiple brain metastases, a cancer which has spread to multiple places in the brain, have poor survival or quality of life after single fraction stereotactic radiosurgery or whole brain radiotherapy. We will develop and study a new treatment strategy for multiple brain metastases using spatial and temporal fractionated stereotactic radiosurgery by frameless GammaKnife.

"iGLAMOUR Study:  Innovations in Glaucoma Adherence and monitoring Of Under-Represented minorities PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Glaucoma affects more than 70 million people worldwide and is the world's leading cause of irreversible blindness. The only current method to delay its development and progression is by lowering intraocular pressure (IOP), achieved with topical administration of eyedrops. Adherence rates for glaucoma eyedrop administration are poor, in many cases below 50%, resulting in disease progression, eventual blindness, and a more than 2-fold increase in healthcare costs. African Americans and Latinos carry a significantly higher glaucoma burden compared with Caucasians. Minorities have additionally been found to have disproportionately lower rates of medication adherence. Previously studied interventions aimed at improving glaucoma adherence had key limitations that particularly affect minorities, including unreliable self-reported measures of adherence, lack of consideration of individual circumstances influencing glaucoma medication management, and developing/testing interventions in predominantly Caucasian populations. Health information technology has experienced rapid advancement in the last decade with the electronic health record (EHR), the proliferation of accessory mobile health technologies, and the advancement of artificial intelligence. Although their integration holds great promise to enable screening tools for diagnosis and risk prediction, successful integration to aid minority populations in real-world settings depends on: understanding how the collected information relates to the patient's other (e.g. clinical) data and the patient's socio-cultural context; seamless information exchange and interoperability with the EHR, the central portal of healthcare delivery; and integration of algorithmic findings into workflows involving both providers and patients to deliver information and/or recommendations in a simple, actionable manner. Glaucoma is a complex chronic disease, spanning decades of patients' lives and requiring ongoing monitoring and evaluation, thus making it an ideal application for the use of health IT to reduce racial disparities. In this proposal, we aim to accomplish this by: demonstrating the effectiveness of a flexible electronic eyedrop sensor to generate granular digital signatures of an individual's adherence and contextualizing this data in a socio- cultural context with patient interviews (Aim 1), combining adherence data with EHR variables to construct machine learning models to predict IOP control and enhance clinical risk stratification (Aim 2), and prototyping a dynamic dashboard for intervention coordination (Aim 3). Altogether, success of this innovative, comprehensive, culturally-tailored, and scalable health IT framework will improve medication adherence and slow disease progression among minorities, therefore narrowing this important racial health disparity. PROJECT NARRATIVE African Americans and Latinos carry a disproportionate burden of glaucoma, a blinding eye disease that can lead to severely decreased quality of life. Promoting adherence with topical medications that lower intraocular pressure, the primary therapeutic target for reducing the risk of glaucoma progression, represents a critical opportunity for technology-driven interventions. The iGLAMOUR (innovations in GLaucoma Adherence and Monitoring Of Under-Represented minorities) Study aims to develop and evaluate a health information technology framework incorporating flexible sensor electronics, machine learning-based predictive models, a patient- facing mobile interface, and a clinician-facing clinical dashboard to facilitate early identification and intervention for high-risk patients in order to narrow these racial disparities and improve vision outcomes in these minority populations.",iGLAMOUR Study:  Innovations in Glaucoma Adherence and monitoring Of Under-Represented minorities,10120501,R01MD014850,"['Adherence', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Blindness', 'Bluetooth', 'Caucasians', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronics', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Eye diseases', 'Eyedrops', 'Glaucoma', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Technology', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Latino', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medication Management', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Minority Groups', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Physiologic Intraocular Pressure', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Qualitative Evaluations', 'Quality of life', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Screening procedure', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Topical application', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'Visual Fields', 'Wireless Technology', 'adherence rate', 'base', 'blind', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical risk', 'dashboard', 'data visualization', 'design', 'digital', 'dosage', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'field study', 'flexibility', 'glaucoma test', 'health care delivery', 'health information technology', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'interoperability', 'mHealth', 'medication compliance', 'medication nonadherence', 'mobile application', 'mobile computing', 'patient engagement', 'personalized care', 'predictive modeling', 'primary outcome', 'prototype', 'racial disparity', 'racial health disparity', 'retinal nerve fiber layer', 'risk prediction', 'risk stratification', 'secondary outcome', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'social culture', 'social health determinants', 'success', 'support tools', 'therapeutic target']",NIMHD,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2021,225000
"Patient specific 3D printed tissue engineered vascular graft for aortic reconstruction designed by artificial intelligence algorithm. 1 The goal of this study is to create patient-specific, hemodynamically optimized, tissue engineered  2 vascular grafts (TEVG) for use in aortic arch repair surgery. These TEVGs are optimized for high pressure  3 circulation using 3D printing technology and artificial intelligence, and will grow with the patient, in hopes of  4 obviating need for future surgeries to replace grafts, which can occur with contemporary arch reconstruction  5 materials. Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the leading cause of death due to congenital anomalies. Despite  6 significant advances in surgical management for CHD, one significant source of morbidity and mortality arises  7 from the complexity of surgery for diverse anatomies in the aortic arch. Previous studies have demonstrated  8 that the resultant arch geometry after surgical reconstruction of stenotic or hypoplastic aortas is important to  9 minimize reduce energy loss and undesirable flow inside the arch, which can lead to hypertension, abnormal 10 vascular response and ventricular dysfunction. Ensuring a patient-specific graft design for ideal reconstructed 11 route before surgery with minimum energy loss and wall shear stress may yield long-term benefits for patient 12 health and quality of life. 13 We have demonstrated native vessel like neotissue formation of TEVG in small and large animal 14 studies. Based on these experiences, we have developed a novel 3D printing technology combining 3D printed 15 metal mandrels with nanofiber electro-spun technology. With this 3D printing technology, we showed that 16 TEVG developed native like neovessel formation in venous circulation in a sheep model. For this next step, we 17 aim to develop grafts in arterial circulation that can be applied to aortic reconstruction. We will also develop 18 automatic design algorithms to design optimal graft shape in order to reduce time and cost of patient specific 19 design. We hypothesize that patient-specific TEVG using our 3D printing technology can be designed, 20 aided by pre-operative imaging and flow data, computer assisted design (CAD), automatic design 21 algorithms based on computation fluid dynamics (CFD) results, and will demonstrate proper neotissue 22 formation and growth while maintaining optimally designed hemodynamics. 23 This project will be an important step towards clinical application of patient-specific vascular grafts that 24 recapitulate the native anatomy and mechanical properties. The results of this work will have a broader impact 25 on the design and fabrication of other more complex cardiovascular structures for implantation. This paradigm 26 shift in vascular graft technology will improve the quality and safety of pediatric patient care. The goal of this study is to create patient-specific, hemodynamically optimized, tissue engineered vascular grafts using 3D printing technology and artificial intelligence for use in aortic arch repair surgery which demands a structured surgical approach in order to optimize hemodynamics postoperatively. We will optimize the design of an aortic graft automatically using computational flow dynamics, refine 3D printing manufacturing, evaluate grafts with in-vitro testing, and finally will test the performance of the grafts in vivo over time.

"DEVELOPMENT OF BASELINE GENE EXPRESSION-BASED RESPONSE PREDICTOR FOR ANTI-TNFA THERAPY IN PATIENTS WITH INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASES ABSTRACT Anti-TNF therapies are widely used to treat autoimmune diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), a chronic inflammation of the digestive system which presents both an economic burden as well as prominent disability and morbidity. These therapies, however, are largely ineffective in IBD patients, with primary non- response rates varying from 10-30%, and with 23-46% of patients losing response over time. They also lead to adverse health outcomes including increased risk of infections (most notably reactivation of tuberculosis), liver problems, arthritis, and lymphoma. Due to biologic switching where multiple drugs are tried in sequence until an effect is observed, they often lead to overall increased healthcare costs. There is no clear predictive factor of response or loss of response to anti-TNF therapies, with current research focusing on efficacious dosage and inhibitor selection. While numerous predictors of response have been identified in studies, none are robust enough to impact clinical practice. Overcoming this gap in the administration of anti-TNF therapies will be an important next step in improving their utility and reducing overall healthcare costs, morbidity, and mortality. This project proposes a multicohort meta-analysis and machine learning approach to discover and validate a prognostic gene signature that can differentiate anti-TNF responders from non-responders in IBD patients, allowing for improved decision-making and positive health outcomes. Despite the broad biological, clinical, and technical heterogeneity inherent in such a task, the Inflammatix analytical framework was able to identify significant differentially expressed genes that discriminate anti-TNF responders from non-responders (mean discovery AUC of ~0.83 and mean validation AUC of ~0.81). Supported by these preliminary results, this project will (1) discover a robust, clinically translatable multi-gene prognostic signature using publicly available datasets, (2) generate independent gene expression data from retrospective cohorts of mucosal biopsy samples (n=150) to validate the signature (target AUC > ~0.8), and (3) use our proprietary Inflammatix machine learning (IML) platform to train and validate a plethora of machine learning algorithms to develop a robust, generalizable classifier (target AUC ~ 0.8 - 0.9) that is ready for clinical validation via prospective studies. Our novel prognostic signature will transform the clinical paradigm in the use and administration of anti-TNF therapies, maximizing treatment benefit while minimizing patient exposure to potentially harmful side effects and adverse health outcomes, consequently reducing financial burden for the healthcare system and patient. NARRATIVE Anti-TNF therapies are widely used to treat autoimmune diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), however, they are ineffective in greater than half of patients, and carry significant risks with associated healthcare costs. This project will discover and validate a prognostic, generalizable mRNA signature that can identify IBD patients who are likely to respond to anti-TNF treatment, transforming how physicians use and administer these expensive and oftentimes risk-laden therapies to maximize patient benefit and minimize adverse health outcomes. Improved treatment decision-making will undoubtedly help address ever-increasing cases of IBD in the US and globally while reducing overall healthcare costs, morbidity, and mortality.",DEVELOPMENT OF BASELINE GENE EXPRESSION-BASED RESPONSE PREDICTOR FOR ANTI-TNFA THERAPY IN PATIENTS WITH INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASES,10138841,R43DK127578,"['Address', 'Age', 'Anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor Therapy', 'Arthritis', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biopsy', 'Biopsy Specimen', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Colonoscopy', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Economic Burden', 'Exposure to', 'Financial Hardship', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heterogeneity', 'Immunomodulators', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Liver', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Lymphoma', 'Machine Learning', 'Messenger RNA', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mucous Membrane', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Predictive Factor', 'Prevalence', 'Privatization', 'Prospective Studies', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Retrospective cohort', 'Risk', 'Robin bird', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Standardization', 'TNF gene', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Tuberculosis', 'Validation', 'acute infection', 'adjudicate', 'adjudication', 'base', 'bioinformatics pipeline', 'clinical development', 'clinical practice', 'clinically actionable', 'clinically translatable', 'cost', 'cytokine', 'differential expression', 'disability', 'dosage', 'gastrointestinal system', 'genetic signature', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'infection risk', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'instrument', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality', 'multilayer perceptron', 'novel', 'predicting response', 'predictive marker', 'predictive signature', 'prognostic', 'prognostic signature', 'responders and non-responders', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'service providers', 'side effect', 'support vector machine', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment response']",NIDDK,"INFLAMMATIX, INC.",R43,2021,251371
"Rapid platelet dysfunction detection in whole blood samples using machine learning powered micro-clot imaging. Abstract This project will optimize a point-of-care (POC) platelet force monitoring technology for clinical application in trauma care. The leading causes of death and disability after trauma are related to hemorrhage and traumatic brain injury with intracranial hemorrhage (ICH). Platelets are critical to hemostasis by inducing clot formation via adhesion, aggregation, and contraction at wounds. Platelets often become dysfunctional after trauma which worsens internal bleeding and ICH progression and increasing morbidity. POC platelet assays have not been incorporated in practice due to:1) lack of large cohort ED patient testing; 2) poor accuracy in transfusion prediction and 3) extended processing times. We have made an innovative POC technology to test platelet function by directly measuring platelet contractile forces on microfluidic force sensors. Advantages of our POC test vs. existing assays: 1) rapid, direct activation and measures of platelet functions and 2) innovative machine vision with deep potential for machine learning insight. However, this technology needs optimization and validation in a large major ED trauma cohort and remains untested after ICH. Our pilot data suggests platelet contractile forces are sensitive to a range of relevant activation pathways and mechanisms and force is significantly decreased in trauma patients requiring blood transfusion. Further, in prior clinical trials, platelet transfusion has been found to be harmful when used indiscriminately. Building on this unmet scientific need, we will determine if our POC technology is predictive of hemorrhagic complications in trauma patients, informing a personalized transfusion strategy. Our overarching hypothesis is our POC platelet force monitor technology is an efficient indicator of bleeding complications after trauma and ICH. Aim 1: Optimize the platelet force monitor optics to improve platelet force sensor performance. We hypothesize the addition of a second fluorescent imaging channel can improve our current platelet force sensor performance. Aim 2: Use machine learning (ML) image analysis to improve detection of platelet dysfunction and prediction of trauma outcomes. We hypothesize image-based ML models can improve test performance. We will compare the accuracy of direct platelet force measurements (Aim 1) vs. ML-enhancement measurements for detecting platelet dysfunction and predicting outcomes. Aim 3: Validate our platelet function algorithm for predicting blood transfusion needs, mortality, and the progression of traumatic ICH in a prospective cohort of severely-injured ED trauma patients. We hypothesize platelet force will be a powerful predictor of blood transfusion needs, mortality, and progression of ICH. In the ED we will apply our algorithm (both the original and optimized algorithm from Aim 1) to blood from trauma patients and compare the predicted transfusion requirements against actual transfusion (Aim-3a) and measure the association between measured platelet force and ICH progression (Aim-3b). Project Narrative Rapidly identifying patients who are at risk for traumatic internal and intracranial bleeding would improve care by enabling personalized transfusion strategies. The current clinical approach causes undue morbidity and mortality because of late identification of those in need of a transfusion, resulting in delayed blood transfusion in those patients who would benefit, and unnecessary transfusions in those who would not. The proposed project improves and validates an innovative blood testing technology which has shown the potential to make rapid bleeding assessment of every patient both easy and accurate.",Rapid platelet dysfunction detection in whole blood samples using machine learning powered micro-clot imaging.,10146213,R61HL156508,"['ADP Receptors', 'Address', 'Adhesions', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Arachidonic Acids', 'Bedside Testings', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood', 'Blood Cells', 'Blood Platelets', 'Blood Tests', 'Blood Transfusion', 'Blood coagulation', 'Blood specimen', 'Care Technology Points', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Coagulation Process', 'Color', 'Complex', 'Contracts', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Electrons', 'Emergency Department patient', 'Engineering', 'Enrollment', 'Freezing', 'Functional disorder', 'Gold', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hemostatic function', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Intracranial Hemorrhages', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medicine', 'Microfluidics', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Platelet Function Tests', 'Platelet Transfusion', 'Platelet aggregation', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Preparation', 'Prospective cohort', 'Receptor Inhibition', 'Reporting', 'Research Design', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transfusion', 'Trauma', 'Trauma patient', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Traumatic injury', 'Traumatic intracranial hemorrhage', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Whole Blood', 'Work', 'base', 'blood product', 'clinical application', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'design', 'diagnostic assay', 'diagnostic technologies', 'disability', 'flexibility', 'fluorescence imaging', 'force sensor', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine vision', 'microsensor', 'mortality', 'nanonewton', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'performance tests', 'platelet function', 'point of care', 'prediction algorithm', 'prospective', 'seal', 'sensor', 'severe injury', 'shear stress', 'trauma care', 'wound']",NHLBI,STASYS MEDICAL CORPORATION,R61,2021,294185
"A Machine Learning-Based Clinical Decision Support Tool to Predict Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Prognosis Using Existing Longitudinal Data SUMMARY: A Machine Learning-Based Clinical Decision Support Tool to Predict AAA Prognosis  Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a localized dilatation of the aorta. If left untreated AAA may go on to rupture, an occurrence which has a 90% mortality rate and is the 13th leading cause of death in the United States, with more than 15,000 annual deaths reported annually. After AAA is diagnosed, a clinician must determine its severity; i.e., the relative risk of rupture compared to the risk of intervention. Current clinical guidelines for this determination is based on the one-size-fits-all “maximum diameter criterion”, which states that when a AAA reaches 5.5 cm in diameter, the risk of rupture necessitates repair of the aneurysm. However, smaller sized AAAs (< 5.5 cm) have been seen to rupture at rates of up to 23.4%, demonstrating that this diameter-based criterion is unsuitable for AAA management. A recently completed NIH-funded clinical trial, 1U01-AG037120: “Non-Invasive Treatment of AAA Clinical Trial” (N-TA3CT) was designed to demonstrate the efficacy of pharmacologic treatment of small AAA. During this trial, a highly unique and valuable dataset was collected longitudinally every 6 months for a 3-year period for patients presenting with small AAA.  This proposal is designed to test the hypothesis that, at the time of discovery of small AAA, clinical prognosis – i.e., predicting if and when clinical intervention will be required based on rupture risk metrics – can be facilitated using machine learning-based algorithms using real-time biomechanical, morphological, and clinical data. To address this hypothesis, we will pursue two specific aims.  Aim 1 will be to quantify the “evolution” of individual small AAA from the N-TA3CT trial. The biomechanical and morphological status of all patient AAAs at each timepoint will be determined from data collected during the trial using finite element analysis and morphometric analysis, respectively, and these will be tabulated along with clinical indices for each AAA at each timepoint.  Aim 2 will be to develop and validate machine learning and regression techniques to forecast the clinical prognosis of small AAA. The data from Aim 1 as well as follow-up reporting data from the N- TA3CT trial will be used to train machine learning classification models to determine whether aneurysm prognosis can be accurately predicted. Validation will be performed on a subset of data to assess the accuracy, sensitivity, precision and specificity of the proposed prediction model.  The unique dataset from the N-TA3CT trial, paired with the extensive experience of and methods developed by our lab, will allow us, for the first time, to carefully examine and quantify the natural evolution of small AAA and to subsequently develop a predictive model to improve patient prognosis. PROJECT NARRATIVE Currently, when clinicians must decide if or when to fix an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA; characterized by the ballooning of a thin and weakened wall), they base their decision solely on the AAA diameter. However, a quarter of AAA below the accepted cutoff diameter still rupture, often leading to death. In this project, we will use a unique database collected during a clinical trial of small AAA, computer models, and machine learning to create a new decision method that will better serve patients with this disease.",A Machine Learning-Based Clinical Decision Support Tool to Predict Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Prognosis Using Existing Longitudinal Data,10115365,R21HL156246,"['Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Aneurysm', 'Annual Reports', 'Aorta', 'Biomechanics', 'Caliber', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computer Models', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Dilatation - action', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Failure', 'Finite Element Analysis', 'Funding', 'Geometry', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Left', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Relative Risks', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Rupture', 'Ruptured Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm', 'Severities', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Methods', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'cohort', 'design', 'experience', 'feature selection', 'follow-up', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'predictive modeling', 'rate of change', 'repaired', 'screening', 'serial imaging', 'support tools', 'theories', 'tool']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R21,2021,117375
"Machine learning-based development of serologic test for acute Lyme disease diagnosis Project Summary/Abstract Lyme Disease is a tickborne illness with markedly increasing prevalence in the United States and an urgent need for improved diagnostics in its early stages, when treatment is most efficient. While classic clinical presentation of the early illness is the presence of erythema migrans (EM), or “bullseye rash”, surrounding the tick bite site, 20-30% of patients do not present with EM. Further complicating diagnosis is a proportion of patients who present with EM, but are seronegative on the current standard two-tiered test algorithm (STTTA). The proposed research addresses the need for improved serological tests to diagnose early Lyme Disease in these patients, while the disease is the most responsive to treatment. A proof-of-concept antigen panel capable of distinguishing STTTA-positive acute Lyme samples from endemic controls was identified using a novel antigen discovery approach. This approach relies on representing an entire binding space of a donor’s circulating antibody repertoire using machine learning models based on the antibody binding profile to a diverse, random library of 126,050 peptides with an average length of 9 amino acids, which is a sparse representation of all possible amino acid combinations. Resulting models are then used to identify pathogen epitopes with high predictive power that are combined into a panel with diagnostic efficacy. Here, the unmet need of diagnosing early Lyme disease in STTTA-seronegative patients is addressed by the addition of antigens predicted as specific to this patient population. Diagnostic efficacy of the supplemented proof-of- concept antigen panel, that was identified in a previous proof-of-principle study, will be tested using an expanded cohort of STTTA seronegative donors and endemic controls. Specificity of the panel for Lyme disease will be confirmed using a panel of look-a-like illnesses including autoimmune diseases and tickborne diseases. This work is expected to yield data demonstrating the feasibility of a novel immunoassay for the diagnosis of early stage Lyme Disease patients currently missed by present tests. Additionally, it will serve as a demonstration of the antigen discovery approach as a means to identify diagnostic antigens for difficult pathogens. Project Narrative Improved diagnostics for early Lyme Disease, the most treatable stage of the disease, are urgently needed to identify infected patients, including those not presenting with the classic bullseye rash or who are seronegative on the standard two-tiered test algorithm. Here, we apply a novel antigen discovery approach that allows us to computationally model patients’ serum antibody binding profiles and predict diagnostic antigens for patients with early Lyme Disease. By developing a diagnostic assay which includes antigens specific for patients missed by current diagnostics, patient outcomes can be improved through enabling early intervention with effective treatments.",Machine learning-based development of serologic test for acute Lyme disease diagnosis,10259497,R43AI162473,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Amino Acids', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Repertoire', 'Antigens', 'Area', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmune Process', 'Binding', 'Borrelia burgdorferi', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Computer Models', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Ensure', 'Epitopes', 'Evaluation', 'Exanthema', 'Health', 'Human', 'Immunoassay', 'Immunology', 'Incidence', 'Laboratories', 'Length', 'Libraries', 'Lyme Disease', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Peptides', 'Performance', 'Pilot Projects', 'Prevalence', 'Protein Engineering', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Serology', 'Serology test', 'Serum', 'Services', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Surface Antigens', 'Symptoms', 'Synthetic Antigens', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tick-Borne Diseases', 'United States', 'Work', 'antigen diagnostic', 'base', 'biomarker panel', 'classification algorithm', 'clinical diagnostics', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'cross reactivity', 'density', 'design', 'diagnosis standard', 'diagnostic assay', 'disease diagnosis', 'effective therapy', 'erythema migrans', 'falls', 'improved', 'in silico', 'machine learning method', 'member', 'molecular diagnostics', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'pathogen', 'patient population', 'response', 'seasonal influenza', 'synthetic peptide', 'technological innovation', 'tick bite', 'tick-borne']",NIAID,BIOMORPH TECHNOLOGIES LLC,R43,2021,300000
"Deep Learning Image Analysis Algorithms to Improve Oral Cancer Risk Assessment for Oral Potentially Malignant Disorders Abstract Oral potentially malignant disorders (OPMD) are a group of mucosal diseases in the oral cavity with a risk of progressing to oral squamous cell carcinoma. Risk assessment is traditionally done through a combination of clinical and histologic evaluation. Leukoplakia is a common type of OPMD that is given a histologic grading score that is supposed to be related to its risk of progression. However, there is tremendous intra- and inter- observer heterogeneity in dysplasia grading, leading to variability and uncertainty in risk assessment and treatment planning. This also hinders the ability to study the biology of these lesions. We propose to use whole slide imaging on routine hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained sections in combination with deep learning methods to build a consistent risk scoring system for OPMD. Our methods will identify cell, nucleus, and tissue architectural features relevant to risk of progression in OPMD. These features will be tested in a large retrospective case-control study and then validated prospectively. We will also explore combining them with genomic and immune biomarkers in order to improve the prognostic power and explore the biolo gy of progression in OPMD. We hope that these efforts will improve and standardize risk assessment for OPMD. This could lead to improved treatment and prevention options by enabling risk stratification and allowing future clinical trials be conducted in a more uniform patient cohort. Similarly, it could improve our understanding for the biology of OPMD and the process of progression to cancer. Project Narrative Oral potentially malignant disorders (OPMD) are a common and heterogeneous group of mucosal lesions in the oral cavity without robust and consistent biomarkers for their risk of progression to can cer. Here we propose to use whole slide imaging analysis of routine clinical samples to develop a more robust risk assessment process.

"Wearable Multi-modality Cuffless Blood Pressure Monitoring Abstract Continuous blood pressure (BP) is one of the most critical monitoring parameters during anesthesia, surgery and in intensive care units (ICU). Both hypotension and hypertension can impair the function of vital organs (e.g. brain, heart and kidneys), and intraoperative hypotension is associated with postoperative mortality, which makes it important to detect BP changes as quickly as possible to prompt timely intervention or therapy. However, the current gold standard technology for BP monitoring, an invasive arterial line (a-line), causes patient suffering (physical pain) and increases the risk of infection. In the United States, about 80,000 blood stream infections caused by an arterial catheter are reported annually. Due to the inherent risks associated with a-line, it is used only for clinically indicated high risk surgeries or ICU patients. As a result of the a-line risks and discomforts, even though more than 300 million surgeries are performed worldwide each year, only a small portion receive continuous BP monitoring. In addition, although vital sign (ECG, pulse oximetry, BP etc) monitoring is routine in surgical rooms and ICUs, currently most monitoring devices are fixed in individual rooms, which result in gaps in patient monitoring, accidents during patient transport process, and extra work to disconnect and reconnect sensors when leaving and entering a new facility. Seamless “continuum of care” monitoring—for instance from surgical room to ICUs, including transport in between and without reconnecting sensors—is on top of the wish list by clinician. In recent years, efforts have been made to develop portable ECG monitors and “mobile ICUs”; however so far, no continuous and seamless BP monitoring has been achieved. This proposal fully leverages the outcomes from the related R21 (EB022271) project. We will develop novel machine learning and deep learning based data fusion algorithms to use existing vital signs for continuous BP monitoring, then integrate them with our unique wearable patient monitoring system to form a novel perioperative patient monitoring system. We will test the system’s performance against gold standard a- line and Finapres BP technologies. to develop a fully functional technology for noninvasive, continuous, and seamless BP monitoring. We will also develop a public database for future BP technology development. The proposed multimodality algorithms, seamless BP monitoring system and PhysioNet database will provide major steps forward to meet the clinical need for noninvasive continuous BP monitoring. Project Narrative Continuous blood pressure (BP) is one of the most critical monitoring parameters during anesthesia, surgery and in intensive care units (ICU). However, the current gold standard technology for BP monitoring, the invasive arterial line (a-line), causes patient suffering (physical pain) and increases the risk of infection, and current noninvasive BP technologies have poor stability.

"Therapeutic potential of vagal neurostimulation to reduce food intake Obesity affects almost 40% percent of US adults and is associated with high levels of comorbidities, including cancer, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Although effective treatments with minimal side effects are lacking, vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) can reduce body weight and suppress feeding behavior. There is little insight, however, into its mechanism and it is unclear whether VNS effects on feeding and body weight result from non-specific side effects, such as nausea. The current application directly addresses these issues by assessing gastrointestinal (GI) myoelectric changes as a potential mechanism for effects of VNS on feeding behavior, while comparing these responses to emetic activation. We plan to accomplish this by using a ferret model, which is a gold-standard for studying emesis, vagus nerve, and GI physiology. We will test the hypothesis that electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve can reduce food intake without triggering indicators of nausea, such as disrupted GI myoelectric responses, retching, and vomiting. We will complete three Aims. Aim 1: Define the individualized GI myoelectric patterns during feeding behavior using machine learning classification. Animals will be implanted with planar electrodes attached to the GI serosal surface from proximal gastric fundus to distal duodenum. We will use machine learning to classify GI myoelectric patterns of meal consumption compared to emetic-related states, including those elicited by intragastric emetine and high amplitude and frequency VNS known to trigger emesis. Aim 2: Test the efficacy of abdominal VNS on reducing meal size without triggering disruptions of GI myoelectric responses, retching, and emesis. Animals will be assessed for effects of abdominal VNS using a variety of stimulus parameters on feeding behavior and multi-site GI myoelectric recordings. Aim 3: Determine the efficacy of cervical VNS in controlling meal size without producing off-target effects (disruptions of GI myoelectric responses, retching, emesis, changes in heart rate, or blood pressure). We will test the impact of cervical VNS parameters on feeding behavior, GI myoelectric responses, retching, emesis, hear rate variability, and blood pressure. Our approach is innovative because we will use machine learning classification to detect individualized GI myoelectric response patterns in an awake free-moving animal for comparing therapeutic and off-target effects of VNS on feeding, GI activity, emesis, and cardiovascular function. This planned research is significant because VNS therapy can potentially provide a frontline treatment option for patients with high levels of obesity refractory to behavioral or pharmacological therapy, which unlike other surgical interventions for weight loss, such as gastric bypass, is potentially tunable and reversible by changing stimulation parameters, switching the device off, or complete removal. Obesity affects almost 40% percent of US adults, is associated with type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer, and has a health-care cost that could total nearly one trillion US dollars by 2030. The current project is designed to test vagus nerve stimulation to reduce food intake, while limiting adverse effects, such as nausea, vomiting, and disrupted gastrointestinal function. Our proposed research is relevant to the NIH’s plan to support the design and testing of new interventions for achieving and maintaining a healthy weight (Strategic Plan for NIH Obesity Research).",Therapeutic potential of vagal neurostimulation to reduce food intake,10207620,R01DK121703,"['Abdomen', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Behavioral', 'Blood Pressure', 'Body Weight', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular Physiology', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cervical', 'Chemicals', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Distal', 'Duodenum', 'Eating', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electrodes', 'Emetics', 'Emetine', 'Event', 'Excision', 'FDA approved', 'Feeding behaviors', 'Ferrets', 'Fiber', 'Frequencies', 'Gastric Bypass', 'Gastrointestinal Motility', 'Gastrointestinal Physiology', 'Gastrointestinal tract structure', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hearing', 'Heart Rate', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Laboratory Rat', 'Laboratory mice', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Nausea', 'Nausea and Vomiting', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Rattus', 'Refractory', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rodent Model', 'Satiation', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Stimulus', 'Stomach', 'Strategic Planning', 'Surface', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Upper digestive tract structure', 'Vagus nerve structure', 'Vomiting', 'awake', 'behavioral pharmacology', 'comorbidity', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'efficacy testing', 'experimental study', 'feeding', 'gastric fundus', 'gastrointestinal', 'gastrointestinal function', 'healthy weight', 'heart rate variability', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning classifier', 'machine learning algorithm', 'obesity treatment', 'personalized medicine', 'pre-clinical', 'predicting response', 'recruit', 'reduced food intake', 'response', 'side effect', 'support vector machine', 'therapeutic target', 'vagus nerve stimulation', 'weight loss intervention']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2021,482164
"Biomarker Signatures for Delayed Cerebral Ischemia and Outcome Following Subarachnoid Hemorrhage Abstract Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) accounts for 5% of all strokes, has a high mortality and the cost to society is similar to ischemic stroke since subjects are much younger. Though SAH fatality has decreased ~50% in the last 25 years due to immediate repair of aneurysms, improved medical management and nimodipine, nearly 1/3 of SAH patients develop delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) often with cerebral infarction which is associated with poor outcomes. Though this was thought to be due delayed cerebral vasospasm, recent studies have shown that decreasing or preventing vasospasm does not improve outcomes. This has led to alternative hypotheses that combined effects of microvessel thrombosis and vasospasm combined with cortical spreading ischemia and peripheral and central inflammation may cause DCI. Thus, there is a great unmet need to assess potential treatment targets that contribute to DCI following SAH in humans and that could be used to predict DCI to begin early treatment and to predict outcome to better allocate resources. The premise of the proposal is based upon the findings that we have shown that gene expression in blood can predict SAH patients who develop vasospasm. This led us to Hypothesize that clotting and inflammatory molecules in blood interact with the brain microvasculature and other factors to cause Delayed Cerebral Ischemia (DCI) and delayed cerebral infarction following SAH which lead to poor outcomes. We propose that gene profiles in blood will predict DCI and predict outcomes using the modified Rankin Scale (mRS).  R61 Phase. Specific Aim #1a: Perform RNA sequencing (RNAseq) on whole blood of a training cohort of patients 1, 2 and 3 days after a SAH but prior to DCI compared to matched vascular risk factor controls. Specific Aim #1b. Identify the most significantly regulated genes and pathways in blood at 1, 2 or 3d that distinguish SAH patients who develop DCI at 4-14 days from SAH patients who do not develop DCI. Specific Aim #1c: Use WGCNA to identify key hub genes and upstream genes expressed at 1, 2 or 3d after SAH and which are associated with developing DCI at 4-14d and might be causative. Specific Aim #1d. Use Support Vector Machine (SVM) learning to identify the least number of genes at 1, 2 or 3d from Aim #1b that best predict (1) SAH patients who develop DCI at 4-14 days (2) and predict mRS of 0, 1-3, 4-5, and 6 at 3 months. Specific Aim #1e. Confirm RNAseq with qRT-PCR and assess qRT-PCR accuracy and precision. R33 Phase. Specific Aim #2. In a separate validation cohort of SAH patients perform qRT-PCR on their peripheral blood to measure expression of genes derived in Aim #1 to predict using Support Vector Machine (SVM) on day 1, 2 and/or day 3 which patients will develop DCI at 4-14 days and which patients will have mRS=0 (no deficit), 1-2, 3-5 and mRS=6 (dead) at 3 months.  Contexts of Use. The molecules/pathways that predict DCI and mRS could serve as future treatment or prevention targets of DCI. Predicting who will develop DCI would make it possible to treat DCI earlier. In addition, future clinical trials to prevent DCI following SAH would enroll just those patients predicted to develop DCI after SAH. Predicting mRS outcomes could be used to stratify patients in future DCI trials. Narrative  This proposal will perform RNAseq on blood of a derivation cohort of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) patients to determine those genes that best predict Delayed Cerebral Ischemia (DCI) between 4 and 14 days and that predict median Rankin Scores (mRS) outcomes at 90 days using cross-correlation. These genes are then measured in an independent validation cohort of SAH patients to predict who develops DCI by 14d, and to predict their mRS at 90 days after SAH. The studies will direct early treatment for DCI, identify treatment targets for DCI, and help stratify patients for future DCI treatment trials.",Biomarker Signatures for Delayed Cerebral Ischemia and Outcome Following Subarachnoid Hemorrhage,10105072,R61NS119345,"['3-Dimensional', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aneurysm', 'Aneurysmal Subarachnoid Hemorrhages', 'Angiography', 'Arteries', 'Blood', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Catheters', 'Cerebral Infarction', 'Cerebral Ischemia', 'Cerebral hemisphere hemorrhage', 'Cerebrovascular Spasm', 'Cerebrum', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Coagulation Process', 'Cognitive', 'Complication', 'Derivation procedure', 'Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Endothelin Receptor Antagonist', 'Enrollment', 'FDA approved', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Hemorrhage', 'Human', 'Image', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Ischemia', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial dysfunction', 'Neurologic', 'Nimodipine', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Placebos', 'Prevention', 'Pulmonary Edema', 'Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase PCR', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Resources', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Societies', 'Stroke', 'Subarachnoid Hemorrhage', 'Survivors', 'Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome', 'Thrombosis', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Vasospasm', 'Whole Blood', 'Work', 'base', 'biomarker signature', 'care costs', 'cerebral microvasculature', 'cohort', 'cost', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'mortality', 'outcome prediction', 'patient stratification', 'peripheral blood', 'prevent', 'repaired', 'spreading depression', 'stroke patient', 'support vector machine', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'treatment trial', 'vascular risk factor', 'whole genome']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R61,2021,681385
"Reclassifying Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension Into Immune Phenotypes Using Machine Learning This is a K23 award application for Dr. Andrew Sweatt, a pulmonary/critical care physician and young investigator at Stanford University who is establishing a niche in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) precision phenotyping. His work centers on using machine learning to reclassify PAH, where hidden patterns are detected in high-throughput molecular data to uncover new phenotypes. The existing PAH clinical classification does not inform therapy decisions, and outcomes are overall poor with a ‘one-size-fits-all’ treatment approach. There is a critical need for molecular phenotyping efforts, to develop classification schemes that sit closer to pathobiology and identify therapeutically-targetable patient subsets. Dr. Sweatt’s K23 builds on an innovative foundational study where he used machine learning to cluster PAH patients based on blood immune profiling, without guidance from clinical features. This agnostic approach uncovered 4 immune phenotypes with distinct cytokine profiles that are independent of clinical subtypes and stratify disease risk. These findings indicate that inflammation is a viable platform for PAH reclassification. Extensive research has implicated inflammation in PAH and multiple immune-targeting therapies are under active investigation, but these studies rest on the assumption that a common pathophenotype exists. The objective of Dr. Sweatt’s K23 is to better understand PAH immune phenotypes in terms of their longitudinal evolution, mechanistic underpinnings, and therapeutic implications. First, he will perform serial cytokine profiling in two observational cohorts (Stanford, USA; Sheffield, UK) to reassess immune phenotypes during the disease course (Aim 1). Based on preliminary data, dynamic phenotype switches may occur in some patients and reflect changes in clinical disease severity. Next, he will integrate blood transcriptomic profiling and apply sophisticated computational tools to provide phenotype-specific mechanistic insights (Aim 2). He postulates that distinct transcriptomic profiles will link phenotypes to specific signaling pathways and immune cell subsets. Findings will be validated using multi-cohort data from public repositories. Finally, he will perform post-hoc cytokine profiling in two recent PAH trial cohorts where immune modulators were tested, to assess if therapy responses differ across phenotypes (Aim 3). His research could help identify patients who will respond to specific therapies, inform clinical trial designs, lead to biomarker discovery, and define novel biology in PAH. The K23 will provide Dr. Sweatt with the critical support needed to transition to an independent research career and be a leader in PAH precision phenotyping. His K23 objectives are to gain experience in PAH clinical phenotyping/cohort building, expand expertise in bioinformatics, cultivate collaboration, and translate findings to new hypotheses for R01 development. He will be guided by a committed team of multidisciplinary mentors (Roham Zamanian [expert in PAH clinical trial design/biomarkers], Marlene Rabinovitch [leader in translational PAH research], and Purvesh Khatri [pioneer in bioinformatics]) and scientific advisors (Mark Nicolls [translational PAH immunology], PJ Utz [immunology], and Manisha Desai [biostatistics]). NARRATIVE This proposed research is aimed at classifying novel subtypes of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), by studying inflammation in the blood of patients (complex protein and genetic profiles) and using sophisticated computational methods (machine learning and systems-based network analysis) to find data patterns that would otherwise remain hidden. This research is relevant to public health as the burden of morbidity and mortality is high in PAH, and the current system used to classify patients does not inform treatment decisions. Our project has significant potential to improve public health, as it may yield a PAH classification scheme that sits closer to underlying pathobiology, provide a critical step toward identifying patients who will respond to specific therapies, help improve the design of forthcoming clinical trials, and create a framework for precision medicine.",Reclassifying Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension Into Immune Phenotypes Using Machine Learning,10192823,K23HL151892,"['Address', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Classification Scheme', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Critical Care', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Evolution', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Growth Factor', 'Immune', 'Immune Targeting', 'Immunity', 'Immunology', 'Immunomodulators', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Molecular', 'Mononuclear', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Network-based', 'Outcome', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Plasma', 'Public Health', 'Rare Diseases', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Signal Pathway', 'System', 'Systemic disease', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Toxin', 'Transcript', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomarker discovery', 'career', 'chemokine', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical subtypes', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'cytokine', 'data repository', 'design', 'differential expression', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'molecular phenotype', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'overexpression', 'patient subsets', 'precision medicine', 'prospective', 'protein complex', 'public repository', 'pulmonary arterial hypertension', 'response', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'transcriptomics', 'trend']",NHLBI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K23,2021,193536
"Deep Learning and Fluid Dynamics Based Phenotyping of Expiratory Central Airway Collapse Project Summary/ Abstract Expiratory central airway collapse (ECAC), defined by >50% collapse of large airways during expiration, resulting from either cartilaginous weakening or redundancy of the posterior membranous wall of the trachea, is an increasingly recognized disorder associated with cigarette smoking and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Airflow obstruction in smokers primarily arises from increased resistance to airflow in the small distal conducting airways <2 mm in diameter. It is plausible that in a subset of smokers with and without COPD, central airway collapse results in additional resistance to airflow, resulting in substantial respiratory morbidity. Ninety-two million adults in the Unites States are active or past smokers, and ECAC is present in approximately 5% of current and former smokers. The presence of ECAC is associated with greater dyspnea, worse respiratory-quality of life and greater frequency of exacerbations after adjustment for underlying lung disease. Whether these patients will benefit from interventional therapies such as stenting or tracheopexy depends on whether the airflow resistance caused by ECAC contributes to symptoms, and this in turn depends on the relative contribution of central and small airways to overall airflow resistance. If the overall airflow resistance is primarily due to distal small airways obstruction in a given patient with ECAC, treating central airway collapse is unlikely to benefit such a patient. Our central hypothesis is that ECAC results in additional airflow obstruction beyond that incurred in the small airways, and that in a subset of patients the central airways are the major site of airflow obstruction and hence are amenable to therapy. The complex interplay of proximal and distal airway resistances and transpulmonary pressures does not lend itself to direct measurements in human subjects across a range of physiological pressure and flow changes. We propose a combination of CT-derived imaging and patient-personalized benchtop model and deep learning to answer these questions with the following specific aims. Aim 1 of this application will be to derive personalized patient- specific information on airway geometry and resistance using airway segmentation from computed tomography (CT) scans. We will calculate airway resistances in central and small airways using standard formulae. The goal of Aim 2 is to create bench-top simulations to understand the complex interplay between the resistance of small and large airways. In Aim 3, we will use deep learning to derive probability scores for clinically substantial ECAC from segmented airway images on computed tomography. The results of our study will enable patient-specific personalized therapies for ECAC. The mechanistic insights gained from this study will help identify patients with clinically significant ECAC and hence most likely to benefit from therapeutic interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE Expiratory central airway collapse (ECAC), greater than 50% collapse of the large airways during expiration, is present in 5% of chronic smokers, and is associated with substantial respiratory morbidity disproportionate to underlying lung disease. Resistance to airflow in smokers is thought to primarily occur in the small conducting airways. By using benchtop models and deep learning to determine the effect of central airway collapse on overall airway resistance and its contribution to airflow obstruction relative to small airway resistance, the proposed project will identify patients with ECAC who will benefit from intervention, and cause a paradigm shift in the therapy of these patients.",Deep Learning and Fluid Dynamics Based Phenotyping of Expiratory Central Airway Collapse,10149998,R21EB027891,"['3-Dimensional', '3D Print', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Air Movements', 'Airway Resistance', 'Area', 'Body mass index', 'Breathing', 'Caliber', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Dyspnea', 'Exhalation', 'Forced expiratory volume function', 'Frequencies', 'Generations', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Length', 'Liquid substance', 'Lung diseases', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Probability', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Pulmonary Function Test/Forced Expiratory Volume 1', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Resistance', 'Scanning', 'Site', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Smoking History', 'Spirometry', 'Stents', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Trachea', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Tube', 'United States', 'Visualization', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'airway obstruction', 'base', 'cartilaginous', 'cigarette smoking', 'clinical application', 'clinical predictors', 'clinically significant', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'expiration', 'former smoker', 'human subject', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'patient subsets', 'personalized medicine', 'pressure', 'respiratory', 'respiratory morbidity', 'response', 'sex', 'simulation', 'three-dimensional modeling']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,R21,2021,185497
"Optimal Decision Making in Radiotherapy Using Panomics Analytics The complex environment of modern radiation therapy (RT) comprises data from a rich combination of patient- specific information including: demographics, physical characteristics of high-energy dose, features subsequent to repeated application of image-guidance (radiomics), and biological markers (genomics, proteomics, etc.), generated before and/or over a treatment period that can span few days to several weeks. Rapid growth of these available and untapped “pan-Omics” data, invites ample opportunities for Big data analytics to deliver on the promise of personalized medicine in RT. This particularly true in promising but high-risk RT procedures such as stereotactic body RT (SBRT), which have witnessed tremendous expansion due to clinical successes in early disease stages and socio-economic benefits of shortened high dose treatments. This has led to the desire to exploit these treatments into more advanced stages of cancer, however, the unknown risks associated with increased toxicities hamper its potential. Therefore, robust clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) capable of exploring the complex pan-Omics interaction landscape with the goal of exploiting known principles of treatment response before and during the course of fractionated RT are urgently needed. The long-term goal of this project is to overcome barriers related to prediction uncertainties and human-computer interactions, which are currently limiting the ability to make personalized clinical decisions for real-time response-based adaptation in radiotherapy from available data. To meet this need and overcome current challenges, we have assembled a multidisciplinary team including: clinicians, medical physicists, data scientists, and human factor experts. Specifically, we will develop and quantitively evaluate: (1) graph-based supervised machine learning algorithms for robust prediction outcomes before and during RT; (2) deep reinforcement learning to dynamically optimize treatment adaptation; and (3) a user-centered software prototype for RT decision support, with the broader goal of building a comprehensive real-time framework for outcome modeling and response-based adaption in RT. We hypothesize that the use of advanced machine learning techniques and user-centered tools will unlock the potentials to move from current population-based approaches limited by subjective experiences and heuristic rules into robust, patient-specific, user-friendly CDSSs. This approach and its corresponding software tool will be tested within two clinical RT sites of lung and liver cancers, to demonstrate its versatility and highlight pertinent human-computer factors and cancer specific issues. Impact statement: Patient-specific big data are now available before and/or during RT courses, offering new and untapped opportunities for personalized treatment. This study will overcome current shortcomings of population-based approaches and data underuse in current RT practice by investigating and developing an intelligent, computer-aided, user-centered, personalized CDSS and test its performance in rewarding but high- risk RT scenarios. The approach is also applicable to other modern cancer regimens. With the wide variety of treatment prescription options in radiation therapy, physicians and patients need to weigh the benefits and risks of each treatment; these treatments are delivered over multiple treatment sessions where additional patient-specific data become available. Clinical decision support can play a pivotal role in deliberations related to response-based adaptation of treatment. Therefore, we are exploring and benchmarking large-scale adaptive machine learning methods for building a robust decision support system tool in terms of efficacy, human-computer factors, and the ability to handle large data uncertainties for clinical practice in the complex but promising environment of high dose radiation treatment of lung and liver cancers as case studies.",Optimal Decision Making in Radiotherapy Using Panomics Analytics,10299634,R01CA233487,"['Algorithms', 'Awareness', 'Bayesian Network', 'Bedside Testings', 'Benchmarking', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'Biological Markers', 'Case Study', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Complex', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Scientist', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Dose Fractionation', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Hostage', 'Human', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'Intelligence', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Liver', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of liver', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Nature', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Oncology', 'Outcome', 'Patient Preferences', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Procedures', 'Proteomics', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Quality of life', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation therapy', 'Reaction Time', 'Regimen', 'Regrets', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Schedule', 'Site', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Uncertainty', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical center', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical practice', 'clinical research site', 'computer human interaction', 'deep learning', 'deep reinforcement learning', 'demographics', 'experience', 'fractionated radiation', 'heuristics', 'high reward', 'high risk', 'image guided', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'irradiation', 'knowledge base', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'multidisciplinary', 'neoplastic cell', 'outcome prediction', 'personalized decision', 'personalized medicine', 'population based', 'predicting response', 'predictive marker', 'profiles in patients', 'prototype', 'radiation risk', 'radiomics', 'rapid growth', 'response', 'side effect', 'socioeconomics', 'success', 'supervised learning', 'support tools', 'therapy outcome', 'tool', 'treatment choice', 'treatment duration', 'treatment optimization', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'usability', 'user-friendly']",NCI,H.

"Optical Coherence Elastography of the Cornea PROJECT SUMMARY The fundamental physical properties of the outer tunic of the eye determine the structural characteristics of the ocular globe and may be altered in several devastating disease states including axial elongation in myopia, pathological deformation in keratoconus, and iatrogenic keratoectasia following corneal refractive surgery. These biomechanical tissue characteristics not only influence our clinical interpretation of diagnostic tests, e.g. measurement of intraocular pressure, but have been implicated as important factors in the development of glaucoma. Currently, there is no available reliable method to perform quantitative measurement of corneal elasticity in vivo. Here we will develop novel method for the assessment of corneal elastic properties that could potentially be used for routine clinical diagnostic and treatment. This method will take advantages of highly localized air pressure stimulation and ultra-sensitive detection and analysis of the pressure waves propagation on corneal posterior and anterior surfaces with a line-field Optical Coherence Tomography to reconstruct volumetric biomechanical properties of the cornea. Our previous work has made fundamental advances in the understanding of corneal biomechanics through a novel approach with potentially impactful applications in other disciplines (e.g. cataract surgery, LAISK, corneal cross-linking, and tissue transplants with personalize treatments). The proposed studies will accelerate transition of this technology into clinics, influence our selection and application of corneal surgical treatments and will help us to understand the structural consequences of corneal disease and wound healing: Aim 1. Develop a line-field OCE (LF-OCE) system for ultrafast 3D clinical imaging. Aim 2. In vivo studies with rabbits. Aim 3. Preliminary clinical studies in humans. Aim 4. Refine numerical (FEM) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) models of the depth-dependent nonlinear viscoelastic properties of the cornea. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal will focus on the development of novel technology and methods for noninvasive assessment of biomechanical properties of the cornea.

"Relationship between Glaucoma and the Three-Dimensional Optic Nerve Head Related Structure Project Summary Glaucoma is the second leading cause of blindness globally, and is characterized by optic nerve damage that leads to the death of retinal ganglion cells with accompanying visual field (VF) loss. The optic nerve head (ONH) is the site of injury to the optic nerve fibers and plays a central role in glaucoma pathogenesis and diagnosis. Traditionally, glaucoma is diagnosed based on fundus inspection of the ONH, which provides information about the surface contour of the ONH. However, the optic nerve damage occurs in the deeper layers. With the development of optical coherence tomography (OCT) techniques for three-dimensional (3D) retinal imaging, parameters derived from the 3D ONH related structure (e.g., Bruch's membrane opening minimum rim width, peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer thickness, disc tilt etc.) have been studied to better understand glaucoma pathogenesis, and are used to supplement clinical diagnosis. In addition, studies of the ONH biomechanics have also shown that the strain level at the ONH at any given intraocular pressure level depends on the 3D geometry of the ONH related structure. A high strain level is hypothesized to contribute to retinal ganglion cell injury. Previous research has suggested that the 3D ONH related structure is correlated to glaucoma pathogenesis and critically important to glaucoma diagnosis. However, to date, a systematic study using clinical data to determine the impact of the 3D ONH related structure on glaucoma has not been conducted.  We propose to study the relationship between the 3D ONH related structure and glaucoma with a diverse set of combined techniques including image processing, computational mechanics and machine learning. The specific aims of this project are to: (1) Derive features from the 3D ONH related structure and study their implications on VF loss patterns (K99 Phase). (2) Investigate the impact of the strain field patterns at the ONH on glaucoma (K99 Phase). (3) Study the effect of the 3D ONH related features on OCT diagnostic parameters (R00 Phase). (4) Model central vision loss from the 3D ONH related structural features (R00 Phase). Collectively, these studies will provide new insights and perspectives into the structure-function relationships in glaucoma and establish ocular anatomy specific norms of retinal nerve fiber layer profiles, which will advance our current understanding of glaucoma pathogenesis and improve glaucoma diagnosis. Our research is of high clinical relevance and can be potentially translated into clinical practice for better glaucoma diagnosis, monitoring and treatment.  Through the proposed research and training plans, the applicant will build a solid knowledge base in ophthalmology and further improve his expertise in mathematical modeling and data science. This project will provide critical training opportunities to further enhance the applicant's capabilities to become an independent computational vision scientist in ophthalmology.

"Climate Penalty: Climate-driven Increases in Ozone and PM2.5 Levels and Mortality Project Summary Climate change is the greatest public health challenge of the 21st century. While numerous pathways of the health impact of climate change have been proposed, the “climate penalty” effect, i.e., a warming temperature worsens ambient air quality and consequently influences human health, remains poorly understood, resulting in an underestimated public health burden associated with global warming. Our previous epidemiological studies have reported that higher summer mean temperatures and higher PM2.5 concentrations are each associated with increased all-cause mortality in the Medicare population (aged ≥65) in the Southeastern US (SEUS)1, 2. Satellite and ground-based observations suggest a strong dependence of air pollution on interannual variabilities of summer mean temperature in SEUS3. These findings suggest that the indirect health effect of temperature via the climate penalty on air quality can be potentially important in the SEUS region, in addition to the direct adverse effects that we observed. However, clear epidemiological evidence of the air pollution serving as a mediator for the health effects of temperature, and accurate estimate of this effect is still missing in current literature. Herein, drawing on our preliminary results, we hypothesize that rising temperature can indirectly affect all-cause mortality via worsening both PM2.5 and ozone levels in the SEUS. We propose a study that will leverage the Medicare cohort from 2000-2016 (124 million person-years), the largest longitudinal cohort available for the SEUS and the high-resolution temperature, PM2.5, and O3 data, to investigate all-cause mortality in response to the “climate penalty” effect using a mediation statistical analysis. Specifically, in this project we will (1) update the present- day temperature and ozone predictions at 1-km2 grids across the SEUS through 2016 by incorporating ensemble averaging of machine learning models; (2) quantify the health effect of “climate penalty” on all-cause mortality using a mediation analysis, and explore whether mitigating anthropogenic air pollution emissions might serve as a pathway of climate change adaptation; (3) perform a risk assessment on the excess deaths related to the climate penalty on air pollution for the mid- (2050) and late-21st century (2100), using climate model output, chemical transport modeling, along with the top-down estimate of “climate penalty” from Aim 2. The proposed research will improve understanding of the interplays between climate, air pollution, and human health based on real-world big data, and provide epidemiological evidence of an important pathway that climate change adversely affects human health, with immediate relevance to climate and environmental policymaking. Project Narrative This project aims to estimate the health effect of “climate penalty”, i.e., the rising temperature indirectly affects human health via worsening ambient air quality (primarily PM2.5 and ozone levels) using a mediation analysis based on satellite-retrieved exposures and Medicare all-cause mortality. We will test the hypotheses that 1) the indirect health effect of a warming climate by worsening air quality can be a major public health burden of future climate change, and 2) improving air quality by reducing anthropogenic emission can mitigate the health effect of climate penalty. We will also forecast the excess deaths in 2050 and 2100 related to the climate penalty on air pollution using climate model ensembles simulated for different emission scenarios.",Climate Penalty: Climate-driven Increases in Ozone and PM2.5 Levels and Mortality,10218738,R21ES032606,"['Address', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Air', 'Air Pollution', 'American', 'Big Data', 'Cessation of life', 'Chemicals', 'Chronic', 'Climate', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dependence', 'Environmental Policy', 'Epidemiology', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Global Warming', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Insurance', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medicare', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Ozone', 'Pathway interactions', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Planet Earth', 'Policies', 'Policy Making', 'Pollution', 'Population', 'Population Study', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Public Health', 'Quality Control', 'Reaction', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk Assessment', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Suggestion', 'Surface', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Update', 'Weather', 'air pollution control', 'anthropogenesis', 'atmospheric chemistry', 'base', 'climate change', 'climate impact', 'cohort', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'fine particles', 'human old age (65+)', 'improved', 'mortality', 'neural network', 'oxidation', 'pollutant', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'random forest', 'resilience', 'response', 'tropospheric ozone', 'ventilation', 'volatile organic compound', 'warm temperature']",NIEHS,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R21,2021,260895
"Data-Driven Phenotyping of Severe Traumatic Brain Injury Project Summary This predoctoral fellowship will provide the applicant (Hayley Falk), a doctoral candidate in the Department of Computational Medicine & Bioinformatics at the University of Michigan, with the skills necessary to become an independent research investigator with expertise in novel applications of machine learning for TBI. The limited accuracy of current models for early prediction of GCS 3-8 TBI (commonly referred to as severe TBI) outcomes (prognostic models) is a major barrier to improving the clinical care of patients with GCS 3-8 TBI. Less than 20% of patients with GCS 3-8 TBI experience a good neurologic recovery and currently there are no therapeutic agents that improve long-term outcomes. In GCS 3-8 TBI clinical trials of promising therapeutic agents, a favorable outcome is typically defined as a better outcome than would be expected, taking into account the predicted prognosis for each individual patient. Therefore, accurate estimation of predicted prognosis is critical to assessing the efficacy of novel therapeutic agents. The leading prognostic models for GCS 3-8 TBI, IMPACT (International Mission for Prognosis and Analysis of Clinical Trials in TBI) and CRASH (Corticosteroid Randomization After Significant Head Injury), have undergone extensive external validation, however, the discriminative accuracy is highly cohort dependent with AUCs as low as 0.60 in some patient groups. The two major limitations of the IMPACT and CRASH models include one-time measurements of clinical predictor variables and regression-based methods, which are not designed to handle complex, multidimensional datasets. Our objective is to derive a dynamic prognostic model which provides updated outcome predictions as new data becomes available. We will then develop a clustering algorithm to identify physiologically distinct subtypes (clusters) of GCS 3-8 TBI derived from continuous, high frequency data streams. Our proposed goals will be achieved by the following specific aims: 1) we will derive a dynamic prognostic model using a RNN (recurrent neural network)-based framework and data collected during the first two weeks post-injury from BOOST-2 (Brain Oxygen Optimization in Severe Traumatic Brain Injury: Phase 2) which provides updated 6-month outcome predictions every 24 hours; and 2) using time series hierarchical clustering and continuous measures of physiologic parameters collected from subjects enrolled in BOOST-2 during the first two weeks post-injury, we will identify distinct subtypes of GCS 3-8 TBI and examine the association between subtype and 6-month outcome. In Aim 1, we hypothesize that our dynamic prognostic model derived from time-varying data will have a higher discriminative accuracy (AUC) than a static prognostic model (similar to IMPACT and CRASH) derived using single timepoint data collected on the day of injury. In Aim 2, we hypothesize that subtypes of GCS 3-8 TBI characterized by continuous physiologic parameters such as increasing ICP (intracranial pressure), decreasing CPP (cerebral perfusion pressure), and decreasing PbtO2 (brain tissue oxygenation) will be associated with poor 6-month outcomes. Project Narrative The proposed project aims to address the limitations of current prognostic models for GCS 3-8 TBI using state- of-the-art machine learning techniques including RNNs (recurrent neural networks) and time series hierarchical clustering. Using time-varying data collected during the first two weeks post-injury from GCS 3-8 TBI subjects enrolled in BOOST-2 (Brain Oxygen Optimization in Severe Traumatic Brain Injury: Phase 2), we will use a RNN-based framework to derive a dynamic prognostic model which improves upon the accuracy of existing static TBI prognostic models and a time series hierarchical clustering algorithm to identify distinct subtypes (clusters) of GCS 3-8 TBI derived from continuous physiologic parameters and examine the association between subtype and 6-month outcome. We will validate and refine the models developed using BOOST-2 data and data from a cohort of subjects enrolled in BOOST-3.",Data-Driven Phenotyping of Severe Traumatic Brain Injury,10230403,F31NS118944,"['Address', 'Adrenal Cortex Hormones', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Bioinformatics', 'Brain', 'Cerebral perfusion pressure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Coma', 'Complex', 'Craniocerebral Trauma', 'Data', 'Early identification', 'Enrollment', 'Fellowship', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Glasgow Outcome Scale', 'Goals', 'Hour', 'Injury', 'International', 'Intracranial Hypertension', 'Intracranial Pressure', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Network-based', 'Outcome', 'Oxygen', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Probability', 'ROC Curve', 'Randomized', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Series', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Time', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'clinical care', 'clinical predictors', 'clinical trial analysis', 'cohort', 'data streams', 'experience', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'long short term memory', 'mortality', 'multidimensional data', 'neurological recovery', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'pre-doctoral', 'predictive modeling', 'recurrent neural network', 'skills', 'temporal measurement', 'time use', 'tissue oxygenation']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,F31,2021,37988
"Application of advanced methodology to osteoarthritis phenotyping Osteoarthritis (OA) is highly prevalent, contributes to substantial morbidity in the population, and lacks effective interventions to prevent onset and progression. Importantly, and like many other chronic conditions, OA is not a single disease but rather a heterogeneous condition consisting of multiple subgroups, or phenotypes, with differing underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. It is becoming increasingly clear that consideration of specific OA phenotypes in clinical studies and trials is critically needed to move the field forward. The overall goal of this line of work is to identify and understand potential phenotypes of knee osteoarthritis (KOA) to better inform future research efforts and treatments; this exploratory R21 project using OA Initiative (OAI) data will investigate novel methodology to support phenotyping in KOA. Successful treatments for OA will need to be targeted to, and tested in, specifically chosen OA phenotypes. Our hypothesis is that an understanding of KOA phenotypes, a key step toward Precision Medicine in OA, will lead to more successful clinical studies in the long-term. To approach this important clinical problem, we propose a project in which we will apply innovative machine learning methods and validation strategies to data from the large, publicly available OAI cohort. We will leverage this large dataset, along with local expertise in statistics, biostatistics and machine learning methodology, to tackle the problem of phenotyping this heterogeneous disease. In Aim 1, we will utilize a data-driven, unsupervised learning approach, to cluster features that best define and discriminate among phenotypes of KOA in the OAI dataset, using biclustering and a novel significance test (SigClust) developed by co-I Marron. For Aim 2, we will test specific hypotheses of relevance to OA outcomes, such as differences between those with and without OA, or those who do or do not develop new or worsening disease, using another set of machine learning methods (Direction-projection-permutation [DiProPerm] hypothesis testing, and Distance-Weighted Discrimination [DWD]), also developed by co-I Marron, in the full cohort and in any identified clusters from Aim 1. In order to address these aims, this proposal involves interdisciplinary collaborations among experts in statistics, biostatistics, computer science, rheumatology, and epidemiology. This work will significantly impact the field by fulfilling a critical need to accurately define OA phenotypes, discover the key features associated with these phenotypes, link phenotype subgroups to underlying mechanisms and use this information to inform and focus future clinical studies. In the long term, we expect that this strategy will lead to more personalized and successful management of the millions of people affected by OA. Project narrative Osteoarthritis is an enormous and increasing public health problem, and like many other chronic conditions it is not a single disease but a heterogeneous condition consisting of multiple subgroups, or phenotypes, with differing underlying mechanisms. The lack of appreciation of this heterogeneity has contributed to the failure of all attempts to date to develop disease-modifying osteoarthritis drugs; future trials will need to target specific OA phenotypes. There is a critical need to define and understand phenotypes in OA and link these to outcomes, leading to more personalized and successful management of this common and debilitating disease.",Application of advanced methodology to osteoarthritis phenotyping,10083187,R21AR074685,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age-Years', 'Arthritis', 'Biomechanics', 'Biometry', 'Cartilage', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Failure', 'Fibrinogen', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Knee Injuries', 'Knee Osteoarthritis', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Meniscus structure of joint', 'Methodology', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Non obese', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Progressive Disease', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Research Methodology', 'Resources', 'Rheumatology', 'Risk Factors', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Synovial Membrane', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'bone', 'cohort', 'common treatment', 'computer science', 'demographics', 'design', 'disability', 'drug development', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'improved', 'injured', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary collaboration', 'joint destruction', 'large datasets', 'loss of function', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'statistics', 'unsupervised learning']",NIAMS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R21,2021,160567
"Biomarkers of Cerebral Cavernous Angioma with Symptomatic Hemorrhage (CASH) Biomarkers of Cerebral Cavernous Angioma with Symptomatic Hemorrhage (CASH) PROJECT SUMMARY Cerebral cavernous angioma (CA) is a capillary microangiopathy affecting more than a million Americans, predisposing them to a premature risk of brain hemorrhage. Fewer than 200,000 cases who have suffered a recent symptomatic hemorrhage (SH) are most likely to re-bleed again with serious clinical sequelae, and are the primary focus of therapeutic development. Genetic mechanisms of CA have been extensively studied, and consequent signaling aberrations in the neurovascular unit. These include proliferative dysangiogenesis, blood- brain barrier hyperpermeability, inflammation and immune mediated processes, anticoagulant vascular domain, and gut microbiome-driven mechanisms. Plasma levels of molecules reflecting these mechanisms and measures of vascular permeability and hemorrhage leak on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have been correlated with CA hemorrhage in pilot studies. It would be desirable to optimize these biomarkers to accurately diagnose CASH, to prognosticate the risk of future SH, and to monitor cases after a bleed and in response to therapy. This would influence clinical management, and select higher risk cases for clinical trials. Additional candidate biomarkers are emerging from ongoing mechanistic and differential transcriptome studies, which would be expected to further enhance the sensitivity and specificity of diagnosis and prediction of CASH. Weighed combinations of levels of plasma proteins and characteristic micro-ribonucleic acids (miRNA) may further strengthen biomarker associations. Plasma biomarkers may reflect (and potentially replace) more cumbersome and expensive imaging biomarkers for monitoring CA hemorrhage. We here assemble leading clinical CA researchers and propose to deploy advanced statistical and computational biology approaches (including supervised machine learning) for the integration of novel candidate biomarkers, rejecting non-correlated candidates, and determining the best clustering and weighing of combined biomarker contributions. In Specific Aim 1 we assess these biomarkers in a large CA cohort from multiple sites, to discover the best plasma biomarkers and validate them in sex, age and relevant clinical subgroups. In Specific Aim 2 we compare changes in MRI measures of vascular permeability and hemorrhage with plasma biomarkers over time. In Specific Aim 3 we query the biomarkers in non-CA subjects, to identify potential confounders in the clinical context. This project leverages the synergy of established CA research consortia, and integrates analytic and computational biology expertise to develop blood tests for better CASH diagnosis and prognosis. The project tests a novel integrational approach of biomarker development in a mechanistically defined cerebrovascular disease with a relevant context of use. This approach is applicable to other neurological diseases with similar pathobiologic features. PROJECT NARRATIVE The project assembles leading cavernous angioma researchers with the aim of developing blood tests for the diagnosis and prediction of symptomatic brain hemorrhage, a critical clinical challenge in a disease affecting more than a million Americans. We further examine whether blood biomarkers can replace or enhance the accuracy of advanced imaging in association with lesional bleeding.

"Radiomics and Pathomics to predict upstaging of DCIS Abstract  Ductal carcinomas in situ (DCIS) of the breast are a heterogeneous group of neoplastic lesions that are usually detected by screening mammography. Workup generally includes a percutaneous (core) Biopsy (Bx) for histologic confirmation, followed by multiparametric MRI (mpMRI), followed by breast-conserving excision, and adjuvant radiation. Approximately 20-25% of patients with core Bx-confirmed DCIS are upstaged to invasive carcinoma upon pathology of resected tissue. Foreknowledge of this would dictate a more aggressive surgical intervention, including sentinel node biopsy for axillary staging. Further, another 20-25% of patients are judged to have low-risk disease and current thought is that such women may have better outcomes in an active surveillance setting, and this is being tested in clinical trials. The ultimate goal and the overall impact of this project is to use machine learning to identify biochemical (SA1) or imaging (SA2) biomarkers, as well as their combination (SA3) to discriminate indolent from aggressive DCIS, as determined by upstaging upon excisional biopsy.  The major hypothesis to be tested in this work is that hypoxia and expression of hypoxia-related proteins (HRPs) can discriminate aggressive from more indolent DCIS, and that this can be used for decision support. Expression of HRPs is optimally characterized by immunohistochemistry (IHC), and we have deployed methods for multiplexed IHC, as well as methods for advanced analytics using machine learning (pathomics). We have also shown that hypoxic habitats within breast cancers can be identified from mpMRI using machine learning (radiomics). We thus propose to use pathomics of core biopsies and radiomics of mpMRI to determine the presence and extent of hypoxic habitats in DCIS prior to surgery to predict subsequent upstaging after surgical resection. This work will be performed in Aim 1 for pathomics and Aim 2 for radiomics, and Aim 3 will develop combined radio-pathomics predictors. Each aim will contain: (a) retrospective arms for training, tuning, and testing; and (b) prospective internal and external cohorts for rigorous validation. For the retrospective studies, we have identified 604 cases wherein women with DCIS obtained core Bx, mpMRI, and surgery with pathology at Moffitt in the last 10 years. Internal prospective studies will accrue ~6 women/month who have consented to the total Cancer Care® protocol and who have their complete workup at Moffitt. External validation cohorts will be accrued at UCSF and at Advent Health.  At the end of this work we will have developed a risk model for DCIS that can be deployed prior to surgery to guide decisions along the spectrum from active surveillance at one end to more extensive surgical intervention at the other. This is expected to lay a foundation for subsequent interventional trials. Additionally, the inclusion of hypoxia as a central hypothesis has high potential to illuminate components of the natural history of this disease. Narrative  Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is one of the most commonly diagnosed malignancies of the breast and data are lacking with regard to optimal treatment. Consequently, the majority of DCIS are treated in the same manner: i.e. surgery +/- radiation +/- hormonal therapy that results in either over- or under-treatment of many patients. In the current work we will test the hypothesis that histologic or radiologic markers prior to surgery can guide decision support by identifying predicting up-staging and pathological risk scoring following surgical excision.",Radiomics and Pathomics to predict upstaging of DCIS,10120171,R01CA249016,"['Acidosis', 'Adjuvant', 'Adjuvant Therapy', 'Antibodies', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Axilla', 'Basic Science', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Breast', 'Breast Carcinogenesis', 'Carcinoma', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Paths', 'Clinical Trials', 'Consent', 'Core Biopsy', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Duct (organ) structure', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Evolution', 'Excision', 'Excision biopsy', 'Formalin', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Habitats', 'Health', 'Heritability', 'Histologic', 'Hyperplasia', 'Hypoxia', 'Image', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Indolent', 'Intervention Trial', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammographic screening', 'Mammography', 'Metastatic breast cancer', 'Methods', 'Milk', 'Modeling', 'Multiparametric Analysis', 'Mutation', 'Noninfiltrating Intraductal Carcinoma', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Periodicity', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Prospective cohort', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation', 'Radio', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Resected', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Retrospective cohort', 'Risk', 'SLC2A1 gene', 'Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy', 'Staging', 'Stains', 'Surgical Pathology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Embedding', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Woman', 'Work', 'advanced analytics', 'arm', 'base', 'breast malignancies', 'cancer care', 'cohort', 'contrast enhanced', 'deep learning', 'disease natural history', 'disorder risk', 'hormone therapy', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'neoplastic', 'optimal treatments', 'practical application', 'preclinical study', 'premalignant', 'prospective', 'radiomics', 'standard of care', 'statistics', 'tumor', 'validation studies']",NCI,H.

"Bioinformatics for post-traumatic stress Project Summary/Abstract Maladaptive complications following trauma, including post-traumatic stress (PTS), are highly prevalent in both veterans and civilians, and have been difficult to accurately diagnose, manage and treat. Debate regarding diagnostic criteria and the need to represent the full spectrum of inter-connected features contributing to psychopathology has spawned the development of the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH). RDoC is a developing framework to help guide the discovery and validation of new dimensions of mental health disorders and their relationships to underlying biological mechanisms. NIMH now has a rich federated database that currently houses raw data from RDoC-sponsored clinical research, and clinical trial data from the National Database of Clinical Trials (NDCT) with information that may help to unlock the complex and overlapping relationships between symptoms of PTS and the underlying biomarkers to fuel improvements on diagnostic and therapeutic frameworks for trauma recovery. The proposed project will apply bioinformatics and machine learning analytical tools to these large, heterogeneous datasets to identify and validate new research dimensions of trauma-related psychopathology and treatment response trajectories and their predictors. Aim 1 will develop an in silico trauma patient population by integrating data from diverse sources, including cross-sectional and observational longitudinal clinical studies housed within available data repositories for trauma and other related mental health research. Data will include medical history, demographics, diagnostic tests, clinical outcomes, psychological assessments, genomics, imaging, and other relevant study and meta-data. Aim 2 will identify multiple dimensions of PTS diagnostic criteria, using a combination of unsupervised dimension-reduction statistical methods, internal and external cross-validation, and supervised hypothesis testing of predictive models to understand the heterogeneous subtypes of PTS. Aim 3 will deploy unsupervised machine learning methods, such as topological data analysis and hierarchical clustering, to identify unique clusters of patients based on symptomatology to develop clustering methods for precision mapping of PTS patients based on disease severity. Aim 4 will use supervised machine learning techniques for targeted predictive analytics focused on identifying treatment responders from the NDCT, and identification of latent variables that predict treatment response. The results of the proposed research project will greatly enrich the field of computational psychiatry research to identify conserved dimensions associated with the complex relationships of psychopathology and precision treatment planning following exposure to traumatic events. Project Narrative A recent restructuring of diagnostic and research criteria for psychiatric disorders has been implemented to promote greater understanding of the biological mechanisms involved in the development of complex mental health disorders. The proposed project aims to apply bioinformatics and machine learning analytics to large datasets from trauma-exposed patients to identify and validate dimensions of post-traumatic stress (PTS), relevant biological predictors, and precision treatment response trajectories.",Bioinformatics for post-traumatic stress,10205954,R01MH116156,"['Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Database', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diagnostics Research', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Exposure to', 'Genomics', 'Growth', 'Image', 'Laboratories', 'Linear Models', 'Linear Regressions', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical History', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Neurocognitive', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Recovery', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Project Grants', 'Severity of illness', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Trauma', 'Trauma Research', 'Trauma patient', 'Trauma recovery', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Validation', 'Veterans', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'biobehavior', 'combat veteran', 'computational platform', 'data archive', 'data mining', 'data repository', 'data sharing', 'demographics', 'diverse data', 'feature selection', 'federated computing', 'guided inquiry', 'hands-on learning', 'heterogenous data', 'in silico', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'large datasets', 'machine learning method', 'multidimensional data', 'multimodality', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'post-traumatic stress', 'post-traumatic symptoms', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'psychologic', 'research and development', 'research study', 'response', 'statistics', 'stress related disorder', 'supervised learning', 'symptomatology', 'tool', 'trauma exposure', 'traumatic event', 'treatment planning', 'treatment responders', 'treatment response', 'unsupervised learning', 'vector']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2021,501996
"Data-driven approaches in defining knee osteoarthritis phenotypes and factors  associated with fast progression Osteoarthritis (OA) affects 14 million individuals in the US and over 300 million adults worldwide. The disease is characterized by joint pain and functional limitations and is associated with poor health- related quality of life and increased healthcare utilization. OA of the hips and knees ranks as the 11th highest contributor to global disability. Despite the clinical and economic impact of knee OA, no disease-modifying agents are currently available; current treatments are limited to symptom control and are only modestly efficacious. While several promising treatments are in the pipeline, developing and testing treatments for OA is complicated by disease heterogeneity. We urgently need to identify the right patient for the right treatment to ensure that new therapies are being tested on the appropriate population. This proposal aims to use machine learning methods to address gaps in our understanding of disease heterogeneity in knee OA. We will use publicly available data from the FNIH OA Biomarkers Consortium project. This study of 600 subjects with knee OA includes over 200 parameters that describe the joint structure and disease severity, including measures of cartilage, bone, ligaments, menisci, and inflammation. An unsupervised learning approach using model-based clustering will be used to distinguish disease phenotypes. To implement phenotyping in practice a minimal set of biomarkers must be identified that meets the challenges of both predictive accuracy and feasibility. Thus the second aim will investigate variable selection methods in model-based clustering in order to identify important variables and develop a prediction model to determine phenotype. Finally, a supervised machine learning approach via super learning will investigate algorithms to predict disease progression. The applicant, Dr. Jamie Collins, is a biostatistician at the Orthopedic and Arthritis Center for Outcomes Research at Brigham and Women’s Hospital. Dr. Collins is a committed investigator in rheumatology research with eight first author publications in the field. She holds a career development award from the Rheumatology Research Foundation and pilot funding from the Brigham Research Institute. This proposal will provide protected time and rigorous training so that the applicant can expand her current biostatistical skill set to encompass the burgeoning fields of data science and machine learning. She will take coursework at the Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health and will have access to courses, seminars, and training provided by the Brigham Research Institute and the Harvard Catalyst Program. The applicant will be supported by mentorship from Drs. Elena Losina and Tuhina Neogi, and input from the advisory committee of Drs. Tianxi Cai, Jeffrey Duryea, Ali Guermazi, Tina Kapur, Virginia Kraus, Katherine Liao, and Kurt Spindler. The research and training proposed in this award will address critical research gaps in our understanding of OA heterogeneity and progression. This will set Dr. Collins on the path towards independence and her long-term career objective of being an independent investigator with a focus on applying advanced analytic methods in OA research. Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a chronic disabling disease that affects millions of people worldwide; there is an urgent need to develop effective therapies capable of providing symptom control and arresting structural progression. Developing and testing treatments for OA is complicated by disease heterogeneity.

"Deep learning and topological approaches to identify kidney tissue features associated with adverse outcomes after nephrectomy ABSTRACT Pathologic assessment of kidney biopsy tissue remains the best predictor of adverse outcomes in patients with kidney diseases. These features are largely independent of disease etiology and are not well reflected in non- invasive tests (e.g. serum creatinine and albuminuria). Quantitative assessment of these parameters is time consuming and maybe flawed by heterogeneity of pathologic features within kidney tissue. We propose to evaluate and optimize computational image analysis approaches to support pathologic analysis of large pieces of cancer-free kidney tissue from patients who underwent nephrectomy which we have collected (n > 220). Computer-assisted analysis of glomerular phenotypes in these samples show that morphometric features in glomeruli without obvious pathology precede established pathologic changes. We hypothesize that evaluation of cancer-free kidney tissue will inform about subclinical damage in the remaining kidney which is associated with relevant pathologic and clinical parameters. We propose to assess glomeruli, arteries and tubuli, and determine the spatial inter-relationship of the assessed features within the kidney tissue. The examination of significantly larger pieces of kidney tissue than those obtained by needle biopsy allows to include 20 times more glomeruli (nephrectomy samples: avrg. 256 glomeruli/sample; needle biopsy: avrg. 13/sample) with the vast majority considered “normal appearing” as per standard pathologic criteria. In addition, these samples include a significant larger number of blood vessels (nephrectomy samples: avrg. 18 arteries/sample; needle biopsy: avrg. 1/sample) allowing a more robust evaluation of the vasculature. We propose to apply and optimize our detection and segmentation approach to detect glomeruli, arteries and tubular segments to train convolutional neural networks and use topological image analysis to automate the identification of visual and sub-visual features. In addition, we will assess the spatial relationship between individual features (glomeruli, arteries and tubular segments and features of the same category, i.e. globally sclerosed glomeruli, arteries with hyalinosis, atrophied tubuli) within the section. To determine reproducibility of our approach, we will assess a second tissue section from a separate part of the same samples. Specifically, we propose an algorithmic detection and characterization of kidney features using deep learning, a topological image analysis for discovery of novel sub-visual features in kidney tissue images and to determine spatial relatedness of these features. If successful, we will validate our analytical approach in future independent studies. For this purpose, we are already prospectively collecting kidney tissue and longitudinal clinical data from consented patients undergoing nephrectomies, allowing association of specific features with clinical relevant outcomes. LAY NARRATIVE Patients who have one kidney removed because of cancer or other reasons, are at risk of experiencing kidney failure after the surgery due to damage to the remaining kidney, but it is difficult to know why the kidney fails and how to prevent or treat it. Evaluation of kidney tissue is the best way to determine how strong or weak the kidney is at time of surgery and how to best manage kidney-related complications afterwards. We propose a detailed analysis of pieces of tissue not affected by the tumor from the removed kidney using advanced computer-assisted analysis methods (“convolutional neural networks” and “topological image analysis”) to more accurately evaluate the status of the kidney, predict what will happen to the kidney function in the future and thereby guide therapy.",Deep learning and topological approaches to identify kidney tissue features associated with adverse outcomes after nephrectomy,10229784,R21DK126329,"['Acute', 'Albuminuria', 'Algorithms', 'Arteries', 'Atrophic', 'Blood Vessels', 'Categories', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collection', 'Computer Assisted', 'Consent', 'Consumption', 'Contralateral', 'Creatinine', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic Nephropathy', 'Disease', 'Distant', 'Elderly', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Fibrosis', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Glomerulonephritis', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Kidney Failure', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Masks', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Needle biopsy procedure', 'Needles', 'Nephrectomy', 'Nephrotic Syndrome', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Obesity', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Renal function', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Serum', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Tubular formation', 'Visual', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost effective', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'glomerulosclerosis', 'histological stains', 'improved', 'insight', 'interstitial', 'kidney biopsy', 'kidney imaging', 'morphometry', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'renal damage', 'serial imaging', 'spatial relationship', 'tumor', 'user-friendly']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R21,2021,234000
"Focal nerve fiber layer reflectance analysis for glaucoma evaluation PROJECT SUMMARY Glaucoma is a leading cause of blindness, and effective glaucoma management requires early detection. Nerve fiber layer (NFL) thickness measurement by optical coherence tomography (OCT) is useful for confirming the diagnosis of glaucoma, but its diagnostic sensitivity is not sufficient to be used alone for population-based screening.  NFL reflectivity is reduced in glaucoma subjects, presumably due to loss of axons and axonal microtubule content. But its diagnostic value is diminished by its dependence on the incident angle of the OCT beam, which is highly variable in routine clinical imaging. We hypothesize that the diagnostic accuracy can be boosted by reducing incidence angle effects with azimuthal filtering of NFL reflectance profile, and by analysis of focal rather than average reflectance changes. The preliminary result, bases on 100 normal and glaucoma eyes, showed that the diagnostic sensitivity was significantly improved from 71% for average NFL thickness to 97% for focal NFL reflectance loss in PG eyes, at a 99% specificity cutoff. We propose to validate this result in the large Advanced Imaging for Glaucoma (AIG) study dataset that comprises 249 perimetric glaucoma (PG), 252 pre-perimetric glaucoma (PPG), and 145 normal participants. The AIG study has an average follow-up of more than 4 years, which also allows assessment of the accuracy in predicting glaucoma progression. 1. Reproduce the high diagnostic accuracy of focal NFL reflectance loss analysis using the large AIG  dataset. If we could again demonstrate high diagnostic accuracy in the AIG dataset, especially in the PPG  and early PG subgroups, this could bring OCT glaucoma evaluation into the realm of population screening.  The primary performance metric will be the diagnostic sensitivity at a fixed 99% specificity cut point. 2. Use focal NFL reflectance loss to predict visual field (VF) conversion and progression. In the AIG  study, focal thinning of the macular ganglion cell complex (GCC) and peripapillary nerve fiber layer (NFL)  were found to be the best predictors of VF conversion (development of glaucomatous VF abnormality in an  eye with normal baseline VF) and progression (significant worsening of VF). We hypothesize that focal  NFL reflectance loss would have even better predictive accuracy. Predictive accuracy will be assessed  using the area under the receiver operating curve (AROC) and logistic regression (odds ratio). 3. Combine OCT reflectance and structural maps using machine learning to improve glaucoma  diagnostic accuracy. A combination of disc, peripapillary, and macular thickness parameters had  previously been shown to be synergistic, producing higher AROC than any single parameter. We  hypothesize that the addition of the novel NFL reflectance loss map to the set of input parameters will  further enhance the diagnostic accuracy of a machine learning algorithm. PROJECT NARRATIVE Nerve fiber layer (NFL) thickness using OCT is widely used in clinic for glaucoma diagnosis, but the diagnostic sensitivity is limited. Combination of NFL reflectivity and other structural OCT information promises to improve the diagnostic accuracy to a level where population-based screening would be feasible.",Focal nerve fiber layer reflectance analysis for glaucoma evaluation,10108277,R21EY032146,"['Algorithms', 'Area', 'Axon', 'Blindness', 'Clinic', 'Clinical Management', 'Complex', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Sensitivity', 'Diagnostic Specificity', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Glaucoma', 'Image', 'Incidence', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Microtubules', 'Nerve Fibers', 'Odds Ratio', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Retina', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Thick', 'Thinness', 'Visual Fields', 'base', 'clinical imaging', 'cost', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'disorder risk', 'follow-up', 'ganglion cell', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'macula', 'novel', 'population based', 'screening']",NEI,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R21,2021,192500
"Pathogenesis of Primary Biliary Cholangitis PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The major goal of this proposal is to conduct the first multi-omics translational study of Primary Biliary Cholangitis (PBC), thereby identifying the systems-level networks driving pathological processes in this rare, autoimmune liver disease. Improved understanding of PBC pathogenesis is urgently needed to inform tailored care and the development of new effective therapies. Comprehensive assessments of immunity and the role of environmental influence in PBC are currently lacking. Such evaluations would provide critical knowledge to leverage recent advances in the field’s ability to pharmacologically alter the immune system, thereby providing new hope to PBC patients. Having made significant contributions to the understanding of the genomic architecture underlying development of autoimmunity in PBC, we propose a novel, patient-oriented, multi- omics approach. In this new application, we will decipher how peripheral cellular immunity and non-cellular circulating factors contribute to PBC pathogenesis. We hypothesize that multi-omic analyses integrating cellular and non-cellular factors will identify systems-level pathways driving PBC pathogenesis. To test this hypothesis, we develop an innovative platform that combines aspects of machine learning and quantum statistical mechanics to identify omics-based signatures of PBC that when integrated with clinical features will unveil biological pathways driving disease pathogenesis.  To perform this multi-omic study of PBC, we have assembled a world-class, multi-disciplinary team synergizing expertise in PBC biology and omics-scale analytics as well as resources across Mayo Clinic and Columbia University. With a new, in-hand collection of diverse biological specimens from 300 deeply- phenotyped PBC patients and 300 well-matched controls, our studies are already underway with preliminary data demonstrating measureable immunome, methylome, inflammatory protein, exposome, and metabolome differences between PBC patients and controls. In Aim 1, we thoroughly evaluate peripheral immune composition (the immunome) and activation state (methylome, transcriptome, inflammatory proteins) using mass-cytometry (CyTOF), sequencing- and proximity extension-based methods. In Aim 2, we perform a cutting-edge study of exogenous chemicals “the exposome” and endogenous metabolites “the metabolome” using ultrahigh resolution mass spectroscopy to discover pathogenic alterations in metabolism in PBC. We also develop an assay to quantify liver-specific cell-free DNA in blood as a measure of disease severity. In Aim 3, we integrate omic-specific signatures (Aims 1 and 2) using a novel approach to identify and prioritize PBC- associated features for further biological investigation. We then infer clinically-relevant subgroups of PBC patients by performing similarity network fusion analysis. In summary, using state-of-the-art, multi-omic analyses, we will discover systems-level networks driving PBC pathogenesis, spurring development of new hypotheses and studies designed to elucidate PBC pathobiology and identify novel therapies. PROJECT NARRATIVE We will conduct the first multi-omics translational study of primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), to improve understanding of the culprits driving this rare, autoimmune liver disease. By integrating multiple layers of omics data, we will better define the architecture of cellular networks driving PBC. In so doing, we will identify molecular signatures including immune alterations, environmental toxins, and metabolism-related chemicals unique to PBC patients, thereby spurring improved understanding of PBC pathobiology and identification of novel druggable targets.",Pathogenesis of Primary Biliary Cholangitis,10095117,R01DK126691,"['Architecture', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Autoimmune Process', 'Autoimmunity', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Blood', 'Caring', 'Cellular Immunity', 'Chemicals', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Cytometry', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Funding', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Heel', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Immunity', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Light', 'Liver', 'Liver diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Onset of illness', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Primary biliary cirrhosis', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Publications', 'Questionnaires', 'Research Design', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Severity of illness', 'Specimen', 'Statistical Mechanics', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Toxic Environmental Substances', 'Universities', 'Work', 'advanced disease', 'base', 'biobank', 'cell free DNA', 'clinically relevant', 'combinatorial', 'effective therapy', 'genomic locus', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'metabolome', 'methylome', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple omics', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient oriented', 'quantum', 'response', 'toxin metabolism', 'transcriptome', 'translational study']",NIDDK,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2021,628683
"Development of a Machine Learning Model to Integrate Clinical, Laboratory, Sonographic, and Elastographic Data for Noninvasive Liver Tissue Characterization in NAFLD Abstract Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is exceptionally common, with an estimated one hundred million afflicted people in the United States. Detection and risk stratification of this very common disease remains a major challenge. Despite recent advances, including development of numerous therapeutic agents presently in phase 2 and 3 trials, NAFLD remains a silent disease in which the vast majority of patients accumulate progressive liver damage without signs or symptoms and, undiagnosed, receive no medical care. The NAFLD patients at highest risk of cirrhosis are those with moderate or greater liver fibrosis at the time of diagnosis, a group of patients who are described as having high risk non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (hrNASH). The current reference standard for identifying people with hrNASH is liver biopsy, which is expensive, invasive, and limited by interobserver variability. The focus of this project is to develop and validate low cost non-invasive diagnostic technology to diagnose hrNASH. We propose to accomplish this in three Specific Aims. First, we will expand and annotate an existing database of patients with chronic liver disease from 328 subjects to 1,000 subjects, ~40% of whom will have NAFLD. The database will contain ~20,000 images (~10,000 ultrasound elastography images and ~ 10,000 conventional ultrasound images) and multiple demographic and clinical data points for each subject (a total of ~30,000 clinical, laboratory, and demographic data points). We have previously developed advanced image processing techniques to make ultrasound elastography more accurate and less variable. We will use this large database to develop, customize and refine our image processing techniques for NAFLD evaluation (Aim 1), with the goal of improving ultrasound elastography diagnosis of hrNASH. Second, we will combine conventional ultrasound elastography imaging, conventional ultrasound imaging, our advanced image analysis techniques, and the demographic, clinical, and laboratory data in a machine learning model to predict hrNASH and will compare the performance of our predictive model with the FIB4, a widely-used blood test-based prediction rule (Aim 2). Third, we will validate our predictive model in an independent prospective cohort of NAFLD subjects undergoing biopsy for NAFLD risk stratification (Aim 3). We hypothesize that the combination of image processing-enhanced elastography and conventional ultrasound imagery combined with demographic, clinical, and laboratory data will have greater predictive power for hrNASH than clinical or sonographic data alone. The proposed predictive models have the potential to (1) reduce the number of liver biopsies performed for hrNASH detection, (2) facilitate recruitment for clinical trials of NAFLD therapeutics, and (3) improve care quality for the most common liver disease in the United States. Project Narrative In this project, we aim to create low-cost non-invasive technology to diagnose people with high risk non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (hrNASH), a common liver disease that has a high risk of cirrhosis. We will accomplish this goal by improving liver ultrasound imaging and by creating a prediction tool that integrates liver ultrasound, laboratory testing and clinical information. This prediction tool has the potential to reduce the need for liver biopsies.","Development of a Machine Learning Model to Integrate Clinical, Laboratory, Sonographic, and Elastographic Data for Noninvasive Liver Tissue Characterization in NAFLD",10075930,R01DK119860,"['Algorithmic Analysis', 'Area', 'Biopsy', 'Blood Tests', 'Caring', 'Cirrhosis', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Evaluation', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Laboratories', 'Liver', 'Liver Fibrosis', 'Liver diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase II/III Trial', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Prospective cohort', 'Quality of Care', 'ROC Curve', 'Reference Standards', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Schedule', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Staging', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Therapeutic Clinical Trial', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'chronic liver disease', 'clinical care', 'cost', 'diagnostic technologies', 'disorder subtype', 'elastography', 'hepatocellular injury', 'high risk', 'image processing', 'improved', 'liver biopsy', 'liver imaging', 'liver injury', 'non-alcoholic fatty liver disease', 'nonalcoholic steatohepatitis', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'patient population', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'risk stratification', 'screening', 'standard of care', 'tool']",NIDDK,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2021,448421
"A mobile sensing system to monitor symptoms during chemotherapy Cancer treatments can cause a variety of poorly-managed symptoms and toxicities that can impair quality of life and functioning and lead to early discontinuation of life-prolonging medical treatment. The goals of the proposed study are (1) to develop a novel mobile sensing system to passively monitor symptom burden during chemotherapy and (2) to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of using this system to recommend patient-provider communication. To accomplish Aim 1, we will enroll 200 oncology patients starting a new chemotherapy regimen and will collect smartphone and wearable sensor data continuously as well as daily patient-reported symptoms via smartphones for 90 days. Using machine learning methods, we will retrospectively analyze data from the first 100 participants and develop a generalizable and parsimonious population-level model to identify severe symptom days. For the second 100 participants, we will run these computational models in real-time and prospectively evaluate the accuracy of our classifications relative to patient-reported symptoms. For Aim 2, we will enroll 50 patients in a prospective single-arm trial of a system that uses inferences based on sensing and machine learning to recommend contact with providers and will evaluate patient accrual, attrition, and compliance as well as information from both patients and their providers about acceptability and perceived usefulness of the system. The scientific premise of this proposal is that mobile sensing of subtle fluctuations in behavior coupled with real-time computational modeling could enable earlier detection and ultimately better management of severe symptoms during cancer treatment. The proposed project builds on our prior research and completes the necessary development and feasibility work to support a large multisite trial comparing the mobile sensing system to standard of care to determine effects on symptom burden, quality of life, health care utilization, and survival. Public health relevance: Symptoms during cancer treatment are common, compromise patient quality of life and ability to tolerate treatment, and often go undetected at clinic visits. This project aims to combine smartphone and wearable sensor data with machine learning to remotely monitor symptoms during chemotherapy and to develop a system that automatically recommends patient-provider contact when severe symptoms are detected.",A mobile sensing system to monitor symptoms during chemotherapy,10218121,R37CA242545,"['Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chemotherapy-Oncologic Procedure', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinic Visits', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Computer Models', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Enrollment', 'Goals', 'Health Status', 'Heart Rate', 'Impairment', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Light', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Noise', 'Notification', 'Oncology', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Provider', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Running', 'Secure', 'Severities', 'Sleep', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Support System', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Telephone', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Work', 'acceptability and feasibility', 'arm', 'base', 'cancer care', 'cancer therapy', 'care delivery', 'care outcomes', 'chemotherapy', 'common treatment', 'feasibility testing', 'health care service utilization', 'improved', 'machine learning method', 'mobile computing', 'multi-site trial', 'novel', 'patient-clinician communication', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'remote monitoring', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'sensor', 'standard of care', 'symptom management', 'trial comparing', 'wearable sensor technology']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R37,2021,361146
"Biopsychosocial Phenotypes and Potential Mechanisms in CHARTER Central nervous system (CNS) complications are common among people with HIV (PWH), even those who are taking antiretroviral therapy (ART). The spectrum of CNS complications is broad, ranging from mild cognitive deficits that do not affect daily functioning to life-threatening encephalitis. Cognitive and mood disorders are among the most common CNS diseases that affect PWH and share a common risk factor, inflammation. Inflammation persists in effectively treated PWH for multiple reasons, including production of HIV RNA and proteins and gut dysbiosis and microbial translocation. CHARTER is a multisite, U.S.-based, neuroHIV cohort study that is funded by NIH and that has investigated CNS disorders in PWH for nearly two decades, during which it has completed more than 6,000 assessments generating more than 10 million data points. CHARTER has made important contributions to understanding the frequency, risk factors, and pathogenesis of these disorders. In recent years, new questions have arisen about the heterogeneity, biological basis, clinical impact, and management of CNS disorders. This debate has highlighted the need to create new classifications of CNS disorders in PWH that are more biology-based. We propose to use methods such as machine learning and an agnostic approach to categorize CHARTER’s high-dimensional neurobehavioral, neuromedical, psychiatric, substance use, and imaging data. Such analyses would yield not just cognitive phenotypes but biopsychosocial (BPS) phenotypes that could identify new mechanisms that lead to clinically useful diagnostic tests, new therapies, and better management of CNS disorders in PWH.  Our overarching goal is to leverage prior investment in CHARTER by using its data and stored specimens to a) better understand cognitive and BPS phenotypes in PWH and b) relate them to biological mechanisms. To accomplish this, we will use unsupervised and supervised machine learning methods to analyze data from CHARTER’s comprehensive assessments with the goal of identifying new cognitive and BPS phenotypes (Aim 1). We will then compare these new phenotypes to high-dimensional data from CHARTER’s completed genomewide association study as well as new data we will generate on inflammation (45-plex bead-based array) and highly novel assays of the microbiome and the metabolome in blood and CSF (Aim 2). Our analyses will include a specific focus how sex affects the observed relationships. To determine if this novel approach relates more strongly to biology than prior methods, we will also compare the performance of the new phenotypes to those defined by the 2007 HAND criteria. This highly innovative application is supported by strong preliminary data, responds well to Office of AIDS Research priorities, and will address key gaps in the field, including the need to better understand the pathogenesis of comorbid disease. Cognitive and mood disorders occur more commonly in people with HIV than in the general population but the field still does not fully understand why and has no effective therapies for most of those who are affected. This project will take a new approach to understanding how cognition, mood, substance use, and medical characteristics cluster together and will identify new biological mechanisms associated with these conditions. The successful project could lead to new diagnostic tests and therapies for these disorders, which would have substantial public health relevance.",Biopsychosocial Phenotypes and Potential Mechanisms in CHARTER,10161628,R01MH125720,"['AIDS dementia', 'Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Blood', 'Brain imaging', 'Central Nervous System Diseases', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Cohort Studies', 'Data', 'Data Store', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Encephalitis', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'General Population', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Gut associated lymphoid tissue', 'HIV', 'HIV antiretroviral', 'HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Investments', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Participant', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathology', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Research Priority', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Specimen', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'antiretroviral therapy', 'base', 'biopsychosocial', 'comorbidity', 'daily functioning', 'disease classification', 'effective therapy', 'genome wide association study', 'gut dysbiosis', 'high dimensionality', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging', 'metabolome', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiome analysis', 'multidimensional data', 'neuroAIDS', 'neurobehavioral', 'neurocognitive disorder', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'sex', 'supervised learning', 'unsupervised learning']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2021,708875
"Portable Hearing Laboratory  - CRP In the parent Phase II project (R44DC016247; PI: C. Pavlovic) we successfully developed a portable platform for developing and testing new hearing aid technology. This Portable Hearing Laboratory, or PHL, has now been acquired and is being used by a number of leading university laboratories and other research centers and their feedback has been extremely positive. The device features a central unit (BatAndCat Box) which provides an appropriate and complete hearing aid ambient for developing new algorithms. A number of realistic interfaces has also been provided. This includes an extremely high quality BTE system we designed; an ITE system adapted by us, as well as an appropriate interface circuitry for typical wearables (e.g; headsets via the line input). Finally, a smart phone app features interfaces both for the researcher and the subject. The system runs the Master Hearing aid sweet developed concurrently in R01DC015429 (PIs Hohmann and Pavlovic). In this CRP renewal we will achieve the following goals: 1. Implement various Design for Excellence Measures (DFX) and super modern manufacturing  technology to obtain the highest product quality at the lowest product cost. This would make  the product affordable for large clinical studies and, potentially, for some consumer sales. 2. In response to the recent availability of, and the recent research demand for, a far greater  processing power to enable the development of algorithms which rely on machine learning,  we plan to increase the processing power of the device by at least 10 times, and likely 20  times, by changing the processor core to a multicore system. 3. Introduce modern low-latency BLE technology to enable efﬁcient noise reduction by utilizing  remote microphones and machine learning. 4. The other complementary requirement to extract speech from noise is being able to inform  the system whom the listener is actually listening to. This will be achieved by providing on  the PHL the interface means for external multi-sensor arrays such as EEG, OEG, etc. 5. Execute electrical and mechanical design changes dramatically reducing the size and  weight of the device. This would not only be a much more acceptable device for long clinical  trials, but would also open up a direct-to-consumer, secondary market for the device. 6. It is our strong determination to provide continuous support to the Beta sites for extensive  further testing of the device in a variety of settings. We consider this the best means to  reach the perfection. Portable Hearing Laboratory (PHL), developed in R44DC016247 has been deployed successfully at various research centers and it features a central unit connected to a number of realistic interfaces such as BTEs, ITEs, or typical wearables. In this CRP renewal we upgrade the technology to support demanding machine learning algorithms interfaced almost inconspicuously to a number of EEG and EOG electrodes to extract perfectly speech from noise.

"Identification of Distinct Multimodal Biotypes of PTSD Using Data Driven Approach: A Multisite Big Data Study Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a highly prevalent and debilitating disorder. Despite efforts to characterize the pathophysiology of PTSD and its heterogenity, no objective biomarker have been established to aid in diagnosis, and prediction of treatment response. This K01 presents a program for research and training that will support the applicant on a path towards becoming an independent investigator, focused on utilizing a data-driven computational approach and machine learning techniques to identify multimodal neural biomarkers of PTSD (supervised) and multimodal biotypes of PTSD (unsupervised) and explore whether such biotypes could be used to predict response to prolonged exposure (PE), the first line treatment for PTSD. The training plan builds on the candidate’s prior training and experience and capitalizes on a mentorship team and a research environment to foster development of the candidate’s expertise in 1) the neural and behavioral basis of PTSD and anxiety disorders; 2) multimodal data fusion analysis and latent dimension interpretation with data-driven computational approaches and data reproducibility; and 3) patient-oriented translational research in anxiety disorders. This research project will apply both supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques on multimodal MRI data from the largest existing PTSD dataset (N~3000 from the ENIGMA-PTSD working group). Biotypes identified from this large dataset will then be extended to clinical treatment data. The results of the proposed research will be vital to aid in finding neural biomarkers of PTSD and better predict different treatment outcomes through different biotype targets and will lead to a future R01 grant examining brain-symptoms association across anxiety and trauma-related disorders, and to use the newly identified PTSD biotypes to inform different treatment outcomes in a following R61/33. Together, the research and training experiences and expertise developed through this K01 award will support the applicant’s transition to research independence and ensure the applicant becomes a leading authority in the application of data-driven computational approaches in psychiatry research, and provide the basis for future NIMH grants to explore biotypes from multimodal brain imaging using data-driven computational approaches across anxiety-related disorders. PTSD can occur after a direct or indirect traumatic experience and is a highly prevalent and debilitating disorder. This research project use a big data and data-driven approaches to study the heterogenity of PTSD. In the long term, this line of research will aid in finding neural biomarkers of PTSD and better predict different treatment outcomes through different biotype targets, which will advance the development of effective diagnostics and treatments for PTSD.",Identification of Distinct Multimodal Biotypes of PTSD Using Data Driven Approach: A Multisite Big Data Study,10127376,K01MH122774,"['Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Complex', 'DSM-IV', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Fostering', 'Fright', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurobiology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Prevalence', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychotherapy', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Support', 'Research Training', 'Rest', 'Sample Size', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Subgroup', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Trauma', 'Treatment outcome', 'Work', 'advanced analytics', 'anxiety-related disorders', 'associated symptom', 'authority', 'base', 'clinical heterogeneity', 'clinical phenotype', 'comorbidity', 'data fusion', 'design', 'experience', 'gray matter', 'individualized medicine', 'large datasets', 'memory process', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'patient oriented', 'predicting response', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'reward processing', 'skills', 'supervised learning', 'therapy development', 'trauma exposure', 'treatment comparison', 'treatment research', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'unsupervised learning', 'working group']",NIMH,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,K01,2021,176916
"An Autonomous, Non-invasive, and Bioanalytics-enabled Wearable Platform for Precision Nutrition and Personalized Medicine Project Summary  This proposal aims to enable precision nutrition by creating a wearable technology that can be scaled across the general population to non-invasively track the diurnal profiles of a panel of putative circulating nutrients and biomarkers. Accordingly, we will address fundamental and intermeshed engineering bottlenecks and scientific questions at sensor, device, and data analytics levels to realize a sweat-based wearable bioanalytical technology, equipped with autonomous sweat secretion modulation, biofluid management, and analysis capabilities. To illustrate our technology’s transformative potential, we will particularly position it to monitor a panel of nutrients and indicators of the metabolic and disease state that are relevant in cystic fibrosis (CF, the most common inherited multisystemic disorder), in order to enable individualized nutritional support, which is central to the CF treatment.  Accordingly, in the first phase (R21), we will develop microsensor arrays targeting glucose, triglyceride, and β- hydroxybutyrate. We will incorporate our readily developed auxiliary sensing modalities (sweat sodium, chloride, pH, and sweat secretion rate sensing interfaces) to enable the in-situ characterization of the secretion profile (which is useful for the normalization of sweat readings and tracking of the CF progression). In parallel to these engineering efforts, we will conduct sweat characterization experiments to study the effect of the secretion rate on analyte partitioning from blood into sweat. These datasets will be augmented with state-of-art machine learning algorithms to formulate a dedicated analytical framework that accounts for sweat secretion variabilities and determines optimal sweat secretion condition(s) to provide undistorted and physiologically meaningful sweat readings.  In the second phase (R33), we will establish the clinical utility of our technology by demonstrating the ability to non-invasively track the target nutrients’ temporal profiles in relation to their circulating levels in blood (in both healthy subjects and CF patients and through simple/mixed meal-modulated studies). Accordingly, we will first measure the sweat and blood analytes’ excursion profiles after controlled single/binary combinations of nutrients intake and develop a machine-learning based algorithm to correlate the sweat analyte readouts to their circulating concentrations. Then we will assess and characterize the predictive utility of our solution in the context of complex nutritional supplement studies. Upon its validation, we will recruit a cohort of CF patients and perform a longitudinal randomized nutritional support study to demonstrate the enabling remote patient monitoring capabilities rendered by our solution.  The success of this work will represent a groundbreaking contribution towards the development of strategies to enable precision nutrition and personalized medicine. Project Narrative This proposal aims to enable precision nutrition by creating a wearable sweat bioanalytical technology— equipped with autonomous sweat secretion modulation, biofluid management, and analysis capabilities—that can be scaled across the general population to non-invasively track the diurnal profiles of a panel of putative circulating nutrients and biomarkers. By deploying this technology in clinical studies (with a particular focus on cystic fibrosis, the most common inherited multisystemic disorder), we will study and establish the correlation of the sweat readings to the circulating analytes and in response to nutritional interventions. This technology will provide a comprehensive and physiologically rich view of the individuals’ well-being/disease and nutritional status, rendering a personalized solution for effective treatment and nutritional support.","An Autonomous, Non-invasive, and Bioanalytics-enabled Wearable Platform for Precision Nutrition and Personalized Medicine",10198604,R21DK128711,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Engineering', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Cystic Fibrosis', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Engineering', 'General Population', 'Glucose', 'Health', 'Hour', 'In Situ', 'Individual', 'Influentials', 'Inherited', 'Intake', 'Iontophoresis', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Methodology', 'Microfluidics', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Nutrient', 'Nutritional Support', 'Nutritional status', 'Periodicity', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Randomized', 'Reading', 'Sampling', 'Sodium Chloride', 'Study Subject', 'Sweat Glands', 'Sweat test', 'System', 'Technology', 'Triglycerides', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'beta-Hydroxybutyrate', 'cofactor', 'cohort', 'cystic fibrosis patients', 'dietary supplements', 'effective therapy', 'experimental study', 'human subject', 'machine learning algorithm', 'microsensor', 'multidisciplinary', 'operation', 'personalized medicine', 'precision nutrition', 'predictive modeling', 'recruit', 'remote patient monitoring', 'response', 'sensor', 'success', 'targeted biomarker', 'wearable device']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R21,2021,210796
"Dissecting drug resistance in serial uveal melanoma biopsies using integrated, multi-modal single-cell profiling and novel machine learning tools. PROJECT SUMMARY Uveal melanoma (UM) is a rare melanoma subtype with an estimated annual incidence of approximately 2000 in the United States. While most patients have excellent rates of local disease control with surgery or radiotherapy, nearly half develop metastatic disease, most frequently to the liver. Metastatic UM (MUM) is very treatment resistant and shows no significant responses to conventional chemotherapies or immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI). UM is molecularly characterized by canonical mutations of the Gα protein subunits (GNAQ/11), which result in hyperactivation of the MAPK pathway. Targeting this pathway with MEK inhibitors (MEKi) results in significant anti-tumor activity in vitro, and response rates of up to 14% in patients with MUM, thereby exhibiting significantly higher activity compared to other available systemic therapies. However, there remains significant potential to improve the efficacy of MEKi. To better define modifiers of MEKi sensitivity and resistance, it is important to consider the fact that most UM harbor mutually exclusive GNAQ/11co-mutations, including inactivating mutations or bi-allelic loss of BAP1 (~33%) or deleterious mutations in SF3B1 (~23%) or EIF1AX (13%), thus define distinct genomic subtypes of UM. These alterations likely provide dependencies that are not abrogated with MEKi alone, yet they may represent synthetic lethal vulnerabilities in the context of MEKi. Furthermore, there has not been a systematic evaluation of how MEKi (or any other therapy) alters cancer cell autonomous and cell non-autonomous mechanisms that could confer drug resistance. This is in part due to technical barriers and lack of in vivo models that faithfully recapitulate human MUM. In this proposal, we build on several innovations to systematically determine the impact of MEKi on the MUM ecosystem and define synthetic lethal dependencies across the UM genomic landscape and in the context of MEKi. We will achieve this in two specifim aims: In Aim 1, we will perform single-nuclei RNA-sequencing (snRNA-seq) in patients with MUM who underwent therapy with MEKi selumetinib and had serial biopsies (pre-, on- and off-therapy), and analyze these with several established analytical methods. Second, building on recent developments, we will build machine learning tools for the analysis of sequential single-cell data sets. In Aim 2, we will perform patient- informed CRISPR-screens with multi-modal single-cell RNA/protein readouts across the genomic spectrum of UM. Finally, we will perform genome-scale CRISPR-screens across multiple models to define genotype-shared and -unique modifiers of MEKi responses. Together, these approaches will provide the a comprehensive sequential single-cell analysis in solid tumors, develop tools for temporal single-cell analyses that can be referenced against a ground truth, and define genotype-dependent synthetic lethal vulnerabilities with concurrent MEKi therapy. PROJECT NARRATIVE Uveal melanoma (UM) is a rare form of melanoma that metastasizes in 50% of affected patients, which is associated with treatment resistance poor survival. There is currently no Food-and-Drug-Administration (FDA)- approved therapy for patients with metastatic UM, but MEK inhibitors (MEKi) are promising. Here, we will use a broad spectrum of single-cell genomic, genome-editing and machine-learning tools to define drug resistance to MEKi and potential synthetic lethal vulnerabilities across the distinct genomic landscape of UM.","Dissecting drug resistance in serial uveal melanoma biopsies using integrated, multi-modal single-cell profiling and novel machine learning tools.",10290692,R21CA263381,"['Affect', 'BRCA1 gene', 'Biopsy', 'CRISPR screen', 'Caring', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cues', 'Cutaneous', 'DNA Damage', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Targeting', 'Drug resistance', 'Ecosystem', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Freezing', 'GNAQ gene', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Immune checkpoint inhibitor', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Liver', 'Loss of Heterozygosity', 'MAP Kinase Gene', 'MAPK Signaling Pathway Pathway', 'MEKs', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Melanoma Cell', 'Metastatic Melanoma', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Protein Subunits', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'RNA Splicing', 'Radiation therapy', 'Resistance', 'Small Nuclear RNA', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'Specimen', 'Systemic Therapy', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Translations', 'United States', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Uveal Melanoma', 'analytical method', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'chemotherapy', 'combinatorial', 'disorder control', 'experience', 'genome editing', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'in vitro activity', 'in vivo Model', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'loss of function', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'melanoma', 'molecular subtypes', 'multimodality', 'mutational status', 'novel', 'preclinical study', 'prospective', 'resistance mechanism', 'response', 'single cell analysis', 'therapy resistant', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'tumor']",NCI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R21,2021,189338
"Statistical Unsupervised Learning VF for IIHTT & ONTT Summary Current assessments of visual field testing depend on algorithms, principally developed to diagnose and monitor progression in glaucoma, or on expert descriptive categorization of deficits. The algorithms do not work well for non-glaucomatous optic neuropathies as these disorders can both improve and deteriorate. Descriptive categorizations are not readily quantifiable to assess change over time. Unsupervised statistical learning archetypal analysis is a new way to investigate glaucoma and potentially other optic neuropathies. Both idiopathic intracranial hypertension and optic neuritis are disorders that often improve and respond to therapy. Archetypal analysis of the visual fields from two NEI sponsored clinical trials on each disorder, ONTT and IIHTT, will be investigated to determine if the findings parallel the reported outcomes and effects of therapy. We will also test whether machine learning quantifiable archetypes, which are disease-associated patterns of field deficits, are similar to expert determinations, whether they are sensitive to changes in optic nerve function, and if they reveal residual optic nerve dysfunction in eyes reported to be normal by prior study criteria. Adding cases of IIH and optic neuritis from the clinic will enhance the archetypes for each disorder for use in the clinic and new studies. Narrative Analysis of the visual fields of patients with optic neuropathies using machine learning will improve the evaluation and provide objective measurement, rather than the current descriptive methods. The approach, called archetypal analysis, should improve safety monitoring during clinical trials as well as uncover residual visual field deficits not seen with other types of analyses.",Statistical Unsupervised Learning VF for IIHTT & ONTT,10192112,R21EY032522,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Clinic', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cost Savings', 'Detection', 'Deterioration', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Eye', 'Face', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Glaucoma', 'Head', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Masks', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Military Personnel', 'Monitor', 'Optic Nerve', 'Optic Neuritis', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Papilledema', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perimetry', 'Physiologic Intraocular Pressure', 'Pseudotumor Cerebri', 'Reader', 'Reporting', 'Residual state', 'Safety', 'Shapes', 'Supervision', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Vision', 'Visit', 'Visual Fields', 'Weight', 'archetypal analysis', 'base', 'central visual field', 'clinical practice', 'eligible participant', 'field study', 'improved', 'longitudinal analysis', 'optic nerve disorder', 'prospective', 'response', 'statistical learning', 'successful intervention', 'treatment effect', 'treatment trial', 'trend', 'unsupervised learning']",NEI,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R21,2021,331170
"The Detection, Quantification, and Management of Ventilator Dyssynchrony Project Summary/Abstract Despite significant advances in ventilator management, mortality from the acute respiratory distress syn- drome (ARDS) remains unacceptably high. Mechanical ventilation with large tidal volume, high pressure ven- tilation, and repeated alveolar collapse can injure the lung, called ventilator induced lung injury (VILI). Defined as the inappropriate timing and delivery of a breath in response to a patient effort, ventilator dyssynchrony (VD) may potentiate VILI. This proposal outlines a 5-year training programing including mentoring, formal didactics, and practical research experiences which positions Dr. Sottile for a successful clinical research career examining ventilator dyssynchrony (VD), its impact on ventilator induced lung injury (VILI), and its optimal management. An integrated curriculum will optimize an automated VD detection algorithm, delineate which types of VD are deleterious, and determine the ideal ventilator and sedation strategies to minimize VD and improve patient outcomes. This experience will provide Dr. Sottile with the necessary tools to be a leader in signal analysis, ventilator dyssynchrony, advanced mathematical modeling, and critical care research. This program will consist of formal mentoring from four renowned experts in machine learning, mechanical ventilation, critical care research, and modeling of dynamic systems. In addition, coursework in clinical sciences, machine learning, and advanced mathematical modeling will build the theoretical foundation to apply these techniques. This structured curriculum will help Dr. Sottile gain expertise in the computerized detection of VD from real-time ventilator data, the pathophysiology of VD, and the modeling of complex, temporally dynamic, biological systems. The formal curriculum will coincide with three practical experiences. First, Dr. Sottile will optimize his already developed VD identification algorithm to detect additional types of VD that may be injurious to the lung. Second, he will identify which types of VD are associated with deleterious ventilator mechanics. Finally, he will deter- mine the personalized ventilator and sedation strategies to minimize VD, VILI, and the negative consequences of over sedation using linear optimization and lagged linear correlation to account for the dynamic nature of patient physiology. The result of the proposed studies will develop a computerized algorithm to detect seven types of VD, identify which types of VD are most likely to propagate VILI, and determine the optimal ventilator and sedation strategies to improve individual patient outcomes. This will leave Dr. Sottile and the study team positioned to conduct a randomized clinical trial comparing computer-predicted individualized ventilator and se- dation strategies compared to the current standard of care. If successful, this will potentially to revolutionize the use of mechanical ventilation by tailoring evidenced-based therapies to the individual patient. Project Narrative Despite over 50 years of research, the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) accounts of over 10% of ICU admissions. Despite current treatment strategies focused on reducing ventilator induced lung injury through low tidal volume ventilation or prone position, mortality remains over 30%. This proposal seeks to understand how patient-ventilator interactions may propagate lung injury and will determine optimal treatment strategies to improve patient- ventilator interactions, decrease lung injury, and improve patient outcomes.","The Detection, Quantification, and Management of Ventilator Dyssynchrony",10080102,K23HL145011,"['Accounting', 'Admission activity', 'Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Algorithms', 'Alveolar', 'Biological Markers', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Dysbarism', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Endothelium', 'Epithelial', 'Esophagus', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Individual', 'Induction of neuromuscular blockade', 'Injury', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Manometry', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Mechanics', 'Mentors', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Physiology', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prone Position', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sedation procedure', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'Surrogate Markers', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Tidal Volume', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'Training Programs', 'Ventilator', 'Ventilator-induced lung injury', 'biological systems', 'career', 'computerized', 'dynamic system', 'esophagus pressure', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'interest', 'lung injury', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mathematical model', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'optimal treatments', 'personalized predictions', 'personalized strategies', 'pressure', 'programs', 'response', 'standard of care', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'trial comparing', 'ventilation']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,K23,2021,169654
"Selection of Flow Modulation Protocols for Patients on Continuous Flow Ventricular Assist Devices (CF-VADs) PROJECT SUMMARY A major concern with continuous flow ventricular assist devices (CF-VADs) is the resulting non-physiological flow with diminished pulsatility which has been shown to be a major risk factor for development of arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) and gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. To address this issue, flow modulation via rapid changes in pump impeller speed has been proposed as a technique to introduce ‘artificial pulsatility’. However, given the inadequacy of large animal models with recreating CF-VAD associated non-surgical bleeding events, it is still unclear if artificial pulsatility can prevent these adverse events or what level of artificial pulsatility is even necessary. To evaluate the effects of pulsatility and identify promising flow modulation approaches we developed a vascular pulse perfusion model (VPPM) to culture Human Aortic Endothelial Cells (HAECs) under conditions of normal pulsatile flow or flow with diminished pulsatility (CF-VAD support). Our rationale for modeling arterial vessels is because pulsatility primarily affects the arterial side of the circulatory system and its effects are transduced by endothelial cells that line the large arterial vessels. The VPPM was validated as relevant model via direct comparison with aortic samples of patients with and without CF-VADs. Our published data also shows that loss of pulsatility is associated with an increase in production of pro-angiogenic/inflammatory cytokines. The relevance of these results is further strengthened by supporting data from patients that experience AVMs and GI bleeding events (both CF-VAD related and due to other conditions) showing similar elevated levels of pro- angiogenic/inflammatory cytokines. The VPPM therefore provides a powerful model to evaluate artificial pulsatility in the context of CF-VAD flow modulation and determine if restoring pulse pressure and/or pulse frequency can mitigate non-surgical bleeding events. Based on recent studies that suggest that pulse pressure < 35 mmHg is a major risk factor for development of GI bleeds, we hypothesize that “Diminished pulsatility associated with ‘CF-VAD support’ results in endothelial dysfunction and pro-inflammatory/pro-angiogenic soluble factor production. These changes can be mitigated via introduction of artificial pulsatility using flow modulation strategies where pulse pressure is preserved at > 35 mmHg”. Aim1 will evaluate response of patient derived endothelial cells within the VPPM to CF-VAD flow and quantify angiogenic/inflammatory soluble factor production, Aim2 will follow patients for up to 36 months to evaluate serum levels of pro-angiogenic/pro- inflammatory cytokines and non-surgical bleeding events which will then be compared to results from in-vitro studies within the VPPM and Aim3 will evaluate different flow modulation strategies using patient-derived endothelial cells to determine most promising patient-specific approaches via comparison of hemodynamic profiles and cytokine biomarkers using deep learning approaches. Successful completion of this project will enable identification of device-based strategies to prevent non-surgical bleeding in patients on CF-VAD support. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project seeks to determine the effects of diminished pulsatility during continuous flow ventricular assist device (CF-VAD) support on human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs). Changes in production of pro- angiogenic/pro-inflammatory cytokines will be used as biomarkers to evaluate the effects of loss of pulsatility and help validate new approaches to introduce artificial pulsatility in CF-VADs.",Selection of Flow Modulation Protocols for Patients on Continuous Flow Ventricular Assist Devices (CF-VADs),10116660,R01HL151663,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Age-Years', 'Aging', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Antioxidants', 'Arteriovenous malformation', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood specimen', 'Brain hemorrhage', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Endothelin-1', 'Endothelium', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Gastrointestinal Hemorrhage', 'Heart failure', 'Hemorrhage', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Production', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'Pulsatile Flow', 'Pulse Pressure', 'Pump', 'Quality of life', 'Quantitative Evaluations', 'Refractory', 'Regulation', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Sheep', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speed', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Transducers', 'Translating', 'VWF gene', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'cytokine', 'deep learning', 'endothelial dysfunction', 'experience', 'gastrointestinal', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'novel strategies', 'operation', 'patient response', 'preservation', 'pressure', 'prevent', 'response', 'safety testing', 'ventricular assist device']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,R01,2021,535547
"q4DE: A Biomarker for Image-Guided, Post-MI Hydrogel Therapy Project Summary/Abstract  Ischemic heart disease remains the top cause of death in the world. Acute myocardial infarction (MI) causes regional dysfunction which places remote areas of the heart at a mechanical disadvantage resulting in long term adverse left ventricular (LV) remodeling and complicating congestive heart failure (CHF). The course of MI and post-MI remodeling is complex and includes vascular and myocellular injury, acute and chronic inflammation, alterations of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and angiogenesis. Stress echocardiography is a clinically established, cost-effective technique for detecting and characterizing coronary artery disease and myocardial injury by imaging the LV at rest and after either exercise or pharmacologically-induced stress to reveal ischemia and/or scar. In our previous effort on this project, we developed quantitative 3D differential deformation measures for stress echocardiography from 4DE-derived LV strain maps taken at rest and after dobutamine stress. These measures can localize and quantify the extent and severity of LV myocardial injury and reveal ischemic regions. We now propose that improved versions of these same measures can be used for both targeting of therapy and outcomes assessment in the treatment of adverse local myocardial remodeling following MI. We choose a particular up and coming therapeutic strategy as an exemplar: the local delivery of injectable hydrogels within the MI region that are intended to alter the biomechanical properties of the LV myocardium, as well as inflammation, and thereby help to minimize adverse remodeling. Our new, robust approach for estimating improved dense displacement and differential deformation measures is based on an innovative data-driven, deep feed-forward, neural network architecture that employs domain adaptation between data from labeled, carefully-constructed synthetic models of physiology and echocardiographic image formation (i.e. with ground truth), and data from unlabeled noisy in vivo porcine or human echocardiography (missing or very limited ground truth). Training is based on tens of thousands of four-dimensional (4D) image-derived patches from these two domains, initially based on displacements derived separately from shape-based processing of conventional B-mode data and block-mode, speckle-tracked processing of raw radio-frequency (RF) data; and later based on learning directly from B-mode and RF image intensity information. After non-rigid registration of rest and stress 4DE image sequences, quantitative 4D differential deformation parameters will be derived from porcine and human echocardiographic test data. These parameters will be derived at baseline, and at several timepoints after delivery of injectable hydrogels into the MI region. The ability of the differential deformation parameters derived from 4D stress echocardiography to guide local delivery of injectable hydrogels in a MI region and assess/predict outcomes will then be determined in a hybrid acute/chronic porcine model of MI and post-MI remodeling. The technique will be translated to humans and evaluated by measuring the reproducibility and the relationship to remodeling of our new robust, deep learning-based differential deformation parameters in a small cohort of subjects. Project Narrative  At the core of the proposed effort is the development and evaluation of novel 4D (three spatial dimensions over time) echocardiographic imaging, image analysis, and machine learning methods that will enable the accurate and robust quantification of changes in myocardial deformation due to stress. Our methods will use this information to guide delivery and assess outcome of a promising new therapy to improve the biomechanical properties of the heart after myocardial injury based on injectable hydrogels.","q4DE: A Biomarker for Image-Guided, Post-MI Hydrogel Therapy",10139080,R01HL121226,"['3-Dimensional', '4D Imaging', 'Acute', 'Acute myocardial infarction', 'Area', 'Autopsy', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomechanics', 'Blood Vessels', 'Canis familiaris', 'Cardiac', 'Cause of Death', 'Chronic', 'Cicatrix', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Congestive Heart Failure', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Defect', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disadvantaged', 'Dobutamine', 'Echocardiography', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Exercise', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Family suidae', 'Four-Dimensional Echocardiography', 'Four-dimensional', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Heart', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Hydrogels', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Infarction', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Injectable', 'Injections', 'Injury', 'Intelligence', 'Ischemia', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Left Ventricular Remodeling', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase Inhibitor', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Motion', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Myocardial Ischemia', 'Myocardial tissue', 'Myocardium', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Assessment', 'Patients', 'Pharmacology', 'Physiology', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Property', 'Recombinants', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Source', 'Stains', 'Stress', 'Stress Echocardiography', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Treatment outcome', 'Ultrasonography', 'Ventricular', 'Ventricular Remodeling', 'Work', 'angiogenesis', 'base', 'cohort', 'cone-beam computed tomography', 'cost effective', 'deep learning', 'feedforward neural network', 'heart imaging', 'human subject', 'image guided', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'myocardial injury', 'neural network', 'neural network architecture', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome prediction', 'precision medicine', 'predicting response', 'prevent', 'radio frequency', 'spatiotemporal', 'synthetic construct', 'targeted treatment', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy']",NHLBI,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,790095
"Accounting for Hidden Bias in Vaccine Studies: A Negative Control Framework Project Summary / Abstract The proposed research aims to develop novel causal inference methods to resolve unmeasured confounding bias known to plague vaccine effectiveness and safety studies by leveraging so-called negative control variables widely available in vaccine studies. A negative control outcome is a variable known not to be causally affected by the treatment of interest, while a negative control exposure is a variable known not to causally affect the outcome of interest. Both share a common confounding mechanism as the exposure-outcome pair of primary interest. Examples of negative controls abound in vaccine studies. Such known-null effects form the basis of falsiﬁca- tion strategy to detect unmeasured confounding, however little is known about when and how negative controls can be used to resolve unmeasured confounding bias. We plan to develop principled negative control methods for identiﬁcation and semiparametric estimation of causal effects in the presence of unmeasured confounding, incorporating modern highly adaptive machine learning methods. We also plan to develop negative control meth- ods to detect and quantify causal effects in complex longitudinal and survival settings critical to vaccine studies using routinely collected healthcare data. Finally we plan to apply the proposed methods to evaluate vaccine effectiveness using data collected from a pioneering test-negative design platform and to monitor vaccine safety using electronic health record data. Successful completion of the proposed research will equip investigators with paradigm-shifting methods to unlock the full potential of contemporary healthcare data, encourage investigators to routinely check for evidence of confounding bias, and ultimately improve the validity of scientiﬁc research.

"An enhancement to nGoggle: a VR Goggle for Structural and Functional assessment in Glaucoma PROJECT SUMMARY  Assessments of functional loss and of structural damage to the optic nerve are typical evaluations per- formed in the diagnosis and monitoring of glaucoma. This proposal aims at developing the hardware system that will allow acquisition of fundus photographs using the nGoggle, a portable Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) which integrates a wearable, wireless, electroencephalogram (EEG) system and a head-mounted display to monitor electrical brain activities associated with visual field stimulation. In a previous project, we developed the nGoggle portable system for the assessment of visual function deficits in order to address limitations of standard automated perimetry (SAP), a traditional but subjective visual field test. We compared the diagnostic accuracies of the nGoggle and SAP in discriminating patients with glaucoma from healthy subjects and found that the BCI performed at least as well, if not better than SAP, with the additional advantage of portability and objectivity.  With rapid advancements in smartphone cameras, it is now possible to develop compact auto-focusing fundus cameras and integrate them into our neuro-monitoring nGoggle. Recently we developed an approach named Machine-to-Machine (M2M), a deep learning algorithm that was trained to analyze fundus photos and predict quantitative measurements of retinal nerve fiber layer thickness and neuroretinal rim provided by spectral domain-optical coherence tomography (SDOCT), with high correlation and agreement with the original SDOCT observations. This approach opens up the possibility of using simple fundus photographs to extract quantitative information about neural damage in glaucoma. By combining functional assessment currently provided by the nGoggle with structural assessment capability, this new system would result in a very unique device capable of portable structural and functional assessment of optic nerve damage for a multitude of eye conditions, not limited to glaucoma, such as age-related macular degeneration, retinal degenerations and non-glaucomatous optic neu- ropathies.  The specific aims of this Phase I SBIR project are (1) to incorporate a high-resolution auto-focusing fundus camera to the nGoggle head-mounted display in full compliance with ophthalmic instrument safety stand- ards and fundus camera functional standards, and (2) to demonstrate the ability of the nGoggle fundus camera to capture high-quality optical nerve images from a model eye. Successful development of this system will enable both structural and functional assessments of retinal conditions to be performed easily and inexpensively using a portable device. PROJECT NARRATIVE NGoggle Inc. proposes to develop a new wearable ophthalmic diagnostic instrument capable of performing con- current structural and functional assessment to diagnose and monitor optic neuropathies and retinal diseases. This project aims at developing a pair of compact high-resolution fundus cameras in full compliance with oph- thalmic instrument safety standards and integrating them into our neuro-monitoring nGoggle, an instrument with the demonstrated capability of estimating functional vision loss in glaucoma patients based on their electroen- cephalogram (EEG) responses evoked by visual stimuli. We also intend to demonstrate that the optic nerve images of model eyes taken by the integrated fundus cameras can yield consistent and compatible cup-to-disc ratios when compared with the measurements obtained from the same model eyes using optical coherence tomography (OCT).

"Neural Biomarkers of ECT Response in Schizophrenia PROJECT SUMMARY This is an application for an NIMH Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) entitled ""Neural Biomarkers of ECT Response in Schizophrenia."" In this application, Dr. Miklos Argyelan proposes a comprehensive plan for transitioning into an independent translational researcher focused on understanding the neural mechanisms of treatment response in schizophrenia by integrating functional neuroimaging with neuromodulatory bioelectric treatment approaches. Despite its effectiveness and intensive research, the mechanism of action for ECT remains unknown, and currently no clinical or biological biomarkers exist to predict response. In patients with schizophrenia undergoing a trial of ECT (with bitemporal electrode placement), the proposed study will use resting-state functional MRI, as well as electrical field modeling as applied to structural MRI scans, to examine the neural circuitry underlying clinical response. Patients will undergo MRI scanning at baseline, and after the 8th ECT treatment. Results of this proposal may lead to biomarkers that will optimize treatment algorithms for schizophrenia with higher efficacy. Identifying target mechanisms would not only improve the current deployment of bioelectric approaches as part of a “precision medicine” approach, but could also lead to the development of novel therapies. This line of research will be conducted under the guidance of mentors who are recognized experts in the biomarker research of schizophrenia (Anil K. Malhotra, M.D.), neuromodulation (Georgios Petrides, M.D., Marom Bikson Ph.D.), neuroimaging of ECT (Chris Abbott, M.D.) and analyzing high dimensional datasets (Jing Sui, PhD.). Concurrently, Dr Argyelan will engage in a comprehensive training program which is fully integrated with the research study in the proposal. The training plan contains three domains with corresponding goals: (1) to gain further expertise in designing and conducting clinical trials in schizophrenia, (2) to expand my knowledge in machine learning algorithms, and (3) to learn more about electrical field (EF) modeling techniques. The combination of training in clinical trials, machine learning and neuromodulation will support the planned research to provide the framework to explore and validate biomarkers of disease and treatment response. The culmination of these training activities, combined with the planned research aims under this award, will prepare Dr. Argyelan to develop into an independent translational researcher and to submit a planned R01 in personalized neuromodulation. PROJECT NARRATIVE Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) has been consistently shown to be an effective augmentation strategy in the treatment of schizophrenia, however its mechanism of action remains unknown, and there are no clinical or biological predictors to predict response. The overall goal of this K23 proposal is to examine the functional neural circuitry that underlies successful treatment with ECT, which may lead to the identification of biomarkers that will allow for more efficient use of ECT, as well as additional treatment targets for patients with refractory illness. Simultaneously, this proposal will develop the career of the Principal Investigator, Miklos Argyelan, M.D., as an independent translational researcher.",Neural Biomarkers of ECT Response in Schizophrenia,10119330,K23MH120504,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Area', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Caring', 'Chronic Schizophrenia', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Conduct Clinical Trials', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Effectiveness', 'Electroconvulsive Therapy', 'Electrodes', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Globus Pallidus', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurobiology', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Principal Investigator', 'Refractory', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Therapeutic Studies', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Training Programs', 'Work', 'base', 'bioelectricity', 'biomarker identification', 'career', 'cingulate cortex', 'clinical efficacy', 'clinical practice', 'clinical predictors', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'electric field', 'experience', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'machine learning algorithm', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'neuromechanism', 'neuroregulation', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome forecast', 'precision medicine', 'predicting response', 'predictive marker', 'prognostic', 'prognostic tool', 'prospective', 'psychotic symptoms', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'translational scientist', 'treatment optimization', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy']",NIMH,FEINSTEIN INSTITUTE FOR MEDICAL RESEARCH,K23,2021,195480
"Biomedical Raman Imaging Workshop Summary The purpose of the planned conference is to facilitate development of Raman-spectroscopy based clinical appli- cations.  Raman scattering provides label-free contrast for imaging that derives from intrinsic molecular vibrations. Because it is label-free and reports in an unbiased way on all molecular species in a sample, it provides a holistic “view” of the chemical environment in clinical samples, and thus holds signiﬁcant value as a diagnostic and treatment monitoring tool.  While the phenomenon of Raman scattering has been known since 1920, and its clinical potential has been recognized for many decades, roadblocks including weak signal levels and complexity of its readout has precluded it from clinical use. These roadblocks are now being removed through innovations in instrument development and machine learning. Narrative Raman spectroscopy provides diagnostically important chemical proﬁles of clinical samples, withouth the need of labeling. Throgh this it holds tremendous potential to improve many diagnostic and monitoring aspects of healthcare. The purpose of this workshop is to facilitate efﬁcient development of these techniques in a way that will be clinically acceptable.",Biomedical Raman Imaging Workshop,10318774,R13EB032251,"['Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Antibiotic susceptibility', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Caring', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Device or Instrument Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Educational workshop', 'Environment', 'Excision', 'Fingerprint', 'Fruit', 'Generations', 'Healthcare', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging technology', 'In Situ', 'Label', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Paper', 'Pathogen detection', 'Photons', 'Physicians', 'Publishing', 'Raman Spectrum Analysis', 'Reporting', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Signal Transduction', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Voice', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'contrast imaging', 'imaging approach', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'liquid biopsy', 'screening', 'symposium', 'technique development', 'technology development', 'tool', 'tumor', 'vibration']",NIBIB,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R13,2021,9996
"Public Insurance Design and Health at Older Ages PROJECT ABSTRACT Health insurance has been at the forefront of US public policy debate throughout the last decade. For elderly Americans, who benefit from nearly universal coverage under Medicare, decisions about the scope of their insurance coverage have been a central policy concern since Medicare’s inception in 1965. Medicare’s coverage is extensive, but by statute the program only covers medical services that are “reasonable and necessary,” which can be a controversial definition. Some decisions about what Medicare should cover have engendered intense debate, underscoring the importance of the program’s coverage decisions for millions of patients and doctors. The debate around the scope of Medicare coverage is likely to intensify in the coming decades as options for medical treatment, and testing, expand rapidly, the population ages, and public insurance systems grapple with how to address inequality in access to medical innovations. Yet, despite the importance of decisions about the scope of insurance coverage in and outside of Medicare, we know little about how the scope of coverage (as opposed to patient cost-sharing), affects treatment choices, clinical practice, and health outcomes for the elderly. The research outlined in this proposal aims to start filling this gap. The project investigates how the presence or lack of insurance coverage for specific procedural or pharmacologic therapies affects treatment decisions and health outcomes for the elderly with Alzheimer’s Disease and related Dementias (ADRD). This is a population that may be particularly vulnerable to changes and limits in insurance coverage, as the patients may have limited decision-making capacity and may be disproportionately exposed to treatments that are deemed experimental and lacking effectiveness to clear the “reasonable and necessary” threshold. Aim 1 of the project is to estimate the average effect of coverage decisions across prescription drugs and outpatient procedures on treatment decisions and health outcomes of elderly Medicare enrollees with ADRD. Aim 2 is to predict and characterize the subgroups of ADRD patients that are most likely to be affected by decisions that restrict the scope of insurance coverage using machine learning methods. The proposed empirical method is to use quasi- experimental variation that arises from natural experiments of abrupt changes in insurance coverage within different parts of the Medicare program. The analysis takes advantage of variation in the scope of formularies across Medicare Part D plans, as well as the variation in local coverage decisions for physician services and outpatient procedures under Medicare Part B. These sources of variation coupled with methods for quasi- experimental estimation of treatment effects and machine learning methods for heterogeneity analyses, allow estimating the response of treatment decisions and health of the elderly with ADRD across different drugs, procedures, and subgroups of ADRD patients. PROJECT NARRATIVE For elderly Americans, who benefit from nearly universal coverage under Medicare, decisions about the scope of their insurance coverage have been a central policy concern since Medicare’s inception in 1965 - Medicare’s coverage is extensive, but nevertheless incomplete as by statute the program only covers medical services that are “reasonable and necessary,” which can be hard to define. The debate around the scope of Medicare coverage is likely to intensify in the coming decades as options for medical treatment, and testing, expand rapidly, the population ages, and public insurance systems grapple with how to address inequality in access to medical innovations. In this project I investigate how changes in coverage for prescription drugs, physician office visits, and outpatient procedures affect the treatment received by elderly patients with Alzheimer’s Disease and related dementias (ADRD), who often face coverage limitations due to experimental nature of many ADRD treatments, and yet may be most vulnerable to unintended consequences of any coverage restrictions.",Public Insurance Design and Health at Older Ages,10137860,K01AG059843,"['Address', 'Admission activity', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'American', 'Amyloid', 'Anxiety', 'Barbiturates', 'Benzodiazepines', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Cost Sharing', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Drug Targeting', 'Economics', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Family Physicians', 'Formularies', 'Fracture', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Geriatrics', 'Gerontology', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Health Insurance', 'Heart', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'Inequality', 'Insurance', 'Insurance Coverage', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Learning Skill', 'Length of Stay', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicare', 'Medicare Part B', 'Mental Depression', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Movement', 'Natural experiment', 'Nature', 'Office Visits', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Outpatients', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Physicians', 'Policies', 'Policy Maker', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Procedures', 'Public Policy', 'Quasi-experiment', 'Race', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Services', 'Skilled Nursing Facilities', 'Source', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic procedure', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universal Coverage', 'Variant', 'aging population', 'alternative treatment', 'bariatric surgery', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'comorbidity', 'decision-making capacity', 'design', 'experience', 'high dimensionality', 'innovation', 'insurance claims', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'older patient', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'public health insurance', 'response', 'socioeconomics', 'theories', 'tool', 'treatment choice', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response']",NIA,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K01,2021,126700
"The Dynamics of Human Atrial Fibrillation Project Summary  Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a major arrhythmia worldwide, causing palpitations, stroke and mortality, and affecting 2-5 million Americans. Unfortunately, therapy to eliminate AF has had limited success. In our last funding cycle, we focused on localized drivers as potential AF mechanisms. Mapping of drivers has now been validated by concurrent optical mapping of human AF, and their features and have been validated by several other methods in patients. Nevertheless, ablation results for these and other proposed mechanisms for AF outside the pulmonary veins are mixed. It is unclear if this reflects difficulties of AF mapping, or different mechanisms between patients.  The project will develop a novel mechanistic framework for AF that simplifies existing indices by building on scientific consensus that organized AF is easier to treat, and disorganized AF has worse prognosis. This concept spans many existing indices and may help to reconcile them. We have 3 specific aims: (1) To define if the impact of ablation depends on the extent of organizing surrounding the ablation site; (2) To establish candidate mechanisms for organized and disorganized AF zones in individual patients with specific profiles, using machine learning applied to known cases with and without ablation success in our large registry. This comprises detailed AF maps during ablation and after Maze surgery, clinical data and outcomes. (3) To use novel clinical tools to predict whether patients will respond to PVI, other ablation or Maze surgery based on whether targeted regions control larger atrial areas and their locations.  This study will deliver immediate translational and clinical impact, and directly enable personalized medicine for AF ablation. We use detailed clinical mapping in patients, signal processing and computer modeling to develop a novel mechanistic framework and widely applicable clinical tools. We will use tools including machine learning and statistics to classify mechanisms based upon outcomes from ablation in individual patients. We will make our data and code available online. Our team is experienced in electrophysiology, computer science, machine learning, biological physics and statistics. The proposal is thus highly feasible. The Dynamics of Human Atrial Fibrillation Narrative Atrial fibrillation (AF) is an enormous public health problem in the United States, affecting 2-5 million Americans and causing rapid heart beats, stroke, heart failure or death. In this project, the applicant will develop a novel framework to better understand human AF that builds on agreement between several concepts for the disease.

"Multi-stable Compliant-Mechanism-based Mattress for Bedsore Prevention Abstract Pressure ulcers or decubitus ulcers, more commonly known as bedsores are a huge problem affecting 2.5 million patients every year in the US and causes 60,000 deaths every year. Pressures exceeding 32 mm of Hg in the bony prominences in the back of the patient body lead to bedsores. Despite the existing low air loss mattresses, alternating pressure mattresses and the state-of-the-art air fluidized beds, bedsores prevail, and its prevention remains a huge healthcare challenge. Current hospital protocol is to turn patient every two hours. This is very disturbing and cause of pain to a resting patient who is dealing with other co-existing health conditions besides bedsores. Caregivers and nurses must turn heavy patients around, which sometimes lead to hurting their backs in the process. When not performed adequately and frequently (every 2 hours) as required, it is considered as negligence of care and causes litigation against nursing homes and hospitals causing huge financial losses to them. We propose a compliant-mechanism- based mattress that will obsolete the current clinical protocol of nurses and caregivers having to turn the patient every two hours. It will operate with minimal power, make small clicking noise when changing from one stable state to another using amount of force required to open a desk drawer. This switching of states can be further automated and can include a simple counter for documented evidence of alternating pressure to support against litigation of negligent care. In specific aim 1, machine learning using trained neural network will determine the functional requirements of the mattress (e.g., optimal amplitude and pitch for the undulation of the pressure points) by conducting a cohort pressure profile study that involves a bed that intentionally applies pressure on resting bodies. In specific aim 2, ideal topology with pitch and amplitude of undulations discovered in aim 1 will be developed using FACT and optimized using BLOT to create a prototype bi-stable compliant-mechanism-based mattress as a new approach for shifting pressure points on a patient’s body. FACT is advanced technique using freedom and constraint topologies for topology synthesis of the mattress and BLOT provides boundary layer optimization of the topology. Proposed mattress is innovative, disruptive, affordable, lightweight, does not use noisy air pumps, has no leakage issues and will eliminate the scourge of bedsores in the existing immobile and aging population. Project Narrative Numerous currently marketed alternating pressure mattresses have not received recommendations from reviewers due to poor correlation and unconvincing outcomes for bedsore prevention. Our approach of using neural network based machine learning will bring a new methodical approach to discerning the pitch and amplitude of undulations required to prevent dead pressure zones that exceed safe pressure of 32 mm of Hg on the patient’s back, which is fundamental to preventing bedsores. This will further serve as input to designing the prototype compliant-mechanism-based mattress using the freedom and constraint topologies (FACT) approach and the boundary learning optimization tool (BLOT) with end effect of developing an innovative mattress for preventing bedsores in the immobile and aging population.",Multi-stable Compliant-Mechanism-based Mattress for Bedsore Prevention,10138288,R41NR019721,"['Affect', 'Air', 'Air Pressure', 'Back', 'Beds', 'Body Weight', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical Protocols', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Extravasation', 'Fatigue', 'Freedom', 'Geometry', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Height', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Injections', 'Lasers', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Liquid substance', 'Litigation', 'Machine Learning', 'Mattresses', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molds', 'Monitor', 'Negligence', 'Network-based', 'Noise', 'Nurses', 'Nursing Homes', 'Nursing Protocols', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Pump', 'Recommendation', 'Rest', 'Scourge', 'Shoulder', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Width', 'Work', 'aging population', 'base', 'cohort', 'cost', 'decubitus ulcer', 'design', 'improved', 'innovation', 'light weight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'neural network', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'pressure', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'tool']",NINR,K MEDICAL LLC,R41,2021,251440
"A Model for Predicting 2-Year Risk of Incident Late Age-related Macular Degeneration PROJECT SUMMARY Age-related macular degeneration (AMD), in the dry or wet form, is the leading cause of vision loss in the developed countries. The Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) showed that specific antioxidant vitamin supplementation reduces the risk of progression from intermediate stages to late AMD and maintains visual acuity in approximately 25% of patients. While treatment of wet AMD with Intraocular injections can be effective in maintaining vision, such treatments are costly and may be associated with significant cardiovascular risks, or even progression of dry AMD. Hence, it is critical to identify patients at the earlier stages. Unfortunately, there is no effective, automated screening tool to accomplish this, and the patients themselves may be asymptomatic. The goal of this SBIR Direct-to-Phase II proposal is to provide such tool. We have demonstrated the feasibility of AMD screening software ‘iPredictTM’ by successfully identifying 98.1% of individuals with early or intermediate stage AMD. iPredictTM also successfully predicted which individuals would develop late AMD within one year with 87.8% accuracy and two years with 88.4% accuracy. iPredictTM has prototype components for image analysis and machine learning. We also developed a HIPAA compliant telemedicine platform which will enable iPredictTM to perform large-scale screening from remote and rural areas. In order to bring the product to market, these components need to be integrated and tested which is the aim of our proposed Direct-to-Phase II proposal. We aim to develop the finished product which will be ready for the market. We also aim to evaluate the efficacy of iPredictTM in a clinical setup. The AMD preventative market is estimated around $5.4 billion in the U.S. alone. iPredictTM will capture the major market share with its best accuracy and be the first prediction tool for AMD. We aim to commercialize iPredictTM for the screening and prevention of AMD, saving millions of citizens from blindness and reduced quality of life. With iPredictTM’s improvements in speed of delivery, cost of care, and ease of access, the product will be a significant addition to the healthcare system. The iPredictTM’s telemedicine platform will allow large-scale screening from remote/rural areas, primary care clinics, optometry offices and ophthalmology clinics. PROJECT NARRATIVE Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) in its late forms, “dry” or “wet”, is the leading cause of blindness in developed countries. Early intervention and therapy can significantly reduce the progression of early to late AMD.

"Human-like automated radiotherapy treatment planning via imitation learning PROJECT SUMMARY Radiation therapy is one of the major approaches for cancer treatment. Treatment planning, the process of designing the optimal treatment plan for each patient, is one of the most critical steps. If a treatment is poorly designed, a satisfactory outcome cannot be achieved, regardless of the quality of other treatment steps. Treatment planning in modern radiotherapy is formulated as a mathematical optimization problem defined by a set of hyperparameters. While there exists several quantifiable metrics to quantify plan quality and guide the planning process, these are simplified representations that cannot fully describe the physician’s intent. In addition, these metrics only measure plan quality from a population-based perspective, and cannot guide treatment planning to achieve the patient-specific best treatment plans. Hence, the best physician-preferred solution often sits in a gray area, only achievable by an extensive trial-and-error hyperparameter tuning process and interactions between the planner and physician. Consequently, planning time can take up to a week for complex cases and plan quality may be poor, if the planner is inexperienced and/or under heavy time constraints. These consequences substantially deteriorate treatment outcomes, as having been clearly demonstrated in clinical studies. Recently, the advancement in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly in imitation learning allows human- like decision making by observing a human expert’s actions and internally building its own decision-making system. In response to PAR-18-530, the goal of this project is to develop and translate an AI planner that mimics human experts’ behavior to generate a high quality plan. The AI planner will not replace human planners. Instead, the AI plan will be used as a starting point in the current planning process to improve plan quality and planning efficiency. The human planner’s actions on further plan improvement can feed back to the AI planner through continuous learning for its continuous evolution. We will pursue this goal using prostate cancer as the test bed through an academic-industrial partnership, jointing strong research and clinical expertise at UT Southwestern Medical Center with extensive commercial product development experience at Varian Medical Systems Inc. The following specific aims are defined. Aim 1: Model and algorithm development. We will collect experts’ behavior data in routine treatment planning and train the AI planner. Aim 2: System validation and translation. We will integrate the AI planner into Varian Eclipse treatment planning system and validate the system in a clinically realistic setting. The innovations include the use of a state-of-the-art AI imitation learning algorithm to solve a clinically important problem, the novel technological capabilities enabled by the developed system, as well as coherent translation activities to deliver new capabilities to end users. Deliverability is ensured by extensive preliminary studies and the partnership integrating complementary expertise and resources. Clinical translation of the AI planner will bring substantial impacts to radiotherapy by providing high-quality and efficient treatment planning to benefit patients, especially those in resource-limited regions. NARRATIVE Treatment planning for radiation therapy, where an optimal treatment strategy is designed for each individual patient and executed for the whole treatment course, plays a central role for the success of radiation therapy treatment. The current treatment planning workflow is inefficient and produces plans with sub-optimal quality, substantially deteriorating treatment outcomes. Jointing strong research and clinical expertise at UT Southwestern Medical Center with extensive commercial product development experience at Varian Medical Systems Inc, this project will develop and translate an artificial intelligence planner that is capable of efficiently generating high quality treatment plans.",Human-like automated radiotherapy treatment planning via imitation learning,10143143,R01CA254377,"['Anatomy', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attention', 'Back', 'Beds', 'Behavior', 'Cancer Patient', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Complication', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Due Process', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Human', 'Intention', 'Joints', 'Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Manuals', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Mind', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Radiation therapy', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Scheme', 'Site', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Treatment Step', 'Treatment outcome', 'Validation', 'algorithm development', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical translation', 'design', 'experience', 'head and neck cancer patient', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'industry partner', 'innovation', 'learning algorithm', 'learning progression', 'model development', 'negative affect', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'population based', 'product development', 'prototype', 'response', 'routine practice', 'success', 'treatment planning', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor', 'validation studies']",NCI,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,626797
"Racial disparities in biomarkers, tobacco cessation, and smoking relapse in association with electronic cigarette use Project Summary Although enormous progress has been made in reducing cigarette smoking in the United States, large disparities remain across subpopulations such as racial minorities. Quitting smoking can greatly reduce the risk of disease and early death. However, African Americans (AA) are less likely to quit smoking successfully than are non-Hispanic Whites, and they are also three times more likely to smoke menthol cigarettes than Whites. There is a remarkable variation in the incidence of lung cancer due to cigarette smoking among racial/ethnic groups in the United States, and African Americans have significantly greater risks than Whites at lower levels of smoking. Tobacco use landscape is changing among U.S. adults with an estimated 4.5% of adults aged 18 years and older reporting current use of electronic cigarettes (EC). Evidence suggests that e-cigarette aerosol is substantially less toxic than combustible cigarette smoking, but e-cigarette use may also post elevated risk for former smokers to relapse back to combustible cigarette smoking. Biomarker can play an important role in assessing the potential health effects of tobacco products and studies have found that AA have higher levels of serum cotinine per cigarette smoked, higher urinary amount of TNE and NNAL than Whites. However, evidence on the racial disparities of biomarker outcomes of EC use is scarce, especially whether and to what extent they are different from use of various EC devices, flavors, and transitions in EC ↔ cigarettes. The overarching goal of this study is to examine the racial disparities in biomarkers of exposure and toxicants in association with EC use by analyzing the restricted Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) Wave 1-4 biomarker data. We will link the biomarker data with the PATH adult surveys to identify the between- person and within-person differences in biomarkers by use of different vaping products, flavors, and transition in EC and combustible cigarettes across different waves (Aim 1). We will further leverage machine learning algorithms to develop a composite bio (biomarker)-socio (socio-demographics) -psycho (psychosocial factors) risk index score for each racial/ethnic group to predict subsequent abstinence from cigarette smoking and relapse to cigarette smoking since these 2 outcomes represent the most meaningful transitions from a public health perspective. This study is innovative in its focus on racial disparities of biomarkers by leveraging the nationally longitudinal data, and on using machine learning algorithms to predict future smoking cessation and relapse behaviors in EC ↔ cigarette transition. Fulfillment of these aims will build a scientific base for maximizing the value of existing biospecimen collections. Findings from this R21 study are expected to inform regulatory strategies to reduce tobacco-related morbidity and mortality and set the stage for a future R01 application that will develop personalized intervention strategies that incorporate biomarker measures to reduce racial disparities in tobacco use and improve health outcomes. 1 Project Narrative The proposed study seeks to examine racial disparities in biomarkers of e-cigarette use by linking the PATH Waves 1-4 restricted biomarker data and adult survey data. The study will extend our knowledge on the heterogeneity in biomarkers of exposure and toxicants across racial and ethnic groups, including use of different vaping products, flavors, and transition between e-cigarettes and cigarettes. We will further develop a bio-socio-psycho risk index score to predict abstinence from cigarette smoking, relapse to cigarette use, and tobacco-related health outcomes using machine learning algorithms across racial and ethnic groups.","Racial disparities in biomarkers, tobacco cessation, and smoking relapse in association with electronic cigarette use",10232728,R21DA054818,"['18 year old', '4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol', 'Abstinence', 'Adult', 'African American', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Biological Markers', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Cigarette', 'Cigarette Smoker', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Cotinine', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Electronic cigarette', 'Ethnic group', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hispanics', 'Incidence', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Measures', 'Menthol', 'Metals', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nicotine', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Play', 'Population Analysis', 'Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health', 'Psychosocial Factor', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Recording of previous events', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Respiratory Signs and Symptoms', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Serum', 'Smoke', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco Use Cessation', 'Tobacco use', 'United States', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'cigarette smoke', 'cigarette smoking', 'cigarette user', 'combustible cigarette', 'disorder risk', 'e-cigarette aerosols', 'electronic cigarette use', 'electronic cigarette user', 'former smoker', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality', 'personalized intervention', 'psychosocial', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial disparity', 'racial minority', 'reduce tobacco use', 'smoking cessation', 'smoking relapse', 'sociodemographics', 'tobacco exposure', 'tobacco products', 'tobacco toxicant', 'toxicant', 'urinary', 'vaping']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF NEBRASKA MEDICAL CENTER,R21,2021,204739
"PROTECT: optima4BP 2.0: prediction of Optimal Treatment and Route to achieve and maintain BP Target Need. In the US, 40 million patients with hypertension (HTN) have their blood pressure (BP) uncontrolled. BP above clinical Target even for a few months increases the risk for stroke (35-40%), heart failure (HF) (up to 64%), myocardial infarction (MI) (15-25%). Physician-nurse-pharmacist resource-intensive demonstrations in achieving & maintaining BP Target have shown promising results, but their real-life deployment was found unsustainable long-term. As a result, a process-standardized and sustainable solution is acutely needed.  Solution. In response to this need, Optima Integrated Health developed optima4BP 1.0. It is a first-in-class artificial intelligence (AI) that simulates the process of clinical reasoning undertaken by the treating physician in optimizing the anti-HTN treatment towards BP Target. Just like the physician, optima4BP 1.0 cannot determine upfront the needed Optimal Treatment (OT) to achieve & maintain BP Target for 1-2 years. PROTECT [optima4BP 2.0: prediction of Optimal Treatment and route to achieve and maintain BP Target] proposes to establish upfront the personalized OT. The OT can then be used to select the shortest and safest treatment modification route needed to achieve & maintain BP Target. Phase II Goal. Build optima4BP 2.0.  Phase I. Phase I Prior Work demonstrated that k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN), an AI model, can predict with ≥ 80% confidence the correct anti-HTN treatment, when compared to physician decision.  Phase II. optima4BP 2.0 will predict the Optimal Treatment and route to achieve & maintain BP Target.  Optimal Treatment data-mining source. PROTECT will use the SPRINT (Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial, 2015) and ACCORD (Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes, 2010) clinical trial data. They represent the foundation of the most current anti-HTN treatment management national guidelines.  Aim 1. Build kNN. Hypothesis. kNN can predict the proximity (clinical relevance) of a patient to an Optimal Treatment (OT). Milestone. Achieve ≥ 90% accuracy of prediction to physician decision. Phase I Data Preparation protocol will be applied to the SPRINT & ACCORD data. Then, the kNN Ensemble Learning function will be built to select the Optimal Treatment with the highest demonstrated efficacy by comparing the choice from 3 computational approaches developed and tested during Phase I.  Aim 2. Build the Optimal Treatment Route (OTR). Hypothesis. Knowing the Current and Optimal Treatment (OT), an OTR can be built. Milestone. Safest Route: Achieve 100% exclusion of treatments that led to an adverse event in similar patient populations. Shortest Route: Achieve ≥30% reduction in number of treatment changes compared to physician route. The OTR will be built by comparing at each Step on the Route how similar each Candidate Treatment is to the OT through a computed similarity assessment.  optima4BP 2.0 aims to establish a process-standardized & sustainable solution with the goal of reducing the incidence of stroke, HF, MI and death resulting from uncontrolled hypertension. In the US, 40 million patients with hypertension have their blood pressure uncontrolled. We propose to build and test optima4BP 2.0 (Project Name: PROTECT) that will predict upfront the personalized optimal treatment and shortest treatment route required by a patient to achieve and maintain blood pressure target. Achieving and maintaining blood pressure target will reduce the incidence of adverse events [stroke (35-40%), heart failure (up to 64%), myocardial infarction (15-25%)] or death resulting from uncontrolled hypertension.",PROTECT: optima4BP 2.0: prediction of Optimal Treatment and Route to achieve and maintain BP Target,10159301,R44HL140624,"['Acute', 'Adverse drug event', 'Adverse event', 'Antihypertensive Agents', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Blood Pressure', 'California', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Confidential Information', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Drug Combinations', 'Enrollment', 'Euclidean Space', 'Exclusion', 'Foundations', 'Gender', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Heart failure', 'Hypertension', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Lipids', 'Logic', 'Medical center', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Names', 'Nature', 'Nurses', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacists', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Resources', 'Route', 'Safety', 'San Francisco', 'Seminal', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Stroke', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Visit', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'Women&apos', 's Role', 'Work', 'base', 'blood pressure intervention', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'clinical care', 'clinically relevant', 'commercial application', 'comparative efficacy', 'data mining', 'data quality', 'hypertension treatment', 'innovation', 'optimal treatments', 'patient population', 'prevent', 'processing speed', 'response', 'stroke incidence', 'stroke risk', 'success']",NHLBI,"OPTIMA INTEGRATED HEALTH, INC.",R44,2021,715983
"Leveraging Heterogeneity in Preclinical Traumatic Brain Injury to Drive Discovery and Reproducibility Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of neurological disorders and affects over 2.5 million people each year, yet no treatment has successfully translated from bench to clinic. TBI is a broad term and encompasses an extremely heterogeneous set of injuries differing by cause, severity, biomechanics, and the varied, complex secondary injury responses that collectively result in chronic disabilities. Current preclinical research circumvents the issue of TBI heterogeneity by relying on specific preclinical animal models that mimic subpopulations of patients and particular secondary injury mechanisms with each study focusing on limited, individual pathways. This proposal instead aims to tackle TBI heterogeneity by approaching TBI as a “big data” problem and aggregating and analyzing the multidimensional data collectively. A framework for data harmonization and curation will be developed, and datasets from a consortium of preclinical labs employing a variety of preclinical TBI models will be collected and curated into an open data commons (ODC-TBI). Utilizing machine learning and multidimensional analytics, the proposed research will directly leverage TBI heterogeneity in the merged dataset to identify persistent features of TBI to empower translational research. By creating a preclinical TBI ODC and applying machine learning to integrate the heterogeneity of preclinical TBI models, the project will reveal multidimensional features of TBI across heterogeneous injuries and characterize how diverse secondary injury mechanisms interact and ultimately affect injury outcome. Throughout the project's timeline, new datasets will continue to be harmonized into the ODC-TBI according to the established framework. The ODC-TBI will be the first open multicenter, multi-model repository of preclinical TBI data and will enable the application of data science to the field of TBI. Furthermore, the ODC-TBI and the methods implemented throughout the project will be openly shared to improve reproducibility of TBI research. Together with the multidimensional analysis that will provide quantitative and qualitative understanding of TBI heterogeneity, the project aims to ultimately accelerate data- driven discovery and precision medicine for TBI. Reflecting the complexities of clinical traumatic brain injury (TBI), preclinical TBI research is confounded by the extreme heterogeneity prevalent across possible injury models and resulting biological responses. The proposed research will aggregate and curate an extensive open data commons (ODC) of preclinical TBI research with multiple TBI models and utilize machine learning to tackle TBI heterogeneity directly. The project will create an ODC for preclinical TBI research to improve data sharing and scientific reproducibility, and will empower translational TBI research by identifying multidimensional features of TBI that best predict functional outcome.",Leveraging Heterogeneity in Preclinical Traumatic Brain Injury to Drive Discovery and Reproducibility,10212363,F32NS117728,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomechanics', 'Brain region', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Closed head injuries', 'Common Data Element', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Commons', 'Data Element', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Informatics', 'Injury', 'Institutes', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Publishing', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Severities', 'Standardization', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'Therapeutic', 'TimeLine', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'behavioral outcome', 'bench to bedside', 'biomarker discovery', 'controlled cortical impact', 'data curation', 'data framework', 'data harmonization', 'data sharing', 'disability', 'experimental study', 'functional outcomes', 'genetic manipulation', 'improved', 'insight', 'multidimensional data', 'multiple datasets', 'nerve injury', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroinflammation', 'open data', 'patient subsets', 'pre-clinical', 'pre-clinical research', 'precision medicine', 'repository', 'response', 'response to injury']",NINDS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",F32,2021,71224
"Integrate Dynamic System Model and Machine Learning for Calibration-Free Noninvasive ICP Project Summary  No clinical device exists for noninvasive intracranial pressure (nICP) assessment. Past attempts have focused on identifying ICP-related signals that are noninvasively measureable, but have done little to address the calibration problem. Without calibration, only ICP trending can be inferred at the best. However, noninvasive calibration is not trivial. A universal calibration will fail because individual patients require different calibration to obtain accurate results. On the other hand, the use of plain regression for individualized calibration is infeasible because ICP cannot be obtained noninvasively for a de novo patient to begin with.  Invasive ICP monitoring remains a standard of care and this can be leveraged to continuously grow a database of ICP, noninvasive signals, and different calibration equations, e.g., each built from a pair of invasive ICP and noninvasive signal in the database. Then nICP becomes feasible by selecting from a rich set of calibration equations the optimal choice for a de novo patient. In this project, we will pursue three aims that will lead to the development of an accurate noninvasive ICP system based on Transcranial Doppler. These aims are: 1) To implement and validate core algorithms needed for achieving accurate nICP; 2) To test if estimated nICP is sensitive to variations in ultrasound probe placement; 3) To test the generalizability of the proposed nICP approach.  Large epidemiologic surveys reveal that ICP is monitored in only about 58% of US patients when ICP monitoring is indicated. It is a smaller percentage (37%) in European patients and even fewer in developing countries. The proposed nICP approach does not have the high risks associated with invasive ICP, requires no onsite neurosurgical expertise, and can be economically deployed and readily practiced. Therefore, its potential impact is enormous. Project Narrative  No clinically accepted device exists for noninvasive intracranial pressure (ICP) assessment.

"Data-driven subtyping in major depressive disorder Abstract  Major depressive disorder contributes substantially to morbidity, mortality, and health care cost. Standard treatments are ineffective for up to a third of patients, so new treatment options are needed along with strategies to make more effective use of existing treatments. However, progress in expanding therapeutic options has been hindered by heterogeneity in clinical presentation and course of depression.  In other disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease, cancer, and dementia, identifying disease subtypes has led to therapeutic discoveries. In major depressive disorder, efforts to identify subtypes based on clinical observation have yielded limited success, primarily because of the lack of availability of adequate cohorts for replication, and because those features most apparent to clinicians may not be the most relevant for differentiating subgroups. Efforts to leverage large electronic health record data sets for subtyping address some of these challenges, but standard approaches may not yield human-interpretable features nor those with value in prediction.  The investigators have developed methods for engineering features that balance utility in prediction with interpretability. Preliminary work by the investigators during a year of R56 support yielding 4 publications demonstrates that this approach indeed yields coherent topics without sacrificing predictive validity; electronic health records contain meaningful data that facilitates identification of interpretable patient subgroups. The present study draws on very large cohorts of individuals with major depression, defined by a validated algorithm, in electronic health records from two health systems. It will first apply methods developed by the investigators to identify MDD subtypes. These subtypes will then be examined in terms of predictive validity as well as interpretability by clinicians.  The study builds on a productive collaboration between a team experienced in mood disorder phenotyping and clinical investigation, analysis of large-scale longitudinal electronic health records, and development and application of innovative methods in machine learning that yield interpretable models rather than black boxes. Data-driven disease subtyping will facilitate clinically useful risk stratification as well as biological study of mood disorders. Narrative  The wide variation in symptoms of major depressive disorder complicates efforts to develop new treatments and make effective use of existing treatments. Applying machine learning methods to electronic health records will enable the identification of interpretable disease subgroups, enabling development of more targeted treatment strategies.",Data-driven subtyping in major depressive disorder,10211310,R01MH123804,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Cessation of life', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Endocrine System Diseases', 'Engineering', 'Equilibrium', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Functional disorder', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health system', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Prevalence', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Quality of life', 'Research Personnel', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Series', 'Subgroup', 'Suicide', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'biomarker identification', 'clinical investigation', 'clinical subtypes', 'cohort', 'depressive symptoms', 'disorder subtype', 'experience', 'ineffective therapies', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient subsets', 'phenomenological models', 'precision medicine', 'risk stratification', 'standard care', 'success', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy resistant', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2021,832192
"Maternal Antecedents and Electronic Fetal Monitoring in Term Asphyxia (MAESTRA) Neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) is a neurologic syndrome that results from reduced flow of oxygenated blood to the fetal or newborn brain. HIE occurs in 1-3 per 1,000 term births and may cause death or neurologic disabilities such as cerebral palsy. Electronic fetal monitoring (EFM) was developed in the 1970's to assess the adequacy of fetal oxygenation as a strategy to prevent HIE, and is now standard of care. Yet clinical trials report that EFM usage has not reduced the rate of CP, perinatal death or HIE, but is associated with a dramatic increase in cesarean deliveries. The currently used 3 Category fetal heart rate (FHR) classification system, based on simple rules designed to be easy to apply at the bedside, has some utility in predicting HIE. However, Category II FHR patterns that make up the vast majority of tracings are poorly predictive of HIE and confer “indeterminate” risk. Category III patterns are also of limited use in predicting HIE due to low sensitivity. There is an urgent need to develop better objective methods to assess EFM that would identify more fetuses at risk of HIE in time for corrective actions. Uterine tachysystole, or excessive frequency of uterine contractions, has been implicated as a preventable cause of HIE; yet studies report conflicting results. EFM research has been limited by an inability to access and manually analyze the large datasets needed to study HIE. We now have the ability to analyze digital EFM signals using automated methods to measure standard FHR patterns as well as to discover novel aspects of the tracing that may not be readily detectable by a clinician at the bedside. We hypothesize that modern signal processing and machine learning techniques can create highly predictive models of HIE by analyzing established and novel features of EFM tracings, in combination with demographic and pertinent clinical information from the mother and fetus. We propose a population-based retrospective cohort study of 350,000 infants born at ≥ 36 weeks gestation at Kaiser Permanente Northern California in 2010-19. Our specific aims are: 1) To create the MAESTRA Cohort dataset that links EFM recordings to HIE and neonatal acidosis among 350,000 infants born at ≥ 36 weeks gestation in 2010-19 at Kaiser Permanente Northern CA; 2) Using modern signal processing and machine learning techniques, to extract established and novel FHR and uterine contractility features from the EFM recordings, and to determine which of these features are most predictive of HIE and acidosis when combined with maternal and fetal clinical data; and 3) To perform external validation by applying the final predictive models to a historical dataset. We anticipate that machine learning techniques incorporating novel FHR and uterine contractility patterns over time, as well as pre- and perinatal clinical characteristics, will improve the predictive value of the EFM data that are already being collected as part of routine care. Our results will inform future clinical trials. Such an unprecedented large-scale multidisciplinary study will lead to improvements in our ability to use EFM data to prevent neonatal brain injury while minimizing unnecessary cesarean sections. MAESTRA Project Narrative Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) occurs when a baby gets reduced oxygen and blood flow to the brain, and can lead to death or long-term disabilities such as cerebral palsy. During labor and delivery, doctors are able to continuously record the heart rate of the fetus.

"Evaluation of molecular mechanisms of treatment response in late-life depression DESCRIPTION: Over the past decades, antidepressants and psychotherapy have been the first-line treatments for LLD. Despite being safe and well-tolerated, a large number of patients do not achieve full and persistent remission after initial treatment. About 50% of patients with LLD do not respond after two antidepressant trials, meeting the consensus definition of treatment resistance (TR-LLD). The persistence of chronic and elevated depressive symptoms in older adults has significant clinical and public health implications. This has been correlated to poor general health, reduced quality of life, and a higher risk of mortality when compared to those with sustained remission after treatment. Despite the relevance to public health of TR-LLD, there is little information about the biological mechanisms and no robust clinical prediction model to evaluate at the outset of antidepressant therapy who will or will not respond to treatment. Leveraging an NIMH funded clinical trial, the Incomplete Response in Late-Life Depression: Getting to Remission” (IRL-GREY), across 3 sites, in this study, we propose to evaluate the biological mechanisms related to treatment response in late-life depression and to develop a machine learning based algorithm for prediction of treatment response in these subjects. We will carry out a comprehensive, multiplexed proteomic analysis on 542 samples from patients who completed phase 1 and phase 2 of the clinical trial. We hypothesise that ageing-related biological pathways (i.e. inflammatory response control, proteostasis control, cell damage response, endothelial function) will be associated with poorer treatment response in LLD. Moreover, we hypothesize that a machine learning derived biomarker panel will have sensitivity and specificity greater than 80% to predict treatment response in LLD. Finally, we will evaluate the biological mechanisms related to different depressive symptoms trajectories after treatment. This work will set the stage for a biologically-driven model of treatment response that will be useful to guide, at the outset of antidepressant treatment, those who will benefit more from a specific treatment. If successful, our work can accelerate therapeutic efforts and innovation targeting depression and reduce suffering for large numbers of elderly and their families. Using advanced molecular approaches, we will determine the biological mechanisms related to treatment response in late-life depression. Our proposed study will also develop a predictive tool combining neurocognitive, neuroimaging, and protein data to identify who with late-life depression is more likely to have no benefit from antidepressant treatment at the outset of therapy. The goal of the study is to clarify the mechanisms of treatment response in late-life depression, and whether we can effectively identify those who will benefit from antidepressant therapy at the outset of treatment.",Evaluation of molecular mechanisms of treatment response in late-life depression,10129431,R01MH118311,"['Address', 'Aftercare', 'Aging', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Aging', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Blood specimen', 'Brain', 'Cell Cycle', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Disease remission', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Elderly', 'Endothelium', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Funding', 'Geroscience', 'Goals', 'Growth Factor', 'Health', 'Immune', 'Impaired cognition', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Depression', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurocognitive', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Phase II Clinical Trials', 'Placebos', 'Population', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Prevalence', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Psychotherapy', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Work', 'angiogenesis', 'aripiprazole', 'base', 'biomarker panel', 'cell injury', 'cohort', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'endothelial dysfunction', 'geriatric depression', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'meetings', 'mortality risk', 'neuroimaging', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'novel strategies', 'open label', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'proteostasis', 'recruit', 'response', 'therapy resistant', 'treatment response', 'treatment-resistant depression', 'venlafaxine']",NIMH,CENTRE FOR ADDICTION AND MENTAL HEALTH,R01,2021,490569
"Biomechanical Analysis in Strabismus Surgery We propose 3 interrelated aims to define the biomechanics of the eye rotating (extraocular) muscles (EOMs) & optic nerve (ON) in health & visual disease, understand novel EOM actions, & characterize mechanical effects that may contribute to severe myopia. We aim to improve treatment of strabismus, misalignment of visual directions of the eyes; glaucoma & non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NA-AION), both common blinding ON diseases; & high axial myopia, an ocular elongation & distortion that has become a worldwide epidemic & major cause of blindness. We propose a novel & critical nexus linking the EOMs, ON, & structure of the eye's scleral wall that we will explore using modern imaging & artificial intelligence techniques. Aim I will clarify the kinematic (motion) properties of the human eye, testing by multipositional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the eyeball & EOMs the hypothesis that translational (linear) movement contributes importantly to ocular alignment. MRI will be performed during horizontal convergence & vertical eye rotation in normal people, & in patients who have common forms of strabismus including convergence insufficiency, eye crossing (esotropia), & outward ocular deviation (exotropia), both before & after corrective EOM surgery. Clarification of ocular translation is necessary to understand normal ocular motility and treat its disorders. Aim II will characterize the mechanical loading on the ON caused by eye movements. We will characterize the mechanical effects of ON tractional loading on the eyeball during horizontal & vertical eye rotations at 2 scales in living people, to test the hypothesis that such ON loading deforms it & adjacent retina & blood vessels as loading translates the eye. We propose that the resulting deformation during eye movements may create repetitive strain injury contributing to glaucoma, NA-AION, & axial myopia. In groups of subjects with the foregoing diseases, & in an equal group of matched healthy subjects, we will study mechanical effects of eye movement within the living eye by imaging its internal micro structure & blood vessels with optical coherence tomography, & outside the eyeball in the eye socket using MRI. Effects of tethering during eye movement will be studied ex vivo by precision 3D optical imaging of fresh human eye bank specimens subjected to mechanical tension on the ON that mimic effects of the eye movements imaged in the living subjects. Aim III will model the biomechanics of ocular kinematics. The constitutive mechanical properties of the non-muscular ocular & eye socket tissues will be described by finite element models (FEMs) using modern engineering methods for computational simulation to predict ocular kinematics, as well as local mechanical strains in the ON & sclera that may cause glaucoma, NA-AION, & the ocular deformities underlying extreme nearsightedness. We will determine if FEMs employing normal tissue properties can simulate normal ocular translation during horizontal & vertical rotations & convergence. By FEM simulation, we will also test the hypothesis that ocular loading by eye movement might contribute to: normal vergence, strabismus, & the effects of strabismus surgery. Relevance. Strabismus is a common clinical disorder that can cause double vision in adults and vision loss in children. Strabismus is often treated by surgical manipulation of the eye muscles, although current knowledge of their structure and function is incomplete. Proposed functional imaging and biomechanical studies of the properties of the eye muscles, eyeball, and optic nerve will improve understanding of the causes and treatment of strabismus, optic nerve diseases, and nearsightedness.",Biomechanical Analysis in Strabismus Surgery,10134346,R01EY008313,"['3-Dimensional', 'Accounting', 'Adult', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior Ischemic Optic Neuropathy', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Biological Specimen Banks', 'Biomechanics', 'Blindness', 'Blood Vessels', 'Child', 'Choroid', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Connective Tissue', 'Convergence Insufficiency', 'Cumulative Trauma Disorders', 'Deformity', 'Degenerative Myopia', 'Diplopia', 'Disease', 'Duct (organ) structure', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Epidemic', 'Equilibrium', 'Esotropia', 'Etiology', 'Exotropia', 'Eye', 'Eye Banks', 'Eye Movements', 'Failure', 'Functional Imaging', 'Gap Junctions', 'Glaucoma', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lasers', 'Link', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Matched Group', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Muscle Contraction', 'Myopia', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Ocular orbit', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Ophthalmoscopy', 'Optic Disk', 'Optic Nerve', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Optics', 'Patients', 'Physiologic Intraocular Pressure', 'Play', 'Primary Open Angle Glaucoma', 'Property', 'Retina', 'Role', 'Rotation', 'Scanning', 'Sclera', 'Strabismus', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Traction', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'anatomic imaging', 'biomechanical model', 'cell motility', 'crosslink', 'digital imaging', 'ex vivo imaging', 'human tissue', 'improved', 'in vivo imaging', 'in vivo optical imaging', 'kinematics', 'mechanical load', 'mechanical properties', 'model development', 'models and simulation', 'monocular', 'neglect', 'novel', 'ocular imaging', 'optic nerve disorder', 'optical imaging', 'orbit muscle', 'predictive modeling', 'quantitative imaging', 'retina blood vessel structure', 'simulation']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2021,584907
"Large-scale data integration and harmonization to accurately predict sites facing future health-based drinking water crises Project summary: Up to 45 million people per year in the U.S. are directly impacted by health-based drinking water problems. This leads to at least 16 million cases of acute gastroenteritis directly linked to pollution at community water systems, with tens of millions more directly impacted by chemical and organic pollutants. Impacts are further exacerbated in locations dealing with water scarcity, in under-served populations, and within other vulnerable populations already suffering from health disparities. Many of these water problems are the direct result of managerial negligence, inconsistent monitoring, and a lack of the ability to anticipate where problems may arise next. While the reasons for drinking water problems are complex, if we could anticipate where health-based drinking water problems were to occur in the future, it could have an immediate and positive impact on tens of millions of Americans annually. Interestingly, extensive data about water quality and the performance of municipal water systems already exists in large, disparate databases. These databases are largely ignored and, when used, are typically used only anecdotally and retroactively. Preliminary evidence suggests that these existing databases, which contain histories of administrative violations and sub-threshold water-quality results, can be mined to accurately predict future drinking water crises. The Superior Statistical Research R&D team is an internationally recognized group of water experts with cross-cutting expertise in statistics/data analysis/modelling/computing, water-quality monitoring of biological and chemical contaminants, and the ability to clearly and compellingly translate water-quality and health information to actionable steps for individuals, organizations and communities. In this Phase I project, we will show that it is possible to predict water-related, health-based problem areas utilizing already collected, historical data on water quality and municipal water system performance. We will begin by harmonizing the disparate water quality and municipal water system performance in two different states (Michigan and Iowa). We will then utilize machine-learning techniques to predict health-based violation histories and will evaluate our methods by comparing predicted violations to actual health-based violations in the previous 5 years. Finally, we will identify at least 10 municipalities determined by our algorithm to be at the highest risk for future health- based water problems and will do systematic sampling to confirm our model-based predictions. We will then demonstrate how making these predictions can be leveraged to profitability by exploring how our model-based predictions can be presented to customers in an economical, usable form. Proof of our concept and profitability models in two states (Phase I) will set us up for widespread (multi-state) database harmonization and improvement of the proposed machine-learning/modelling effort in Phase II. With multi-state harmonized datasets, identification of key data gaps in particular states/areas, and proven financial models, our technology will ultimately lead to dramatic reductions in the number of health-based drinking water problems annually. Project Narrative Up to 45 million people per year in the U.S. are directly impacted by health-based drinking water problems, but predicting where and when these health-based drinking water problems will occur remains a large and complex obstacle. Current approaches focus on a reactive approach to health-based water-quality violations in community water systems, rather than a proactive one that seeks to anticipate where problems will occur in the future. The overall goal of this project is to leverage large and disparate historical datasets of water quality to accurately predict locations of future health-based water-quality violations, validate the predictions, and commercialize our proprietary predictions as a practical and cost-saving approach to anticipating and heading off future health-based water problems.",Large-scale data integration and harmonization to accurately predict sites facing future health-based drinking water crises,10253600,R43ES033134,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Area', 'Biological Monitoring', 'Chemicals', 'Cities', 'Coal', 'Communities', 'Community Surveys', 'Complex', 'Cost Savings', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Ensure', 'Exposure to', 'Filtration', 'Focus Groups', 'Future', 'Gastroenteritis', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Health', 'Human', 'Individual', 'International', 'Iowa', 'Lead', 'Lead levels', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Municipalities', 'Negligence', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Pollution', 'Price', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'ROC Curve', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Research', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Serinus', 'Site', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'Trust', 'Underserved Population', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Water', 'advocacy organizations', 'base', 'commercialization', 'data harmonization', 'data integration', 'drinking water', 'economic impact', 'health disparity', 'high risk', 'improved', 'inner city', 'innovation', 'large scale data', 'member', 'pollutant', 'predictive modeling', 'research and development', 'rural area', 'statistics', 'water quality', 'water sampling', 'water testing', 'willingness to pay']",NIEHS,"SUPERIOR STATISTICAL RESEARCH, LLC",R43,2021,256579
"A magnetic capsule endoscope for colonoscopy in patients with inflammatory bowel disease We propose to develop, optimize, and conduct first in-human measurements of our Magnetic Flexible Endoscope (MFE) robotic platform that may provide a safer and more intelligent alternative to standard colonoscopy (CLS) for patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). Patients with IBD are at increased risk for colorectal cancer and therefore surveillance has been recommended to occur at intervals less than that recommended for the general population. Thus, over the course of their lifetime, they are subjected to more frequent CLS than their non-lBD counterparts, resulting in a more than 6-fold increase in adverse events. The main risks of CLS are related to procedural sedation, patient discomfort, or perforation of the colon from looping. Looping and mesenteric stretching occur due to the design of the colonoscope. Special maneuvers can be performed to minimize looping, making CLS a procedure that requires a great degree of technical skill and experience to perform safely. By using the proposed robotic platform, the endoscopist will be able to control the motion of the MFE to perform navigation, diagnosis, and therapy (i.e. biopsy, polyp removal/retrieval, injection) inside the human colon. MFE motion is achieved by magnetic coupling between an external permanent magnet (attached to a robotic arm outside the patient's body) and an internal permanent magnet (located inside the proximal head of the MFE). A small-diameter flexible tether between the head of the endoscope and the distal control module (outside the patient's body) allows for passage of commercially available therapeutic tools, insufflation, irrigation, suction/aspiration, and electrical wiring. Employing magnetic attraction at the head of the endoscope, for advancement and manipulation, permits the tether to follow passively-reducing the risk of mesenteric stretching or looping when compared to the traditional colonoscope. We will leverage our experience and extensive preliminary results to test the hypotheses that (1) intelligent robotic control and assistive autonomy in endoscopic tasks improves endoscopic performance, (2) quantifying the portion of colon lumen visualized provides valuable feedback to improve MFE operation and diagnostic yield, and (3) that the MFE is safe and successfully functions in the human colon in a manner similar to conventional CLS. The investigative team, combining engineering and clinical faculty, is uniquely positioned to achieve success of this study-collectively possessing expertise in endoscopic device design, clinical CLS, assessment and validation of innovative gastrointestinal technologies, robotics, magnetism, image processing, artificial intelligence, and translation of research-engineering developments into clinical applications. Additionally, the investigators have a long-standing history of close and fruitful collaboration including R01 EB018992. If successful, this approach will demonstrate first in-human use of the MFE that reduces potential adverse events in an at-risk population (IBD patients), is intuitive to control, and integrates intelligent guidance into colon exploration and inspection. The robotic platform we propose has the potential to provide a safer, more accessible, and potentially painless alternative to standard colonoscopy for patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (Ulcerative Colitis or Crohn's disease)-a disease that impacts the lives of over three million Americans, who are at a 6-fold increased risk for post-colonoscopy adverse events when compared to their non-lBD counterparts. The platform uses magnetic actuation, intelligent closed-loop control, and integrated assistive autonomy of our diagnostic and therapeutic magnetic flexible endoscope (MFE) to facilitate intuitive endoscopist-directed motion under precise control with a novel colon-visualization-index (CVI) that provides feedback to the endoscopist with estimates of the portion of colon lumen successfully imaged to maximize the yield of exam. We propose the first in-human study of a magnetically actuated robotic platform for colonoscopy and the first in-human demonstration of intelligent control with assistive autonomy using magnetic fields.",A magnetic capsule endoscope for colonoscopy in patients with inflammatory bowel disease,10121126,R01EB018992,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Model', 'Articulation', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automation', 'Benchmarking', 'Benign', 'Biopsy', 'Cadaver', 'Caliber', 'Cecum', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Colon', 'Colonoscopes', 'Colonoscopy', 'Complication', 'Coupling', 'Crohn&apos', 's disease', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Device Designs', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Dysplasia', 'Electric Wiring', 'Endoscopes', 'Endoscopy', 'Engineering', 'Excision', 'Failure', 'Family suidae', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Head', 'Human', 'Image', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Injections', 'Insufflation', 'Intelligence', 'Intervention', 'Intubation', 'Intuition', 'Irrigation', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Magnetism', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Medical Device', 'Mesentery', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Mucositis', 'Mucous Membrane', 'Nature', 'Nursing Faculty', 'Painless', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Perforation', 'Performance', 'Polyps', 'Populations at Risk', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Provider', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrieval', 'Risk', 'Robotics', 'Safety', 'Sedation procedure', 'Software Validation', 'Stream', 'Stretching', 'Suction', 'Surface', 'Technical Degree', 'Technical Expertise', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Ulcerative Colitis', 'Validation', 'Vision', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'biomaterial compatibility', 'capsule', 'clinical application', 'colorectal cancer risk', 'comorbidity', 'design', 'detection method', 'experience', 'first-in-human', 'flexibility', 'gastrointestinal', 'human study', 'image processing', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'lifetime risk', 'magnetic field', 'novel', 'operation', 'outcome forecast', 'pain patient', 'phantom model', 'prevent', 'procedure safety', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'robot assistance', 'robot control', 'skills', 'success', 'tool', 'trial comparing']",NIBIB,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,316138
"Understanding the role of the Complement Proteome in progressive Diabetic Kidney Disease PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT There is a critical need to identify novel mechanisms of diabetic kidney disease (DKD) that will provide targets for new interventions. Chronic inflammation is one plausible mechanism. Using untargeted high-throughput aptamer proteomics, our recently published study has shed new light on specific, key inflammatory drivers of DKD. This was a large prospective three-cohort study that identified a novel and extremely robust circulating signature (KRIS) associated with risk of ESRD in diabetes. Our pilot study points to the data-driven connection between circulating KRIS and urinary profiles of the Complement pathway. Our hypothesis is that the Complement involvement in the kidney is a downstream effect of the systemic inflammatory processes mediating an increased DKD risk. The overarching goal of this proposal is to provide a high-resolution view of the involvement of the Complement proteome in progressive diabetic kidney disease. Aim 1 will comprehensively evaluate the etiological role of the urinary Complement proteome in progressive DKD leading to ESRD. This evaluation will leverage a prospective two-cohort population of Joslin Kidney Study (JKS) participants with an overt DKD at baseline followed for 10 years (primary outcome – incident ESRD). Measurements will utilize an aptamer proteomic technology (SOMAscan). Aim 2 will extend generalizability of the urinary Complement proteome to earlier DKD stages. The proposed study will be conducted in participants of the Preventing Early Renal Loss (PERL) clinical trial with predominantly normal renal function at baseline followed for 3 years (primary outcome - renal slope). Aim 3 proposes to gain direct insight into the intra-renal Complement proteome by targeted and untargeted protein studies in diabetic kidney tissue (Susztaklab Biobank). This project focuses on a significant public health problem, leverages the progressiveness of the disease, employs an innovative proteomic technology and stems from strong preliminary data. Advances in this project will pinpoint missing key components of DKD etiology, thereby accelerating drug development strategies for patients with diabetes. PROJECT NARRATIVE Diabetes accounts for approximately 45% of prevalent ESRD cases in the United States, therefore new interventions to prevent or decelerate development of kidney failure are critical in order to improve the health of patients with diabetes who comprise a large sector of the US population. This study will advance our knowledge regarding the etiology of diabetic kidney complications evaluating specific components of systemic (KRIS) and local, kidney inflammation (Complement). These advances offer long-term potential for the development of new therapies that will ultimately improve clinical outcomes of patients with diabetes.",Understanding the role of the Complement Proteome in progressive Diabetic Kidney Disease,10153779,R01DK123459,"['Address', 'Biological Markers', 'CCL2 gene', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic Nephropathy', 'Disease Progression', 'End stage renal failure', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Histology', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Injury to Kidney', 'Intervention', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Failure', 'Knowledge', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Medicine', 'Nature', 'Nested Case-Control Study', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Process', 'Progressive Disease', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Renal function', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Severity of illness', 'Signaling Protein', 'Source', 'Technology', 'Tissue Banks', 'Tissues', 'Tubular formation', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor', 'United States', 'aptamer', 'biobank', 'cohort', 'complement pathway', 'complement system', 'diabetic', 'disorder risk', 'drug development', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'member', 'nephrogenesis', 'non-diabetic', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'prevent', 'primary outcome', 'prospective', 'random forest', 'stem', 'study population', 'systemic inflammatory response', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'urinary']",NIDDK,JOSLIN DIABETES CENTER,R01,2021,478789
"APPLYING ERROR-CORRECTED SEQUENCING TO DETECT MINIMAL RESIDUAL IN THE AAML 1031 STUDY Abstract  Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) accounts for half of all pediatric leukemia deaths and is the leading cause of leukemia-related death in adulthood. One reason for worse outcomes is the inability to properly assess for minimal residual disease (MRD) following therapy. Unlike ALL, AML presents with multiple subclonal populations without a singular clonal surface marker, and surface markers can change during therapy. The current gold standard for AML MRD is multi-parameter flow cytometry (MPFC), which is predictive of outcomes to frequencies of 0.001, yet 30% of MPFC-MRD-negative patients still relapse. Alternatively, every AML case harbors leukemia-specific mutations that could be markers of disease, except that next-generation sequencing has high error rate of ~1%. In this proposal, we will implement a novel, validated error-corrected sequencing (ECS) strategy, developed by the Druley lab in collaboration with Illumina, to improve MRD assessment of AML subclonal heterogeneity in 990 pediatric de novo AML cases from the Children's Oncology Group AAML1031 study. We hypothesize that using a highly sensitive sequencing method will improve identification of residual AML, provide important insights on subclonal heterogeneity in pediatric AML, improve understanding of the role of germline variability and gene function on relapses or refractory disease and facilitate personalized medicine. To interrogate this hypothesis, we propose the following aims: 1. Define subclonal heterogeneity at diagnosis and end of Induction 1 (EOI1) in 990 pediatric de novo  AML patients (n=1890). By using the largest prospective study of pediatric AML that has ever been  performed, we will perform ECS on 94 genes that are the most frequently mutated genes in pediatric and  adult AML at diagnosis and EOI1 to identify patterns of mutation associated with relapsed disease, FAB  subtypes or other cytogenetic features. 2. Correlate ECS-MRD with existing EOI1 MPFC-MRD for all participants in the COG AAML1031 study.  A major question is whether the “different from normal” cell population identified as residual disease by  MPFC is actually the same population(s) identified by ECS. We will define residual disease by ECS and  compare results to MPFC status (positive/negative), actual MPFC percentages (<0.001) and the clinical  outcomes (relapse risk, disease-free survival and overall survival) of study participants. 3. Integrate germline variation and all subclonal mutations into mechanistic groups that are frequently  mutated in pediatric AML and correlate with outcomes using unbiased machine learning  algorithms. Preliminary data tells us that every patient will have multiple subclones at diagnosis and EOI1  as well as germline variants in AML-associated genes, which may be important for outcome. In this aim, we  will take these mutations into account as well as MPFC, clinical features and cytogenetics for probabilistic  risk assessment using unsupervised machine learning algorithms for improved outcome prognostication. Narrative We have developed Error-Corrected Sequencing (ECS) that enables the highly accurate detection of leukemia- specific mutations in heterogeneous DNA samples to a limit of 0.0001. We will perform ECS with a panel of 94 frequently mutated genes in adult and pediatric AML in matched diagnostic and end of Induction 1 bone marrow samples from 990 pediatric de novo AML patients enrolled on the Children's Oncology Group AAML1031 protocol, which is the largest pediatric AML trial ever performed in North America. With these data, we can truly understand subclonal heterogeneity in pediatric AML, significantly improve minimal residual disease testing in pediatric AML, and integrate these data into an unbiased multivariate probability platform taking into account individual sequencing, flow cytometry, cytogenetic and clinical features to provide truly personalized cancer care.",APPLYING ERROR-CORRECTED SEQUENCING TO DETECT MINIMAL RESIDUAL IN THE AAML 1031 STUDY,10063814,R01CA211711,"['Acute Myelocytic Leukemia', 'Adult', 'Adult Acute Myeloblastic Leukemia', 'Alleles', 'BAY 54-9085', 'Biological Markers', 'Bone Marrow', 'Bortezomib', 'Categories', 'Cessation of life', 'Childhood', 'Childhood Acute Myeloid Leukemia', 'Childhood Leukemia', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Cytogenetics', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Enrollment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Exons', 'FLT3 gene', 'Family', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hematology', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Normal Cell', 'North America', 'Oncogenes', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pediatric Oncology Group', 'Phase', 'Point Mutation', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protein Tyrosine Kinase', 'Protein phosphatase', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reagent', 'Recurrent disease', 'Refractory Disease', 'Relapse', 'Residual Neoplasm', 'Residual Tumors', 'Residual state', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Spliceosomes', 'Surface', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'analytical method', 'base', 'chemotherapy', 'cohesion', 'design', 'detection limit', 'digital', 'falls', 'functional group', 'gene function', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'insight', 'leukemia', 'leukemia treatment', 'machine learning algorithm', 'next generation', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'nucleocytoplasmic transport', 'outcome prediction', 'pediatric patients', 'personalized cancer care', 'personalized medicine', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'randomized trial', 'relapse risk', 'response', 'risk stratification', 'specific biomarkers', 'subclonal heterogeneity', 'transcription factor', 'unsupervised learning']",NCI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,352587
"Discovery and clinical validation of host  biomarkers of disease severity and multi-system inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) with Covid-19 ABSTRACT Novel approaches for early and accurate diagnosis of COVID-19 associated syndromes and evaluation of clinical severity and outcomes of COVID-19 disease in children are urgently needed. The overarching goal of this grant proposal is to develop clinical assays that can evaluate and predict severity of pediatric COVID-19 disease, ranging from asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic to severe manifestations such as multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C). To date, we have collected and biobanked clinical samples from more than 400 patients across 3 academic hospitals, including approximately 100 patients with MIS-C. In the first R61 phase of this project, we will continue to enroll patients with pediatric COVID-19 and MIS-C for sample collection and longitudinal chart review and testing (Aim 1), leverage machine learning to identify diagnostic and prognostic “omics” host biomarkers based on RNA transcriptome profiling from nasal swab and whole blood samples (Aim 2) and cell-free DNA analysis from plasma (Aim 3), and generate predictive models of clinical severity and outcomes by incorporating longitudinal clinical, laboratory, viral, and omics data (Aim 4). Our rationale for including these samples is that they are routinely obtained in hospitals and clinics and permit easy and noninvasive collection without any special processing or handling requirements, which will accelerate the development of omics-based clinical assays. Our Go/No-Go transition milestones for transition to the R33 phase after 2 years include: (1) collection of longitudinal samples from a minimum of 120 patients for each identified presentation (mildly symptomatic outpatient, severely ill in the ICU, and MIS-C) and a comparable number of matched controls, (2) generation of panels of candidate of severity and confirmation of a subset of biomarkers by qPCR, (3) development of classifier models using machine learning using the biomarkers alone (for clinical assay development), and (4) combining these omics biomarkers with additional clinical, viral, and laboratory biomarkers into combined classifier models using machine learning. For the classifier models, the minimum/goal performance requirements would be 70%/>80% sensitivity and 80%/>90% specificity. In the second R33 phase, we propose to develop host-based clinical assays for diagnosis and severity prediction of COVID-19-associated syndromes, including MIS-C, in children from nasal swabs and blood (Aim 5) and validate these biomarker panels as a Laboratory Developed Test (LDT) in a CLIA (Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments) diagnostic laboratory (Aim 6). These assays will be evaluated for accuracy, precision, reproducibility, limits of detection (LOD), matrix effect, interference, among other performance characteristics. We will work closely with the RADx-rad Data Coordination Center (DCC) on assay development, testing, and validation for submission to the FDA for Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) and timely deployment of these assays for clinical use. PROJECT NARRATIVE Novel approaches to accurately diagnose acute pediatric COVID-19 associated diseases, including the Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C), as well as predict clinical severity and outcomes, are urgently needed.

"Novel Optimization Methods and Treatment Planning System for Clinically-Deliverable Truly-Hybrid Proton-Photon Radiotherapy Project Summary  Radiotherapy (RT) aims to deliver tumoricidal dose to clinical target volume (CTV) while sparing organs at risk (OAR), for which proton and photon beams are naturally complementary to each other: protons are generally better for OAR sparing, while photons are more robust to delivery uncertainties for CTV coverage. The hybrid proton-photon RT has a long history. However, as it generates proton and photon plans separately without fully utilizing joint proton-photon optimization during the planning stage, current hybrid RT is pseudo- hybrid and very limited in plan quality, treatment sites, and broad applicability. The key to leapfrog from pseudo-hybrid to truly-hybrid RT is new joint proton-photon optimization method that synergizes complementary proton and photon beams. The hypothesis is that truly-hybrid RT via appropriate joint proton- photon optimization will be more favorable than proton or photon-only RT, in terms of CTV coverage robustness and OAR sparing optimality.  Broad applicability of truly-hybrid RT to patients: (A) Clinical applicability: unlike pseudo-hybrid RT that is limited in plan quality and treatment sites, truly-hybrid RT may become a new paradigm for general cancer RT, owing to its superior plan quality and thus potentially clinical outcomes to proton-only or photon-only RT. (B) Clinical workflow: our truly-hybrid plans can be individually and safely delivered on existing proton and photon machines, and this effort envisions patients being treated in an integrated cancer center like ours with both proton and photon equipment, under the direction of a single physician, using shared immobilization devices, simulation procedure and structure set, and integrated treatment planning and delivery system. (C) Patient coverage: truly-hybrid RT can be made broadly available to many cancer patients through existing infrastructures in US, since (1) most hospitals with proton centers also have photon centers; (2) 76% of cancer patients live in the states with operational proton centers, while 85% are within 100-mile (2-hour-driving) distances to these proton centers; (3) cancer patients are more willing to travel for advanced treatment options.  Proposed effort: Inspired by unprecedented plan quality and broad applicability of truly-hybrid RT via our joint proton-photon optimization method, the next step is to test the hypothesis prospectively via clinical trials. However, a missing prerequisite to advance truly-hybrid RT from research to clinic is a treatment planning system (TPS) that can generate clinically-deliverable hybrid plans. To meet this urgent need, this effort will develop novel optimization methods and TPS for clinically-deliverable truly-hybrid RT, which is a radical step towards prospective clinical trials for testing the hypothesis.  Aim 1: Optimization methods and TPS for clinically-deliverable truly-hybrid RT.  Aim 2: Optimization methods for accurate and efficient MCO truly-hybrid planning.  Aim 3: Deep learning based optimization methods for efficient truly-hybrid planning. Project Narrative  This project will develop truly-”2D” proton-photon joint optimization methods for clinically-deliverable truly- hybrid RT with unprecedented superior plan quality to proton-only and photon-only RT, and first-of-its-kind TPS to bridge truly-hybrid RT from research to clinic. This hybrid TPS can facilitate prospective clinical trials of a broad spectrum of treatment sites for many patients. If succeed, truly-hybrid RT via this first-of-its-kind TPS will likely warrant improved clinical outcomes with reduced OAR toxicities, and potentially become a new paradigm for cancer RT in general, with compelling benefits in both treatment cost and clinical outcomes.",Novel Optimization Methods and Treatment Planning System for Clinically-Deliverable Truly-Hybrid Proton-Photon Radiotherapy,10207870,R37CA250921,"['Automobile Driving', 'Bathing', 'Cancer Center', 'Cancer Patient', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Devices', 'Dose', 'Equipment', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Hybrids', 'Immobilization', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Joints', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Photons', 'Physicians', 'Procedures', 'Protons', 'Radiation therapy', 'Radiotherapy Research', 'Recording of previous events', 'Risk', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Toxic effect', 'Travel', 'Treatment Cost', 'Uncertainty', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer radiation therapy', 'clinical application', 'deep learning', 'improved', 'innovation', 'novel', 'prospective', 'simulation', 'success', 'treatment planning', 'treatment site']",NCI,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R37,2021,356850
"Understanding the mechanisms by which weight change affects progression of knee osteoarthritis in obese and overweight individuals: An analysis of the Osteoarthritis Initiative Dataset Project Summary Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative joint disease which affects more than 27 million people in the US and is the single most common cause of disability in older adults. The number of people affected with symptomatic OA will increase due to the aging of the population and the growing number of people with obesity, which represents an established risk factor for OA. Obesity has become a US “epidemic,” and projections have suggested that 86.3% of adults in the United States will be overweight or obese by 2030. Obesity is a modifiable risk factor for OA with weight loss offering a potential non-invasive therapy for disease prevention in obese and overweight individuals. Research has shown that weight loss slows OA progression and weight gain exacerbates progression. However, these studies did not specifically assess factors or pathways which would be responsible for improved or worse outcomes, such as associated inflammation, local body composition and sarcopenia. In the current proposal, we will comprehensibly examine the mechanisms associated with mechanical loading (weight loss and gain) that are responsible for driving knee joint degenerative changes including cartilage loss, namely concurrent changes in inflammation, local body composition (periarticular fat), and muscle morphology and strength. Identifying which mechanism(s) are most beneficial for slowing OA progression during weight loss will lead to targeted therapies for effective and optimized treatment of OA at early stages of disease during which progression may be prevented. Through pathway analysis, mediation analysis, and machine learning, we will identify potential preventive measures (such as muscle strengthening and anti-inflammatory measures) that could amplify the positive effects of reduced mechanical loading on OA. Thus, the clinical impact of our project is development of a subject-specific prediction model for clinicians to individually-tailor treatment plans that slow joint breakdown, and decrease probability for invasive and costly surgeries such as total knee arthroplasty. Three specific aims are proposed: Specific Aim 1: We will characterize the associations between changes in weight with changes in knee joint inflammation, local body composition, muscle cross-sectional area (CSA), fat infiltration and muscle strength, and investigate the associations between these parameters and progression of knee degenerative changes. Specific Aim 2: Using a path analysis we will explore the mechanisms by which weight change impacts OA progression, and quantify the degree to which these factors mediate this relationship. Specific Aim 3: Finally, we will develop a prediction model using machine learning to determine which demographic, clinical, and MRI features (including changes in local body composition, inflammation, muscle) can predict progression of OA over 8 years. Project Narrative (Public Health Relevance) While obesity is a modifiable risk factor for osteoarthritis (OA), studies analyzing the impact of weight loss in overweight and obese people have found inconsistent results on structural progression of knee OA. One potential explanation for these findings, and at the same time a major gap of knowledge in previous research, is that studies have not specifically assessed factors or pathways which, together with mechanical load, are responsible for improved or worse outcomes, such as associated inflammation, local body composition and sarcopenia. The overall goal of our proposal is to elucidate which mechanisms are responsible for slowing progression during weight loss, and which are most beneficial to develop individualized treatment plans targeting specific pathways that will enhance the positive effects of weight loss on slowing OA progression.",Understanding the mechanisms by which weight change affects progression of knee osteoarthritis in obese and overweight individuals: An analysis of the Osteoarthritis Initiative Dataset,10180705,R01AR078917,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biochemistry', 'Biomechanics', 'Body Composition', 'Body Weight Changes', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Cartilage', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Epidemic', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Infiltration', 'Inflammation', 'Joints', 'Knee', 'Knee Osteoarthritis', 'Knee joint', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Morphology', 'Muscle', 'Obesity', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Overweight', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Preventive measure', 'Probability', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Stress', 'Structural defect', 'Structure', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'United States', 'Weight', 'Weight Gain', 'base', 'cost', 'disability', 'disorder prevention', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'joint destruction', 'joint inflammation', 'knee replacement arthroplasty', 'mechanical load', 'modifiable risk', 'muscle form', 'muscle strength', 'novel', 'obese person', 'personalized risk prediction', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'risk prediction model', 'sarcopenia', 'strength training', 'targeted treatment', 'treatment optimization', 'treatment planning']",NIAMS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2021,714433
"PREcision Care In Cardiac ArrEst - ICECAP (PRECICECAP) Project Summary The objective of PREcision Care In Cardiac ArrEst - ICECAP (PRECICECAP) is to discover novel biomarker signatures of post cardiac arrest brain and extracerebral organ failure that predict treatment responsiveness and long-term recovery. We will achieve this by partnering with the ICECAP trial, a response-adaptive dose finding clinical research trial that seeks to determine the optimal duration of post-arrest hypothermia. Cardiac arrest is a major public health problem with high morbidity and mortality. Four in five patients hospitalized after cardiac arrest have significant brain injury, and death from neurologic damage is common. Improving survival and functional recovery is a critical public health objective and will require innovative approaches. The current clinical situation is unprecedented. Currently post-CA brain injury is an acute, sudden critical illness with major knowledge gaps about how best to characterize severity of injury and to identify which individual patients are likely to benefit from specific neuroprotective strategies. Thus, development of high- performing biomarker signatures is a critical need and would translate in to immediate changes in care. We hypothesize that not all patients are identical (i.e. there will be a heterogeneity of treatment effect) and that through our innovative, multi-parametric data driven approach, we will be able to identify novel signatures that define subgroups of patients. Advanced data science and analytical approaches will allow the identification of these subgroups that was previously not possible. These subgroups will be clinically important insofar as they will indicate differential responses to treatment and different trajectories of functional recovery. This project will acquire high resolution multi-modal data early in the disease course that will allow us to address these current knowledge gaps and improve our understanding of the disease in the early acute setting when interventions can improve outcome. The knowledge learned here will be applied to develop personalized treatments for cardiac arrest survivors, addressing the NIH's and our goals of lengthening life and reducing disability. Project Narrative Post-cardiac arrest injury affects the brain and other critical organs and is a major public health problem causing significant death and disability. This project will use novel data-driven approaches to collect high resolution monitoring data from patients in the critical care unit and will use that multi-parametric data to develop newly defined patient sub-groups with differing clinical trajectories and responses to therapies. This project will have a major impact on public health by allowing treatment of the right patient at the right time with the right therapy, thereby reducing disability and saving lives.",PREcision Care In Cardiac ArrEst - ICECAP (PRECICECAP),10099869,R01NS119825,"['Acute', 'Acute Disease', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Death', 'Brain Injuries', 'Cardiopulmonary', 'Cardiopulmonary Physiology', 'Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Critical Care', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Heart Arrest', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hypoxic-Ischemic Brain Injury', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologic Examination', 'Neurosciences', 'Organ', 'Organ failure', 'Outcome', 'Patient Rights', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Public Health', 'Pupil light reflex', 'Recovery', 'Recovery of Function', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Rewarming', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Savings', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Standardization', 'Subgroup', 'Survivors', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Titrations', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Work', 'advanced analytics', 'arm', 'base', 'biomarker signature', 'candidate marker', 'clinical care', 'clinical predictors', 'design', 'disability', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'natural hypothermia', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'outcome prediction', 'patient subsets', 'personalized care', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'prognostic value', 'prospective', 'random forest', 'response', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'treatment arm', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response', 'unsupervised learning']",NINDS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,1648754
"Timeliness of Management of Trauma Related Hemorrhage and Trauma Related Coagulopathy PROJECT SUMMARY Injury is the most common cause of death in people younger than 46 years of age, and bleeding after injury is the most common cause of preventable death. Treatment of bleeding requires timely procedures to stop the bleeding as well as medications and blood transfusions to prevent blood thinning. Hospitals that specialize in treating injury have protocols, medications, devices and clinical staff available 24 hours a day and seven days a week. Injured people treated at specialized hospitals are more likely to live. However, there are far too many injured people every year than can be treated at specialized hospitals so minor injuries are cared for at hospitals not specialized in treating injuries. Severely injured people are taken to hospitals not specialized in treating injuries when specialized hospitals are too far away, or the emergency medical personnel underestimate how seriously injured someone is. Hospitals not specialized in treating injuries do not participate in ongoing injury clinical trials, regional data registries nor national quality improvement programs, and as a result what happens there that leads to people bleeding to death is unknown. This application's long-term objective is to improve the timeliness of treatment of bleeding after injury. The Specific Aims will be to: 1) understand how bleeding after injury is managed in hospitals that do and do not specialize in treating injuries; 2) identify the reasons patients do not get timely treatment; and3) determine how to improve the timeliness of treatment. The central hypothesis is that treatment of bleeding is not standardized in hospitals not specialized in treating injuries and leads to a delay in transferring injured people to specialized hospitals. Identifying modifiable healthcare system, hospital, and patient factors can inform the design of a systematic process to quickly temporarily stabalize bleeding of injured people initially at non-specialized centers then expedite transfer to specialized hospitals by engaging key stakeholders from across the spectrum of hospitals. This will ensure that people who are bleeding after injury are cared for at the right place at the right time. Ultimately, the right treatment at the right time will give people initially taken to hospitals not specialized in treating injuries the same chance at life as those taken to specialized hospitals. As a Career Development Award, the proposed training plan will include training in data science, systems engineering and design. The methods to be learned and employed will be machine learning, failure mode, effects and criticality analysis and user-centered design. The health relatedness of the project is to understand current practice management of bleeding after injury, in order to improve the timeliness of bleeding treatments to enhance the health of injured inviduals. PROJECT NARRATIVE Injury is the most common cause of death in people under 46 years old with more than 200,000 Americans dying annually. Bleeding accounts for 30% of deaths after injury, most of which are preventable if patients receive timely bleeding treatments including procedures to stop the bleeding as well as medications and blood transfusions to prevent blood thinning. The proposed resarch will understand how bleeding after injury is managed in hospitals that do and do not specialize in injury care, identify the reasons patients do not get timely treatment, and then create an improved systematic process by engaging key stakeholders from across the spectrum of hospitals caring for injured people.",Timeliness of Management of Trauma Related Hemorrhage and Trauma Related Coagulopathy,10203288,K23HL157832,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Adherence', 'Age-Years', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'American College of Surgeons', 'Area', 'Bleeding time procedure', 'Blood', 'Blood Coagulation Disorders', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood Transfusion', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Chicago', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Devices', 'Emergency Medical Technicians', 'Emergency medical service', 'Ensure', 'Failure', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hemostatic Agents', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Illinois', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Interventional radiology', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Minor', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Transfer', 'Patient Triage', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Practice Management', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Provider', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Resuscitation', 'Special Hospitals', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Testing', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Time Management', 'Training', 'Trauma', 'Trauma patient', 'Traumatic injury', 'Triage', 'United States', 'Work', 'blood product', 'clinical care', 'data modeling', 'data registry', 'design', 'engineering design', 'high risk', 'improved', 'injured', 'mortality', 'patient oriented', 'prevent', 'preventable death', 'programs', 'prototype', 'severe injury', 'standardized care', 'stroke patient', 'supervised learning', 'time use', 'trauma care', 'trauma centers', 'user centered design']",NHLBI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,K23,2021,190279
"Hemostasis, Hematoma Expansion, and Outcomes After Intracerebral Hemorrhage PROJECT SUMMARY Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is the most morbid form of stroke and has no treatment approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. Hematoma expansion (HE), interval growth of the hematoma, is a proximate cause of worse patient outcomes and death as larger hematomas displace brain tissue; hematomas > 60 mL reliably lead to disability or death at follow-up. Preventing HE is a promising strategy to improve outcomes for patients with ICH. Our relative inability to predict HE, however, has impeded the development of effective treatment strategies for ICH, and several clinical trials have been unsuccessful. Even when HE has been reduced, our ability to detect a benefit is hampered by relatively insensitive patient outcomes. This proposal will resolve two roadblocks that prevent the development of effective treatments for ICH, the most morbid form of stroke. Three comprehensive stroke centers (two from the Northwestern Medicine system in metropolitan Chicago, IL, and the University of Texas at Houston) will partner to prospectively enroll patients with ICH, measure hemostasis, measure HE, and record patient outcomes with state of the art assessments, including the NIH Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) and NIH Toolbox. First, we will determine the mechanisms that lead to HE in acute ICH, broadly grouped into platelet activity, activation of coagulation, and fibrinolysis. Each can be specifically measured and has specific treatments to improve it. For example, reduced platelet activity due to aspirin can be reliably improved with desmopressin, delayed activation of coagulation may be related to hypomagnesemia, and accelerated fibrinolysis may be reduced with tranexamic acid or aminocaproic acid. Each will be examined for predicting HE; if multiple pathways are found, we will determine which are most important with machine learning. Once the most important mechanisms of hemostasis for HE are determined, we will explore if specific therapies improve platelet activity. It is possible that specific treatments for specific deficits in hemostasis will be more likely to reduce HE than single therapies applied to ICH patients generally (e.g., Factor VII). Once hemostatic mechanisms of HE are determine, we will determine the effect of HE on patient outcomes such as the modified Rankin Scale (mRS, a global ordinal scale), PROMIS, and NIH Toolbox. This will be crucial to plan for future clinical trials intended to improve patient outcomes through correcting abnormal hemostasis in acute ICH. Results will apply broadly to other bleeding conditions (e.g., neurotrauma). PROJECT NARRATIVE Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is the most morbid form of stroke. Hematoma expansion is a proximate cause of worse outcome after ICH, yet our ability to predict HE is limited. This proposal will determine how platelet activity, activation of coagulation, and fibrinolysis predict HE, and how HE, in turn, affect patient outcomes.","Hemostasis, Hematoma Expansion, and Outcomes After Intracerebral Hemorrhage",10133760,R01NS110779,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Age', 'American', 'Aminocaproic Acids', 'Antifibrinolytic Agents', 'Aspirin', 'Blood Coagulation Factor VII', 'Blood Platelets', 'Brain Injuries', 'Cerebral hemisphere hemorrhage', 'Cessation of life', 'Chicago', 'Clinical Trials', 'Coagulation Process', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Desmopressin', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Enrollment', 'Factor VIIa', 'Fibrinolysis', 'Future', 'Growth', 'Hematoma', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hemostatic Agents', 'Hemostatic function', 'Hypomagnesemia', 'Image', 'Information Systems', 'Intervention', 'Intuition', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Myocardial Ischemia', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Platelet Transfusion', 'Population', 'Quality of life', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Stroke', 'Survivors', 'System', 'Texas', 'Thrombelastography', 'Tranexamic Acid', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Vascular Diseases', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'brain tissue', 'clopidogrel', 'disability', 'effective therapy', 'follow-up', 'health related quality of life', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'machine learning algorithm', 'metropolitan', 'point of care', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'stroke trials', 'treatment strategy']",NINDS,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2021,609173
"A novel microfluidic platform to study exosome biology in PAH. The endothelium is the cellular monolayer that covers the inner lining of the entire circulatory system. Endothelial dysfunction is a feature of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), a life-threatening disease associated with abnormally high pulmonary pressures and chronic right heart failure. Due to the limitations of available static cell culture and animal models, our understanding of the mechanisms that orchestrate the initiation and perseverance of endothelial dysfunction in PAH remains incomplete. Given that endothelial dysfunction is a common finding in PAH, an understanding of the mechanism behind maladaptive endothelial responses could help accelerate the discovery of novel therapies for PAH. Presently, it is believed that endothelial derived exosomes contribute to PAH by carrying signals that trigger maladaptive endothelial responses in the setting of injury. Exosomes are cell-derived small (~30-150 nm) extracellular vesicles that carry proteins, metabolites and nucleic acids involved in a variety of physiological and pathological processes. While it is known that exosomes carry molecular and genetic factors associated with angiogenesis, inflammation and vasoreactivity, a comprehensive assessment of exosome cargo of healthy and dysfunctional PMVECs has been hindered by current low-yield exosome isolation techniques. These techniques cannot perform real-time dynamic exosome isolation from pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (PMVECs) exposed to PAH-associated stressors. To address this unmet need, we have designed the MFES (Multifunctional Exosome Sorter) that can dissect the whole exosome population into subpopulations based on size and surface markers. MFES is the first lab-on-a-chip platform that integrates: 1) a vessel-on-a-chip module for real-time characterization of PMVEC functional responses across a wide range of physiological and pathological parameters, 2) a module for high-yield exosome size-based isolation, 3) a surface marker based exosome sorting using magnetic beads, and 4) multi-omics phenotyping of exosomes of PMVECs. Here, we are proposing a technology that can enable broadly to investigate the two main defining characteristics of exosomal subtypes, i.e., size and surface markers, both separately independently, and in combination sequentially. We will characterize changes in exosome cargo in healthy and PAH PMVECs exposed to shear stress-related conditions in the MFES. We will isolate subpopulations of exosomes based on size and surface markers and characterize them for their cargo (Aim 1). Then, we will determine whether exosomes derived from stressed PMVECs can induce pathological changes in healthy PMVECs cultured in a microfluidic culture chip (Aim 2). This technological innovation enables to study endothelial exosome biology in a setting that represents the flow dynamics associated with PAH. Further, the use of cutting-edge -omics technologies, bioinformatic analysis integrated with machine learning algorithms to analyze the purified exosomes is expected to yield a comprehensive dataset of exosome cargo profiles and open exciting opportunities for investigating the biological role of exosomes in PAH pathobiology and the testing of novel therapeutic agents. Due to the limitations of available static cell culture and animal models, our understanding of the mechanisms that orchestrate the initiation and perseverance of endothelial dysfunction in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) remains incomplete. The endothelial cell derived exosomes, small (~30-150 nm) extracellular vesicles, contribute to PAH by carrying signals that trigger maladaptive endothelial responses in the setting of injury via molecular and genetic factors associated with angiogenesis, inflammation and vasoreactivity. However, a comprehensive assessment of exosomal cargo of healthy and dysfunctional pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (PMVECs) has been hindered by current low-yield exosome isolation techniques that integrates real-time exosome capture from PMVECs exposed to PAH-associated high shear stress. We propose to develop a lab-on-a-chip platform technology, Multifunctional Exosome Sorter (MFES), that can dissect the whole exosome population into subpopulations based on size and surface markers integrating; (i) a vessel-on-a-chip module, (ii) a high-yield exosome size-based isolation module, (iii) a magnetic bead-based surface biomarker sorting chamber, and (iv) multi-omics phenotyping of exosomes investigating the biological role of exosomes in PAH pathobiology, where such a technological innovation will uniquely enable to study the biology of exosome subsets associated with flow dynamics in PAH.",A novel microfluidic platform to study exosome biology in PAH.,10158068,R21HL156761,"['Acoustics', 'Address', 'Animal Model', 'Antibodies', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Blood Vessels', 'CD81 gene', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Culture Media', 'Cultured Cells', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Endothelium', 'Etiology', 'Experimental Models', 'Exposure to', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Heart failure', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Injury', 'Lab-On-A-Chips', 'Life', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Microfluidics', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Physiological Processes', 'Population', 'Process', 'Production', 'Proteomics', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Seeds', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Stress', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Time', 'Vascular remodeling', 'Vision', 'angiogenesis', 'base', 'cytokine', 'design', 'endothelial dysfunction', 'exosome', 'extracellular vesicles', 'hemodynamics', 'machine learning algorithm', 'magnetic beads', 'monolayer', 'multiple omics', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'pressure', 'protein metabolite', 'pulmonary arterial hypertension', 'response', 'shear stress', 'stressor', 'technological innovation', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NHLBI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R21,2021,236363
"Peripheral blood mononuclear cell epigenetic associations in and biomarkers for knee osteoarthritis development and progression Project Summary / Abstract The objective of the proposed research is to better understand how peripheral blood epigenetic patterns are associated with knee osteoarthritis (OA). A great deal of work has already been demonstrated widespread epigenetic changes within articular tissues in both knee and hip OA. Others have described serum and urine protein biomarkers as predictors of future knee OA progression. Our first Aim is to evaluate peripheral blood cell DNA epigenetic patterns in baseline blood samples from patients who will go on to have rapid radiographc and/or pain progression in the subsequent 24 months. We will then use these data to develop develop and evaluate the performance of epigenetic algorithmic models to discriminate these groups. Patient samples will parallel the National Institutes of Health OA Biomarkers Consortium (OABC-FNIH) study. DNA methylation will be evaluated using a next-generation bisulfite sequencing approach (methylSeq), and algorithms developed using cutting-edge machine learning techniques. We will then translate our findings into a more high- throughput, inexpensive, and clinically relevant form by developing and validating a targeted capture sequencing system to interrogate these specific epigenetic locations. Our second Aim is to evaluate the peripheral blood DNA methylation patterns that precede the development of OA, using samples from 48-, 24-, 12-, and 0-months before incident OA. We will again develop algorithms to predict future OA development using similar techniques as Aim 1 and translate this to a targeted capture sequencing system. This unique longitudinal approach which will allow us not only to determine whether and when epigenetic patterns develop preceding OA development, but also track longitudinal epigenetic changes as OA develops. The proposed work is important, as there are no FDA approved biomarkers for OA diagnosis or prognosis. Our work is quite innovative both in its combination of ""big data"" epigenetic analysis and cutting-edge machine learning techniques applied to a specific clinical problem, as well as in its examination of PBMC epigenetics in OA, which has not yet been described. Moreover, we tackle the problem of translation of big-data research by aiming specifically to develop high-throughput methods to translate our findings into a clinically-relevant and accessible form. Success in our proposal will produce both algorithmic models with direct clinical impact to predict future OA development and progression, as well as broaden our understanding of epigenetic changes in peripheral blood cells from OA patients. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because a better understanding of blood epigenetic patterns in osteoarthritis (OA) is likely not only to give insights into the causes of OA, but also to give rise to new biomarkers to assist physicians and researchers diagnose OA patients and predict how rapidly they will worsen over time.
