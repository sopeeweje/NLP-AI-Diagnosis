"Academy of Aphasia Research and Training Symposium PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The annual Academy of Aphasia meeting is the premier conference for researchers in the field of language processing and aphasia. Since the first meeting in 1963, this international meeting has brought together an interdisciplinary group of linguists, psychologists, neurologists, and speech-language pathologists to discuss the latest research in the field of aphasia, including theoretical, clinical, and rehabilitation aspects of this language disorder. The topics at the conference range widely but almost always cover all aspects of language processing including phonological processing, lexical-semantic processing, syntactic processing, orthographic processing, bilingualism, computational modeling, non-invasive and invasive brain imaging, language recovery, neuroplasticity, and rehabilitation. In this proposal, we aim to include two special initiatives that will take place during the annual academy of aphasia conference. The first initiative involves a formal mentoring program for young investigators entering the field of aphasia research. In this program, selected student/post-doctoral fellows from interdisciplinary backgrounds who are first authors at the conference are paired with a mentor. This mentor will provide specific feedback about the fellow's presentation and general mentorship to the fellow about research and academic careers. This program is currently occurring as part of the conference and has been growing at the annual meeting with very positive feedback. Additionally, a formal mentoring meeting will allow a structured format for discussion about a career in aphasia research. The second initiative will be a three hour seminar (New Frontiers in Aphasia Research) that covers the background and approach of a state of the art methodology (e.g., fNIRS, graph theoretical metric, machine learning approaches) that has an application to the study of aphasia. These workshops will be recorded and, consequently, uploaded to the academy website/youtube channel for dissemination to aphasia researchers and the public. This workshop will allow conference attendees to understand the conceptual and methodological aspect of a particular scientific approach that can be implemented in their study of aphasia. Given the highly interdisciplinary nature of aphasia research, these workshops will bridge the communication between aphasia researchers and scientists and experts who have developed new approaches to study the brain. This meeting already allows a valuable opportunity for cross-pollination of research ideas and will now provide a platform for the training the next generation of scientists interested in pursuing the nature of aphasia and associated language disorders in adults. PROJECT NARRATIVE Approximately 100,000 individuals suffer from aphasia each year. The academy of aphasia is an organization of clinicians, scientists and practitioners who study this communication disorder and develop interventions to treat individuals with aphasia. The members comprise a very interdisciplinary group of linguists, psychologists, speech and language clinicians, neurologists and neuroscientists. The annual academy of aphasia meeting is the premier venue to share state of the art methodologies for application in the study of aphasia to improve the research in the development of diagnosis and treatment approaches to alleviate aphasia. This conference is also the ideal venue to educate and train the next generation of aphasia researchers who are well trained from a theoretical, technical and clinical standpoint and are committed to expand the impact of research in aphasia.",Academy of Aphasia Research and Training Symposium,10194459,R13DC017375,"['Academy', 'Adult', 'Aphasia', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Chicago', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Committee Membership', 'Communication', 'Communication impairment', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Discipline', 'Educational workshop', 'Feedback', 'Fellowship', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Governing Board', 'Grant', 'Graph', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Individual', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Language Disorders', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuscripts', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders', 'Nature', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologist', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Neurosciences', 'Non-aphasic', 'Orthography', 'Outcome', 'Pathologist', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Production', 'Psychologist', 'Psychology', 'Publishing', 'Reading', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Research Training', 'Rest', 'Retrieval', 'Scientist', 'Secure', 'Speech', 'Speech Pathologist', 'Speech Perception', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training and Education', 'Transcranial magnetic stimulation', 'Travel', 'Videotape', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'bilingualism', 'career', 'career networking', 'experience', 'frontier', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'interest', 'language processing', 'lexical', 'meetings', 'member', 'neuroimaging', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'outcome forecast', 'phonology', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'semantic processing', 'success', 'symposium', 'syntax', 'tenure track', 'web site']",NIDCD,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),R13,2021,39939
"Communication Bridge: A person-centered Internet-based intervention for individuals with primary progressive aphasia Language impairment (aphasia) is the defining feature of the clinical dementia syndrome primary progressive aphasia (PPA) and significantly compromises the diagnosed individual’s independence and activities of daily living. There are currently no treatments to reverse the degenerative process responsible for PPA, which is caused by Alzheimer’s disease or a form of frontotemporal lobar degeneration. Nonpharmacological interventions including speech-language treatment may offer significant benefit to the diagnosed individual’s quality of life, but there are few efficacy studies and no guidelines to direct best clinical care practices. There are also several barriers to accessing care. Individuals with PPA are under-referred for nonpharmacological services, making it challenging for families to find care unless the individual with PPA lives near an informed specialist. Evidence-based research outcomes from speech-language therapy studies are promising but have been limited to case reports or small groups of local patients and often lack a control group. This project will circumvent both geographic limitations and poor access to care by using a previously validated telepractice model to deliver speech-language treatments to adults with PPA. The proposed study will use a randomized controlled trial design (RCT) to evaluate whether a person-centered treatment (Experimental) for adults with mild PPA maximizes functional communication participation as compared to a dose-matched impairment-only treatment (Control). Ninety individuals with a diagnosis of PPA and their actively-engaged care partners will be enrolled into the study. Both the Experimental and Control arms of the study will receive treatment and evaluations over the course of 12 months. The trial will be supported by a custom web-application, which has an aphasia-friendly design and provides a place for participants to connect to evaluation and treatment sessions. Participants will also use the web-application to receive weekly To-Do lists of home exercises, which are provided to reinforce evidence-based strategies learned during treatment sessions and to facilitate implementation into the context of daily life. Aim 1 will determine the within-group response of the Experimental and Control treatments for individuals with PPA. Aim 2 will determine between group differences in treatment outcomes. In the absence of a cure for dementia, it is important to identify and evaluate strategies that help individuals maximize their quality of life, and this study will help fulfill this need. In the absence of a cure for dementia, it is important to identify evidence-based strategies that maximize quality of life and independence. This study will evaluate the effectiveness of two interventions using a creative telepractice model for individuals with primary progressive aphasia (PPA). Outcomes from this study will inform clinical guidelines for effective language treatment in PPA, which can be adapted for other dementia syndromes.",Communication Bridge: A person-centered Internet-based intervention for individuals with primary progressive aphasia,10129873,R01AG055425,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Adult', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Aphasia', 'Blinded', 'Caring', 'Case Study', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communication', 'Control Groups', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Dementia', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Enrollment', 'Evaluation', 'Exercise', 'Family', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Frontotemporal Lobar Degenerations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Home environment', 'Impairment', 'Improve Access', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Insurance', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Language', 'Language Therapy', 'Life', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Outcomes Research', 'Participant', 'Partner Communications', 'Pathologist', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Primary Progressive Aphasia', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Sample Size', 'Services', 'Severity of illness', 'Specialist', 'Speech', 'Syndrome', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Withdrawal', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'clinical care', 'design', 'eHealth', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'efficacy study', 'evidence base', 'experimental arm', 'experimental group', 'language impairment', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'person centered', 'personalized care', 'premature', 'primary outcome', 'response', 'restoration', 'skills', 'stroke-induced aphasia', 'translational neuroscience', 'treatment center', 'treatment program', 'treatment response', 'trial design', 'web app', 'web-based intervention']",NIA,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2021,924106
"Center for the Study of Aphasia Recovery (C-STAR) Summary: Overall section Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability in the United States, making it a major public health concern (1). Approximately a quarter of all chronic stroke survivors present with aphasia, a language disorder caused by damage to the speech and language areas of the brain (3, 4). In a recently published report, Simmons-Mackie (1) estimates that over two million people in North America are currently living with aphasia. Stroke is typically thought to affect older persons; however, the incidence of stroke in younger individuals has been steadily increasing (2). In fact, at least half of all stroke patients in the state of South Carolina are under the age of 60 (2). Aphasia can vary in severity from very profound impairment that renders patients mute and without the ability to understand others’ speech, to milder forms where patients have great difficulty retrieving specific words. In the chronic stage of stroke, aphasia has been identified as the strongest predictor of poor quality of life. Aphasia not only influences the ability to communicate with family and friends, but also drastically decreases education and employment opportunities. Although some degree of spontaneous recovery from aphasia is typical in the first weeks and months following stroke, many patients are left with devastating communication problems and never fully recover. To address the need for studies improving long-term outcomes in aphasia, the Center for the Study of Aphasia Recovery (C-STAR), funded for just under four years at the time of this application, has made great progress towards understanding the mechanisms that promote spontaneous and therapy-induced recovery in aphasia. The overarching goal of the research proposed in this renewal application is to maintain our focus on aphasia therapy. Specifically, during the next funding phase, the focus of C-STAR is to improve access to aphasia therapy, enhance the effect of behavioral aphasia therapy to promote an improved aphasia therapy outcome, and understand overall health and neurolinguistic factors that influence aphasia recovery. To accomplish our research goals, this project will continue to rely on collaboration among five main investigators: Drs. Julius Fridriksson, Argye Hillis, Leonardo Bonilha, Chris Rorden, and Greg Hickok. Projects led by Fridriksson (chronic patients) and Hillis (acute patients) will continue to focus on factors that may promote improved outcome of aphasia therapy. Both projects have proven successful in yielding a vast, unique dataset including measures of brain status and response to aphasia therapy. Relying on this dataset, Bonilha and Rorden’s project will focus on the relationship between brain health and recovery from aphasia, whereas Hickok will utilize the same data to better understand aphasic impairment in relation to aphasia therapy success as well as new neurolinguistic models of speech and language processing. Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability in the United States; aphasia, an impairment of the ability to process language, is one of the most devastating results of left hemisphere stroke. The purpose of the work proposed here is to improve recovery from aphasia by expanding access to therapy by using telerehabilitation and by understanding the effects of drug therapy, brain health, and neurolinguistic factors on the outcome of aphasia therapy.",Center for the Study of Aphasia Recovery (C-STAR),10094377,P50DC014664,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Anodes', 'Aphasia', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Biography', 'Brain', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Double-blind trial', 'Drug usage', 'Education', 'Elderly', 'Employment Opportunities', 'Enrollment', 'Escitalopram', 'Family', 'Financial Support', 'Friends', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Impairment', 'Improve Access', 'Individual', 'Language', 'Language Disorders', 'Left', 'Lesion', 'Life Expectancy', 'Manuscripts', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Microvascular Dysfunction', 'Modeling', 'Neuropsychology', 'North America', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Persons', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Phase I/II Clinical Trial', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Process', 'Production', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Severities', 'South Carolina', 'Speech', 'Stroke', 'Survival Rate', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Work', 'aphasia recovery', 'base', 'brain health', 'brain tissue', 'chronic stroke', 'disability', 'double-blind placebo controlled trial', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'language processing', 'machine learning method', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'outcome prediction', 'post stroke', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'speech processing', 'stroke incidence', 'stroke patient', 'stroke survivor', 'stroke-induced aphasia', 'success', 'syntax', 'telerehabilitation', 'therapy outcome']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA AT COLUMBIA,P50,2021,2558826
"Neural Correlates of Recovery from Aphasia After Stroke Project Summary/Abstract Aphasia is one of the most common and debilitating consequences of stroke. Aphasia is caused by damage to language regions of the brain, which are usually localized to the left hemisphere. Fortunately, most individuals with aphasia after a stroke experience some degree of recovery of language function over time. The pace of recovery is greatest in the first weeks and months, but clinically meaningful gains in language function are possible even years after stroke. Recovery from aphasia is thought to depend on neural plasticity, that is, functional reorganization of surviving brain regions such that they take on new or expanded roles in language processing. However, despite much research, the mechanisms that underlie this process of functional reorganization remain poorly understood. The overall goals of this project are to better characterize the neural correlates of recovery from aphasia after stroke, and to determine which patterns of functional reorganization are associated with more or less favorable language outcomes. To address major limitations of prior studies, we will use a range of innovative approaches. Adaptive language mapping paradigms will be used to identify language regions in a reliable and valid manner, while minimizing performance confounds. We will recruit large numbers of patients at two established sites, enabling rigorous statistical approaches such as linear mixed models and permutation testing. Advanced machine learning algorithms will allow us to disentangle complex relationships between structural damage, neurofunctional changes, and language outcomes. We will study two complementary cohorts of patients—acute and chronic—longitudinally using the same multimodal functional and structural MRI protocol, and the same language evaluations. In the acute cohort, we will investigate the dynamics of early recovery and functional reorganization, while in the chronic cohort, we will identify relationships between patterns of reorganization and language outcomes in a larger sample, and track the neural correlates of recovery in the chronic phase. Our first specific aim is to build predictive models of the trajectory of evolving aphasia profiles based on structural neuroimaging, including lesion location and extent, as well as multiple measures of the integrity of surviving tissue, and other clinical variables. Our second specific aim is to characterize the brain regions recruited for language processing in people with aphasia, and to identify patterns that are associated with more or less favorable outcomes. Critically, the key analyses will use the predictive models from Aim 1 to determine which patterns of functional reorganization result in better or worse outcomes relative to what would be expected on the basis of structural and clinical factors alone. Our third aim is to identify changes in functional activity associated with gains in language function over time, again in the context of the predictive models developed in Aim 1. A better understanding of the biological mechanisms that underlie recovery from aphasia will contribute to the development of neuromodulatory and therapeutic interventions, and will improve the clinical management of individuals with aphasia. Project Narrative Aphasia (acquired language impairment) is one of the most common consequences of stroke and often leads to significant long-term disability. This project seeks to better characterize the neural correlates of recovery from aphasia after stroke, and to determine which patterns of functional reorganization are associated with more or less favorable language outcomes. A better understanding of the biological mechanisms that underlie recovery from aphasia will contribute to the development of neuromodulatory and therapeutic interventions, and will improve the clinical management of individuals with aphasia.",Neural Correlates of Recovery from Aphasia After Stroke,10177996,R01DC013270,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Aphasia', 'Area', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Biological', 'Brain region', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Phase', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Management', 'Cognitive', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Development', 'Evaluation', 'Functional Imaging', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Disorders', 'Left', 'Lesion', 'Location', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Stimulus', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Task Performances', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Validity and Reliability', 'Work', 'acute stroke', 'aphasia recovery', 'base', 'chronic stroke', 'clinical infrastructure', 'cohort', 'disability', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'language impairment', 'language outcome', 'language processing', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multimodality', 'neural correlate', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroregulation', 'post stroke', 'predictive modeling', 'recruit', 'stroke patient', 'support vector machine']",NIDCD,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,548529
"Functional anomaly mapping of aphasia recovery Project Summary Difficulty communicating (aphasia) is one of the most common and debilitating results of left-hemisphere stroke. Although aphasia symptoms are highly variable and recovery is difficult to predict, much research has shown that lesion size and location are major drivers of aphasia symptoms and recovery. However, this previous research has only considered direct anatomical damage caused by the lesion. This is a critical limitation because stroke lesions also cause indirect effects on the function of brain structures distant from the lesion. Throughout this application, I refer to this as “remote dysfunction.” Although initially thought to resolve quickly after the stroke, remote dysfunction is now known to persist throughout recovery and independently contribute to outcomes. Studies of aphasia recovery have focused almost exclusively on the idea of recovery through reorganization, whereby behavioral improvement occurs through plastic reorganization of brain networks. These studies have eschewed the older idea that recovery occurs through partial resolution of remote dysfunction (RRD) caused by lesions. Consequently, it is not clear how RRD contributes to aphasia recovery. The applicant has developed a new machine learning approach called functional anomaly mapping (FAM) that uses resting BOLD functional MRI signal to map remote dysfunction throughout the brain in individual stroke survivors. FAM maps have much better test-retest reliability than current measures, like task- related fMRI activity and resting state functional connectivity, as well as several other features that make it promising as a clinically useful tool. The applicant has already demonstrated that remote dysfunction measured with FAM relates to behavioral outcomes in people with chronic aphasia. During the mentored phase of this award, the applicant will optimize the FAM approach and test competing hypotheses about the biological mechanisms generating the remote dysfunction measured in chronic aphasia. During the independent phase, the applicant proposes a longitudinal study to understand the contribution of RRD to aphasia recovery. The applicant proposes a comprehensive training plan to expand his knowledge in the following areas: the biological mechanisms of stroke recovery and neuroplasticity beyond aphasia, machine learning, biomarker development, and advanced neuroimaging analysis. The research and training during this award will enable the applicant to develop a long-term, independent research program focused on understanding the neural correlates of aphasia and developing translational brain measures to inform clinical decision-making in aphasia neurorehabilitation. Public Health Relevance Statement Difficulty communicating (aphasia) is one of the most common and debilitating results of left-hemisphere stroke. While aphasia symptoms are highly variable and recovery is difficult to predict, stroke size and location are significant determinants of outcomes. Research that leads to a more complete characterization of how stroke lesions affect residual brain function over the course of recovery will lead to a better understanding of the brain-behavior relationship in aphasia and has the potential to inform clinical decision-making in aphasia neurorehabilitation.",Functional anomaly mapping of aphasia recovery,10214766,K99DC018828,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Aphasia', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Deafferentation procedure', 'Diagnosis', 'Distant', 'Exhibits', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Length', 'Lesion', 'Location', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Longitudinal prospective study', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Modeling', 'National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiology', 'Recovery', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Residual state', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Sample Size', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Strategic Planning', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'aphasia recovery', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'behavioral outcome', 'biomarker development', 'brain behavior', 'chronic stroke', 'clinical decision-making', 'cohort', 'experience', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multimodality', 'neural correlate', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'neurological rehabilitation', 'neuromechanism', 'post stroke', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'spatiotemporal', 'stroke recovery', 'stroke survivor', 'stroke-induced aphasia', 'tool', 'white matter']",NIDCD,GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY,K99,2021,121473
"Early Detection and Treatment of Emerging Cognitive-Linguistic Impairment in Minority Cognitive Aging and Primary Progressive Aphasia PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Dementia is among the most daunting public health crises facing industrialized nations. Many countries, including the United States,1 have recently adopted comprehensive national dementia strategies.2 The US National Dementia Strategy (section 2B) has identified early diagnosis and links to community treatment services as pillars of its management plan. The availability of evidence-based outpatient treatment for progressive language impairments remains exceedingly sparse. In 2014, we began to address this void via a longitudinal intervention targeting maintenance of a core vocabulary consisting of 100 words over two years. This caregiver-friendly treatment is showing great promise for promoting the retention of key vocabulary in frontotemporal degeneration and Alzheimer's Disease. A secondary aim involved evaluating prediction of later language forgetting. We have learned much during this initial project period, and its renewal has the potential to tell us much more. Our current proposal consists of three aims, all of which directly align both with the US National Dementia Strategy and the mission of our funding institute (i.e., the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders).3 In Specific Aim 1 (SA1), we will evaluate the long-term effectiveness of a regimen of noninvasive brain stimulation (transcranial direct current stimulation) delivered over the anterior temporal lobes as an adjuvant to our ongoing semantic behavioral treatment. We will do so using a crossover design where two groups of patients with semantic variant Primary Progressive Aphasia complete sham and active stimulation conditions paired with behavioral treatment (order counterbalanced). We will subsequently follow this patient cohort over two years to evaluate the durability of treatment gains. In SA2, we will evaluate predictors of emerging cognitive-linguistic impairment in a vastly underserved population (i.e., older African American adults). We will identify older adults who are at increased risk for conversion to mild cognitive impairment as indexed by global cognitive and language measures. We will then follow and characterize this prospective cohort using sensitive behavioral (gaze patterns during visual confrontation naming) and neuropsychological markers. Finally, in SA3 we will evaluate representation, processing, and shifts in abstract word meaning as functions of age, pathology, and individual differences (e.g., vocabulary size, years of education) using machine learning. This renewal reflects the continuation of a productive and rigorous line of research that will yield complementary data about human semantic memory, best practices in promoting language maintenance, and variability of age-associated language change. PROJECT NARRATIVE We will investigate the effectiveness of pairing non-invasive brain stimulation with an ongoing behavioral treatment targeting maintenance of a small functional vocabulary in patients with progressive naming disorders. In a secondary sequence of aims, we will evaluate processing of abstract words (e.g., love, truth) and prediction of evolving language impairment in a prospective cohort of lower-income, predominantly minority older adults with the aim of improving early detection of cognitive-linguistic decline.",Early Detection and Treatment of Emerging Cognitive-Linguistic Impairment in Minority Cognitive Aging and Primary Progressive Aphasia,10119275,R01DC013063,"['Address', 'Adjuvant', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'African American', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Ambulatory Care', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior', 'Atrophic', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Bilateral', 'Brain region', 'Caregivers', 'Cathodes', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive aging', 'Color', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Comprehension', 'Country', 'Crossover Design', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Developed Countries', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Education', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Electrodes', 'Emotions', 'Episodic memory', 'Eye', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Individual Differences', 'Industrialization', 'Inferior', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Disorders', 'Linguistics', 'Link', 'Love', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Mission', 'Molecular Target', 'Names', 'National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders', 'Nature', 'Neuropsychology', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Physiological', 'Primary Progressive Aphasia', 'Process', 'Progressive Aphasias', 'Property', 'Prospective cohort', 'Public Health', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Screening procedure', 'Semantic memory', 'Semantics', 'Severity of illness', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Underserved Population', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Vocabulary', 'Word Processing', 'age related', 'base', 'cognitive change', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cohort', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'drug discovery', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'evidence base', 'executive function', 'follow-up', 'forgetting', 'frontal lobe', 'frontotemporal degeneration', 'gaze', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'indexing', 'language impairment', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'neurological rehabilitation', 'noninvasive brain stimulation', 'novel', 'prevent', 'screening', 'sound', 'stroke-induced aphasia', 'supervised learning', 'treatment services', 'voltage']",NIDCD,TEMPLE UNIV OF THE COMMONWEALTH,R01,2021,470083
