"Integrative cellular deconvolution of human brain RNA sequencing data Many projects have characterized the human brain transcriptome within and across cell types to better understand changes in RNA expression associated with brain development and aging, developmental or psychiatric brain disorders, and genetic variation. Large consortia, including psychENCODE, CommonMind and BrainSeq Consortiums, have primarily focused on the molecular profiling of RNA extracted from homogenate/bulk tissue from different brain regions across thousands of individuals. However, bulk tissue like the frontal cortex contains a mixture of different important cell populations, and failing to account for the underlying composition of tissue samples can cause both false positives and missed signal in differential expression analysis. Therefore, statistical methods referred to as ""cellular deconvolution"" have been developed that estimate the relative fractions of different cell types in bulk RNA-seq datasets. These cell fractions can then be used to control for differences in cell composition across bulk tissue samples and can better determine the cell type(s) that drive differential expression signal in bulk tissue data. However, these approaches require reference expression profiles from the underlying cell types that will be estimated, which can be difficult to generate from human postmortem brain tissue. Recent approaches have leveraged single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) or single nuclei RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) datasets to construct these reference profiles and perform cellular deconvolution, particularly in peripheral tissues. While many statistical or machine learning approaches have been proposed, the majority produce similar composition estimates for a given reference dataset. However, as we describe in this application, many of these existing reference datasets -regardless of the algorithm employed - are largely non- comparable to the vast majority of bulk RNA sequencing data generated from postmortem human brain tissue, and have produced incorrect estimates of cellular composition. Current algorithms estimate the relative fraction of RNA attributable to each cell type, and not the relative fraction of cell types. We therefore propose to generate a more comprehensive framework for performing cellular deconvolution in human postmortem RNA- seq data.This proposal will leverage the extensive bulk RNA sequencing performed over the past decade to better determine the relative role of cell type-specific expression in the human brain and their subsequent dysregulation in debilitating brain disorders. Recent approaches have leveraged single cell or nuclei RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data to perform cellular deconvolution on homogenate datasets, but many current algorithms estimate the relative fraction of RNA attributable to each cell type, and not the relative fraction of cell types. This proposal therefore aims to develop novel reference and validation datasets necessary to implement cellular, and not RNA, deconvolution from RNA-seq datasets, which will become publicly available software. We will lastly apply this novel deconvolution approach to thousands of homogenate RNA-seq samples to identify cell type-specific insights into debilitating brain disorders.",Integrative cellular deconvolution of human brain RNA sequencing data,10138028,R01MH123183,"['Accounting', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Astrocytes', 'Autopsy', 'Bioconductor', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain region', 'Calibration', 'Cell Fraction', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Gold', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Microglia', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Nuclear', 'Oligodendroglia', 'Peripheral', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'RNA', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Signal Transduction', 'Small Nuclear RNA', 'Software Tools', 'Statistical Methods', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Validation', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'brain tissue', 'cell type', 'cognitive function', 'differential expression', 'excitatory neuron', 'frontal lobe', 'inhibitory neuron', 'insight', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'oligodendrocyte precursor', 'secondary analysis', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'statistical learning', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'web app']",NIMH,"LIEBER INSTITUTE, INC.",R01,2021,507442
"New methods for computational modeling of RNA structures RNA molecules play fundamental roles in nearly all cellular processes at the level of gene expression and regulation. Not surprisingly, emerging biomedical advances such as precision medicine and synthetic biology all point to RNA as the central regulators and information carriers. Recently, realizing the potential of using RNA to intervene gene expression, scientists successfully developed Onpattro, the ﬁrst FDA-approved RNA-based therapy in August 2018.  Understanding RNA function and therapeutic applications requires knowledge about RNA structure. Unfortu- nately, currently, the number of the known structures is a small fraction of what need to be determined. This gap has to be closed by computational methods. Furthermore, an RNA molecule is a highly charged polyanion and positive charges such as metal ions bind to an RNA and for an integral part of an RNA structure. Where and how metal ions interact with an RNA can directly impact RNA structure and function as well as RNA-drug interactions.  Continuously supported by NIH for over 15 years, we have developed systematic computational tools for the predictions of RNA structures, folding stability, kinetics, and metal ion effects. These tools have led to fruitful applications in virology, microbiology, gene therapy, RNA biotechnology, and various RNA-based therapeutic de- signs. However, despite over decade of efforts, many critical issues in computational RNA biology still remain: de novo prediction of non-Watson-Crick interactions, structure prediction for large RNAs, effective incorporation of experimental data such as cryo-EM and NMR data into structure prediction, and modeling of metal ion ef- fects. In this grant, after 15 years of developing an initio physics-based models, we propose to target the above and other pressing issues using a fundamentally different approach by systematically developing data-driven (such as deep-learning) or hybrid data-driven/physics-based simulation methods. The new approaches are mo- tivated by the increasing amount of experimental data and the pressing need to have more efﬁcient and reliable computational tools for data interpretation, especially for structure determination experiments. We will use ex- perimental database, such as RNA-Puzzles database, PDB, EMDataBank, BMRB, for large-scale benchmark tests, and biochemical and NMR data collected by our well-established collaborators for in-depth and interactive information about various experiments such as HCV genomic RNAs and HIV PBS systems. Our goal, if success- fully accomplished, will immediately impact experiments such as structure determination, including cryo-EM and NMR-based structure determination, identiﬁcation of metal ion sites, and rational design of RNA structures for therapeutic applications. RNA structures and interactions hold the key to many important biological processes. This project develops cutting-edge computational methods for the predictions of RNA structures and interactions. The results from the project will lead to novel computational tools for understanding disease mechanism at molecular level and for the rational design of RNA-based therapeutics. !",New methods for computational modeling of RNA structures,10130568,R35GM134919,"['Benchmarking', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Biotechnology', 'Cell physiology', 'Charge', 'Computer Models', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cryoelectron Microscopy', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Drug Interactions', 'FDA approved', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'HIV', 'Hepatitis C virus', 'Hybrids', 'Ions', 'Kinetics', 'Knowledge', 'Metal Ion Binding', 'Metals', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Physics', 'Play', 'RNA', 'RNA Computations', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'deep learning', 'design', 'experimental study', 'gene therapy', 'genomic RNA', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'polyanion', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'simulation', 'success', 'synthetic biology', 'tool', 'virology']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI-COLUMBIA,R35,2021,496674
"Programmable RNA-targeting CRISPR-Cas tools to study RNA biology Summary Technological advances such as next-generation sequencing and single-cell analysis have opened the flood gates for RNA analysis, revealing that the transcriptome is significantly more complex than previously thought, both with respect to the diversity of RNA transcripts, their temporal expression dynamics, and their cellular location. Moreover, thousands of dysregulated RNAs have been observed in diseases including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. These observations underscore the dire need for new molecular tools to precisely dissect RNA function in health and disease. The goal of my research program is to harness the unprecedented power of CRISPR-Cas systems to create a versatile range of methods to precisely manipulate virtually any RNA, and to use these tools to explore fundamental knowledge gaps in RNA biology. This proposal specifically focuses on addressing the following knowledge gaps: 1) Despite the technological advances in harnessing RNA-targeting CRISPR-Cas enzymes Cas9 and Cas13 for research and clinical applications, we still do not understand the principles of gRNA selection for efficient and tunable RNA-targeting. This problem precludes the facile development of a number of RNA-targeting applications and underscores the need for a thorough interrogation of gRNA selection. Our goal here is to develop a model to predict highly-active gRNAs for Cas9/Cas13 RNA- targeting in human cells. We will use a combination of high-throughput RNA:protein interactome methods, flow- cytometry based gRNA screens and machine learning to precisely define features of highly active RNA-targeting gRNAs for RNA-binding and knockdown for Cas9 and Cas13. 2) The vast majority of human RNAs are alternatively spliced, and RNA splicing defects are common in cancers and neurological diseases. However, our understanding of the downstream functional effects of splicing in a majority of cases is rudimentary. To address this issue, we will develop a toolbox of robust, multiplexable Cas-based splicing factors to offer an unprecedented opportunity to study the functional consequences of alternative splicing. that can determine in a single step both the identity of proteins bound to a And 3) There is a paucity of methods specific RNA and their location on that RNA. The development of such an approach will enable us to determine the spatial arrangement of proteins on specific RNAs to dissect their dynamic deposition in range of RNA processes such as transcription, 3ʹ-end and micro-RNA processing, and lncRNA function. To address this issue, we propose to develop a genetically encodable Cas-based RNA proximity-labeling strategy to precisely identify proteins that bind in close proximity to a specific RNA sequence. We will then use this approach to identify protein factors involved in regulating microprocessor (Drosha/DGCR8) activity at specific primary micro-RNA loci. These research goals fully align with the NIGMS 5 Year Strategic Plan, through the development of essential research tools to study and RNA function for biomedical research. Project Narrative RNA-targeting CRISPR-Cas proteins offer an unprecedented opportunity to precisely manipulate RNA biology in ways not currently possible. We propose several innovative approaches to address critical knowledge gaps in CRISPR-Cas tool development and chart a path to use these tools to interrogate several fundamental questions in RNA biology. Our approaches will help us define the gRNA design rules for RNA-targeting Cas proteins, and develop robust new RNA-targeting Cas tools to manipulate RNA splicing and dissect protein- RNA interaction networks, and ultimately, the tools developed here will transform the way we study RNA and will broadly impact the fields of molecular and cell biology.",Programmable RNA-targeting CRISPR-Cas tools to study RNA biology,10160925,R35GM133462,"['Address', 'Alternative Splicing', 'BCAR1 gene', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Complex', 'Defect', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Enzymes', 'Floods', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Guide RNA', 'Health', 'Human', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Microprocessor', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'National Institute of General Medical Sciences', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'RNA Binding', 'RNA Processing', 'RNA Sequences', 'RNA Splicing', 'RNA analysis', 'RNA-Protein Interaction', 'Research', 'Strategic Planning', 'System', 'Transcript', 'base', 'clinical application', 'design', 'innovation', 'knock-down', 'nervous system disorder', 'next generation sequencing', 'programs', 'single cell analysis', 'tool', 'tool development', 'transcriptome', 'virtual']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,R35,2021,385000
"Analysis of the Molecular Machinery Regulating Gene Expression during Vertebrate Development The maternal to zygotic transition is a fundamental transfer of information conserved among all animals and characterized by a profound change of the transcriptional landscape. Post-transcriptional regulation mediates this drastic change in gene expression through regulatory elements embedded in maternal mRNAs. RNA structure is detrimental to RNA function and regulatory element activity. Coordination of essential biological processes relies on specific RNA structures such as RNA G-quadruplexes-mediated translation in cancer. Therefore, this proposal will address two central questions in biology: what are the components of the code regulating early embryogenesis and what is the role and molecular function of individual components in vertebrate development. New approaches will be used to understand this vital transition. First, high throughput experiments will be performed to identify mRNA elements that regulate mRNA abundance and translation (Aim 1), and to solve their RNA structure (Aim 2). Then, a combination of biochemical and functional approaches will be used to discover the readers of those regulatory elements (Aim 3). Finally, mutants of those readers will be generated and their molecular mechanism and role studied during vertebrate development (Aim 3). Since the interaction between RNA structures and readers are master regulators of key biological phenomenon (e.g. GAIT system in inflammation and roquin in autoimmunity), the novel gene expression regulatory networks uncover in this proposal will likely be conserved in human and impact human development and health. To accomplish this proposal, Dr. Beaudoin will continue his training as Postdoctoral fellow in the Genetics Department at Yale University, where he will enjoy both state-of-the-art facilities and the interaction with his mentors and other scientific leaders in the field. With this K99 Award, Dr. Beaudoin's goals are to get close mentoring from several scientific experts (mentors and collaborators) in mRNA regulation, developmental biology, machine learning and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated functional screens. Furthermore, Dr. Beaudoin plans to expand his previous teaching and mentoring experience by participating in structured courses and workshops. This will allow him to learn innovative and effective ways to teach biology and progress to become a well- rounded scientist and mentor. Dr. Beaudoin existing expertise and the scientific and training plans of this proposal will allow him to reaching his long-term career goal: to establish a research program to understand the role of RNA structures and RNA helicases in vertebrate development. Defective RNA helicases have been associated to dozens of human diseases (e.g. infertility, neurological disorders, cancers and aging). Therefore, their molecular characterization in a relevant vertebrate model will provide invaluable insights to develop new human therapeutic approaches. Dr. Beaudoin is fully committed to obtain an appointment as a tenure track junior faculty in academia. It is fully expected that Dr. Beaudoin will be competitive for such group leader appointments at the completion of his K99/R00 Award tailored to enhance his scientific and mentoring skills. NARRATIVE  Every animal's life starts by a drastic and controlled remodeling of gene expression following the fertilization of the egg by the sperm.

"Characterization and modeling of m6A RNA methylation in cancer ABSTRACT The most abundant internal mRNA modification is N6-methyladenosine (m6A), and growing evidence has suggested its critical roles in cancer. However, the global patterns of m6A RNA modification and its regulators over large patient cohorts are not available. It remains unclear how m6A RNA modification contributes to cancer initiation/progression and how it may be used in cancer therapy. The objective is to systematically characterize the genome-wide patterns of m6A RNA modification and its regulators using well-characterized The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) patient cohorts, elucidate their interactions with other molecular aberrations, and assess their potential clinical utility. The working hypothesis is that the dysregulation of m6A RNA methylation plays critical roles in cancer development and may represent potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets. We will pursue three specific aims: Aim #1. Generate the genome-wide profiles of m6A RNA methylation using TCGA sample cohorts. As part of an NCI Functional Proteomic Center, our team has unique access to these samples. We have developed a sensitive, robust m6A-seq protocol, and will apply it to ~1,000 patient samples from diverse cancer types, and generate high-quality, standardized m6A genome-wide profile data. Aim #2. Generate the protein expression profiles of m6A regulators using TCGA sample cohorts. Using the MD Anderson reverse-phase protein array platform, we will characterize the expression levels of ~30 protein markers (including both total and phosphorylated proteins) of 15 m6A regulators (five writers, two readers, and eight erasers) over ~8,000 samples of 31 cancer types as well as ~400 common cancer cell lines. Aim #3. Perform the integrative analysis and modeling of m6A RNA methylation data in a rich TCGA context. Using TCGA multi-dimensional molecular data, we will develop predictive models that quantify the effects of various factors involved in m6A RNA modification by deep learning. We will perform analyses to define m6A-based tumor subtypes, assess the clinical utility of m6A-related markers, and study the interactions of m6A with other molecular aberrations in diverse tumor contexts. Finally, we will build a publicly available, user-friendly database that will contain comprehensive information of the m6A data generated through Aim #1 and Aim #2. The expected outcome of this project is (i) the establishment of an integrated resource of m6A-related genomic and proteomic data based on the most widely used cancer patient cohorts, so that further investigation of such data can be conducted by the cancer research community fluently; and (ii) assessment of the biological and clinical utility of m6A RNA methylation for cancer therapy in a comprehensive way. This project is innovative because it will systematically assess the clinical relevance and functions of a key class of RNA modifications that are currently understudied in cancer research. These results will have an important positive impact because the knowledge gained will not only greatly advance our understanding of the role of m6A RNA methylation in cancer development, but also directly facilitate the development of a novel class of cancer biomarkers and therapeutic targets. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because systematic characterization of RNA modifications in large, well-characterized clinical patient cohorts is expected to advance our understanding of the molecular basis of human cancers, thereby helping the development of more effective treatment approaches. Thus, this project is relevant to the NIH's mission to develop fundamental knowledge that will help to reduce the burdens of human disability.",Characterization and modeling of m6A RNA methylation in cancer,10245143,R01CA251150,"['Alternative Splicing', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancer cell line', 'Chicago', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Communities', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer Analysis', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Event', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder', 'Messenger RNA', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Abnormality', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Polyadenylation', 'Process', 'Protein Array', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'RNA', 'RNA Editing', 'RNA methylation', 'Reader', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Skin Cancer', 'Standardization', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Therapeutic', 'Tumor Subtype', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'University of Texas M D Anderson Cancer Center', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'bioinformatics resource', 'biomedical resource', 'cancer biomarkers', 'cancer genomics', 'cancer initiation', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'deep learning', 'disability', 'effective therapy', 'genome-wide', 'innovation', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'methylation pattern', 'novel', 'potential biomarker', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'protein biomarkers', 'protein expression', 'therapeutic target', 'tumor', 'user-friendly']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,R01,2021,550031
"Systematic identification of RNA sequences and protein components regulating circular RNA translation PROJECT SUMMARY  The human genome encodes tens of thousands of circRNAs, of which the translation is essential for regulating important biological functions, such as cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration. Interference with circRNA translation can lead to tumorigenesis and metastasis of cancers. It is unclear, however, how disrupting circRNA translation can cause the diseases. Identifying the regulatory components of circRNA translation can provide valuable clinical insights. However, current technologies cannot distinguish circRNAs from linear RNAs efficiently, such that the mechanism and molecular components regulating circRNA translation remain unclear. Thus, it is imperative to develop a technology that can identify the components regulating circRNA translation with higher sensitivity and specificity.  I have developed a high-throughput reporter screening assay that can systematically screen and identify the RNA sequences that initiate circRNA translation specifically. Utilizing the technology, I discovered two groups of the RNA sequences that specifically drive translation on either circRNA or linear RNA, respectively, indicating that the regulatory components between linear RNA and circRNA translation are different (Chen et al., resubmitted to Science). In this proposed research, I will further adapt and apply this novel technology to (i) identify and characterize the sequence and protein components that regulate circRNA translation specifically, (ii) identify the association between genetic variation, circRNA translation, and disease, (iii) characterize circRNA translation in a tissue-dependent manner systematically, and (iv) build a non-integrative and stable gene expression platform with tunable expression level and tissue specificity. This proposed research will build the foundation of my future research as an independent researcher to investigate the regulation and the coordination between different translation machinery (cap-dependent vs. independent translation) among different RNA species (linear vs. circular RNAs).  This work will be performed under the mentorship of Dr. Howard Chang at the Stanford University School of Medicine, an expert in technology development and RNA biology who has highly-successful track records of placing postdoctoral fellows into independent academic positions at leading institutions. Further training in scientific and professional skills will be achieved by utilizing the resources available through the Stanford University School of Medicine and the Office of Postdoctoral Affairs, which provide an outstanding intellectually- stimulating environment with all facilities and resources necessary for success. All proposed training will complement my previous training in RNA biology, technology development, and computer programming and facilitate my transition to an independent researcher, investigating the functions, regulations and clinical implications of circRNA.

"Platform for transcriptome-wide RNA modification identification in long reads Project Summary RNA modifications are pervasive throughout the human transcriptome and affect transcript stability, localization, and function. In particular, ADAR-mediated adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) edits in RNA have been shown to affect pre-mRNA splicing and alter codon sequence. Amino acid changes caused by inosines have been implicated in various deleterious conditions, which include cancer and diseases of the brain. However, previous literature mapping inosine positions in high-throughput were only able to do so inside the limited context provided by short RNA-Seq reads. As modifications can be transcript-specific, elucidating the association of inosines with full mRNA isoforms is crucial for a more rigorous understanding of the role of inosine modifications in the tissues of our body and, more broadly, disease. Therefore, I propose to investiate A-to-I editing in the context of diseased and non-diseased systems using full-length mRNA nanopore sequencing. The nanopore is able to sequence whole RNA strands by converting changes in electrical current caused by RNA translocating through the pore into nucleotide sequence. ​Aim 1 leverages high-accuracy nanopore cDNA sequencing of cellular systems with and without ADAR knockdown to interrogate ADAR function and A-to-I-induced changes to transcript expression changes. To accomplish the latter, I will develop workflows to determine isoform structure from noisy, long reads. In addition to sequencing full-length transcripts, nanopore native RNA (nvRNA) sequencing informs on RNA modifications, as modified nucleotides appear as subtle alteration in current signal with respect to canonical nucleotides. As such, ​Aim 2 ​employs a generalizable approach to producing cost-effective training data for systematically understanding how inosines alter current signals in nanopores. I will use a Cas13b-ADAR fusion protein (REPAIRv2) to create site-specific edits and then perform nvRNA sequencing on the edited transcriptome. Site-specific A-to-I editing allows this approach to create a labelled inosine dataset in nvRNA signal from which I can develop computational algorithms to reliably identify inosines in nvRNA data. The REPAIRv2 approach to can be generalized to eventually identify any RNA modification with nanopores. ​Aim 3 will elucidate how A-to-I editing differs between tissues. I will sequence 4 normal tissue types with nvRNA sequencing, generating a map of A-to-I edits in conjunction with isoform usage using the software I am developing. Taken together, the fulfillment of these aims will not only provide further insights on elusive ADAR mechanism, but also create workflows for nanopore data analysis and a platform for the study of any modification. As I work toward my Ph.D. with this interdisciplinary project, I will gain invaluable skills in experimental and computational biology that will prepare me for a career in science. Project Narrative Understanding the functional outcomes of adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing in greater depth is crucial to understanding cancer, diseases of the brain, and other deleterious effects that arise from modification misregulation. To study inosines in full-length mRNA contexts, we will use nanopore sequencing to generate a map of A-to-I editing in diseased and non-diseased transcriptomes. The objective of this proposal is to develop the experimental and computational requisites for identifying inosine modifications in nanopore native RNA sequencing data, particularly for illuminating the interplay between A-to-I editing, alternative splicing, and mRNA regulation.",Platform for transcriptome-wide RNA modification identification in long reads,10168450,F31HG010999,"['Address', 'Adenosine', 'Affect', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Amino Acids', 'Atlases', 'Base Sequence', 'Benchmarking', 'Biology', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Breast', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Chimeric Proteins', 'Codon Nucleotides', 'Complementary DNA', 'Computational Biology', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Enzymes', 'Exons', 'Functional disorder', 'Guanosine', 'Human', 'Inosine', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Lung', 'Lung Adenocarcinoma', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Motor Neurons', 'Neurons', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Nucleotides', 'Pattern', 'Permeability', 'Poly(A) Tail', 'Polyadenylation', 'Polymerase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Property', 'Protein Isoforms', 'RNA', 'RNA Editing', 'RNA Processing', 'RNA Splicing', 'Regulation', 'Research Personnel', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Role', 'Science', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Work', 'adenosine deaminase', 'base', 'career', 'computer framework', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'functional outcomes', 'human tissue', 'insight', 'knock-down', 'mRNA Precursor', 'machine learning method', 'nanopore', 'neuron loss', 'skills', 'software development', 'success', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SANTA CRUZ,F31,2021,38613
"Measuring allele and isoform-specific RBP binding to improve predictive models of RNA splicing PROJECT SUMMARY Alternative splicing (AS) is a fundamental cellular process that regulates 95% of multi-exon genes to diversify protein output and define cell-type specific functions. Both constitutive splicing and AS are controlled by combinations of cis-acting pre-messenger RNA sequences (pre-mRNA) and trans-acting RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). Therefore, defects in splicing regulatory RNA sequence or RBPs can be highly disruptive to basic cellular activities and often lead to disease, especially neurological and muscular disorders and cancer. While the constitutive splicing code is well established, the AS code is more complicated and, thus, poorly understood. This proposal integrates multiple cutting-edge approaches to take an RBP-centric view of AS to study both cis genetic variants and trans RBP expression effects on RBP binding and splicing outcome. While thousands of non-coding genetic variants are associated with splicing variation, and are thus termed putative splicing quantitative trait loci (sQTLs), the causal variants and their molecular effects, such as RBP binding, are largely unclear. Aim 1 will address this gap by integrating RBP-focused experiments, allele-specific genomics, and state- of-the-art machine learning predictive models to characterize an important category of functional, cis non-coding variants that alter RBP binding. Importantly, I will take a unique approach to include these allele-specific RBP binding data as additional training data for our Convolutional Neural Net model. Model output is expected to much more accurately predict functional RBP binding effects of even a single nucleotide change in sequence, enabling improved interpretation of sQTLs. In addition to genetic variant effects, changes in RBP expression can have amplified downstream effects on RNA splicing. Interestingly, ~86% of RBP genes can be expressed as more than one splice isoform, but most studies to date have ignored RBP isoform-specific abundance and function. Aim 2 will provide foundational experiments to understand differential RBP isoform effects by using a novel approach to knockdown RBP isoforms by targeting Cas13 to unique exon junctions. Data from downstream assays that assess changes in RBP binding, splicing, and RNA localization will be integrated to construct the most comprehensive RBP regulatory networks to date. Results from both aims are essential to mechanistically link RNA sequence and RBP binding to splicing outcome and, ultimately, to phenotype and disease. My long-term goal is to become a principal investigator, where I will continue to leverage molecular biology, machine learning, and statistical genetics to answer unique questions about RNA-mediated associations between non-coding sequence and cellular and disease phenotype. The research and training plans proposed here are strategically tailored to provide ample opportunities to learn and apply machine learning and statistical genetics methods that complement my former PhD training in molecular biology and genomics. My sponsor, co- sponsor, and collaborators at the NYGC are committed to providing the scientific expertise, computational training, and career development mentoring to ensure the successful achievement of my goals. PROJECT NARRATIVE Splicing is one of the earliest RNA processing events that regulates nearly every gene in every cell, thereby driving cell-type diversity and function. Mis-regulation at the level of splicing due to genetic variants in RNA sequence or defects in regulatory RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) are highly disruptive to basic molecular processes and often lead to disease. This proposal aims to mechanistically link genetic variants and RBP effects to splicing outcome to improve interpretation of consortia-level DNA and RNA sequencing data as it relates to phenotypic traits and disease.",Measuring allele and isoform-specific RBP binding to improve predictive models of RNA splicing,10234638,F32GM142213,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Alleles', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Automobile Driving', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Categories', 'Cell Line', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Code', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Ensure', 'Event', 'Exons', 'Fellowship', 'Fibroblasts', 'Foundations', 'Fractionation', 'Future', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic study', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Genotype-Tissue Expression Project', 'Goals', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Human', 'Introns', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mentors', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Myopathy', 'Nucleotides', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Protein Splicing', 'Proteins', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'RNA', 'RNA Binding', 'RNA Processing', 'RNA Sequences', 'RNA Splicing', 'RNA metabolism', 'RNA-Binding Proteins', 'Regulation', 'Research Training', 'Ribonucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Role', 'Site', 'System', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Translations', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Work', 'career development', 'causal variant', 'cell type', 'convolutional neural network', 'differential expression', 'disease phenotype', 'experimental study', 'genetic regulatory protein', 'genetic variant', 'improved', 'knock-down', 'mRNA Precursor', 'molecular phenotype', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel strategies', 'nuclease', 'predictive modeling', 'protein expression', 'protein function', 'recruit', 'skills', 'statistical and machine learning', 'trait', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NIGMS,NEW YORK GENOME CENTER,F32,2021,65994
"Revealing Principles of Subcellular RNA Localization by Proximity Labeling PROJECT SUMMARY The human body comprises of trillion of cells, which are the building blocks of life. Each cell is highly organized, with various constituents within localizing to specific regions. Location within a cell is a cardinal organizing principle of gene control and function, especially for RNAs that code for proteins or serve regulatory roles as non-coding RNAs. Each cell type has its distinct RNA-species profile, and where these RNAs are located within the cell can dictate their folding, editing, splicing, translation, degradation, binding partners, catalytic activity, and even the fate of the proteins that they encode. Unsurprisingly, perturbations in RNA localization result in disease conditions including cancers and neuropathologies. In spite of the vital importance of subcellular RNA localization in gene expression, investigating such phenomena simultaneously for many RNA species has been challenging. To address these long-standing issues, Dr. Furqan Fazal and others have recently developed a technique called APEX-seq that can track the location of thousands of RNAs in living human cells with high-temporal and nanometer-spatial resolution. APEX-seq has the transformative potential to provide high-resolution snapshots of tens of thousands of endogenous cellular RNA species, free from artifacts of overexpression, cell fixation or recombinant tagging. This proposal outlines a five-year career program for Dr. Fazal as he investigates principles of RNA subcellular localization, and reaches milestone goals that will transition him into an independent investigator. By improving the APEX-seq technique and amalgamating it with a number of cutting-edge tools including massively-parallel reporter assays and deep-learning-based approaches, Dr. Fazal will dissect how sequences within RNAs direct them to different locations, and how cells actively control RNA subcellular localization to regulate gene function. This work will be carried out at Stanford University, where Dr. Fazal will be mentored by Dr. Howard Chang, a pioneer in developing new genomics tools, and Dr. Joanna Wysocka, a leading authority in vertebrate development and non-coding genomic regulatory elements. Both mentors have highly-successful track records of placing postdoctoral fellows into independent academic positions at leading institutions around the nation and world. Additional support will be available through collaboration with Drs. Shen, Boettiger and Kundaje who will provide training and expertise in genetics, imaging, statistics and computation. An advisory committee comprising of world-leading investigators Drs. Ting, Kool, Li, Bryant and Bassik will also monitor progress and provide expertise. Further acquisition of scientific and professional skills will be achieved by utilizing the educational resources available through the Stanford University School of Medicine and Office of Postdoctoral Affairs. Stanford provides an outstanding intellectually-stimulating environment with all facilities and resources necessary for success, and all proposed training will complement Dr. Fazal’s previous knowledge in genomics and biophysics and facilitate his transition into a multidisciplinary RNA biologist in the field of spatial transcriptomics. PROJECT NARRATIVE Many RNA species within a cell are spatially localized and locally translated into proteins, and previous studies in embryos, neurons and highly-dynamic tissues have demonstrated the vital importance of RNA subcellular location in development and cellular function. However, it has been challenging to study localization transcriptome-wide, which has hampered understanding of the extent and role of such processes in normal and diseased tissues. The proposed work will improve a newly-developed tool for the RNA community to investigate spatial transcriptomics, and use it to provide new insights into RNA biology by determining the regulatory sequences (i.e. the grammar) controlling localization, as well as identifying the associated cellular mechanisms.",Revealing Principles of Subcellular RNA Localization by Proximity Labeling,10405893,R00HG010910,"['3-Dimensional', 'Active Biological Transport', 'Address', 'Advisory Committees', 'Animal Model', 'Binding', 'Biochemical Genetics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Biophysics', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Cis-Acting Sequence', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'DNA', 'DNA Library', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Developmental Biology', 'Disease', 'Dynein ATPase', 'Elements', 'Embryo', 'Environment', 'Enzymes', 'Fractionation', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Heterochromatin', 'Human', 'Human body', 'Image', 'Institution', 'Kinesin', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Life', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Mentors', 'Messenger RNA', 'Mitochondria', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular Motors', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Myosin ATPase', 'Neurons', 'Nuclear', 'Nuclear Envelope', 'Nuclear Lamina', 'Nuclear Pore', 'Organelles', 'Outer Mitochondrial Membrane', 'Pattern', 'Peroxidases', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'RNA', 'RNA Splicing', 'RNA Transport', 'RNA-Binding Proteins', 'Recombinants', 'Records', 'Regulation', 'Regulatory Element', 'Repetitive Sequence', 'Reporter', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Retrotransposon', 'Role', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Small Nuclear RNA', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Writing', 'active control', 'authority', 'base', 'career', 'cell fixation', 'cell type', 'clinically significant', 'deep learning', 'design', 'education resources', 'experience', 'gene function', 'genomic tools', 'improved', 'in vitro Assay', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'insight', 'medical schools', 'multidisciplinary', 'nanometer', 'neuropathology', 'overexpression', 'programs', 'ribosome profiling', 'skills', 'statistics', 'success', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NHGRI,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R00,2021,249000
