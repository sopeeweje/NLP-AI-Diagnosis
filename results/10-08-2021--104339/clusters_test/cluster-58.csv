"Meeting the Challenges of COVID-19 by Expanding the Reach of Palliative Care: Proactive Advance Care Planning with Videos for the Elderly and all Patients with Dementia The majority of patients aged 65 or over, and patients with Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD), have never communicated their preferences to clinicians or completed advance care planning (ACP) documents. Palliative care has the potential to improve ADRD care, improve patient-clinician communication and patient-centered outcomes, while decreasing unwanted burdensome treatments and improving care at the end of life. The novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has acutely escalated the importance of integrating ACP and palliative care services into medical care. The default response to critical illness for patients with ADRD (and all others) is intubation, mechanical ventilation, and aggressive care despite having no change in mortality outcome. ADRD patients and their caregivers may prefer to avoid these interventions.  To address these gaps, we have developed a COVID-19 ACP Educator-led, video-assisted palliative care intervention to improve patient-clinician communication, increase ACP documentation, and lead to more patient-centered care at the end of life. We will identify all hospitalized patients aged 65 and older, and any patient with ADRD, and then an ACP Educator will proactively proceed with primary palliative care services of ACP, leveraging certified video decision aids that we have developed. The ACP Educator to be tested in this proposal represents a new role and proactive function for the palliative care team. The ACP Educator, who will be a palliative care nurse, will work with older patients or patients with ADRD and proxy decision-makers to learn about and document patients' wishes.  The overall objective is to reduce the burden of COVID-19 by expanding the reach of inpatient palliative care, especially for patients with ADRD. We propose to conduct a stepped wedge cluster randomized trial of an ACP Educator intervention among hospitalized patients aged 65 and over, or any patient with ADRD and their proxy decision-makers in the ward and ICU settings of two major hospitals: Boston Medical Center and North Shore University Hospital. Patient outcomes will be abstracted from electronic health records with Natural Language Processing. We will evaluate intervention effectiveness by comparing the following outcomes among 9,000 hospitalized patients: ACP documentation; preferences for resuscitation; palliative care consults; and, hospice use. We will characterize caregiver-centered outcomes of patients with ADRD, including: (1) knowledge, (2) confidence in future care, (3) communication satisfaction, and (4) decisional certainty in 600 caregivers of patients with ADRD admitted to the hospital. COVID-19 poses a unique dilemma for older Americans and patients with ADRD and their caregivers, who must balance their desire to live against the risk of a lonely and potentially traumatic hospital death. Video decision support is a practical, evidence- based, and innovative approach to assist patients facing such choices. If proven effective, this innovative care model can be immediately deployed across the country to improve the quality of care for millions of Americans. The majority of patients aged 65 or over, and patients with Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD), have never communicated their preferences to clinicians or completed advance care planning (ACP) documents. The novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has acutely escalated the importance of integrating ACP and palliative care services into medical care. We aim to improve ACP with an ACP Educator who will promote ACP conversations with certified video decision aids in a model of care that is practical, scalable, and evidence-based, has the potential to mitigate communication barriers related to health literacy and limited English proficiency, and has the potential to improve the quality of medical care delivered to millions of Americans during the COVID-19 pandemic.",Meeting the Challenges of COVID-19 by Expanding the Reach of Palliative Care: Proactive Advance Care Planning with Videos for the Elderly and all Patients with Dementia,10251623,R01AG072911,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Administrator', 'Advance Care Planning', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'American', 'Boston', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'COVID-19 patient', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Cluster randomized trial', 'Communication', 'Communication Barriers', 'Complex', 'Consult', 'Consultations', 'Country', 'Critical Illness', 'Decision Aid', 'Decision Making', 'Dementia', 'Documentation', 'Effectiveness of Interventions', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emotional', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Equilibrium', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Future', 'Health system', 'Hospitals', 'Infrastructure', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Intubation', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Limited English Proficiency', 'Loneliness', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Palliative Care', 'Palliative Care Nursing', 'Patient-Centered Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Proxy', 'Quality of Care', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Services', 'Testing', 'Triage', 'University Hospitals', 'Work', 'aged', 'care systems', 'compare effectiveness', 'dementia care', 'end of life', 'end of life care', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'health literacy', 'hospice environment', 'human old age (65+)', 'implementation intervention', 'improved', 'innovation', 'literacy', 'meetings', 'mortality', 'novel coronavirus', 'older patient', 'palliative', 'pandemic disease', 'patient-clinician communication', 'preference', 'primary outcome', 'response', 'satisfaction', 'visual information', 'ward']",NIA,BOSTON MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,2487017
"Accelerating research to advance care for adults with congenital heart disease through development of validated scalable computational phenotypes PROJECT SUMMARY The advent of surgery to treat congenital heart disease (CHD) in the second half of the 20th century shifted the care paradigm from palliation of disease fatal in infancy to management of lifelong chronic disease through adulthood. There are now more than 1.5 million adults with CHD living in the United States. These patients have a substantial burden of cardiovascular and other medical comorbidities, as well as markedly increased risk for adverse outcomes such as arrhythmia, heart failure, cerebrovascular accident, and premature death. The emergence of this population requires new clinical care models as well as the development of novel research tools and infrastructures to address these patients' unique characteristics and healthcare needs. Adult CHD is characterized by substantial complexity, era-dependent heterogeneity in treatment strategies, and time-varying implications of lifelong disease. This burgeoning population is understudied, and the pathophysiology of the component diseases remains incompletely understood. Billing and other administrative codes available in the electronic medical record are neither sensitive nor specific for CHD diagnosis and do not adequately describe many other salient clinical features. As a result, structured data in large administrative databases are not well suited to studying adults with CHD, even when the goal is simply to identify a cohort of patients with a given diagnosis. This constitutes a major impediment to research efforts and is the primary barrier underlying the limited population-based research performed to date. Adult CHD investigation would benefit immensely from methods to establish harmonized, large-scale, multi-center datasets. While billing codes are inadequate, the information needed to accurately classify adults with CHD is already available in the electronic medical record in the form of clinical notes, comprised mainly of unstructured (“free”) text. Manual data extraction is laborious, resource intensive, and, therefore, not scalable. We propose to apply cutting-edge natural language processing approaches to unstructured text in the electronic medical record to develop computable classifiers for variables fundamental to the study of adults with CHD. We will use two unique institutional data resources at Boston Children's Hospital and Brigham and Women's Hospital that are already populated with expert-adjudicated labels to train classifiers for key phenotypes that are poorly defined by administrative codes. These classifiers will be validated in an independent patient cohort at Vanderbilt University Medical Center and tested in new disease-specific risk prediction models. This work promises to accelerate CHD research by massively increasing the scale of the patient cohorts that can be studied and by establishing a foundation for improved evidence-based decision support for this underserved population. PROJECT NARRATIVE Administrative billing codes are inadequate to support research for adults with congenital heart disease, a growing but understudied population with a high burden of medical comorbidities. To advance high quality research towards much-needed innovations in clinical care for these patients, we plan to develop novel methods for the creation of harmonized, large-scale, multi-center datasets that will expand and enhance collaborative research efforts.",Accelerating research to advance care for adults with congenital heart disease through development of validated scalable computational phenotypes,10214688,R01HL151604,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Arrhythmia', 'Atrial Heart Septal Defects', 'Boston', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Specificity', 'Disease', 'Eisenmenger Complex', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Heart', 'Heart failure', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitals', 'ICD-9', 'Incidence', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Label', 'Life', 'Lung', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical Informatics', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New York', 'Nomenclature', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Population Research', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Stroke', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Thromboembolism', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transposition of Great Vessels', 'Underserved Population', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Visit', 'Woman', 'Work', 'adjudicate', 'administrative database', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'biobank', 'clinical care', 'clinical data repository', 'clinical database', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinically actionable', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'computable phenotypes', 'congenital heart disorder', 'data resource', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'high risk', 'improved', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'large scale data', 'large-scale database', 'mortality', 'multitask', 'neural network', 'neural network classifier', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'palliation', 'patient population', 'population based', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive modeling', 'premature', 'prospective', 'repaired', 'risk prediction model', 'structured data', 'tool', 'treatment strategy']",NHLBI,CINCINNATI CHILDRENS HOSP MED CTR,R01,2021,738379
"Identifying Patterns of Health Care Utilization among Physical Elder Abuse Victims Using Medicare Data and Legally Adjudicated Cases PROJECT SUMMARY The over-arching aim of this research is to: improve understanding of the patterns of health care utilization and associated costs of physical elder abuse victims to improve early identification and intervention and to inform policy. In our prior research, supported by an NIA GEMSSTAR and Beeson grant to PI Dr. Rosen, we leveraged unique partnerships with prosecutors’ offices to comprehensively examine legal case files from more than 200 victims in two large metropolitan areas, representing the largest retrospective series of legally adjudicated physical elder abuse cases ever examined. For the proposed study, we plan to link these cases, for which we have done extensive clinical analysis, to Medicare claims data. The Specific Aims of this proposal are: (1) To use Medicare claims to describe rates and patterns of health care utilization of victims before and after detection, with a focus on potentially missed opportunities by health professionals to identify abuse and differences based on victim characteristics, (2) To compare rates and patterns of ED visits and hospitalizations of physical elder abuse victims to control groups selected algorithmically from Medicare claims data, and (3) To compare patterns of health care utilization other than EDs/hospitals between victims and controls. The proposed research will provide important insight into the patterns of health care utilization for physical elder abuse victims, focusing on whether missed opportunities exist and suggestive patterns emerge. We plan to employ sophisticated machine learning approaches to increase our ability to identify patterns suggestive of physical elder abuse exposure. This will inform strategies for identification and intervention by health care providers, and knowledge gleaned will support the future development of a health informatics tool to identify potential victims. Findings on associated costs will help define the scope and impact of physical elder abuse. This innovative approach leverages existing data gathered with NIA support and extrapolates from successful research approaches in child abuse and intimate partner violence while expanding on them. As no additional subjects will be prospectively enrolled as part of this research, we avoid many of the ethical concerns typical in elder mistreatment work. Our multi-disciplinary team of experts in elder abuse, child abuse and neglect, intimate partner violence, and emergency medicine as well as specialists in statistics, health economics, and computer science is uniquely able to conduct this research. Previously, we have done seminal work examining health care usage and health-related outcomes of elder abuse victims by linking adult protective services and police databases to health care data, which is highly relevant for this proposal. We also have deep experience in using Medicare claims data and machine learning for research. The long-term goal of our research is to leverage a better understanding of health care use by elder abuse victims to improve the ability of health care providers to identify, intervene, and prevent victimization and to inform policy changes to help this vulnerable population. PROJECT NARRATIVE Elder abuse can have serious health consequences, but little is known about the patterns of their health care utilization. We propose to comprehensively examine the health care utilization and associated costs from known physical elder abuse cases using Medicare claims data. Findings from this research will improve the ability of health care providers to identify, intervene, and prevent victimization and to inform policy changes to reduce costs and help this vulnerable population.",Identifying Patterns of Health Care Utilization among Physical Elder Abuse Victims Using Medicare Data and Legally Adjudicated Cases,10224085,R01AG060086,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Ambulatory Care', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Case Series', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Child Abuse', 'Child Abuse and Neglect', 'Clinical', 'Continuity of Patient Care', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Economic Burden', 'Elder Abuse', 'Elderly', 'Emergency Medicine', 'Emergency department visit', 'Enrollment', 'Ethics', 'Family', 'Fracture', 'Future', 'Glean', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Professional', 'Healthcare', 'Hospital Departments', 'Hospitalization', 'Impaired cognition', 'Influentials', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Legal', 'Limb structure', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medicare', 'Medicare claim', 'Methodology', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nursing Homes', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Police', 'Policies', 'Preventive service', 'Primary Health Care', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Seminal', 'Series', 'Services', 'Specialist', 'Suggestion', 'Testing', 'Victimization', 'Visit', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'abuse victim', 'adjudicate', 'aged', 'base', 'comorbidity', 'computer science', 'convict', 'cost', 'experience', 'functional disability', 'health assessment', 'health care service utilization', 'health economics', 'hospital utilization', 'improved', 'informatics tool', 'innovation', 'insight', 'intimate partner violence', 'legal cases', 'maxillofacial', 'medication compliance', 'member', 'metropolitan', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'perpetrators', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'statistics']",NIA,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,R01,2021,485426
"Human-Machine Collaborations to Improve Prognosis and Clinical Decision-Making in Advanced Cancer PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Advance care planning and palliative care represent evidence-based, high-quality care for patients with advanced cancer. Early identification of patients at risk of short-term mortality is a promising strategy to increase advance care planning and palliative care. However, this is limited by prognostic inaccuracy among oncology clinicians, who overestimate prognosis for 70% of their patients with advanced cancer. While recent advances in electronic health record (EHR) infrastructure and machine learning (ML) have allowed accurate identification of patient' mortality risk, there is a fundamental gap in understanding how to integrate ML prognostic algorithms alongside clinician intuition (“human-machine collaborations”) in the routine care of patients with cancer. Dr. Parikh's research objective is to develop and test human-machine collaborative systems that leverage ML algorithms to improve clinicians' prognostic accuracy in order to prompt earlier advance care planning and palliative care among patients with advanced cancer. In prior work, Dr. Parikh has prospectively validated and embedded into the EHR an automated ML algorithm to predict short-term mortality risk among patients with cancer. In this application, Dr. Parikh proposes to take a fundamental next step in this work by exploring strategies to improve prognostic accuracy and decision-making among oncologists treating patients with advanced cancer. In Aim 1, Dr. Parikh will retrain and validate the existing ML mortality risk prediction algorithm by integrating recently-available patient-generated health data. In Aim 2, Dr. develop prognostic that Parikh will a vignette-based survey to assess optimal strategies of presenting ML predictions to improve accuracy. He will administer this survey to a large national sample of medical oncologists to ensure clinician perspectives are incorporated into interventions.In Aim 3, Dr. Parikh will develop two models of human-machine collaborative systems to generate real-time mortality estimates that integrate clinician and algorithm predictions. In a pragmatic multi-institutional clinical trial among patients with advanced cancer, Dr. Parikh will test the impact of human-machine collaborations on prognostic accuracy and rates of advanced care planning and palliative care referral. These findings will have important implications for patients with cancer, their caregivers, oncology clinicians, and health systems. More broadly, the methods proposed may serve as a blueprint to develop and evaluate human-machine collaborations in oncology. This facilitate judgment highly-qualified Dr. development improving research will t raining in areas vital to Dr. Parikh's career goals: dvanced predictive modeling, survey methods and and decision-making, human-machine interfaces, and pragmatic clinical trials. Dr. Parikh has two and committed mentors: Dr. Justin Bekelman, an expert i n cancer care delivery r esearch, and Jinbo Chen, an expert in EHR-based predictive model development. The proposed research and career plan will enable Dr. Parikh to transition to an independent physician-scientist devoted to the quality and applicability of predictive analytics in the care of patients with cancer. a PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because we aim to improve prognostication for patients with advanced cancer by developing frameworks to integrate clinician intuition with machine learning algorithm- based mortality risk predictions (“human-machine collaborations”), a critical step to better identify patients who may benefit from earlier advance care planning and palliative care. This research proposal will optimize an existing machine learning mortality risk prediction algorithm and methodologically assess strategies to present machine learning estimates to clinicians in order to increase prognostic accuracy, advance care planning, and palliative care among patients with advanced cancer. The project is relevant to the NCI's mission by generating fundamental knowledge to inform clinicians, researchers, and policymakers about effective methods to improve and integrate predictive algorithms into clinical practice, thereby allowing better targeting of evidence-based interventions to improve quality of life for patients with advanced cancer.",Human-Machine Collaborations to Improve Prognosis and Clinical Decision-Making in Advanced Cancer,10284721,K08CA263541,"['Advance Care Planning', 'Advanced Malignant Neoplasm', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Oncology', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Discharge Plannings', 'Disease', 'Early identification', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Evidence based intervention', 'Exposure to', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health system', 'Human', 'Industry', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Intuition', 'Jail', 'Judgment', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life Expectancy', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical Oncologist', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'Oncologist', 'Oncology', 'Outcome', 'Palliative Care', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Pragmatic clinical trial', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Public Health', 'Quality of Care', 'Quality of life', 'Rain', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Relative Risks', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Sepsis', 'Services', 'Survey Methodology', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'User-Computer Interface', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'algorithm development', 'algorithmic methodologies', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'cancer care', 'care delivery', 'career', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'design', 'electronic structure', 'end of life', 'end of life care', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'health care service organization', 'health data', 'high risk', 'human model', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'model development', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'outcome forecast', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'prognostic tool', 'programs', 'prospective', 'randomized trial', 'risk prediction', 'routine care']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K08,2021,231174
"A data science approach to identify and manage Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and Kawasaki disease in pediatric patients Summary – Since the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic began, the emergence of an associated novel multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) has been reported. Interestingly, patients with MIS-C follow a presentation, management and clinical course that are somewhat similar to that of patients with Kawasaki disease (KD). Currently, the reason for such an overlap in clinical features and management is unclear and whether this overlap is the result of a partially shared etiology or pathophysiology is the subject of fierce debates. The degree of overlap implies that some of the clinical prediction tools that we have developed in the past for KD could be repurposed to accelerate the development of clinical support decision tools for MIS-C. In this study, we will first (R61 component) systematically address the overlap between KD and MIS-C and create salient machine-learning based prediction models for diagnosis/identification (Aim #1), management (Aim #2), and short- and long-term outcomes (Aim #3) of MIS-C based on our previously developed predictive models for KD in a process akin to transfer learning. Secondly (R33 component), we will validate and evaluate the performance and clinical utility of these models in a predictive clinical decision support system for the diagnosis and management of pediatric patients presenting with features indicative of either MIS-C or KD. In this study we will include 3 groups of patients: 1) patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection with MIS-C (CDC criteria) regardless of whether they have overlapping signs of KD, 2) patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection investigated for but eventually not diagnosed with MIS-C, and 3) patients with KD but without SARS-CoV-2 infection. Targeted data will be collected from enrolled patients (900 for training and 450 for validation) for deep phenotyping and biomarker measurements. Physician feedback on the predictions generated by the algorithm will be used to establish clinical utility. Data required for model training will be accrued in the first two years of activity (R61 period of the grant); the development of algorithms and their internal validation will occur concurrently. In the following 2 years (R33 period of the grant), we will perform external validation, establish clinical utility, add real- time epidemiological surveillance data to the models and finally package, and certify the algorithms for future deployment and for the integration in electronic health records. This project will be a collaboration with the International Kawasaki Disease Registry (IKDR) Consortium. The IKDR Consortium has an active KD and pediatric COVID registry in 35 sites across the world and the number of sites is currently expanding to 60+ sites. More than 600 MIS-C patients have already been identified at IKDR centers, making this project clearly feasible and perfectly positioning IKDR to perform this study. We strongly believe that the use of emerging data science methods and of our previously developed algorithms in the context of KD, as opposed to focusing on MIS-C patients alone, will boost our understanding of the etiology and pathophysiology of both MIS-C and KD and will more rapidly lead to the emergence of data-driven management protocols for patients with MIS-C. Project narrative - The primary objective of this study is to design and validate a predictive decision support system for the identification, treatment and management of SARS-CoV-2 associated with multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). To develop this system, we will adapt and retrain machine learning algorithms which we have previously trained in patients with Kawasaki Disease, a pediatric inflammatory vasculopathy with multiple similarities to MIS-C. This study, performed in collaboration with the International Kawasaki Disease Registry (IKDR) consortium, will consist of two phases, first a large-scale data collection and algorithm development effort and second, the prospective evaluation of the performance and clinical utility of the algorithm ahead of large-scale deployment.",A data science approach to identify and manage Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and Kawasaki disease in pediatric patients,10272448,R61HD105591,"['2019-nCoV', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Benign', 'Biological Markers', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'COVID-19 patient', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Management', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Consultations', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Science', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiologic Monitoring', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Grant', 'Heart Diseases', 'Image', 'Inflammatory', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Management Decision Support Systems', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mucocutaneous Lymph Node Syndrome', 'Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Recording of previous events', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'SARS-CoV-2 exposure', 'SARS-CoV-2 infection', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Site', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'algorithm development', 'application programming interface', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical development', 'clinical predictors', 'coronavirus disease', 'design', 'disease registry', 'epidemiologic data', 'experience', 'interoperability', 'large scale data', 'machine learning algorithm', 'medical complication', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'pediatric patients', 'phenotypic biomarker', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'response', 'surveillance data', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NICHD,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R61,2021,917957
"Quantifying Compliance to the New 2017 Hypertension Treatment Guidelines and Investigating the Association Between Guideline Compliance and Patients' Trajectory of Blood Pressure Project Summary/Abstract Blood pressure (BP) of ³140/90 mm Hg doubles the risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and the total cost of hypertension reaches as high as $51 billion per year. Despite the enormous risk and cost associated with hypertension, less than half (48.3%) of hypertensive patients have a controlled blood pressure (BP) in the United States. Clinical trials demonstrated that a high rate of BP control (up to 85%) can be achieved with currently available therapies and strictly following recommended treatment protocols. This suggests that a higher proportion of uncontrolled BP could be explained by less aggressive treatment, poorer follow-up, and use of fewer or less effective drugs. The 2017 guideline for high BP management was recently published and lowered the threshold for the initiation of medication and definition of uncontrolled BP to BP ≥130/80 mm Hg (from 140/90) for patients with CVD or higher risk of CVD. This challenges physicians to change their traditional hypertension management and could worsen the already low rate of compliance (range 25-65%) to hypertension treatment guidelines. Furthermore, conclusions from previous studies regarding compliance to older hypertension treatment guidelines were compromised due to failure to evaluate multiple aspects of hypertension care, such as comorbidities, follow-up and laboratory assessments; and use of subjective assessment such as physician self-report. The wide-spread adoption of electronic health record (EHR) technology and the vital patient information present in EHR data provide an exceptional opportunity to objectively evaluate several aspects of hypertension care, such as medications prescribed, laboratory procedures ordered, BP level achieved, follow-up monitoring examinations, demographic and comorbid information. We, therefore, propose to use the Northwestern Medicine Enterprise Data Warehouse (NMEDW) – an integrated EHR database of health information from 2.9 million patients to 1) assess compliance to the 2017 hypertension management guidelines for 5 years since its release (2018-2022); 2) investigate whether patient’s age, race, body mass index, history of diabetes, CVD, chronic kidney disease, medication adherence, presence of health insurance and regular physician, and physican speciality predict level of compliance to the new treatment guideline; and 3) examine the association between level of compliance to the 2017 hypertension treatment guidelines and prospective patient BP trajectory over 5 years (2019-2023). Newly diagnosed hypertensive patients’ demographics, BP, medications, lab results, follow-up visit, and comorbid conditions will be assessed from the NMEDW and will be compared to criteria developed based on the 2017 hypertension treatment guidelines to quantify compliance to the guideline. The proposed study provides the candidate an opportunity to learn EHR data-mining skills to assess association between compliance to the new hypertension treatment guideline and patient BP trajectory and to identify predictors of this compliance, as a first step, in designing future targeted interventions to enhance guideline compliance and BP control. Project Narrative The 2017 hypertension treatment guideline lowered the threshold for the initiation of hypertensive medication and definition of uncontrolled blood pressure (BP) to BP ≥130/80 mm Hg (from ≥140/90). This could worsen the already low rate of compliance (25-65%) to treatment guidelines. In this study, we will evaluate physician compliance to the 2017 hypertension treatment guideline and its association with patient BP using electronic health record data that comprises information on several aspects of hypertension care. Findings of this study will help in designing future targeted interventions to enhance compliance to treatment guideline and BP control.",Quantifying Compliance to the New 2017 Hypertension Treatment Guidelines and Investigating the Association Between Guideline Compliance and Patients' Trajectory of Blood Pressure,10111556,K01HL145345,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Blood Pressure', 'Body mass index', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Caring', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diastolic blood pressure', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Drug Side Effects', 'E-learning', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiology', 'Failure', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Insurance', 'Hypertension', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Procedures', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Minority', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Obesity', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Provider', 'Publishing', 'Race', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Titrations', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States', 'Visit', 'aggressive therapy', 'base', 'blood pressure medication', 'blood pressure regulation', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'comorbidity', 'computerized', 'cost', 'data mining', 'data warehouse', 'demographics', 'design', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'hypertension control', 'hypertension treatment', 'improved', 'medication compliance', 'phenotyping algorithm', 'prospective', 'provider adherence', 'skills', 'treatment guidelines']",NHLBI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,K01,2021,121124
"Using Computational Approaches to Optimize Asthma Care Management Abstract  The study will develop more accurate, computational predictive models and a novel automatic explanation function to better identify patients likely to benefit most from care management. For many chronic diseases, a small portion of patients with high vulnerabilities, severe disease, or great barriers to care consume most healthcare resources and costs. To improve outcomes and resource use, many healthcare systems use predictive models to prospectively identify high-risk patients and enroll them in care management to implement tailored care plans. For maximal benefit from costly care management with limited service capacity, only patients at the highest risk should be enrolled. But, current patient identification approaches have two limitations: 1) Low prediction accuracy causes misclassification, wasted costs, and suboptimal care. If an existing model  were used for care management allocation, enrollment would miss >50% of those who would benefit most  but include others unlikely to benefit. A healthcare system often has insufficient data for model training and  incomplete data on many patients. A typical model uses only a few risk factors for adverse outcomes, despite  many being known. Also, many predictive variables on patient and system characteristics are not found yet. 2) No explanation of the reasons for a prediction causes poor adoption of the prediction and busy care  managers to spend extra time and miss suitable interventions. Care managers need to understand why a  patient is predicted to be at high risk before allocating to care management and forming a tailored care plan.  Existing models rarely give such explanation, forcing care managers to do detailed patient chart reviews.  To address the limitations and optimize care management for more high-risk patients to receive appropriate care, the study will: a) improve accuracy of computationally identifying high-risk patients and assess potential impact on outcomes; b) automate explanation of computational prediction results and assess impact on model accuracy and outcomes; c) assess automatic explanations' impact on care managers' acceptance of the predictions and perceived care plan quality. The use case will be asthma that affects 9% of Americans and incurs 439,000 hospitalizations, 1.8 million emergency room visits, and $56 billion in cost annually. Asthma experts and computer scientists will use data from three leading healthcare systems; a novel, model-based transfer learning technique needing no other system's raw data; a novel, pattern-based automatic explanation technique that also improves model generalizability and accuracy; a new data source PreManage to make patient data more complete; and novel features on patient and system characteristics. These techniques can advance clinical machine learning for various applications, improve patient identification, and help form tailored care plans. Focus groups will be conducted with clinicians to explore generalizing the techniques to patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, and heart diseases, on whom care management is also needed. The results will potentially transform care management for better outcomes and more efficient resource use. Narrative  Care management is widely used in managing asthma patients. The proposed new techniques will boost the performance of patient identification and care plan development for care management, leading to improved clinical outcomes and more efficient healthcare resource use.",Using Computational Approaches to Optimize Asthma Care Management,10176558,R01HL142503,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Air', 'American', 'Asthma', 'California', 'Caring', 'Case Manager', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computers', 'Consumption', 'Costs and Benefits', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Development Plans', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Drops', 'Emergency department visit', 'Enrollment', 'Focus Groups', 'Health Services Research', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hospitalization', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care Planning', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Physicians&apos', ' Offices', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Publishing', 'Records', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'Weather', 'acute care', 'adverse outcome', 'asthmatic patient', 'barrier to care', 'base', 'care costs', 'computer science', 'cost', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'novel', 'patient population', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'simulation']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2021,775715
"Inconspicuous Daily Monitoring to Reduce Heart Failure Hospitalizations Project Summary/Abstract In-home monitoring technologies have the potential to transform the healthcare system by enabling the transition from reactive care to proactive and preventive care. This is especially important for cardiovascular disease (CVD); the leading cause of death worldwide. Heart failure (HF), a type of CVD characterized by a weakened heart muscle, impacts approximately 6.5 million Americans with over 960,000 new cases each year. HF costs the US an estimated $30.7 billion annually and is expected to increase 127% to $69.7 billion by 2030. With approximately 80% of the total cost associated with HF due to hospitalization, there is an opportunity to reduce the cost of HF by lowering hospitalization rates through remote patient monitoring. Since patient awareness of symptomology often lags deterioration, successfully tracking physiologic changes in the home is a critical component of an early intervention strategy. Classical approaches to in-home monitoring, such as blood pressure and weight monitoring have had limited success, with patient adherence cited as major barrier to reducing hospitalizations. The central hypothesis of this research is that hospitalization rates and duration of stay for heart failure patients can be significantly reduced through inconspicuous in-home monitoring and early intervention. This research will leverage a highly innovative technology for cardiovascular in-home daily monitoring; the fully integrated toilet seat (FIT). The FIT seat automatically captures a comprehensive cardiovascular assessment in the home, while ensuring long-term patient adherence. A multidisciplinary research team, comprised of engineers, physicians, advanced practice providers (APP), data scientists, biostatisticians, designers, and software developers, will advance an automated system that provides health care providers with early warning of patient deterioration using the FIT system measurements captured in the home. The success of this system will be evaluated through an in-home clinical trial of heart failure patients. Specific Aim 1 seeks to create a learning dataset and data visualization architecture from HF patient in-home physiologic data, perceived wellness, and adverse events. The FIT seat will be deployed for a 90-day in-home study of 200 HF patients, with patient perceived wellness and activity captured through a custom application. This physiologic, wellness, and activity data will be combined with adverse events from the electronic medical record to create an integrated dataset for retrospective analysis and alert model development. In Aim 2, an automated prediction model for early alert of all-cause hospitalizations will be created using novel machine learning techniques. The objective of Aim 3 is to demonstrate that inconspicuous in-home monitoring and early intervention can reduce hospitalizations in a second cohort of 200 HF patients. We hypothesize that the integrated FIT-based alert system will reduce the burden of all-cause hospitalization and will improve the quality of life for patients.

"Improving Outcomes for Care Partners of Persons with Traumatic Brain Injury Abstract Care partners of persons with moderate to severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) are often required to assume a caregiver role, bearing primary responsibility for assisting the person with TBI in physical, mental, financial, and leisure activities. As a result of these new caregiving responsibilities, it is common for these care partners to report problems with physical, mental, and social health, as well as compromised health-related quality of life (HRQOL). Given that care partners’ well-being and functioning affects both their own personal health outcomes, as well as the functional and rehabilitation outcomes of the person with TBI, there is a critical need to develop novel health management interventions to ensure better health outcomes for both members of the TBI care partnership dyad. Therefore, our long-term goal is to improve the health and well-being of these care partners, as well as their ability to provide care to their loved one. Thus, the proposed randomized control trial will examine the efficacy of a just-in-time adaptive intervention (JITAI), or personalized self-management intervention that uses objective mobile sensor data feedback to improve physical activity, sleep, and HRQOL in 240 care partners of persons with TBI. Our primary objectives are to: 1) assess the efficacy of this novel personalized self-management intervention (i.e., JITAI) for preventing the development of adverse symptoms (e.g., mobility, sleep, poor HRQOL); and 2) use data collected from wearables (i.e., the Fitbit Charge®) and real-time assessments of HRQOL to identify care partners with the greatest risk for negative physical and mental HRQOL outcomes, as well as the timing for when they are at greatest risk. We expect care partners that are randomized to receive the JITAI will demonstrate improvements in HRQOL, physical activity and sleep relative to controls. We also hypothesize is that objective, data-derived mobile phenotypes can predict risk for adverse caregiver HRQOL. The scientific premise for the proposed research is based on our multidisciplinary team with expertise in caregiver research, evaluation of HRQOL using patient-reported outcomes, clinical trials implementation, expertise in real time assessment of HRQOL, as well as the statistical expertise in high- dimensional statistics and machine learning. Furthermore, the innovation is grounded in the examination of a real-time, real-world, personalized and scalable JITAI designed to improve HRQOL in care partners. Ultimately, this study will allow us to identify care partners at the greatest risk for negative physical and mental health outcomes, and will provide important efficacy data to support the clinical utility of a low cost, low burden self-management intervention to improve HRQOL for care partners of persons with TBI. Narrative Care partners of persons with traumatic brain injury (TBI) are often faced with considerable physical and emotional stress resulting from their caregiver role; not surprisingly, this stress is associated with negative physical and mental health outcomes for both the care partner and the person for whom they provide care. Given this, interventions focused on improving the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of these care partners will likely have positive downstream effects for the care recipient. The purpose of this study is to examine the efficacy of a personalized self-management intervention designed to promote care partner self-care; this intervention uses physical activity and sleep data collected using a Fitbit® and real-time self-reports of HRQOL collected via a mobile phone app, to provide care partners with personalized feedback via app alert four times per week.",Improving Outcomes for Care Partners of Persons with Traumatic Brain Injury,10110031,R01NR013658,"['Accelerometer', 'Affect', 'Anxiety', 'Beds', 'Car Phone', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Caregiver research', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Charge', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Communities', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Emotional Stress', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Family', 'Family Caregiver', 'Fatigue', 'Feedback', 'Financial Activity', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Priorities', 'Heart', 'Home environment', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Leisure Activities', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Nursing Research', 'Outcome', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Physical Function', 'Physical activity', 'Physical assessment', 'Population', 'Psyche structure', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Rehabilitation Outcome', 'Reporting', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Priority', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Self Care', 'Self Management', 'Sleep', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Social Functioning', 'Stress', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Time', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'adaptive intervention', 'base', 'care outcomes', 'care recipients', 'care systems', 'caregiver strain', 'caregiving', 'clinical trial implementation', 'control trial', 'cost', 'design', 'efficacy evaluation', 'fitbit', 'functional outcomes', 'group intervention', 'health assessment', 'health management', 'health related quality of life', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'insight', 'loved ones', 'member', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'physical conditioning', 'poor sleep', 'post intervention', 'prevent', 'psychologic', 'sensor', 'sleep health', 'smoking cessation', 'social', 'statistics', 'therapy design', 'tv watching']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2021,592501
"Collaborative multi-site project to speed the identification and management of rare genetic immune diseases Summary  The subject of this proposal is a new, collaborative approach to improve the diagnosis of primary immunodeficiency diseases (PIDs). These patients have individually rare, monogenic disorders leading to severe infections, autoimmunity, and inflammation. The prevalence of PIDs is ~1:10,000 and approximately half have antibody deficiencies as their main immunological phenotype. Most doctors are unaware of these diseases and many patients go years without a diagnosis, costing the system tens of thousands of dollars per patient yearly and unnecessarily increasing morbidity and mortality. There is a tremendous, untapped opportunity to advance the diagnosis of patients with PIDs.  We propose to utilize new machine-learning approaches to algorithmically identify patients with PIDs from their electronic health records (EHR). To accomplish our goals, we have built a coalition of computational genomics groups at UCLA, UCSF, and Vanderbilt (Computational team), and clinical immunology groups at the five University of California medical centers (Los Angeles, San Francisco, Irvine, San Diego, and Davis) (Immunology team). We propose to: Identify patients with rare immune diseases by phenotype risk scoring (Aim 1). We will speed the identification of patients with rare immune diseases by surveilling the EHR using a phenotype risk scoring approach, building upon recently published work in Science. We will apply this approach to the UCLA, UCSF, and Vanderbilt clinical data repositories to identify potential cases. We will improve risk scoring by considering gender, age, and race/ethnicity. We will classify patients by whether they have an infection phenotype or immune dysregulation phenotype. Subsequently, we will expand to the larger, UC Health-wide Data Warehouse (UCHWDW), entailing 15+ million patients across all UC medical centers. We will then Identify the genetic immune diseases for these newly found subjects (Aim 2). We will follow the state-of-the-art approach employed by the UCLA and Vanderbilt Undiagnosed Disease Network (UDN) sites. We will start by sequencing all the known antibody deficiency patients across the Immunology team sites while collaboratively pre-reviewing identified cases from Aim 1 on monthly video-calls. For selected subjects, we will perform whole genome and RNA sequencing. Clinical and research laboratory testing will bring closure to the diagnostic odyssey for these subjects.  The overall impact of this work accelerates the diagnosis and cure of PIDs. This project will also serve as a demonstration of how immunology sites can work together sharing electronic medical records and genomic data to advance care. Narrative A major challenge for patients with immune diseases is the delay in diagnosis that leads to morbidity and mortality. This proposal combines teams from the five medical centers of the University of California and Vanderbilt to apply advanced computational, machine-learning approaches to identify patients with genetic immunodeficiency diseases. This approach will dramatically improve the care of otherwise-neglected patients with rare diseases.",Collaborative multi-site project to speed the identification and management of rare genetic immune diseases,10220648,R01AI153827,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Antibodies', 'Autoimmunity', 'Awareness', 'Bronchiectasis', 'California', 'Caring', 'Case Report Form', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Immunology', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Common Variable Immunodeficiency', 'Computer Models', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Drops', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitals', 'Immune', 'Immune System Diseases', 'Immunogenetics', 'Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes', 'Immunological Diagnosis', 'Immunologics', 'Immunology', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Inflammation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Research', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Los Angeles', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Medicine', 'Mendelian disorder', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Immunity', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Rare Diseases', 'Risk', 'San Francisco', 'Schedule', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Visit', 'Work', 'adaptive immunity', 'algorithm development', 'base', 'clinical data repository', 'clinical data warehouse', 'collaborative approach', 'congenital immunodeficiency', 'cost', 'data standards', 'data warehouse', 'disease diagnosis', 'disease phenotype', 'falls', 'genetic disorder diagnosis', 'genome sequencing', 'genomic data', 'health data', 'improved', 'innovation', 'medical specialties', 'mortality', 'neglect', 'next generation', 'peer', 'psychosocial', 'risk prediction', 'screening', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'whole genome']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2021,806368
"Efficient Statistical Learning Methods for Personalized Medicine Using Large Scale Biomedical Data Project Summary/Abstract  Current medical treatment guidelines largely rely on data from randomized controlled trials that study  average effects, which may be inadequate for making individualized decisions for real-world patients. Large-scale electronic health records (EHRs) data provide unprecedented opportunities to optimize personalized treatment strategies and generate evidence relevant to real-world patients. However, there are inherent challenges in the use of EHRs, including non-experimental nature of data collection processes, heterogeneous data types with complex dependencies, irregular measurement patterns, multiple dynamic treatment sequences, and the need to balance risk and benefit of treatments. Using two high-quality EHR databases, Columbia University Medical Center's clinical data warehouse and the Indiana Network for Patient Care database, and focusing on type 2 diabetes (T2D), this proposal will develop novel and scalable statistical learning approaches that overcome these challenges to discover optimal personalized treatment strategies for T2D from real-world patients. Specifically, under Aim 1, we will develop a unified framework to learn latent temporal processes for feature extraction and dynamic patient records representation. Our approach will accommodate large-scale variables of mixed types (continuous, binary, counts) measured at irregular intervals. They extract lower-dimensional components to reflect patients' dynamic health status, account for informative healthcare documentation processes, and characterize similarities between patients. Under Aim 2, we will develop fast and efficient multi-category machine learning methods, in order to evaluate treatment propensities and adaptively learn optimal dynamic treatment regimens (DTRs) among the extensive number of treatment options observed in the EHRs. The methods will provide  sequential decisions that determine the best treatment sequence for a T2D patient given his/her EHRs. Under Aim 3, we will develop statistical learning methods to assist multi-faceted treatment decision-making, which balances risks versus benefits when evaluating a DTR. Our approach will ensure maximizing benefit to the greatest extent while controlling all risk outcomes under the safety margins. For all aims, we will develop efficient stochastic resampling algorithms to scale up the optimization for massive data sizes. We will identify optimal DTRs for T2D using the extracted information from patients' comorbidity conditions, medications, and laboratory tests, as well as records-collection processes. Our methodologies will be applied and cross-validated between the two EHR databases. The treatment strategies learned from the representative EHR databases with a diverse patient  population will be beneficial for individual patient care, assisting clinicians to adaptively choose the optimal treatment for a patient. Finally, we will disseminate our methods and results through freely available software and outreach to the informatics and clinical experts at our Centers for Translational Science and elsewhere. Project Narrative  This proposal aims to develop novel and scalable statistical learning methods to analyze electronic health records (EHRs) and use two real-world, high-quality EHR databases for personalized medicine research. The methods will handle the non-experimental nature of data collection processes, along with heterogeneous data types, dynamic treatment sequences, and the trade-off between benefit and risk outcomes.

"A Multi-Dimensional Linked Registry to Identify Biological, Clinical, Health System, and Socioeconomic Risk Factors for COVID-19-Related Cardiovascular Events PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT There is mounting concern that patients hospitalized with COVID-19 experience unexpectedly high rates of cardiac and vascular events. Identifying which patients are at highest risk for COVID-19-related cardiovascular events and delineating how these events affect short- and long-term outcomes may help support individualized patient care, illuminate underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms, and accelerate the development of effective therapies. However, little is known about how multi-dimensional risk factors, including prior medical conditions, socioeconomic indicators, and circulating levels of biomarkers affect patient outcomes. Building on our team's expertise in data linkage, prediction modeling, and biomarker discovery, we will create a unique and powerful linked data resource to characterize the biological, clinical, health system, and socioeconomic risk factors for the development of cardiovascular sequelae of COVID-19 and examine their impact on health outcomes. To create this data resource, we have partnered with the American Heart Association, whose COVID-19 Cardiovascular Disease Registry is actively capturing high-quality, standardized information on all adults hospitalized with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection at >100 U.S. sites spanning 30 states. We will link this registry to comprehensive health care claims, a national socioeconomic deprivation index, and detailed health care system information. In Aim 1, we will apply traditional and machine learning approaches to the linked multicenter registry in order to identify the clinical, health system, and socioeconomic factors that predict in-hospital major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) among COVID-19 patients. In Aim 2, we will characterize long-term MACE (i.e., at 1 and 2 years after discharge from the index COVID-19 hospitalization) among older adults in a large multicenter registry linked with longitudinal Medicare claims, and identify the clinical, health system, and socioeconomic factors that predict their occurrence. Based on this work, we will create clinically implementable risk scores which will estimate, at the time of admission for and discharge from an index COVID-19 hospitalization, a patient's risk of developing a major cardiovascular event. In Aim 3, we evaluate the proteomic profiles of a subset of patients in the linked registry with biobanked serial blood samples, and identify biochemical markers that predict the occurrence of MACE, both during index hospitalization for COVID-19 and after discharge. This research will advance our collective understanding of the biological, clinical, and socioeconomic predictors of COVID-19-related cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. By identifying patients at greatest at risk of cardiovascular events, our work will help frontline clinicians better individualize clinical management strategies and health systems improve care delivery during future waves of the pandemic. PROJECT NARRATIVE Cardiovascular events (heart damage, stroke, blood clots) appear to be both common and dangerous in patients who are hospitalized with COVID-19. A better understanding of which patients are at highest risk for these events is a key step to developing better approaches for prevention and treatment. We will combine multiple sources of information, including a large national COVID-19 registry from the American Heart Association, health care data from Medicare, and blood protein levels from patients treated at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, to identify the factors that are associated with a higher risk of short- and long-term cardiovascular events among patients hospitalized with COVID-19.","A Multi-Dimensional Linked Registry to Identify Biological, Clinical, Health System, and Socioeconomic Risk Factors for COVID-19-Related Cardiovascular Events",10183512,R01HL157530,"['Address', 'Admission activity', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'American Heart Association', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Markers', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Proteins', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood coagulation', 'Blood specimen', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 patient', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Communities', 'Comprehensive Health Care', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Data Linkages', 'Deep Vein Thrombosis', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Embolism', 'Event', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Arrest', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Israel', 'Link', 'Longterm Follow-up', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Medicare', 'Medicare claim', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Myocarditis', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Predictive Factor', 'Prevention approach', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'SARS-CoV-2 infection', 'Site', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Time', 'Ventricular Arrhythmia', 'Work', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomarker discovery', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'care delivery', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical predictors', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'data resource', 'deprivation', 'disease registry', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'heart damage', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'insight', 'medical information system', 'mortality', 'older patient', 'pandemic disease', 'patient subsets', 'personalized care', 'personalized management', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'risk prediction', 'rurality', 'socioeconomics']",NHLBI,BETH ISRAEL DEACONESS MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,873210
"Improving glucose control with advanced technology designed for high risk patients with type 1 diabetes Summary The objective of this proposal is to optimize the design and evaluate a robust artificial pancreas (R-AP) system for use in patients with uncontrolled type 1 diabetes (T1D) with HbA1C greater than 8% and compare HbA1C outcomes in these patients relative to a decision support system that utilizes continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and multiple daily injection (MDI) therapy. Although high risk patients have possibly the most to gain from usage of AP technology, they are oftentimes under-represented or excluded from clinical trials. This has been because of the increased risk of failure of these AP systems that were not designed to handle inconsistent reporting of meals, variable activity level, and infusion set failures. An AP system for high risk patients needs to be designed to achieve maximal benefit, including reducing the risk of acute and chronic complications. A major obstacle for enabling the AP for usage by high-risk patients is that these patients may be less compliant with use guidelines for the system including missed meal announcements, infrequent sensor calibrations, and prolonged infusion set wear leading to infusion set failures. In this grant, we will integrate new risk-mitigation features into the OHSU single-hormone AP to enable usage by high-risk patients that fall into the categories described above. We present new algorithms for automating the detection of missed meal announcements, missed calibrations, and robust handling of hybrid usage mode. While AP systems may be an optimal choice for improving glycemic control, many people with T1D prefer MDI therapy. Decision support systems such as the DailyDose decision support system developed at OHSU can be used to improve glycemic control for patients who prefer MDI therapy. The DailyDose decision support system is designed for CGM augmented MDI therapy. It enables on-demand calculation of insulin doses, automates insulin dose adjustments based on pattern recognition, and uses machine learning approaches to alert the patients to events such as predicted hypoglycemia and missed meal doses.The benefit of the DailyDose system is that it is a simple system and does not require use of an insulin pump, which may be a challenge for some patients with uncontrolled type 1 diabetes as pump therapy is more intensive and requires infusion set changes. It is unknown in this high risk group of people whether patient needs, quality of life, and glycemic control are best addressed with an AP system or decision support tool or if both treatments are appropriate. We have designed a 3-month clinical study to compare glycemic outcomes during AP vs. decision support interventions in a high- risk T1D cohort (HbA1C 8-10.5%), with the aim of demonstrating a significant clinically relevant reduction in HbA1C. Our hypothesis is that both AP and decision support therapies will decrease HbA1C relative to baseline but that the AP will provide further benefit over DailyDose. Project Narrative Diabetes is the leading cause of blindness, kidney failure, and non-traumatic amputations. We propose to integrate features into the OHSU artificial pancreas to optimize it for high risk patients with type 1 diabetes (HbA1c>8-10.5%) and compare it to DailyDose, a decision support system that uses multiple daily injections.",Improving glucose control with advanced technology designed for high risk patients with type 1 diabetes,10144423,R01DK120367,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Pancreas', 'Awareness', 'Behavioral', 'Blindness', 'Bluetooth', 'Calibration', 'Carbohydrates', 'Categories', 'Cellular Phone', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Detection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic Ketoacidosis', 'Dose', 'Emotional', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Failure', 'Fright', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Hormones', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Hyperglycemia', 'Hypoglycemia', 'Infusion procedures', 'Injection of therapeutic agent', 'Injections', 'Inpatients', 'Insulin', 'Insulin Infusion Systems', 'Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Intervention', 'Kidney Failure', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Modification', 'Multicenter Trials', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Outcome Study', 'Outpatients', 'Patients', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Personality', 'Pump', 'Quality of life', 'Questionnaires', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Update', 'arm', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'blood glucose regulation', 'clinically relevant', 'clinically significant', 'cohort', 'design', 'diabetes distress', 'engineering design', 'expectation', 'falls', 'glucose monitor', 'glycemic control', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'implementation design', 'improved', 'in silico', 'patient population', 'primary outcome', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'risk minimization', 'risk mitigation', 'secondary outcome', 'sensor', 'smart watch', 'support tools']",NIDDK,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,592875
"Low-cost detection of dementia using electronic health records data: validation and testing of the eRADAR algorithm in a pragmatic, patient-centered trial. Nearly half of people currently living with dementia have not received a diagnosis, delaying access to treatment as well as education and support for the patient and family. Thus, NIA has requested applications to support pragmatic clinical trials of low-cost tools to improve detection of cognitive decline in clinical settings (RFA-AG- 20-051). With pilot funding from NIA, we used machine learning to develop a low-cost tool called eRADAR (electronic health record Risk of Alzheimer's and Dementia Assessment Rule), which uses easily accessible information in the electronic health record (EHR) to help identify patients with undiagnosed dementia. In addition, we interviewed patients, caregivers, clinicians, and healthcare system leaders to inform pragmatic implementation of eRADAR in clinical settings. Stakeholders felt strongly that such a tool should be implemented through primary care, in the context of existing clinical relationships, and would need to be accompanied by additional support for patients and clinicians. Our current proposal is heavily informed by this development work. In Aim 1, we will use EHR data to evaluate eRADAR's performance in different patient subgroups, including by race/ethnicity, in two healthcare systems to inform selection of cut- points for use in clinical settings. We will select an optimal cut-point to use for targeted dementia assessment with stakeholder input, balancing sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value. In Aim 2, we will perform a pragmatic clinical trial to determine whether implementing eRADAR as part of a supported outreach process to high-risk patients improves dementia detection. The setting will be primary care clinics within Kaiser Permanente Washington (KPWA), an integrated healthcare delivery system in Washington State, and the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), an urban, academic healthcare system with a diverse patient population. The study includes 6 clinics with ~24,000 patients age ≥65. Within each clinic, primary care providers (PCPs) will be randomly assigned to have their patients with high eRADAR scores targeted for outreach (intervention) or to usual care (control). Our clinical research staff—whose roles were designed to reflect existing roles within these healthcare systems to maximize pragmatism—will reach out to patients with high eRADAR scores, conduct an assessment for cognitive impairment, make follow-up recommendations to PCPs, and support patients after diagnosis. Patients with high eRADAR scores in both treatment arms will be followed to determine the impact of eRADAR on new diagnoses of dementia (primary outcome) as assessed from the EHR (again, to maximize pragmatism). In Aim 3, we will explore the impact of eRADAR implementation on secondary outcomes including healthcare utilization and experience of patients and family members. If this pragmatic trial is successful, the eRADAR tool and process could be spread to other healthcare systems, potentially improving detection of cognitive decline, patient care, and quality of life. Most patients with cognitive impairment are diagnosed relatively late in the disease process, and about half of people living with dementia are undiagnosed. We have developed a low-cost tool called eRADAR (electronic health record Risk of Alzheimer's and Dementia Assessment Rule) that uses information in electronic health records to help identify patients with undiagnosed dementia. This study will determine whether a supported process of reaching out to patients with high eRADAR scores as part of primary care leads to earlier detection of dementia and improves patient care.","Low-cost detection of dementia using electronic health records data: validation and testing of the eRADAR algorithm in a pragmatic, patient-centered trial.",10266125,R01AG069734,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'California', 'Caregivers', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Education', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency department visit', 'Equilibrium', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Impaired cognition', 'Inpatients', 'Integrated Delivery of Health Care', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Participant', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Education', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Pragmatic clinical trial', 'Predictive Value', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Primary Health Care', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Quality of Care', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Request for Applications', 'Research Design', 'Research Support', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Role', 'San Francisco', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Services', 'Stroke', 'Subgroup', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Underweight', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Washington', 'Work', 'base', 'care providers', 'clinical care', 'comparison intervention', 'cost', 'dementia risk', 'design', 'electronic structure', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'formative assessment', 'health care service utilization', 'high risk', 'human old age (65+)', 'improved', 'medication compliance', 'neuroimaging', 'outreach', 'patient oriented', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'pragmatic trial', 'primary outcome', 'satisfaction', 'secondary outcome', 'sex', 'tool', 'treatment arm', 'treatment as usual', 'usual care arm']",NIA,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2021,903251
"A Personalized, Patient-Centered Approach to Optimizing Lupus Care Candidate: April Jorge, MD is an Instructor in Medicine at Harvard Medical School (HMS) and an Assistant in Medicine in the Rheumatology Unit at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH). After graduating from the University of Maryland magna cum laude, she received her MD from Georgetown University, and she completed her internal medicine residency at Northwestern University. She completed her rheumatology fellowship at MGH, during which she also completed the Harvard Catalyst Clinical and Translational Research Academy and began working with Hyon Choi, MD, DrPH. Dr. Jorge's prior work has resulted in 15 peer- reviewed original papers, with 13 as the first author or co-first author. Her goal is to become an independent investigator and innovative leader in patient-oriented research of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Mentorship, Training Activities, and Environment: Dr. Jorge will conduct the proposed project at MGH under the mentorship of Hyon Choi, MD, DrPH and co-mentorship of Karen Costenbader, MD, MPH and Karen Sepucha, PhD. Dr. Choi is a world-renowned, NIH-funded physician scientist in advanced clinical epidemiology of rheumatic conditions, ranging from common disorders to rare but serious disorders (e.g., SLE). He has served as a mentor for several prior K awardees. Dr. Costenbader is a clinical investigator and expert in SLE who is also an experienced mentor of K awardees. Dr. Sepucha is a leading expert in patient-centered decision science. Dr. Jorge's research will also benefit from the specific expertise of her key collaborators, including advanced clinical epidemiology methods, machine learning prediction algorithms, and decision- analytic modeling. In addition to receiving excellent mentorship, she will acquire new skills through didactics in advanced clinical epidemiology and pharmacoepidemiology, risk prediction, eliciting patient preferences with a mixed methods research approach, and decision-analytic modeling. Research: SLE carries increased risks of multiple comorbidities and double the risk of death compared to the general population. Current treatment is limited in part by few proven medications and adverse treatment effects. The central goal of this research is to improve long-term SLE outcomes by integrating personalized risks of potential harms and benefits with patient preferences to guide the personalized, patient-centered use of key lupus medications. To achieve this goal, she will risk stratify patients for potential harms of treatment, i.e., hydroxychloroquine retinopathy and infection with belimumab use versus other immunosuppressants, and other adverse outcomes, i.e., severe COVID-19 infection (Aim 1). She will elicit patient preferences for SLE treatment through a discrete choice experiment (Aim 2a) and will integrate patient preferences with personalized risks through a multi-criteria decision analysis to determine the optimal hydroxychloroquine dose in SLE care (Aim 2b). Completion of this proposal and training plan will position Dr. Jorge with the vital experience to become an independent clinical investigator in patient-oriented research of SLE. Project Narrative Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a heterogeneous systemic condition associated with serious morbidity and premature mortality, yet treatment options are limited. There is uncertainty regarding the optimal use of the two FDA-approved lupus medications, hydroxychloroquine and belimumab, due in part to the risks of adverse treatment effects including hydroxychloroquine retinopathy and infection. This Career Development Award focuses on applying advanced clinical epidemiology and patient-centered decision science to integrate personalized risks of potential harms and benefits with patient preferences to guide the personalized, patient- centered use of key lupus medications, including specifically the optimal dose of hydroxychloroquine in SLE care.","A Personalized, Patient-Centered Approach to Optimizing Lupus Care",10192142,K23AR079040,"['Academy', 'Adverse effects', 'Award', 'Azathioprine', 'Biological', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Data', 'Decision Analysis', 'Decision Making', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Dose', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Equilibrium', 'Event', 'FDA approved', 'Fellowship', 'Flare', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'General Hospitals', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Harm Reduction', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hydroxychloroquine', 'Immunosuppressive Agents', 'Infection', 'Internal Medicine', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Life', 'Lupus', 'Machine Learning', 'Maryland', 'Massachusetts', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methotrexate', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mycophenolate', 'Ophthalmology', 'Oral', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Patient Preferences', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Physicians', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Premature Mortality', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Residencies', 'Retinal Diseases', 'Rheumatology', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'SARS-CoV-2 infection', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Severity of illness', 'Subgroup', 'Systemic Lupus Erythematosus', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Translational Research', 'Treatment outcome', 'Uncertainty', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Vision', 'Work', 'adjudicate', 'adverse outcome', 'belimumab', 'care outcomes', 'catalyst', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical epidemiology', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'compliance behavior', 'data access', 'dosage', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'infection risk', 'innovation', 'instructor', 'medical schools', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'patient oriented research', 'patient stratification', 'personalized medicine', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'preference', 'renal damage', 'risk prediction', 'risk stratification', 'severe COVID-19', 'skills', 'therapy adverse effect', 'trend']",NIAMS,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K23,2021,174960
"Autonomous diagnosis and management of the critically ill during air transport (ADMIT) Project Summary/Abstract: Cardiorespiratory instability (CRI) is common in trauma patients and other acutely ill patients being transferred from trauma sites or between hospital centers. Although paramedics/nurses (PM/RN) have some success in rescuing unstable patients with CRI using defined protocols and decrease incidence of inter-transport severe circulatory shock, the shock recognition tools available and resuscitation endpoints are limited to blood pressure and heart rate thresholds. However, CRI is often unrecognized until it is well established when patients are more refractory to treatment, or progressed to organ injury. If one could accurately predict who, when and why these critically ill patients develop CRI, then effective preemptive treatments could be given to improve care and triage resulting in better use of healthcare resources. We have shown that an integrated monitoring system alert obtained from continuous noninvasively acquired monitoring parameters coupled to a care algorithm improved step-down unit (SDU) patient outcomes. We also applied machine learning (ML) modeling to our clinically-relevant porcine model of hemorrhagic shock to characterize responses to hypovolemia, hemorrhage, and resuscitation, predict which animals would or would not collapse during hypovolemia, and identify occult bleeding 5 minutes earlier than with traditional monitoring. We now propose to apply our work to vulnerable STAT MedEvac air transported patients. We will validate these approaches in our existing >5,000 patient STAT MedEvac database, containing highly granular continuous non-invasive monitoring waveforms of air transported critically ill patients linked to their primary care and inpatient electronic health records (EHR). This level of patient information and granularity linked to treatment data and patient outcomes is unprecedented. We will extend our analysis to include more complex CRI, richer data, deeper analytics, and larger libraries of critically ill patients while in air transport, linking our proven Functional Hemodynamic Monitoring (FHM) principles for pathophysiologic diagnosis and resuscitation with non-invasive monitoring to operationalize personalized resuscitation. We will concurrently running two specific aims. First, we will develop through the Carnegie Melon University Auton Lab multivariable models through ML data-driven classification techniques to predict CRI. We will do this initially on our existing porcine hemorrhagic shock model data (n=60) and then on our STAT MedEvac dataset linked to EHR (n >5,000 patients), determining the minimal data (measures, sampling frequency, observation duration) required to robustly identify deviation from health, likely CRI cause, and response to treatment (endpoint of resuscitation), as well as the incremental benefit of additional variables, analysis, lead-time and sampling frequency to predict CRI and response to treatment, and examine the trade-offs between model parsimony and specificity. Second, we will evaluate our existing clinical decision support (CDS) tools to interface with FHM principles and ML- defined interactions, and trial this in silico first on our porcine hemorrhagic shock resuscitation, then on our STAT MedEvac data, followed by prospective human simulation on flight crew PM/RN (n=160) during annual training for agreement and benefit, defining effectiveness based on diagnosis accuracy, time to diagnosis, intervention choice accuracy and time to intervention. This iterative process will modify the existing CDS platform into one more specifically suited for air transport scenarios. Finally, we will evaluate the resultant semi-autonomous management protocol initially in retrospect in 100 STAT MedEvac patients and 10 Emergency Department trauma patients and then prospectively by active CDS in a final 100 STAT MedEvac patients. We will prospectively analyze the effectiveness of these calibrated CDS tools for predictive ability of the various ML models and apply the best, most practical and parsimonious predictive models for clinical care during transport based on patient population, pathological processes and support staff. Project narrative We propose to develop and trial of proactive approach to diagnosis and management of vulnerable critically ill patients during STAT MedEvac air transport from trauma sites and inter-hospital transfer. We will use machine learning approaches to plumb our existing rich >5500 patient STAT MedEvac waveform data linked to their electronic health records to define level of severity, predict impending cardiovascular instability and to both drive in-flight resuscitation and alert receiving Emergency Department triage. We will use our existing clinically relevant porcine model of hemorrhagic shock to focus initial human instability algorithms and then refine our existing graph user interface clinical decisions support (CDS) algorithm, first in animal and with paramedic/nurse dyads in human simulation and then during actual STAT MedEvac air transport and Emergency Department care of trauma patients creating a scalable CDS platform to support paramedic/nurse smart monitoring and proactive resuscitation of these high risk patients.",Autonomous diagnosis and management of the critically ill during air transport (ADMIT),10141287,R01HL141916,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute', 'Agreement', 'Air', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Blood Pressure', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency Care', 'Emergency Department Physician', 'Environment', 'Family suidae', 'Frequencies', 'Graph', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Rate', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hemorrhagic Shock', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Hypovolemia', 'Incidence', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Medical', 'Melons', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Normal Range', 'Nurses', 'Organ failure', 'Paramedical Personnel', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Records', 'Refractory', 'Resources', 'Resuscitation', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Sepsis', 'Series', 'Serious Adverse Event', 'Severities', 'Shock', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trauma', 'Trauma patient', 'Traumatic Hemorrhage', 'Triage', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Weaning', 'Work', 'advanced system', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision support', 'clinically relevant', 'cost', 'data modeling', 'data streams', 'demographics', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'in silico', 'indexing', 'insight', 'iterative design', 'mortality', 'non-invasive monitor', 'organ injury', 'patient population', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'prospective', 'response', 'signal processing', 'simulation', 'success', 'support tools', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2021,652539
"Use of Predictive Analytics to Quantify Neonatal Hypothermia Burden After Cardiac Surgery ABSTRACT Neonates (infants ≤ 28 days), especially those with congenital heart disease (CHD), are among the most vulnerable populations cared for by critical care nurses. Approximately, two out of three CHD neonates experience unintentional hypothermia after cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Unintentional hypothermia impairs cellular function, which can be linked to poor outcomes frequently reported in this population. To date, there are no studies examining the association between the burden of unintentional hypothermia and clinical outcomes in neonates with CHD. This knowledge would render future opportunities to improve nursing care and prevent avoidable safety events in these vulnerable neonates. To address this gap, we propose to use retrospective data from CardioAccess (database local to the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia [CHOP]), which includes one of the largest multicenter repositories of neonatal cardiac surgery data available to date (Pediatric Cardiac Critical Care Consortium [PC4]), as well as, the electronic health record. Using data from at least 432 neonates who have undergone CPB between 2015 and 2019, we will quantify the time course of hourly temperature trajectories within the initial 24–48 hours after CPB and evaluate their relation to key clinical outcomes. We will specifically study the temporal trends of unintentional hypothermia burden (temperature depth and duration), which challenges current practice, where care is based on maintaining a single, preselected temperature threshold that is driven by consensus, rather than evidence. Single threshold values are not dynamic representations of the complexity that makes up temperature. A more robust output, such as an accumulative hypothermia burden index, is needed to assist clinicians with interpretation of this dynamic indicator of overall health. Our Specific Aims are: 1) Identify distinct temporal temperature patterns in CHD neonates after CPB using both: a multilevel model for intensive longitudinal data with group-based trajectory modeling; and an unsupervised machine learning technique using principal component analysis followed by k- means clustering of longitudinal data. 2) Determine the relationship between hypothermia burden subgroups / clusters and important clinical outcomes in this population. Our team has a demonstrated expertise in building clinically relevant and physiologically plausible markers of adverse outcomes in critically ill patients. This study aligns with the NINR’s priorities of promoting wellness and preventing illness across the lifespan, as well as, using recent advances in precision medicine. The research conducted under this award will take place at the University of Pittsburgh School of Nursing, a research-intensive institution (data analysis), and CHOP (data provision). The personalized training plan outlined in this application, supports the applicant’s career and academic development goals to become an independent nurse researcher. PROJECT NARRATIVE Unintentional hypothermia can significantly contribute to morbidity and mortality in neonates with congenital heart disease (CHD), which has a prevalence at birth in the USA of ~1% or 40,000 cases per year, and of those, ~6,000 neonates are born with severe defects requiring cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) surgery, contributing to a total cost of ~$5.6 billion every year. This will be the first clinical study to define the prevalence of unintentional hypothermia and map its association to neonatal outcomes with CHD, which has major implications for clinical practice. Unveiling the prevalence and consequences of unintentional hypothermia in this vulnerable population will render future opportunities to enhance time to recognition and early choice of preemptive intervention, which can improve the quality and safety of care, save lives and productivity, as well as, health care dollars.",Use of Predictive Analytics to Quantify Neonatal Hypothermia Burden After Cardiac Surgery,10233671,F31NR019725,"['Address', 'Arrhythmia', 'Award', 'Birth', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Surgery procedures', 'Cardiopulmonary Bypass', 'Care given by nurses', 'Caring', 'Cell physiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Consensus', 'Cost of Illness', 'Critical Care', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hospitalization', 'Hour', 'Hypoxemia', 'Impairment', 'Infant', 'Institution', 'Integumentary system', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Ischemia', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Length of Stay', 'Link', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Longevity', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Metabolic acidosis', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neonatal', 'Nurses', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'PC4 Gene', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Philadelphia', 'Physiological', 'Platelet aggregation', 'Play', 'Population', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Privatization', 'Productivity', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiratory Failure', 'Respiratory distress', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Role', 'Safety', 'School Nursing', 'Subgroup', 'Surgical Wound Infection', 'Survival Analysis', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Temperature', 'Time', 'Time trend', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Vasoconstrictor Agents', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Weight Gain', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'career', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'clinically significant', 'congenital heart disorder', 'cost', 'critical care nursing', 'database query', 'early onset', 'experience', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'inclusion criteria', 'indexing', 'mortality', 'multidimensional data', 'multilevel analysis', 'natural hypothermia', 'neonatal outcome', 'neonate', 'neutrophil', 'novel', 'patient safety', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'preemptive intervention', 'prevent', 'repository', 'respiratory', 'trend', 'unsupervised learning']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,F31,2021,48536
"Integrative Informatics Approach to Predict Readmissions and Improve Outcomes in COPD Project Summary This proposal for a mentored career development award consists of a training and research plan devised to facilitate Dr. David Jacobs' transition to an independent investigator focusing on the implementation of medication use interventions during the transition from hospital to home for high-needs patients. Dr. Jacobs is a clinical pharmacist with an advanced degree in epidemiology and health services and has significant experience conducting clinical research. The candidate's current research is focused on transition of care interventions. Given the resource intensive nature of these interventions, the sustainability of these programs will heavily depend on identifying and targeting patients at high-risk for hospital readmission. To anticipate such admissions, predictive models have been developed; however, our ability to predict hospital readmissions remains poor. This is likely because detailed social information, which is disproportionately represented in high-needs populations, is typically absent in risk stratification tools. Therefore, the long-term research objective is to build predictive models that combine social information with rich clinical data to individualize care management interventions and reduce readmissions. The specific aims are: (i) to determine social risk factors driving hospital readmissions by conducting semi-structured interviews with patients, their caregivers, and clinicians; (ii) to develop a risk- prediction model using advanced informatics techniques; and (iii) to develop and test the feasibility of a pilot intervention aimed at improving transition strategies. This work will focus on a singular complex condition, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), in developing a risk stratification tool in order to improve its predictive performance for identifying high-risk patients. COPD will serve as the model condition since it is one of the major readmission diagnoses, and there exists a high level of complexity following hospital discharge at patients' care transition. This award will provide the applicant with mentor-guided didactic and experiential learning to address the following career development objectives: 1) gain experiential learning in qualitative methodology, 2) advance his knowledge in biomedical informatics and develop predictive models integrating high-dimensional electronic health record data, and 3) increase his understanding of implementation science and gain practical experience in conducting a pragmatic clinical trial. The primary mentor, Dr. Sanjay Sethi, and the mentorship team will work closely to monitor his progress toward independence and will provide him with the guidance and the resources to guarantee his success. The proposed study leverages the extensive resources available at the University at Buffalo to address an important public health issue. Achieving the proposed aims and acquiring these advanced skills will position the candidate to submit successful R01s testing the proposed clinical prediction model and transition strategy in real-world settings. In summary, a comprehensive career development plan in the context of a well-defined training, research, and mentorship structure will allow Dr. Jacobs to emerge as a highly successful, independent clinician-investigator in health services research. Project Narrative Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who are discharged from the hospital have high rates of early readmission; these readmissions are a significant burden to the health care system. The proposed research will combine social information with rich clinical data to develop a real-time readmission risk prediction algorithm that will be integrated into a patient-centric intervention and tested in real-world clinical practice settings. The information learned from this project will assist in providing individualized treatment at the transition from hospital to home and focused on reducing healthcare utilization and ultimately improving quality of care.",Integrative Informatics Approach to Predict Readmissions and Improve Outcomes in COPD,10215337,K23HL153582,"['Active Learning', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Affect', 'Automobile Driving', 'Award', 'Buffaloes', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Pharmacists', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Education', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Expenditure', 'Face', 'Health Services', 'Health Services Research', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Home environment', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Length of Stay', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pragmatic clinical trial', 'Primary Health Care', 'Program Sustainability', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Quality of Care', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Social Characteristics', 'Social support', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Work', 'administrative database', 'biomedical informatics', 'care coordination', 'career development', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'cost effectiveness', 'experience', 'feasibility testing', 'health care service utilization', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'hospital readmission', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individualized medicine', 'informatics tool', 'innovation', 'multidisciplinary', 'patient safety', 'personalized care', 'personalized medicine', 'practice setting', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'readmission rates', 'readmission risk', 'risk prediction', 'risk prediction model', 'risk stratification', 'skills', 'social', 'social disadvantage', 'social factors', 'success', 'therapy design', 'tool']",NHLBI,STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK AT BUFFALO,K23,2021,192411
"Precision antimicrobial stewardship for Clostridioides difficile prevention (PASTCDI) Project Summary Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is an important healthcare-associated infection and a significant driver of poor patient outcomes and preventable cost. An existing bundle of antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) methods of CDI prevention are limited by difficulties identifying high-risk patients most likely to benefit from interventions. Recently we have developed a machine learning classification tool capable of accurately identify risk of developing CDI in hospitalized patients. Here we propose adding and rigorously testing this highly innovative precision medicine approach to CDI prevention within a robust, real-world AMS infrastructure Objective: To decrease CDI incidence by implementing an electronic health record-integrated CDI-risk classification tool within a framework of precision-medicine AMS. Specific Aim: Measure the effect of implementing a real-time CDI-risk classification tool to guide AMS efforts for CDI prevention among high-risk patients. The primary outcome will be hospital-associated CDI incidence. We will measure outcomes in patients identified as high-risk by the risk classification tool, comparing a 24- month pre-implementation period with a 12-month post-implementation period using interrupted time series (ITS) segmented regression. Secondary outcomes will include antimicrobial utilization rates, CDI test ordering, hospital length of stay, total cost, tool use, and AMS satisfaction Hypothesis: We hypothesize that tool implementation will result in a 35% relative reduction in CDI incidence, which aligns well with the lower end of estimates of bundle effect in prior studies. Significance: While evidence supports the efficacy of AMS interventions for CDI-prevention in general, our proposal is the first to our knowledge to employ a precision-medicine approach to CDI prevention. This high- impact, precision medicine proposal, based on extensive, sound preliminary data has a high probability of success. Project Narrative Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is an epidemic in hospitalized patients, and current prevention strategies are limited by difficulties identifying patients most likely to benefit from interventions. We developed a machine learning classification tool capable of accurately estimating risk of CDI.

"Early detection, containment, and management of COVID-19 in dialysis facilities using multi-modal data sources Abstract With older age and multiple comorbidities, dialysis patients are at high risk for serious complications, even death, from COVID-19. There is a large disproportionate representation of minorities, especially Blacks and Hispanics. Over 85% of hemodialysis patients travel three times a week to dialysis facilities to receive life-sustaining treatments and cannot shelter in place. There is a critical need to characterize COVID-19 transmission pathways in dialysis patients and clinics, identify potential coronavirus carriers, and develop procedures to curb the spread. With regular medical encounters, a large amount of data has been collected for each patient over time. These data have not been fully utilized for COVID-19 prediction and control in dialysis clinics. In this proposal, we seek to leverage demographic, clinical, treatment, laboratory, socioeconomic, serological, metabolomic, wearable and machine-integrated sensors, and COVID-19 surveillance data to develop mathematical and statistical models and implement them in a large number of dialysis clinics. The mathematical and statistical modeling using multiple data resources will help us understand how COVID-19 spread in dialysis facilities, identify potential COVID-19 patients before symptoms appear, and identify potential asymptomatic COVID-19 patients. We will develop novel mathematical and statistical models that fully utilize the high dimensional multimodal data available to us and other dialysis providers. We capitalize on the intrinsic advantages of hemodialysis clinics to implement and validate the proposed prediction models. We firmly believe that this cross-disciplinary effort will improve patients’ and staff’s safety while delivering high-quality, individualized care to a high-risk population.

"Nurse AMIE: Addressing Metastatic Individuals Everyday in Rural PA and WV Project Summary/Abstract Individuals with cancer who live in rural settings experience worse outcomes as compared to those in urban settings. Individuals in rural regions have difficulty accessing supportive care services due to travel challenges, cost of services, and overall lack of available supportive care resources. The latter issue likely contributes greatly to the urban/rural survival differences, given that multiple studies document that regularly addressing patient symptoms has a survival benefit in the setting of advanced cancer. Technology may provide solutions to overcome issues of rurality, however, little work has been done to specifically leverage technology- based solutions to deliver high quality supportive care in rural settings. Our team has developed and pilot tested a tablet-based symptom assessment and supportive care intervention called Nurse AMIE (Addressing Metastatic Individuals Everyday) that was well received by patients with metastatic cancer, including a subset of rural patients living in non-metropolitan counties (Rural Urban Continuum Code (RUCC) counties of 4 or higher). Patients were provided a tablet and cellular data plan to allow them to answer symptom questions daily, and an embedded personalized decision tree then offered evidence based self-care interventions to address the self-reported symptom with a goal of improving overall health and well-being. A pedometer and resistance band were also provided, given evidence that physical activity can assist with all four of the symptoms addressed in Nurse AMIE (fatigue, sleep, distress, and pain). These four symptoms form the basis of the psychoneurological symptom cluster that has been noted to be associated with quality of life and survival in oncology patients. Nurse AMIE can conduct symptom assessment, track data, and provide interventions offline if internet access is unavailable. Our preliminary evidence demonstrates acceptability and feasibility of the tablet-based approach as our patients logged on 57% of intervention days. Furthermore, patients using Nurse AMIE reported high patient satisfaction with the self-care system. Based on findings from the pilot, we propose to add a weekly survey similar to that from prior research by Basch et al. and Denis et al. to expand the symptom assessment aspect of the platform. We propose that this distance based supportive care intervention (Nurse AMIE) will have significant effects on rural patients overall survival (primary outcome), cancer treatment-related symptoms, function, and health related quality of life. We will focus our efforts on N=344 underserved or low-income adult men and women living in non-metropolitan counties (RUCC codes 4- 9) that have low access to supportive care. This work will be carried out with the help of a strong community advisory board, and guided by the PA and WV State Offices of Rural Health. We will enroll and randomize patients to receive the Nurse AMIE supportive care intervention or usual care. Enrollment will occur at regularly scheduled medical visits and the intervention will extend for the length of follow-up (2 years). We will also examine the cost effectiveness of Nurse AMIE. Nurse AMIE Project Narrative Rural patients with metastatic cancer are less likely to have access to high quality supportive care. This may have a negative effect on survival and well-being. We will conduct a randomized controlled trial to assess the survival benefits of a high quality technology based supportive care platform among 344 underserved, low income patients with metastatic cancer living in rural Pennsylvania or West Virginia.",Nurse AMIE: Addressing Metastatic Individuals Everyday in Rural PA and WV,10085516,R01CA254659,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Advanced Malignant Neoplasm', 'Cancer Patient', 'Client satisfaction', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Cost Effectiveness Analysis', 'County', 'Data', 'Decision Trees', 'Disseminated Malignant Neoplasm', 'Distress', 'Enrollment', 'Fatigue', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Length', 'Low income', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Metastatic breast cancer', 'Metastatic to', 'Nurses', 'Oncology', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Physical activity', 'Probability', 'Quality of life', 'Quality-Adjusted Life Years', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Rural', 'Rural Health', 'Schedule', 'Self Care', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Supportive care', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Tablets', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Travel', 'Treatment-Related Cancer', 'Uncertainty', 'Universities', 'Visit', 'West Virginia', 'Woman', 'Work', 'acceptability and feasibility', 'base', 'care systems', 'common symptom', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cost effectiveness', 'cost estimate', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'health related quality of life', 'improved', 'men', 'opportunity cost', 'pedometer', 'personalized decision', 'primary outcome', 'psychosocial', 'rural area', 'rural patients', 'rural setting', 'rural underserved', 'rurality', 'symptom cluster', 'symptomatic improvement', 'treatment as usual', 'tumor', 'urban setting', 'usual care arm']",NCI,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIV HERSHEY MED CTR,R01,2021,656763
"Prediction of Anti-Cancer Medication Discontinuation via Patient Portal Messages and Structured Electronic Medical Records Summary Cancer is a leading cause of morbidity in the United States, with more than half a million deaths estimated in 2019. Systemic cancer therapies are increasingly being designed as long-term oral anti-cancer medications, given the increased convenience of a self-administered regimen. For instance, patients with operable hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer are prescribed adjuvant oral hormonal therapy, with an expectation that they continue their regimen for a minimum of 5 years to maximize the benefits. Although many oral therapies have proven effective in mitigating cancer recurrence and mortality, discontinuation to these treatments are not uncommon. This is a concern because medication discontinuation before the completion of a prescribed treatment protocol leads to lower survival rates, increased risks of recurrence, and higher healthcare costs. To improve treatment adherence and promise better healthcare delivery, it is essential for healthcare providers to know when and why a cancer patient will discontinue their medications. While there have been various investigations into regimen discontinuation, the focus of these studies is either on knowledge discovery or intervention. While knowledge discovery focuses on characterizing the potential factors that lead to medication discontinuation, intervention aims to leverage discovered knowledge to design and test effective strategies to help patients adhere to treatments. Because there are thousands of cancer patients, it is impossible for healthcare providers to apply intervention to each of them. Limited medical resources need to be allocated efficiently, such that patients with a higher risk of discontinuing medications will receive greater, timely attention. Yet, the increasing integration of online communication and mobile computing technologies into the healthcare domain are generating massive quantities of patient-generated information. Thus, we propose to apply online patient-provider communications in a patient portal to supplement traditional EMR data to better understand a cancer patient’s medical experience. The central hypothesis of this project is that such communications together with structured EMRs can be applied to learn and forecast oral anti-cancer medication discontinuation. The specific aims of this project designed to test our central hypothesis are to 1) discover what has been communicated in a patient portal; 2) infer how patient portal messages and structured EMRs are associated with medication discontinuation; and 3) determine who are more likely to discontinue medications. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to apply the messages in a patient portal and structured EMRs to investigate medication discontinuation for cancer patients. Project Narrative Many oral anti-cancer medications have proven effective in preventing cancer recurrence and mortality, however, treatment adherence to these oral medications, some of which are taken for years, can be challenging for cancer patients due to a variety of factors, including side effects and high costs. Since medication discontinuation can lead to lower survival rates, increased risk of recurrence, and higher healthcare costs, society will benefit from gaining a deeper understanding of the causes of medication discontinuation and knowing who are at a high risk of medication discontinuation. In this project, we will analyze the online communications between patients and healthcare providers in a patient portal and apply them as well as structured electronic medical records to predict medication discontinuation.",Prediction of Anti-Cancer Medication Discontinuation via Patient Portal Messages and Structured Electronic Medical Records,10151599,R37CA237452,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Adjuvant', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Back', 'Biometry', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Computer software', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Future', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Care Research', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Human Characteristics', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Oncology', 'Oral', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Recurrence', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling Biases', 'Self Administration', 'Semantics', 'Services', 'Societies', 'Sociology', 'Statistical Models', 'Supervision', 'Surveys', 'Survival Rate', 'Technology', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Text Messaging', 'Time', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States', 'Work', 'anti-cancer', 'cancer recurrence', 'cancer therapy', 'compliance behavior', 'cost', 'design', 'electronic structure', 'expectation', 'experience', 'health care delivery', 'health care service utilization', 'high risk', 'hormone receptor-positive', 'hormone therapy', 'human subject', 'improved', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'mobile computing', 'mortality', 'patient engagement', 'patient portal', 'patient-clinician communication', 'prevent', 'recruit', 'side effect', 'social cognitive theory', 'text searching', 'treatment adherence', 'unsupervised learning']",NCI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R37,2021,386906
"Improving Medical Decision Making for Older Patients with End Stage Renal Disease A growing number of older patients are living with chronic kidney disease (CKD) due to advances in life- prolonging technologies and the aging of the population. As CKD advances towards end-stage renal disease (ESRD), even life-prolonging technologies cannot extend life indefinitely, especially for patients who have a poor prognosis and for whom decisions about medical interventions become particularly important. Consequently, older patients with advanced CKD need to communicate with their physicians about their preferences regarding CPR, dialysis and supportive kidney care (medical management of symptoms of advanced CKD without dialysis) in order to make crucial decisions impacting the length and quality of their lives. Communication surrounding medical decision making is formalized in Advance Care Planning (ACP), a process involving verbal or written information designed to inform patients of possible medical options including CPR, dialysis and supportive kidney care. Traditional ACP for patients with ESRD relies on ad hoc verbal descriptions of treatment options. This approach is limited because these options are difficult to envision. We have developed a video decision aid for reviewing CPR, dialysis and non-dialytic treatment preferences in ESRD. The tool, which is available in both English and Spanish, also allows patients to video record their preferences (""video declaration"") and share their preferences with their clinicians and caregivers. The overall objective of this study is to conduct a multi-center randomized trial of the video intervention (vs. usual care) to test the hypothesis that the video better informs older persons with advanced CKD and poor prognosis of their treatment options and leads to more ACP documentation, informed decision making, and improved quality of life. We will compare ACP documentation after one year (or at time of death) among 600 patients aged 75 or older with advanced CKD and poor prognosis randomly assigned to either the video intervention or usual care (Aim 1). We will compare ESRD treatment preferences, decisional conflict, ACP engagement and conversations, and concordance of preferences stated after the video intervention or usual care with ESRD care delivery after one year (or at time of death) (Aim 2). We will explore the quality of life, longevity, and cost per Quality Adjusted Life Year (QALY) associated with patients' ESRD treatment decisions in the video vs. control groups (Aim 3). We will also conduct a qualitative assessment of the video declarations as well as barriers and facilitators for intervention success (Aims 4 and 5). ESRD in older patients involves complex decision making. It is imperative that we develop and evaluate early interventions to deliver more patient- focused care to this rapidly growing segment of the population. Using videos to enhance communication offers an opportunity to improve care of this vulnerable group of patients. Video is a practical, evidence-based, and innovative approach that has the potential to improve the quality of care provided to tens of thousands of older Americans. It is imperative to develop scalable and effective approaches to supporting persons with advanced kidney disease and their family caregivers. By providing video education tools to better inform persons making decisions about medical care and offering evidence-based options for kidney care, there is an opportunity to improve quality of life throughout the care trajectory.",Improving Medical Decision Making for Older Patients with End Stage Renal Disease,10144365,R01AG066892,"['Address', 'Advance Care Planning', 'Aging', 'American', 'Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Control Groups', 'Counseling', 'Decision Aid', 'Decision Making', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Documentation', 'Early Intervention', 'Education', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emotional', 'End stage renal failure', 'Family Caregiver', 'Intervention', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Life', 'Longevity', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Palliative Care', 'Patient Care Planning', 'Patient Focused Care', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Process', 'Quality of Care', 'Quality of life', 'Quality-Adjusted Life Years', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Research', 'Supportive care', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Use Effectiveness', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Work', 'advanced disease', 'aged', 'care delivery', 'care outcomes', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'design', 'efficacy study', 'evidence base', 'improved', 'innovation', 'literacy', 'older patient', 'outcome forecast', 'preference', 'primary outcome', 'randomized trial', 'secondary outcome', 'success', 'symptom management', 'tool', 'treatment as usual', 'treatment planning', 'visual information']",NIA,BOSTON MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,2122297
"Towards autonomous management of cardiogenic shock Project Summary  Physicians in the cardiac intensive care unit (CCU) make decisions in an increasingly data- and knowledge- rich world, yet often they get little help. Currently, each physician makes decisions based on his or her mental model of the patient’s physiology, together with mental predictions of the patient’s response to intervention. This approach can lead to a range of behaviors that compromise patient outcomes, including oversimplification of the physiology, errors due to cognitive overload, and physician to physician variability in decision making. A computational tool equipped with quantitative knowledge of physiology, the ability to systematically evaluate all the data, and informed by a database of past action-outcome events could aid the physician with valuable suggestions for action.  We propose to train an algorithm to make decisions about dosing vasoactive medications and initiating mechanical support in patients with cardiogenic shock due to decompensated heart failure. This focused set of decisions entails calculations about the physiology that are normally performed in a physician’s head. We frame the decision problem as optimizing cardiovascular function to preserve oxygen delivery, and we apply tools from optimal control. Rather than hand-design a CCU controller we will use reinforcement learning (RL) techniques to “fit” one. The field of RL has experienced explosive growth over the past few years, with notable advances in strategic decision problems and robotics. A key challenge in the clinical environment is that the exploration phase of learning (“trial and error”) would be unethical in real patients. A second challenge is that the availability of patient data, while growing, is likely to be a bottleneck. We will leverage state-of-the-art model-based RL to train an algorithm using a combination of simulation and off-policy learning from historical data. We will use a model of cardiovascular physiology that underlies cardiac simulators in use today for the training of cardiologists. Historical patient data will come from the Massachusetts General Hospital Clinical Data Animation Center which has recorded real-time telemetry waveform data in addition to standard electronic medical record data from all CCU patients spanning several years. This is one of the largest and most complete datasets of its kind. The complexity of managing cardiogenic shock will continue to escalate as tools become more sophisticated and patients live longer, with more extensive comorbidities. Advanced decision support tools could help tame this complexity, improving the quality of care as well as democratizing it. Project Narrative The sickest cardiac patients are treated in the intensive care unit and are complex to manage. We aim to create a tool that will use artificial intelligence to study a patient's data and offer a physician advice. Our goal is to improve the patient's chance of survival and shorten their time in intensive care.",Towards autonomous management of cardiogenic shock,10218696,R21EB030756,"['Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automation', 'Aviation', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Benchmarking', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiogenic Shock', 'Cardiovascular Models', 'Cardiovascular Physiology', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Devices', 'Dose', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Family', 'Feedback', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'General Hospitals', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hand', 'Head', 'Heart failure', 'Human', 'Intensive Care', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Massachusetts', 'Measurement', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ failure', 'Outcome', 'Oxygen', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Physiology', 'Policies', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Publishing', 'Quality of Care', 'Rewards', 'Robotics', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Suggestion', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telemetry', 'Time', 'Titrations', 'Training', 'Work', 'algorithm training', 'animation', 'base', 'cardiac intensive care unit', 'comorbidity', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'digital health', 'experience', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'learning algorithm', 'learning strategy', 'patient response', 'preservation', 'simulation', 'support tools', 'tool', 'unethical']",NIBIB,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R21,2021,252000
"Novel, High-Impact Studies Evaluating Health System and Healthcare Professional Responsiveness to COVID-19 PROJECT SUMMARY FOR PEOPLE ARE PRIMARY Background: We are experiencing an event unlike any in living history. The global pandemic, referred to as “COVID-19”, has become a one-of-a-kind stress test on health care systems around the world. The size, scope, and speed of this pandemic has created an imperative for rapid dissemination of data and findings. The response of US primary care practices to COVID-19 is a large-scale natural experiment of the capacity of primary care to meet the majority of people's needs. And yet, at the start the pandemic in the US, there was no one organization, federal agency, or national dataset able to provide real-time on-the-ground data regarding the experiences of primary care practices or their patients. Purpose: On March 13, 2020, as the US declared COVID-19 a national emergency, our team created a national research Collaboratory and launched the “Quick COVID-19 Primary Care Survey” (C19 Survey) to fill that gap. The Pilot C19 Survey began as a clinician-based weekly national survey to monitor the response, challenges, and capacity of US primary care practices during the COVID-19 pandemic. After 4 weeks, we launched a complementary patient-based C19 Survey. People Are Primary would allow the C19 Surveys to continue beyond the Pilot stage. We will examine the responses, challenges, and capacity of primary care practices in order to evaluate the resilience and adaptive decision- making required during the pandemic. Drawing on both patients and clinicians, we will examine the rapid adoption of digital health by primary care as well as the positive and negative consequences of digital health on 1) access to care across varied settings, 2) patient and clinician care delivery experiences, and 3) the interaction of digital health with relationships between primary care patients and primary care teams. Methods: This is a mixed-methods learning evaluation with an exploratory sequential design. Regular surveys will be distributed to identified clinician and patient groups throughout the 2-year study period. These will begin weekly and will evolve into biweekly and then monthly surveys in response to changes in the natural evolution of the pandemic and subsequent primary care practice response. The research team will engage in weekly rapid learning cycles that complete data collection, analysis, dissemination, and adjustment to survey instrument within a 7-day period. The team will also use bimonthly deep learning cycles to develop time series and trend- based analysis, offering a more extended conversation of these findings and their implications for the long-term stability and strengthening of the US primary care platform. Benefit: The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the costs of chronic and fragmented under-investment in primary care. Examination of the rapid adoption of digital health and its impact on patient and clinician experiences of care during the pandemic can inform a much needed strategy to 1) stop the immediate threat of primary care collapse, 2) identify practice and funding strategies able to stabilize primary care practices, and 3) enable the long term strengthening of primary care. PROJECT NARRATIVE FOR PEOPLE ARE PRIMARY The global pandemic, referred to as “COVID-19”, has become a one-of-a-kind stress test on health care systems around the world.

Examination of digital health and its impact on patient and clinician experiences of care during the pandemic can inform a much-needed strategy to 1) stop the immediate threat of primary care collapse, 2) identify practice and funding strategies able to stabilize primary care practices, and 3) enable the long term strengthening of primary care.","Novel, High-Impact Studies Evaluating Health System and Healthcare Professional Responsiveness to COVID-19",10193445,R01HS028253,[' '],AHRQ,VIRGINIA COMMONWEALTH UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,491317
"IMProving Outcomes Related to Patients Through Advanced Nursing Technology (IMPORTANT) Although healthcare costs in the United States rank among the highest in the world, critical health outcomes rank lower than other high resource countries. In an effort to improve healthcare quality and concomitantly reduce costs, Congress identified certain serious and expensive but preventable hospital acquired conditions such as patient falls, pressure ulcer injuries (PUI) and hospital acquired infections (HAI), that would no longer be reimbursed by Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. These preventable adverse events have been linked with nursing time with patients. Nurses play a critical role in preventing adverse outcomes by quickly identifying patients at risk, evaluating the extent of these risks, and acting upon the changing status of the patient, a process termed “nurse surveillance.” Hence, nurses are key contributors to overall patient surveillance and safety. The Joint Commission recommends that the nurses give report at the patient bedside, termed “bedside shift report” (BSR), to reduce errors and improve continuity of care; hourly rounds (HR) are also recommended to reduce falls; both of these measures contribute to nurse surveillance of patients, but their relationship to patient outcomes remains understudied. NewYork-Presbyterian, a large academic health system, is piloting an innovative technology called “iN,” to improve BSR and HR through the use of color-changing lights and integrated mobile app to remind nurses when these activities have not been completed. This technology uses a combination of mounted hardware in the patient room with obfuscated computer vision to provide constant surveillance of the patient room and companion software supplied via a mobile phone app that integrates these technologies. This novel intervention to increase BSR and HR by nurses, which generates detailed process data, offers an unprecedented opportunity to gain a complete understanding of all activities that take place at the bedside and yet has not yet been studied to characterize nurse surveillance or to assess associations with related patient outcomes. The IMProving Outcomes Related to patients Through Advanced Nursing Technology (IMPORTANT) study will characterize nurse surveillance and its influence on patient falls, HAI, and PUI to generate new knowledge about factors that influence these nurse-sensitive patient outcomes. Using the dataset built in this study that will integrate data from the iN device, electronic health record, staffing and census data, and hospital reported quality measures on falls, HAI and PUIs, this prospective cohort study design will use descriptive statistics and a Cox-proportional hazard model to characterize nurse surveillance and the contribution of BSR and HR to nurse surveillance to generate predictive indicators of these nurse-sensitive outcomes (falls, PUIs HAIs), which can be used to identify intervention targets. The IMPORTANT study addresses AHRQ’s specific priorities to conduct “Research to improve health care patient safety,” and “Harness data and technology to improve healthcare quality and patient outcomes and to provide a 360-degree view of the patient” and will address AHRQ priority populations of the those with multiple chronic conditions, minorities, and women. Project Narrative This “IMProving Outcomes Related to patients Through Advanced Nursing Technology (IMPORTANT)” study will explore an innovative technology that will capture information about a technology-enabled intervention to improve nurse surveillance and subsequent nurse-sensitive patient outcomes: patient falls, pressure ulcer injury, and hospital acquired infections. This study will provide an enhanced understanding of nursing interactions with patients at the bedside and subsequent effects on related patient outcomes through the use of both existing data and novel technology.",IMProving Outcomes Related to Patients Through Advanced Nursing Technology (IMPORTANT),10131779,R03HS027006,[' '],AHRQ,HUNTER COLLEGE,R03,2021,51444
"Comparative Effectiveness of Treat-To-Target Approach versus Routine Care in Management of Gout Gout is a highly prevalent, painful inflammatory arthritis, caused by crystallization of uric acid in joint tissues. Gout flares cause impaired quality of life and physical function, leading to lost work days, disability, high healthcare costs. Patients with gout are also known to be at an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVD), kidney disease, and mortality. Previous studies suggest a potential beneficial effect of urate-lowering therapy on the risk of CVD and renal function. Over the past decade, the American College of Rheumatology and the European League Against Rheumatism recommend a treat-to-target (TTT) approach that lowers serum uric acid (SUA) level below 6 mg/dl to reduce acute gout attacks, based on the upper limit of water solubility of uric acid under normal physiologic circumstances. However, the 2016 American College of Physicians (ACP)’ guidelines for gout management recommend use of urate-lowering therapy but support a ‘treat-to-avoid symptoms’ strategy without monitoring SUA rather than the TTT strategy because of ‘inconclusive’ evidence in the literature. Such discrepancies in treatment guidelines from various societies urge the need for comparative effectiveness research of the treatment strategies for gout.  Rigorous epidemiologic studies utilizing high-quality observational data from electronic health records (EHR) or insurance claims databases can be an important tool for comparative effectiveness research. The primary objective of this 3-year proposal is to provide high-quality, timely evidence on the comparative effectiveness of two different treatment strategies, TTT versus usual care, for management of gout. We will pursue this objective by utilizing the linked Partners’ EHR-Medicare database (2007-2016); this linked database includes all patients aged ≥65 years enrolled in Medicare Parts A/B/D who had ≥1 encounter at one of the Partners Healthcare hospitals. We will have longitudinal, clinically important data on patients’ demographics, body mass index, visit notes, laboratory results including SUA and serum creatinine, as well as all Medicare claims for inpatient and outpatient visits, procedures, and prescription drugs. The two specific aims of this 3-year proposal are: 1) to examine the effect of TTT strategy on the risk of gout flares versus usual care and 2) to assess the effect of TTT strategy on the risk of kidney disease and CVD versus usual care.  Given the substantial prevalence of gout, the suboptimal management of gout and lack of comparative trial of different treatment strategies, this proposed study will make an immediate, important contribution to the management of gout in clinical practice. This work will not only investigate the effects of different treatment strategies on gout flares but also on common comorbidities in patients with gout such as kidney and CVD. Furthermore, this proposed study will advance understanding of how to improve ascertainment of dynamic outcomes and control for time-varying confounding by utilizing sophisticated and innovative epidemiologic as well as bioinformatics methods in a large EHR database linked with Medicare claims. Narrative Gout is a common, painful inflammatory arthritis caused by crystallization of uric acid in joint tissues. Xanthine oxidase inhibitors, allopurinol and febuxostat, are the mainstay of urate-lowering treatment for gout. While rheumatology societies recommend a treat-to-target (TTT) approach that lowers serum uric acid below 6 mg/dl to reduce acute gout attacks, there is currently no clinical data whether TTT approach is better than urate- lowering therapy but no regular monitoring of uric acid levels (i.e., usual care); therefore, this 3-year research proposal examines the comparative effectiveness of the two different treatment strategies, TTT versus usual care, for management of chronic gout in a real-world setting.",Comparative Effectiveness of Treat-To-Target Approach versus Routine Care in Management of Gout,10176417,R01AR073314,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Allopurinol', 'American', 'American College of Physicians', 'Bioinformatics', 'Body mass index', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Practice Guideline', 'Comparative Effectiveness Research', 'Coronary', 'Creatinine', 'Crystallization', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiology', 'European', 'Flare', 'Glomerular Filtration Rate', 'Gold', 'Gout', 'Guidelines', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Insurance', 'Healthcare', 'Heart failure', 'High Prevalence', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hypertension', 'Hyperuricemia', 'Impairment', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Arthritis', 'Inpatients', 'Joints', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Medical Societies', 'Medicare', 'Medicare Part A', 'Medicare claim', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Physical Function', 'Physiological', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Prognostic Factor', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Renal function', 'Research Proposals', 'Rheumatism', 'Rheumatology', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Serum', 'Societies', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stroke', 'Symptoms', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Urate', 'Uric Acid', 'Visit', 'Work', 'active comparator', 'base', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'clinical practice', 'college', 'comorbidity', 'comparative effectiveness', 'comparative trial', 'cost', 'demographics', 'design', 'disability', 'drug efficacy', 'efficacy study', 'electronic data', 'epidemiology study', 'febuxostat', 'human old age (65+)', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insurance claims', 'mortality', 'population based', 'rheumatologist', 'routine care', 'tool', 'treatment as usual', 'treatment guidelines', 'treatment strategy', 'water solubility', 'xanthine oxidase inhibitor']",NIAMS,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2021,407634
"Quantifying Microbial Keratitis to Predict Outcomes: An Imaging and Epidemiologic Approach PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT For epidemiological studies, future clinical trials, and personalized patient care, there is a critical need to create a risk-stratification system for microbial keratitis. Microbial keratitis (MK), a debilitating, infectious corneal disease, is estimated to be the fourth-leading cause of blindness worldwide. MK severity depends on a complex interaction of patient, organism, and environment, resulting in a spectrum of clinical presentations and responses to treatment. Clinical presentations manifest with unique morphology features and clinical symptoms. Morphology features are visible in the cornea, and symptoms are measurable. But most patients are treated with non-specific broad-spectrum antimicrobials, an approach that increases antimicrobial resistance. This non-specific treatment approach lacks congruence with the unique MK presentations. There is a critical need for a new strategy to personalize treatments for MK and measure treatment efficacy. With quantified MK morphologic and clinical features, clinicians will have the tools to risk-stratify patients. The long-term goal is to develop rapid, objective, personalized treatment plans for patients with MK. This proposal’s objective is to quantify dynamic morphologic and clinical MK features using image and electronic health record (EHR) analyses and then build a risk-stratification scoring system associated with MK outcomes. The proposed research will test the hypothesis that morphologic and clinical features accurately risk- stratify patients for corneal and vision outcomes. Our premise is supported by preliminary data demonstrating that: (1) different organisms generate distinct morphologic and clinical features; (2) clinicians quantify morphology less precisely than image-analysis methods, (3) an expert is able to use MK features to tailor treatments; (4) the use of quantified features has improved outcomes in other diseases, such as diabetic retinopathy, by helping providers to tailor treatments; (5) EHR data can be used to quantify and classify clinical disease features accurately; and (6) EHR data can be used effectively to risk-stratify patients. Aim 1 will develop objective image analysis tools to measure features of MK with existing clinical equipment. Aim 2 will evaluate MK treatment efficacy using morphologic image analysis and clinical features from prospective surveys. Aim 3 will risk-stratify patients with MK by combining image analysis and EHR extracted data. The expected outcomes are: (1) characterized databases of MK images and linked clinical data, (2) quantified MK features across a spectrum of clinical presentations, (3) performance-tested, open-source imaging algorithms and surveys to measure MK markers dynamically, and (4) a novel risk stratification model and scoring system. The resultant work will have significant value to clinicians. Clinicians can use practical, low-cost technologies and readily-available EHR data to quantify MK features and risk-stratify patients in order to tailor treatments. NARRATIVE The clinical management of microbial keratitis is imprecise and dependent on the expertise of the treating physician. Our innovative strategies will quantify corneal features using image analysis and available clinical data from the electronic health record. Quantified image features will be linked to health outcomes to give physicians new tools to risk-stratify patients and to tailor their management to optimize outcomes.",Quantifying Microbial Keratitis to Predict Outcomes: An Imaging and Epidemiologic Approach,10113626,R01EY031033,"['Algorithms', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Blindness', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Control Groups', 'Cornea', 'Corneal Diseases', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Databases', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Equipment', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Inflammatory', 'Keratitis', 'Link', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'National Eye Institute', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Provider', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Self-Examination', 'Severities', 'Standardization', 'Strategic Planning', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Universities', 'Virulence', 'Vision', 'Visual Acuity', 'Work', 'antimicrobial', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'care systems', 'case control', 'clinical risk', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'epidemiology study', 'healing', 'improved outcome', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'microbial', 'novel', 'open source', 'outcome prediction', 'patient stratification', 'performance tests', 'personalized care', 'personalized medicine', 'primary outcome', 'prospective', 'risk stratification', 'slit lamp imaging', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'treatment response']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2021,397484
"(MEnD-AKI) Multicenter Implementation of an Electronic Decision Support System for Drug-associated AKI Abstract Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) in the US has increased by 38% over the last eight years, with drugs as a major contributor to AKI in hospitalized patients. Drug-associated AKI (D-AKI) results in severe consequences with approximately 40% of patients experiencing in-hospital death or dialysis dependence and 70% having evidence of residual kidney damage following the initial D-AKI event. We have determined that many patients at high risk for AKI are identified late and often continue to receive nephrotoxic drugs until AKI becomes severe. Thus, we designed a proposal to address the need for early, appropriate management of nephrotoxins in high-risk patients by studying the effect of an advanced clinical decision support system (CDSS) for primary physicians and hospitalists aimed at reducing D-AKI in hospitalized adults. Specifically, we aim to 1) optimize the clinical performance of D-AKI risk-alerts generated by a clinical decision support system; 2) test whether an advanced clinical decision support system coupled with a pharmacist-led intervention improves short and long- term outcomes for patients with D-AKI; and 3) determine physician perception of the pharmacists’ performance, physician acceptance and cost-effectiveness of our intervention. In 2012 Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) published the first comprehensive AKI clinical practice guideline. Recommendations include the use of standard criteria for defining and staging AKI and a series of stage-based management steps to be considered for all patients with AKI or at risk for developing it. However, clinicians have been slow to adopt these recommendations and some groups (most notably the US KDOQI expert panel), while endorsing the guideline overall, have called for more research testing the recommendations. Our proposal directly addresses this concern by testing whether a unique clinical decision support system identifying high risk patients coupled with an advanced pharmacist service directed to the primary physician can address D-AKI and drug dosing for other forms of AKI to improve patient care. Thus, our central goal is to examine the effect of a pharmacist-led intervention on the early detection and management of AKI, progression of and short-term recovery from AKI, and on various AKI-related outcomes. Project Narrative Patients at high risk for acute kidney injury are often identified late and often do not receive recommended diagnostic and therapeutic interventions, with drugs being the most common cause; yet are potentially preventable. Clinical decision support to physicians in the form of automated alerts and pharmacist guidance for high-risk patients with drug-associated acute kidney injury (D-AKI) could dramatically improve risk assessment, medication use, and drug dosing in even non-drug-associated acute kidney injury. In this randomized control trial application, we will test whether adult hospitalized patients with D-AKI, cared for by physicians randomized to receive clinical decision support with an advanced pharmacist-led intervention, will have a lower risk for dialysis and premature death.",(MEnD-AKI) Multicenter Implementation of an Electronic Decision Support System for Drug-associated AKI,10209005,R01DK121730,"['Accounting', 'Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Adverse drug event', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Practice Guideline', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Cost Analysis', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Dose', 'Drug Modelings', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health system', 'Hospitalists', 'Hospitals', 'Incidence', 'Injury to Kidney', 'Intervention', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Laboratories', 'Length of Stay', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacists', 'Physicians', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Predictive Value', 'Provider', 'Publishing', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Recovery', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Residual state', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Services', 'Site', 'Staging', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Update', 'aging population', 'base', 'care providers', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical risk', 'comorbidity', 'control trial', 'cost', 'cost effectiveness', 'design', 'detection platform', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'equipment training', 'experience', 'group intervention', 'high risk', 'imaging agent', 'implementation cost', 'implementation intervention', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'nephrotoxicity', 'non-drug', 'post intervention', 'premature', 'renal damage', 'risk prediction model', 'standard of care']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2021,562198
"Avoidable Acute Care Use among Patients with Lupus PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Candidate: Dr. Candace Feldman is an Instructor in Medicine in the Division of Rheumatology, Immunology and Allergy and the Section of Clinical Sciences (SCS) at Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH). Dr. Feldman has a longstanding passion to understand and reduce disparities in rheumatic diseases. Her research focuses on racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in prevalence, access and outcomes among patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Her 14 peer-reviewed original publications, 8 first author, and 2 early career development grants exemplify her track record and her commitment to this field. She holds a MPH degree and is pursuing a doctorate in social epidemiology from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health (HSPH). Her immediate goals are to learn and apply advanced health services research and qualitative methods to understand SLE-related avoidable acute care use to inform a future intervention. She will be guided by Dr. Costenbader, an established SLE epidemiologist, and an expert mentoring team. Dr. Feldman strives to apply rigorous methods to redesign healthcare delivery for vulnerable rheumatology patients. Environment: Dr. Feldman’s Division Chief ensures that >75% of her time will be protected for research and career development for the 5-year duration of this K23 award. She has financial support to supplement her salary and project-related expenses from the Division, the SCS, and her primary mentor’s funding. The BWH Lupus Center, co-directed by Dr. Costenbader, is the largest in New England. The research infrastructure established as part of the Center will enable Dr. Feldman to recruit patients. In addition, the SCS has extensive research infrastructure, which will continue to support her work. Dr. Feldman has access to Medicaid data under Dr. Costenbader’s Data Use Agreement with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, and to Partners HealthCare electronic health records linked to claims data through the explicit support of Population Health Management. For her training, she will have access to courses and mentorship at HSPH, where she is a doctoral student, and through Harvard Medical School and the Harvard Catalyst Program. Research: Dr. Feldman will rigorously define SLE-related conditions that may result in avoidable acute care use (e.g. emergency department visits and hospitalizations). She will then examine rates and predictors of potentially avoidable use, and associated mortality and costs in two large, diverse datasets. She will learn and apply qualitative methods, including Photovoice, which will empower SLE patients to photograph their homes and communities, to explore the contribution of social determinants to avoidable care use. Dr. Feldman will hold focus groups of SLE patients, providers and administrators to design a rheumatology-based intervention to improve healthcare delivery for these high-utilizing, vulnerable SLE patients. Dr. Feldman will develop skills in rigorous mixed methods research. This project, and the training Dr. Feldman will gain, will position her for a R01 and for a career as an independent social epidemiology and patient-oriented investigator in rheumatology. PROJECT NARRATIVE Lupus is a complex autoimmune disease, disproportionately affecting vulnerable populations and resulting in high acute care use, much of which could be prevented if patients had consistent access to high-quality outpatient care. There is a need to define and understand lupus-specific avoidable acute care use (emergency department visits and hospitalizations) and to identify those patients at highest risk. This study will inform the design of interventions aimed at optimizing outpatient care, preventing adverse outcomes, and reducing disparities among patients with complex, subspecialty-managed diseases.",Avoidable Acute Care Use among Patients with Lupus,10137787,K23AR071500,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Accounting', 'Administrator', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Ambulatory Care', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Bioinformatics', 'Caring', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'Cost Analysis', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Delphi Technique', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency department visit', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Epidemiologist', 'Financial Support', 'Focus Groups', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Expenditures', 'Health Services Research', 'Healthcare', 'Home environment', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Immunology', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Lupus', 'Mediating', 'Medicaid', 'Medicine', 'Mental Depression', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neighborhoods', 'New England', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Productivity', 'Provider', 'Public Health Schools', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Quality of Care', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Rheumatism', 'Rheumatology', 'Risk', 'Savings', 'Social support', 'Structural Models', 'Systemic Lupus Erythematosus', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality', 'United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Wages', 'Woman', 'Work', 'acceptability and feasibility', 'acute care', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'care costs', 'career', 'career development', 'catalyst', 'cost', 'design', 'disparity reduction', 'doctoral student', 'ethnic minority population', 'health care delivery', 'health management', 'high risk', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'instructor', 'learning strategy', 'low socioeconomic status', 'medical schools', 'medication nonadherence', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'patient oriented', 'patient oriented research', 'patient subsets', 'population health', 'prevent', 'programs', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial and ethnic disparities', 'research and development', 'skills', 'social', 'social determinants', 'social epidemiology', 'social health determinants', 'socioeconomic disparity', 'therapy design']",NIAMS,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K23,2021,178195
"Oral Cavity Quantitative Histomorphometric Risk Classifier (OHbIC) in Oral Cavity Squamous Cell Carcinoma (OC-SCC) SUMMARY: In 2018, nearly 34,000 adults in the US and over 275,000 worldwide were diagnosed with oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OC-SCC). In the US alone >6,600 died from the disease in 2018. In addition to stage, perineural invasion, lymphovascular invasion, depth of invasion, and close or frankly positive resection margins are used to help stratify patients into low-, intermediate-, or high risk categories. Currently, all OC-SCC patients are treated primarily by surgical resection. Post-operative treatment depends on patient risk category. Low-risk patients receive surgery alone and studies have shown the benefit of PORT (Post-operative radiation therapy) in selected patients. A retrospective analysis of 1467 patients with low-risk OC-SCC where 740 (50.4%) received PORT had improved overall survival compared to 727 patients treated with surgery alone. Identifying these patients and better stratifying their risk of progression is critical. Meanwhile, patients with loco-regionally advanced (i.e. intermediate and high risk) disease are treated with PORT as standard. Select high risk patients may be treated with concomitant chemoradiation or subsequent chemotherapy. There is thus an urgent need to develop companion diagnostic tools to better define which patients will benefit from PORT, or, if intermediate or high risk, who will benefit from systemic therapy intensification.  Recently, our group has developed a OC-SCC histomorphometric based image risk classifier (OHbIC) that uses computerized measurements of nuclear orientation, texture, shape, architecture from digital images of H&E-stained tumor sections to identify patients who are likely to recur versus those who are not. OHbIC was trained and validated on N=115 OC-SCC patients, and it had a 2 and 7-fold higher-correlation with disease specific survival compared to the 7th edition AJCC N- and T-stage (clinical variables used in patient prognosis). In this NIH R01, we seek to further improve the prognostic and predictive accuracy of OHbIC by incorporating new classes of image features relating to stromal morphology, pattern of invasion at the tumor leading edge, density and patterns of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, and tumor cell multi-nucleation, features now recognized as potential histopathological markers of prognostic relevance in OC-SCC. Additionally, we seek to 1) validate OHbIC as prognostic of survival in clinically defined low-risk patients and identify those low-risk patients who would benefit from PORT and 2) validate OHbIC as not only prognostic of survival but also predictive of benefit from chemotherapeutic intensification for patients with loco-regionally advanced disease.  This partnership will leverage long-standing collaborations in (1) digital pathomics from the Madabhushi group at Case Western Reserve, (2) surgical pathology and oncology expertise in oral cancer from Vanderbilt University, Cleveland Clinic, San Francisco VA, and Tata Memorial Centre, Mumbai to establish OHbIC as a tissue non-destructive and Affordable Precision Medicine (APM) solution for OC-SCC patients. Project Relevance: In this project, we seek to improve the predictive accuracy of a computerized histomorphometric predictor (OHbIC) for risk stratification, outcome prediction and added benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy for patients with oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OC-SCC) from routine H&E tissue slide images. The success of this project will pave the way for its adoption as a tissue non-destructive Affordable Precision Medicine (APM) companion diagnostic tool, allowing for the identification of OC-SCC patients for whom therapies could be either left as standard, or require “escalation”, depending on the OHbIC risk score.",Oral Cavity Quantitative Histomorphometric Risk Classifier (OHbIC) in Oral Cavity Squamous Cell Carcinoma (OC-SCC),10075748,R01CA249992,"['Adjuvant', 'Adjuvant Chemotherapy', 'Adjuvant Therapy', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Age', 'American Cancer Society', 'American Joint Committee on Cancer', 'Architecture', 'Biological Assay', 'Cancer Center', 'Categories', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Cooperative Group', 'Clinical stratification', 'Cloud Computing', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Eligibility Determination', 'European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer', 'Excision', 'Foundations', 'Head and neck structure', 'Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining Method', 'Histologic', 'Image', 'India', 'Left', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Nuclear', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Oral cavity', 'Outcome', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Platinum', 'Play', 'Postoperative Period', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Therapy Oncology Group', 'Radiation therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Regimen', 'Relapse', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'San Francisco', 'Shapes', 'Slide', 'Smoking', 'Staging', 'Stains', 'Standardization', 'Surgical Oncology', 'Surgical Pathology', 'System', 'Systemic Therapy', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Tissue Microarray', 'Tissue Stains', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Tumor Cell Invasion', 'Tumor stage', 'Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocytes', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'Woman', 'Work', 'advanced disease', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'chemoradiation', 'chemotherapy', 'cohort', 'collaborative trial', 'companion diagnostics', 'computerized', 'cost', 'density', 'digital', 'digital imaging', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'innovation', 'lymphatic Invasion', 'malignant mouth neoplasm', 'men', 'mouth squamous cell carcinoma', 'neoplastic cell', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'patient stratification', 'perineural', 'power analysis', 'precision medicine', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive marker', 'predictive test', 'prognostic', 'prognostic assays', 'prognostic of survival', 'prospective', 'risk stratification', 'success', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'treatment choice', 'tumor', 'tumor behavior']",NCI,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,697902

"Identification of biologically relevant subtypes of hidradenitis suppurativa Project Summary Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a neglected, prevalent, chronic, stigmatizing, and debilitating disease that has recently been prioritized for study by NIAMS. Evidence suggests that some HS patients choose to self-manage symptoms remaining unconnected to healthcare, and some seek medical care for repeated outbreaks of boils but never receive a diagnosis. Such ‘hidden populations’ create challenges for designing research studies that are generalizable. Precision medicine initiatives and resources offer opportunities to rapidly increase our knowledge about biological causes of HS and to improve the care that HS patients receive. For example, the NIH has made considerable investments in the development of data repositories that link genetic data to EHR for hundreds of thousands of patients, including the NHGRI-funded eMERGE Network and the NIH-funded All of Us Research Program. Columbia University investigators are integral members of these nationwide programs, both as a recruitment site, as well as a data and research center (5U01HG008680, 1OT2OD026556). Engaging research participants who are willing to contribute longitudinal data is a major obstacle to precision medicine initiatives. The public’s use of the Internet and social media to obtain and exchange health-related information has created opportunities to rapidly and efficiently assemble large longitudinal cohorts, yet there are important differences from traditional research methods and best practice guidelines have yet to be developed. Columbia University is at the forefront of the development and application of these methods. A major challenge to implementing precision medicine arises from patients who share a diagnosis but have different biological causes of disease. HS patients have a high burden of comorbidities and we hypothesize that sets of comorbidities that tend to present together in individual patients can be used to identify biologically relevant disease subtypes. Here we will use three approaches to identify patterns of comorbidities within patients, to characterize the generalizability of the results from studies conducted in EHR, and to use genetic data to biologically validate comorbidities and resolve causality underlying disease associations. Training in biomedical informatics and Internet-based survey research will allow the applicant to use EHR data and Internet resources for assembling cohorts to conduct these studies, and complement her previous training in epidemiology, biostatistics, molecular biology and human genetics, providing fluency across several domains that are crucial for advancing precision medicine initiatives. Completion of this proposal will achieve the applicant’s long-term goal of obtaining advanced training aimed at implementing precision medicine in the treatment of skin disease. Project Narrative This project addresses the imperative needs of hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) patients who suffer from pain, stigma, diminished quality of life, decreased work productivity, and increased healthcare costs that arise from managing a difficult-to-treat, debilitating disease with a high burden of comorbidities. We will conduct studies of HS comorbidities to identify biologically distinct subclasses of HS in large samples of patients using data in electronic health records and data collected from Internet surveys. This work will improve the precision of HS diagnoses and set up the infrastructure for future large-scale studies of HS.",Identification of biologically relevant subtypes of hidradenitis suppurativa,10160823,K01AR075111,"['Abscess', 'Address', 'Advertising', 'Affect', 'All of Us Research Program', 'Anogenital region', 'Attenuated', 'Automobile Driving', 'Axilla', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Cicatrix', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Consent', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Economic Burden', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Funding', 'Furuncles', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hidradenitis Suppurativa', 'Human Genetics', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Inguinal region', 'International Classification of Disease Codes', 'Internet', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leg', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Medical Research', 'Mendelian randomization', 'Methods', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Diagnosis', 'Mutation', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases', 'Pain', 'Participant', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Practice Guidelines', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Prevalence', 'Productivity', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Stigmatization', 'Subgroup', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'data repository', 'data resource', 'data sharing', 'design', 'disorder subtype', 'effective therapy', 'genome wide association study', 'health care service utilization', 'health data', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'instrument', 'large datasets', 'learning strategy', 'medically underserved', 'member', 'multidimensional data', 'neglect', 'online resource', 'patient engagement', 'patient stratification', 'patient subsets', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'programs', 'psychosocial', 'recruit', 'research study', 'skin disorder', 'social media', 'social stigma', 'symptom self management', 'tool', 'unsupervised learning', 'validation studies']",NIAMS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,K01,2021,121288
"Machine Learning to Reduce Hypertension Treatment Clinical Inertia PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Hypertension (HTN) is a main risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD). It can be managed through use of antihypertensive medications and lifestyle modification (i.e., diet and exercise). Adults who have controlled BP have close to a 50% decreased risk of CVD-related mortality compared to those with uncontrolled BP. However, using current guidelines, over 40% of the 100 million US adults with HTN have controlled BP. Thus, uncontrolled BP remains a significant and largely unchecked public health issue in the United States. Interventions to improve BP control exist (i.e., medication adherence and diet and exercise), but they are mostly complex and resource intensive. If resources to improve HTN control are to be efficiently used, identifying patients who are likely to have persistently uncontrolled BP may provide an opportunity for targeted and tailored intervention and close monitoring. Application of a machine learning algorithm (MLA) to electronic medical record (EMR) data could identify patients likely to have uncontrolled BP. The use and amount of data in EMRs continues to expand and improve in quality. The Temple Health EMR contains extensive demographic, clinical, prescribing, and dispensing data. MLAs are ideally suited to harness this complex and abundant data. MLAs recognize patterns in data that may be difficult to detect by researchers and identify variables that are important for prediction of an outcome. They have been used to predict hospital length of stay, hospital mortality rates, and even detect diabetic retinopathy. The objective of the major study proposed in this K01 application is to first, develop and validate a random forest MLA to predict risk of uncontrolled BP among adults with HTN. Second, identify barriers and facilitators to implementing an MLA-clinical decision support (CDS) tool that predicts uncontrolled BP into clinical settings by conducting key-informant interviews and focus groups with primary care clinicians and patients. Third, Compare clinical management of hypertension with and without a prototype of an MLA-CDS tool through a case-vignette study. These aims align with my career goal of lowering CVD risk in adults. I will accomplish these aims with the help of an accomplished mentoring team focused on hypertension and antihypertensive medication adherence, machine learning, and qualitative interviewing and CDS-tool development. During the timeframe of this study I will gain experience in (1) MLA development and validation, (2) qualitative interviewing skills to develop CDS tools for clinicians, and (3) leadership skills for principal investigators. These skills will allow me to become an independent investigator focused on identifying people at high risk for chronic disease related to CVD events and developing tools to assist physicians in lowering CVD risk at the population level. The objective of the major study proposed in this K01 application is to first, develop and validate a random forest machine learning algorithm (MLA) to predict risk of uncontrolled blood pressure among adults with hypertension. Second, identify barriers and facilitators to implementing an MLA-clinical decision support (CDS) tool that predicts uncontrolled blood pressure into clinical settings by conducting key-informant interviews and focus groups with primary care clinicians and patients.

"Intelligent Intensive Care Unit (I2CU): Pervasive Sensing and Artificial Intelligence for Augmented Clinical Decision-making Project Summary Although close monitoring and dynamic assessment of patient acuity are key aspects of ICU care, both are limited by the time constraints imposed on healthcare providers. Currently, dynamic and precise assessment of patient’s acuity in ICU rely almost exclusively on physicians’ clinical judgment and vigilance. Furthermore, important visual assessment details, such as facial expressions, posture, and mobility, are captured sporadically by overburdened nurses or are not captured at all. However, these visual assessment details are associated with critical indices such as physical function, pain and subsequent clinical deterioration. The PIs’ long-term goal is to sense, quantify, and communicate patient’s clinical condition in an autonomous and precise manner. The overall objective of this application is to develop the novel tools for sensing, quantifying, and communicating any patient’s condition in an autonomous, precise, and interpretable manner. The central hypothesis is that deep learning models will be superior to existing acuity clinical scores by predicting acuity in a dynamic, precise, and interpretable manner, using autonomous assessment of pain, emotional distress and physical function, together with clinical and physiologic data. The hypothesis has been formulated based on preliminary data and is well-grounded in clinical care literature. The rationale is that autonomous and precise patient quantification can result in enhanced clinical workflow and early intervention. The overall objective will be achieved by pursuing three specific aims. (1) Developing and validating an interpretable deep learning algorithm for precise and dynamic prediction of the patient’s clinical status to determine if it is more accurate in predicting daily care transition outcomes, while providing interpretable information to the physician. (2) Developing a pervasive sensing system for autonomous visual assessment of critically ill patients to determine if it can provide accurate visual assessment of a patient compared to human expert, and if it can enrich acuity prediction when combined with clinical data. (3) Implementing and evaluating an intelligent platform for real- time integration of autonomous visual assessment and acuity prediction in clinical workflow to determine accuracy in real-time prospective evaluation and to determine physicians’ risk perception and satisfaction. The approach is innovative, because it represents the first attempt to (1) dynamically predict precise patient trajectory, (2) autonomously perform visual assessment in the ICU, and (3) implement artificial intelligence platform in real time in clinical workflow. The proposed research is significant since it will address several key problems and critical barriers in critical care, including (1) lack of precise and real-time prediction of clinical trajectory, (2) manual repetitive ICU assessments, and (3) uncaptured patient aspects. Ultimately, the results are expected to improve patient outcomes and decrease hospitalization costs, as well as lifelong complications. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because it can result in enhanced critical care workflow and early critical care intervention, ultimately improving patient outcomes and decreasing hospitalization costs. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of NIH’s mission that pertains to advancing disease diagnosis through medical applications of new tools and technologies, as the proposed research applies advanced computational methods and sensing technologies to automatically quantify and convey patient status in real-time.",Intelligent Intensive Care Unit (I2CU): Pervasive Sensing and Artificial Intelligence for Augmented Clinical Decision-making,10154047,R01EB029699,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical assessments', 'Collaborations', 'Color', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Critical Care', 'Critical Illness', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Deterioration', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Facial Expression', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Health Personnel', 'Hospital Costs', 'Human', 'Image', 'Intelligence', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Judgment', 'Literature', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Nurses', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Pain Measurement', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Physical Function', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Posture', 'Process', 'Process Assessment', 'Public Health', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sampling', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visual', 'advanced disease', 'augmented intelligence', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'disease diagnosis', 'emotional distress', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'novel', 'prediction algorithm', 'prospective', 'prospective test', 'risk perception', 'satisfaction', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'tool', 'vigilance']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,R01,2021,632088
"Leveraging Artificial Intelligence Solutions to Develop Digital Biomarkers for Precision Trauma Resuscitation PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  In the U.S., trauma is the leading cause of death for those 1-45 years old and hemorrhage remains the largest contributing factor to preventable death. Providers must rapidly identify those suffering from hemorrhage to optimize outcome, but internal bleeding remains difficult to diagnose even for experienced clinicians. Little is known on presentation about those suffering from occult hemorrhage and providers must quickly make treatment decisions in these time-pressured, time-sensitive clinical scenarios. This proposal seeks to develop through artificial intelligence, a type of advanced machine learning, prediction algorithms that could be deployed at the bedside of patients to assist clinicians with more timely recognition of hemorrhage. By doing so, we hypothesize that this approach (integrating diverse data sources that have not previously been combined to one another) could identify patterns in our patients that far surpass current capabilities to quickly detect and act on the critical components contributing to outcome. The ability to rapidly pinpoint these patterns and display them to the bedside clinician could allow more timely intervention and precise therapeutic approaches for hemorrhage control.  Beyond the challenges in rapidly identifying bleeding, current treatment of hemorrhage is rudimentary with a standard resuscitation approach for all patients. This reflects attempts to optimize outcome based upon the average treatment effect, rather than being adaptable for unique patient phenotypes. Hemorrhage is believed to initiate a complex chain of events involving crosstalk between the coagulation and inflammatory systems that are hypothesized to play a key role in outcome. Trauma has a known time zero of onset, making it an ideal model to study the immediate pathophysiologic changes associated with hemorrhage. This complex, individual patient biology is believed to explain why those suffering similar injury have differing outcomes. However, to date, these individual characteristics are poorly understood and not factored into initial treatment approaches. Through this proposal, I also seek to define novel digital biomarkers representing patient phenotypes that require precision resuscitation approaches to maximize outcome. Fundamental to reducing hemorrhagic deaths is the need to elucidate a deeper understanding of these mechanistic models of patient states. Strategies that help to identify novel patient phenotypes that could benefit from more tailored treatment pathways may provide important advances in decreasing preventable death.  The net result of this proposal will be a deeper insight into the mechanistic models contributing to evolving patient states following hemorrhage, and identify the key phenotypes or digital biomarkers associated with mortality, complications, and occult hemorrhage. Finding solutions to advance our resuscitation approaches following hemorrhage has potential to decrease complications, save lives, and reduce health care costs. PROJECT NARRATIVE In the US, traumatic injury is the number one cause of death for those under 45 years old and these deaths include many patients dying from the consequences of bleeding. Through leveraging the power of artificial intelligence (a scientific analysis approach similarly used in non-medical fields to help answer questions from large amounts of complex information), an integrated approach to measuring outcome will be developed utilizing biologic, clinical, and electronic medical record (EMR) data. The goal of this project is to lay the ground work for developing early warning detection systems that could identify those at risk of complications early and assist care providers in selecting the best treatment to minimize complications and death from hemorrhage.",Leveraging Artificial Intelligence Solutions to Develop Digital Biomarkers for Precision Trauma Resuscitation,10063555,R01HL149670,"['Abdomen', 'Abdominal Cavity', 'Address', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Bedside Technology', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Blood', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Coagulation Process', 'Complex', 'Computational Science', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computers', 'Coupled', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hemorrhage', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physiologic Monitoring', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Provider', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Stream', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'Trauma patient', 'Traumatic injury', 'Triage', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'advanced analytics', 'base', 'care providers', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical predictors', 'clinically significant', 'deep learning', 'detection platform', 'digital', 'diverse data', 'experience', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'insight', 'mortality', 'multimodal data', 'novel', 'point of care', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'pressure', 'preventable death', 'profiles in patients', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensor', 'severe injury', 'treatment effect']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R01,2021,695258
"Dialysis access monitoring using a digital stethoscope-based deep learning system Project Summary/Abstract This SBIR Phase I project will develop a deep learning-based algorithm to analyze the sound of blood flow in mature arterio-venous (AV) fistulas used for hemodialysis access. This monitoring tool can help to identify fistulas with impending failure in patients who are in need of surgical intervention to ensure patency of the patient’s hemodialysis access. The specific aims of the study are (1) to create the world’s first deep learning-scale database of mature AV fistula sounds paired with ultrasound imaging from hemodialysis patients, and (2) develop and evaluate the performance of a deep learning classification model trained via semi-supervised learning to discriminate between patients with patent fistulas and patients with failing fistulas. By integrating this deep learning algorithm into Eko’s mobile and cloud software platform, we anticipate this algorithm will enable better monitoring for failing fistulas. During Phase I of the project we will recruit study subjects in vascular surgery and interventional radiology clinics at Columbia University Medical Center. The follow-up SBIR Phase II project will extend our algorithm to account for (1) broader forms of hemodialysis access including AV grafts, which often fail more frequently than fistulas, and premature fistulas, which are often abandoned, and (2) longitudinal collection and analysis of hemodialysis access sounds at commercial dialysis centers and in patients’ homes. SBIR Project Narrative In creating the world’s largest annotated dataset of mature AV fistula sounds and corresponding ultrasounds, Eko will gain unprecedented insights into fistula blood flow. We expect this to advance our scientific understanding of the fluid dynamics of fistulas, and help explain how and why hemodialysis access fails at such a high rate over time. A clinical decision support algorithm trained from this dataset can help healthcare systems detect fistula failures earlier, leading to more timely interventions that can avert costly complications, prolong life expectancy, and improve quality of life for hemodialysis patients as their care transitions from clinic to home care.",Dialysis access monitoring using a digital stethoscope-based deep learning system,10255460,R43DK129107,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Algorithms', 'Arteriovenous fistula', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Auscultation', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood flow', 'Bluetooth', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Distal', 'Early Intervention', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Eko', 'End stage renal failure', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Failure', 'Fistula', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart Sounds', 'Hemodialysis', 'Home environment', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Interventional radiology', 'Lead', 'Legal patent', 'Life Expectancy', 'Liquid substance', 'Location', 'Maintenance', 'Measurement', 'Medicare', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Nephrology', 'Network-based', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Observational Study', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Personal Computers', 'Phase', 'Physical Examination', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Quality of life', 'Renal Replacement Therapy', 'Research Design', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Standardization', 'Stenosis', 'Stethoscopes', 'Study Subject', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Tablet Computer', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transplantation', 'Ultrasonography', 'Validation', 'algorithm training', 'analog', 'base', 'clinical database', 'clinical decision support', 'clinically relevant', 'cloud based', 'cloud software', 'commercialization', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'data streams', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'deep neural network', 'digital', 'evaluation/testing', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'patient home care', 'premature', 'recruit', 'skills', 'sound', 'standard of care', 'supervised learning', 'systematic review', 'tool']",NIDDK,"EKO DEVICES, INC.",R43,2021,299358
"Using natural language processing and machine learning to identify potentially preventable hospital admissions among outpatients with chronic lung diseases Project Summary Patients living with chronic lung diseases (CLDs) are frequently admitted to the hospital for potentially preventable causes. Such admissions may be discordant with patient preferences and/or represent a low-value allocation of health system resources. To anticipate such admissions, existing clinical prediction models in this field typically produce an “all-cause” risk estimate which, even if accurate, overlooks the actionable mechanisms behind  admission risk and therefore fails to identify a prescribed response. This limitation may explain the only modest – at best – reductions in hospital admissions and readmissions seen in most intervention bundles that have been tested in this population. An opportunity exists, therefore, to predict hospitalization risk while simultaneously identifying patient phenotypes (i.e. some constellation of social, demographic, clinical, and other characteristics) for which known preventive interventions exist. The proposed study seeks to overcome these limitations and capitalize on this opportunity by (1) conducting semi-structured interviews with hospitalized patients with CLDs, and their caregivers and clinicians, to directly identify modifiable risks and their associated phenotypes driving hospital  admissions; (2) using natural language processing techniques (NLP) to build classification models that will leverage nuanced narrative, social, and clinical information in the unstructured text of clinical encounter notes to identify patients with these phenotypes; and (3) building risk prediction model focused on actionable phenotypes with a wide-array of traditional regression and machine learning approaches while also incorporating large numbers of predictor variables from text data and accounting for time-varying trends. The candidate's preliminary work using basic NLP techniques to significantly improve the discrimination of clinical prediction models in an inpatient population has motivated this methodologic approach. The rising burden and costs of hospitalizations associated with CLDs, and the increasing attention from federal payers, highlights the critical nature of this work. Completion of this research will build upon the candidate's past training, which includes a Masters of Science in Health Policy Research obtained with NHLBI T32 support, and will provide the experience, education, and mentorship to allow the candidate to become a fully independent investigator. Based on the candidate's tailored training plan, he will acquire advanced skills in mixed-methods research, NLP, and trial design all through coursework, close  mentoring and supervision, and direct practice. The skills will position him ideally to submit successful R01s testing the deployment of the proposed clinical prediction models in real-world settings. The candidate's primary mentor, collaborators, and advisors will ensure adherence to the proposed timeline and goals and provide a  supportive environment for him to develop an independent research career testing the real-world deployment of clinical prediction models to reduce low-value and preference-discordant care for patients with CLDs. Project Narrative Every year many people living with chronic lung diseases are admitted to the hospital despite the fact that some of these admissions may have been prevented with early identification and intervention prior to the hospitalization. Previous attempts at preventing such hospitalizations have been limited by their ability to both accurately identify those at risk, and because most risk models do not provide a reason for the likely admission. The proposed work draws directly on the experiences of patients with chronic lung diseases who are admitted to a hospital, and then uses cutting edge statistical and computer science techniques to use information in the electronic health record to accurately predict the risk and the likely reason for future hospital admissions.",Using natural language processing and machine learning to identify potentially preventable hospital admissions among outpatients with chronic lung diseases,10134412,K23HL141639,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Admission activity', 'Adult', 'Ambulatory Care', 'Attention', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bioinformatics', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Chronic lung disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Diagnosis', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Education', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health Policy', 'Health system', 'Home environment', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Inpatients', 'Interstitial Lung Diseases', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Machine Learning', 'Master of Science', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Nurses', 'Outpatients', 'Palliative Care', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Preferences', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Policy Research', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Primary Health Care', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Social support', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Training', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'administrative database', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical center', 'clinical encounter', 'comorbidity', 'computer science', 'cost', 'design', 'discrete data', 'end of life', 'experience', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'interest', 'model development', 'modifiable risk', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'preference', 'prevent', 'randomized trial', 'response', 'risk prediction model', 'skills', 'social', 'statistical learning', 'structured data', 'supportive environment', 'trend', 'trial design', 'unstructured data']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K23,2021,173801
"Using Machine Learning to Improve Readmission Prediction in Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementia Project Summary/Abstract By 2060, approximately 14 million adults are expected to live with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia (ADRD). Although ADRD patients represent 10% of the general geriatric population, they account for 37% of the direct healthcare expenditures. Compared to other older adults, ADRD patients are at a significantly higher risk of hospitalization and unplanned 30-day hospital readmission (hereafter “readmission”). Readmissions are costly and expose ADRD patients to expedited cognitive decline, premature institutionalization, and death. Availability of a caregiver after hospital discharge is critical for ADRD patients to ensure adherence to diet, medications, and follow-up appointments. There is a paucity of evidence examining readmission among the ADRD population. Most risk-assessment tools (e.g. LACE Index) have poor discrimination power and lack inclusion of influential medical and social features, and caregiver availability particular to ADRD patients. A potential solution is to develop a risk tool using hospitals’ electronic health records (EHRs) because they contain salient clinical and sociodemographic features as well as a wealth of information from physicians’, nurses’ and social workers’ notes (unstructured EHRs data). The specific research aims for this proposal are to (1) develop and validate a risk-assessment tool for predicting readmission among ADRD patients; (2) examine the feasibility/acceptability and clinical/economic utility of the readmission risk- assessment tool; and (3) develop a natural language processing (NLP) algorithm to extract information on caregiver availability from unstructured EHRs (exploratory). We hypothesize that the predictive power of our risk tool will be at least 20% higher than that of LACE Index (the current risk tool used in the Michigan Medicine hospitals). To accomplish this project, my mentors and I have defined a set of targeted career goals and educational training. My training aims include (1) gain familiarity with the clinical aspects of ADRD (linked with Research Aim 1); (2) acquire methodological skills in machine learning and predictive modeling (linked with Research Aim 1); (3) develop an understanding of the logistics of the ADRD patient discharge and care transition processes (linked with Research Aim 2); and (4) gain proficiency in NLP and algorithm validation (linked with Research Aim 3). By completion of this award, I will have used EHRs and data science to develop a validated risk-assessment tool for readmission for hospitalized ADRD patients. The results will enable efficient and targeted discharge planning to reduce readmission and wasteful spending. It will also provide pilot data needed to apply for an R01 examining the optimization of discharge process/location for hospitalized ADRD patients. This career development award will lay the foundation for me to become a unique health economist specialized in efficient care transitions for ADRD patients. Narrative Patients with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia (ADRD) are at higher risk of hospitalization and 30-day readmission (readmission) compared to other older adults. Readmission is expensive and increases the risk of institutionalization and premature death among ADRD patients.

"Using Large Electronic Health Records and Advanced Analytics to Develop Predictive Frailty Trajectories in Patients with Heart Failure Candidate objective: My objective for this award is to become an independent quantitative scientist in analytical clinical research through structured training and mentored research experience. My goal is to become an academic leader and developer of advanced predictive models of health trajectories using electronic health records (EHR). Training objectives: I seek to sharpen my skill set as a clinical quantitative scientist using clinical informatics, EHR data warehouses, and advanced computational models. I will use the protected time provided by this award to gain proficiency in patient-clinician interactions, clinical informatics, natural language processing, and advanced survival analysis to accomplish my research aims. Background: Frailty is a complex clinical syndrome associated with aging and chronic illness. It decreases physiological reserves and increases vulnerability to stressors. The prevalence of frailty in patients with heart failure is 74%. The interplay of frailty and heart failure increases the risk for death, prolonged hospital stays, and functional dependence. One conceptual framework to operationalize frailty is accumulation of deficits: the frailty index (FI). The FI provides a risk score based on the assumption that the more ailments a patient has, the higher the risk of adverse outcomes, including mortality. Prior FI models have not been used in routine clinical practice due to the following limitations: insufficient number and range of clinical variables, lack of personalized deficit detection, use of data not commonly found in EHRs, insufficient use of longitudinal analytical models including survival analysis techniques, and the reduction of FI to a cross-sectional health status rather than a health trajectory. Research Aim: The overarching goal of this application is to develop a frailty trajectory (FT) for heart failure patients that provides information integrating prior functional impairment, current functional status, and future risk of mortality. In Aim 1, we will develop a novel cross-sectional FI that uses the full breadth of outpatient EHR data and innovative machine learning data science methods to predict mortality. In Aim 2, we will use serial cross-sectional FIs to build FTs and identify clusters of individuals following a similar progression of frailty over time. In Aim 3, we will compare the prognostic value of cross-sectional FI versus FT. The VA national EHR offers the ideal context for this study, as it provides longitudinal data since 1999 and can link to administrative data from non- VA sources, including linked Medicare databases. Mentoring & environment: A multidisciplinary mentoring team will supervise my training and will oversee my mentored research projects, formal coursework, directed reading, and career development. The proposed activities will provide a foundation for transitioning to an independent quantitative data scientist developing clinical decision aids to guide patient care. Baylor College of Medicine and the Center for Innovations in Quality, Effectiveness, and Safety have a national reputation of mentoring and supporting junior faculty members from diverse academic backgrounds to independent careers as clinical-investigators. Physical frailty is common in adults with heart failure and increases the risk for poor health outcomes. Clinicians need tools to identify adults with physical frailty as part of routine care to support early intervention to treat frailty and reduce this risk. This application seeks to develop a novel measure of physical frailty using data collected as part of routine clinical care and recorded in the electronic health record.",Using Large Electronic Health Records and Advanced Analytics to Develop Predictive Frailty Trajectories in Patients with Heart Failure,10199037,K25HL152006,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Admission activity', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'American', 'Award', 'Big Data', 'Biological Models', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Congestive Heart Failure', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Science', 'Data Scientist', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Aid', 'Decision Making', 'Dependence', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Faculty', 'Foundations', 'Frail Elderly', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Status', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Length of Stay', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medicare', 'Medicare claim', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Older Population', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Quality of Care', 'Reading', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Survival Analysis', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'advanced analytics', 'adverse outcome', 'analytical method', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'college', 'data warehouse', 'deep neural network', 'experience', 'frailty', 'functional disability', 'functional status', 'high risk', 'hospital readmission', 'indexing', 'individual variation', 'innovation', 'member', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'point of care', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic value', 'random forest', 'routine care', 'screening', 'signal processing', 'skills', 'stressor', 'support tools', 'tool']",NHLBI,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,K25,2021,143762
"Improving Telerehabilitation in Pediatric Cerebral Palsy Using Machine Learning and Social Robots PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Cerebral palsy (CP) is the most common motor disorder in young children. There is no cure, but disciplined rehabilitation can improve outcomes. A critical component of rehabilitation is continuous assessment of patient function. Patients in rural areas can have difﬁculty accessing care. Telerehabilitation provides an option to extend access to care, but has limitations. The foci of this project are 1) understanding how a social robot physically co-located with the patient during a telerehabilitation assessment alters the activity by the patient, potentially leading to changes in the ability of the clinician to perform assessment and 2) whether computer vision and machine learning can be used to assess patients. Together, these two complementary goals will show a path forward for remote treatment of patients with CP and similar conditions.  The effect of using a social robot in telerehabilitation will be examined through a study where pediatric CP subjects and typical subjects interact with a remote operator in three conditions: face-to-face, over traditional telepresence, and over telepresence with a social robot present. Direct changes in the level of subject interaction and compliance will be measured through surveys and video coding. The effect on quality of assessment will be measured by presenting expert therapists with ﬁrst-person video recordings from each condition and comparing the variance of their grading for each condition.  To truly realize the promise of using remote assessment to extend care, automated grading of assessments is necessary. To evaluate the feasibility of this, videos of children with various levels of upper extremity function along with their box and block scores and clinician ratings will be used to train two algorithms. Both algorithms will begin by using off the shelf convolutional neural network based tools to extract the pose of the subjects. The ﬁrst algorithm will be hand designed. It will learn how to weight known metrics of motion, such as movement speed, time to maximum speed, and number of speed peaks, using principal component analysis and a naive Gaussian classiﬁer. The second algorithm will use a custom neural network operating directly on the time-series pose data. Both algorithms will attempt to, given video of a novel subject, predict the level of function as would be predicted by a therapist. Both algorithms will be analyzed to discover their underlying decision-making philosophies, which may give insight into what parameters of motion clearly differentiate levels of function.  The project will be done in the context of a pre-doctoral training plan. The plan focuses on developing an independent researcher at the intersection of robotics and rehabilitation science. This will be done within Mechanical Engineering, Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, and the General Robotics, Automation, Sensing, and Perception (GRASP) laboratory at the University of Pennsylvania with additional mentorship and experience at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. PROJECT NARRATIVE Limits to care for pediatric cerebral palsy patients in rural areas could be addressed through telepresence, but current technologies fail to adequately convey information. This project will explore whether combining social robots with telepresence systems and computer vision can improve the quality of telerehabilitation for the purpose of remote assessment. The social robot will aid communication to the patient, motivating them through activities, while the computer vision automatically assesses function.",Improving Telerehabilitation in Pediatric Cerebral Palsy Using Machine Learning and Social Robots,10285983,F31HD102165,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automatic Data Processing', 'Automation', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Discipline', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Educational Background', 'Engineering', 'Exercise', 'Facial Expression', 'Frequencies', 'Gaussian model', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Improve Access', 'Infant', 'Instruction', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Long-Term Care', 'Long-Term Care for Elderly', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Motion', 'Motivation', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Network-based', 'Occupational Therapy', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pennsylvania', 'Perception', 'Persons', 'Philadelphia', 'Philosophy', 'Physical Medicine', 'Physical Rehabilitation', 'Physical therapy', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'Series', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Systems Integration', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Travel', 'Universities', 'Upper Extremity', 'Video Recording', 'Weight', 'Work', 'arm', 'arm movement', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'communication aid', 'convolutional neural network', 'design', 'experience', 'human-robot interaction', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'insight', 'kinematics', 'motor disorder', 'neural network', 'novel', 'pediatric patients', 'peer', 'pre-doctoral', 'prototype', 'rehabilitation science', 'robot rehabilitation', 'robotic system', 'rural area', 'social assistive robot', 'telepresence', 'telerehabilitation', 'tool', 'vocalization']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,F31,2021,46036
"Harnessing the Electronic Health Record to Predict Risk of Cardiovascular Disease PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the single largest killer in the United States for both men and women in every racial/ethnic group. Thus, accurate and systematic evaluation of CVD risk represents an aspect of Precision Medicine that will touch every patient. CVD risk scores that are currently the standard of care are derived from research cohorts and are particularly inaccurate in women, older patients, and those with missing data. The goal of this Precision Medicine based application is to capitalize on the depth and breadth of clinical data within electronic health record (EHR) systems to revolutionize CVD risk prediction, thereby optimizing personalized care for every patient. Our proposed approach is innovative in that we have identified and addressed the most significant barriers to development of an EHR-based risk score. Novel aspects of this research include: 1) use of complete EHR data to develop and validate algorithms to define a variety of risk factors (e.g., reproductive history), thus building a comprehensive risk profile for each patient that incorporates diagnosis and procedure codes, laboratory values, clinical test results, patient provided information (e.g., alcohol use), and natural language processing of unstructured clinical text; 2) incorporation of age at onset of risk factors; 3) use of highly flexible machine learning techniques in the form of generalized boosted regression modeling; 4) exploration of a new deep learning model for censored EHR data; and 5) determination of the extent of risk reclassification in multiple geographically-defined populations, including an underserved minority population. Furthermore, genetic studies demonstrate that incorporating variants into current risk models improves risk prediction and use of an individual's genetic risk could further enhance our ability to deliver precision medicine to every patient. Therefore, we seek to develop a sex-specific next-generation CVD risk prediction score using EHR data in combination with genetic variants. This paradigm is a significant departure from the current one that relies on scores derived from relatively small research cohorts that use only a restricted set of clinical parameters that differentially misclassify an individual's risk, especially in women. Our access to empirical clinical EHR data for hundreds of thousands of patients uniquely positions us to 1) develop a sex-specific risk prediction model for incident CVD using data from the EHR; 2) assess the performance of the sex-specific EHR risk score in an independent non-urban and rural population; and 3) identify and characterize patients for whom genetic information improves CVD prediction beyond the clinical risk score. Successful completion of these aims has the potential to impact all adult patients, drive clinical practice changes to systematically collect sex-specific risk factors, and inform attempts to embed the next-generation CVD risk score into EHR systems for automated use in clinical care. PROJECT NARRATIVE Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the single largest killer in the United States. We propose to use electronic health record data to improve our ability to accurately classify risk and identify those who would benefit from preventive therapies. Improved risk prediction will shed light on the mechanisms of CVD and potentially reduce incidence, save lives, and lower health care costs.",Harnessing the Electronic Health Record to Predict Risk of Cardiovascular Disease,10063011,R01HL136659,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Algorithms', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinics and Hospitals', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Community Hospitals', 'County', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Ethnic group', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic study', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hybrids', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Latino', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Minnesota', 'Minority Groups', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive', 'Preventive therapy', 'Procedures', 'Reproducibility', 'Reproductive History', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Rural', 'Rural Population', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Touch sensation', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Wisconsin', 'Woman', 'base', 'biobank', 'cardiovascular disorder prevention', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'deep learning', 'electronic data', 'feature extraction', 'flexibility', 'genetic information', 'genetic panel test', 'genetic variant', 'improved', 'innovation', 'men', 'multiple data types', 'next generation', 'novel', 'older patient', 'personalized care', 'phenotyping algorithm', 'precision genetics', 'precision medicine', 'prospective', 'racial and ethnic', 'research clinical testing', 'risk prediction', 'risk prediction model', 'sex', 'standard of care', 'time use', 'underserved minority']",NHLBI,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2021,794994
"A framework to stratify patient cohorts for clinical management PROJECT SUMMARY  Existing Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems have limited functionality to find patients that can benefit by particular interventions. Hence, clinicians are unable to proactively reach-out to these patients, leading to an ever-widening evidence-care gap. The goal of this proposal is to improve healthcare delivery. The objective is to develop a data-framework for accurately finding patients that can benefits from large/population scale interventions. We will investigate two dimensions for improving the patient search—increasing the resolution of the search (aim 1) and increasing the quality of the data that the search is performed on (aim 2). In aim 1 we will test the hypothesis that a rule-based model of the relevant clinical guideline, will find patients with higher accuracy than the conventional queries. The rational is that the rule-based approach will allow complex groupings of the eligibility criteria and will thereby provide a higher resolution of search than conventional query. In aim 2 we will investigate whether machine learning (ML) can improve the accuracy of patient data and contribute to the accuracy of search results obtained through the conventional query and the guideline rule-base. In addition to the above aims, in aim 3 we will automate deployment of the rule-base and ML models and minimize the manual effort for developing ML models. This proposal builds on the lipid management program at Brigham and Women's hospital (BWH). Our work will be focused on finding patients for lipid- management; however, our methodology and tooling will be generalizable to other medical areas and institutions. The study team includes national experts in cardiology, machine learning, health information technology (HIT) and open-source software development. We will create an open-source software platform (i2b2-ML) by extending the popular `Informatics for Integration Biology and the Bedside' (i2b2) platform that we have developed and supported over the past 10 years and that is used by over 200 medical centers. I2b2-ML will extend i2b2's proven ability to characterize patient cohorts for research into the clinical realm. Our study will yield methodology for accurately finding patients that can benefit by clinical intervention and will thereby enable cost-effectiveness of population programs. It will directly help scale the lipid management program at BWH to benefit a wider patient population. Our detailed characterization of the gaps in lipid management at a large healthcare system will potentially inform improvements in the lipid management guideline. The methodology and tooling developed in this project will be disseminated in open-source for potential incorporation in the clinical data infrastructure at other institutions, which will facilitate implementation of population-scale clinical programs across the nation. In addition, the resultant infrastructure will serve as a platform for development of artificial intelligence-based applications to improve clinical care. These outcomes are expected to have a positive impact on health care delivery so that more patients will get the optimal care. PROJECT NARRATIVE We propose developing Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside (i2b2), a well-established, open source, platform that is currently used at over 200 hospitals and medical centers to use machine learning for identifying patient groups receiving suboptimal care. The proposed work will enable healthcare institutions across the United States to proactively reach-out to these patients, for delivering the appropriate clinical intervention.

"Development of End-To-End Clinical Decision Support Tools To Prevent Cardiotoxic Drug Response SUMMARY Drug-induced cardiac toxicity, in the form of QT prolongation and torsade de pointes, is an uncommon but devastating side effect of over one hundred currently marketed drugs. The ubiquity of drug-induced QT prolongation (diLQTS) across medical specialties and conditions creates a challenge for providers seeking to prescribe known QT-prolonging medications, particularly for non-cardiac conditions. Work by our group to develop automated clinical decision support (CDS) tools that alert providers of patient risk has shown promise towards reducing the number of prescriptions to at-risk individuals. However, these tools rely on a history of an electrocardiogram (ECG) with QT prolongation to identify at-risk patients, and thus exclude a large number of potentially at-risk individuals who have not had an ECG within our system. Through a unique institutional partnership with Google, in which a copy of our entire electronic health record (EHR) is stored on the Google Cloud Platform (GCP), we have developed preliminary deep-learning models to predict risk of diLQTS. We have also validated the genetic association with the QT interval and diLQTS across several real-world populations using an aggregate polygenic risk score. Through creation of an institutional biobank with certification for clinical application of results, as well as cloud-based integration of EHR data with genetic data, we have the capability to leverage our existing infrastructure to study the role of deep learning and genetics to reduce the risk of diLQTS. This investigation will combine our unique research and clinical infrastructure on the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus with our investigative team composed of experts in the study of pharmacogenomics and medical informatics to develop and study an end-to-end CDS tool incorporating genetics and deep learning to predict risk of diLQTS. The specific aims of this application include the following: (1) develop and test a cloud-based, deep-learning model using EHR data on in- and outpatients to predict risk of diLQTS; (2) validate genetic predictors of diLQTS using institutional biobank samples, and a multi-ethnic external population; and (3) develop and test CDS tools using these advanced methods to reduce the risk of diLQTS. We will use a common data model (Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership) mapped from EHR data, as well as a custom DNA array (Multi-Ethnic Genotyping Array) designed for imputation across a variety of non-European ancestries, to ensure that the our prediction model and findings from this study can be replicated in other institutions and populations in the future. In such a way, this investigation will not only provide insight into the use of machine learning and genetics for risk prediction of diLQTS, but it will also create a blueprint for future advanced CDS development for other conditions. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of this project is the development of a clinical decision support tool that can be used to predict the risk of drug-induced QT prolongation based on deep learning and genetics. This tool could be used to prevent potentially fatal side effects of medications when alternatives are available, or increase vigilance when safer alternatives are not available.

"Using predictive analytics to tailor care for patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes PROJECT SUMMARY Over 1.5 million US adults are diagnosed with type 2 diabetes (T2D) each year. These newly diagnosed individuals are at increased risk of developing debilitating complications, including renal disease, strokes, and myocardial infarctions. However, individuals differ widely in their likelihood of experiencing these adverse outcomes. Individual risk varies based on a complex interplay between pathophysiology, responsiveness to treatment, and patient capacity for self-management and making sustained lifestyle changes. Early T2D glycemic control provides a lasting benefit (""metabolic memory""); therefore, strategies that enable the effective targeting and tailoring of T2D care starting in the initial period after diagnosis may result in better long-term health outcomes. Implementing individually-tailored care strategies requires substantially more effective risk prediction tools than are currently available. This R21 proposal seeks to apply advanced analytic prediction modeling methods to a rich source of electronic health record (EHR)-derived clinical data (assessed at the time of initial diagnosis and after a year of standard management) to define individual patient risk profiles. These patient risk profiles will incorporate differences in disease physiology (e.g., reflected in factors such as age, BMI, hemoglobin A1c at diagnosis), treatment responsiveness, and early self- management results (e.g., medication adherence, weekly exercise levels, weight loss). This R21 leverages an established, well-characterized cohort of adults with incident, newly-diagnosed T2D (n=67,575) within Kaiser Permanente Northern California. We will apply advanced machine learning-based modeling methods (e.g., random forests, LASSO, extreme gradient boosting) to complete the following Aims: 1) Develop and validate a predictive model using EHR-derived patient data available at T2D diagnosis to identify patients at increased risk of suboptimal glycemic control over the five years following diagnosis and 2) Modify the Aim 1 model by incorporating clinical predictors captured during the first year following T2D diagnosis. We hypothesize that the unique information available at these two time points (i.e., initial diagnosis and after one year of standard treatment) can be used to individualize both initial and subsequent early care for patients with newly diagnosed T2D. If successful, this project's results can be applied to support targeted T2D care strategies tailored to each individual's risk of suboptimal five-year glycemic control (and later micro and macrovascular complications) based on differences in disease physiology, treatment response, and early self-care. This work will form the foundation for innovative, pragmatic clinical trials that advance our ultimate goal of providing proactive and effectively tailored early care that results in better long-term health outcomes for adults with T2D. PROJECT NARRATIVE Current initial type 2 diabetes care strategies are typically ""one-size-fits-all"" and do not address individual patient differences in risk of complications (like stroke, kidney disease), responsiveness to treatment, or ability to self-manage and successfully adopt lifestyle changes. We propose to apply advanced predictive modeling methods (including machine learning, a type of artificial intelligence) to data from the electronic health record to predict which newly diagnosed individuals are at increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes-related complications. The findings are intended to help clinicians individualize type 2 diabetes care from the beginning by creating optimal care plans that reduce complications and maintain long-term health.",Using predictive analytics to tailor care for patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes,10286549,R21DK130018,"['Adopted', 'Adult', 'Adverse event', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Appointment', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavioral', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Body mass index', 'California', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Cost Sharing', 'Data', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Exercise', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Glucose', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Health Care Visit', 'Health behavior', 'Healthcare', 'Individual', 'Integrated Delivery of Health Care', 'Intervention', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Memory', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Physiology', 'Pragmatic clinical trial', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Preventive screening', 'Race', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Self Care', 'Self Management', 'Smoking', 'Source', 'Stroke', 'System', 'Telemedicine', 'Time', 'Visit', 'Work', 'advanced analytics', 'adverse outcome', 'analytical method', 'base', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'data repository', 'diabetes control', 'diabetes management', 'disorder control', 'electronic data', 'follow-up', 'glycemic control', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'macrovascular disease', 'medication compliance', 'member', 'predictive modeling', 'random forest', 'response', 'risk prediction', 'risk stratification', 'sociodemographics', 'standard care', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy']",NIDDK,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R21,2021,248958
"Nurses' documentation of patient diagnoses, symptoms and interventions for home care patients with Alzheimer's Disease and related dementias: A natural language processing study PROJECT SUMMARY Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) represent a looming public health crisis, affecting roughly 5 million people and 11% of older adults in the United States. Studies on patient transitions across healthcare settings suggests that older adults with chronic conditions are vulnerable to inadequate transfer of information, putting them at risk for diminished quality of care, medication errors and potentially preventable complications. Patients at varied stages along the ADRD trajectory – especially those with multiple chronic conditions – may experience unique risks due to the loss of information across care settings. In a recent study, we developed a longitudinal dataset on a diverse cohort of 56,652 patients – mostly aged 65+ with multiple comorbidities – receiving home health care (HHC) services from a large non-profit home care provider. For patients admitted to HHC in 2010-2012, we identified subgroups of patients with ADRD diagnoses made prior to and after HHC admission. Outside the scope of this prior study remains a vast and largely unexplored data source – nurses’ free-text clinical notes captured in the electronic health record. With roughly 1 million entries of nurses’ free- text notes associated with the study population, there is a wealth of potential information from which to gain new insights and a need for innovative methods to analyze this unstructured data source. In this study, we propose to use natural language processing (NLP) techniques, a method for systematically analyzing free-text content that draws upon machine learning. Using the dataset developed in the prior study, this study aims to: 1. Expand and improve an existing NLP system to automatically identify the following information in the  nursing free-text notes: (i) knowledge of the patient having a previously established ADRD diagnosis; (ii)  observations of cognitive symptoms and related patient/caregiver needs; and (iii) mentions of interventions  to address these needs. 2. For patients who do not have an ADRD diagnosis prior to HHC admission, determine whether nurses’ free-  text documentation of cognitive symptoms identified in the NLP predict subsequent ADRD diagnoses  during the 4-year follow-up period. 3. Among patients diagnosed with ADRD prior to HHC admission, determine whether nurses’ free-text  documentation patterns (e.g. knowledge of the patient’s ADRD diagnostic status, observations of cognitive  symptoms, and interventions) predict: (i) service use; and (ii) adverse health outcomes for which ADRD  patients are at heightened risk (e.g. hospitalizations due to urinary tract infection, dehydration, falls). This study will allow us to examine HHC nurses’ practices, which are often difficult to observe systematically, and identify strategies to address the complex needs of their patients with ADRD and un-diagnosed patients who may be on a path toward ADRD diagnosis. The long-term goal of this research is to develop a home- based intervention that aims to improve quality of life for patients and caregivers along the ADRD trajectory. PROJECT NARRATIVE Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) affect about 5 million people in the U.S. Home health care nurses provide care for many people with ADRD and document what they observe about their patients’ needs in the form of free-text notes. This study will use a method known as ‘natural language processing’ to gain new knowledge from nurses’ notes and identify ways to better support people with ADRD and their caregivers.","Nurses' documentation of patient diagnoses, symptoms and interventions for home care patients with Alzheimer's Disease and related dementias: A natural language processing study",10219952,R21AG065753,"['Address', 'Admission activity', 'Affect', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease patient', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Ambulatory Care', 'Assessment tool', 'Awareness', 'Care given by nurses', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Nursing', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Dehydration', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Documentation', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Family Caregiver', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Home Care Services', 'Home Health Care Agencies', 'Home environment', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical Care Team', 'Medicare claim', 'Medication Errors', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurobehavioral Manifestations', 'New York', 'Nurses', 'Nursing Homes', 'Nursing Services', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Quality of Care', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Management', 'Services', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'United States', 'Urinary tract infection', 'Visiting Nurse', 'Work', 'aged', 'base', 'care coordination', 'care providers', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'ethnic diversity', 'experience', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'health care service', 'health care settings', 'hospice environment', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'longitudinal dataset', 'multiple chronic conditions', 'patient home care', 'patient subsets', 'racial and ethnic', 'study population', 'unstructured data']",NIA,VISITING NURSE SERVICE OF NEW YORK,R21,2021,213501
"Sarcopenia: computable phenotypes and clinical outcomes. PROJECT SUMMARY  Sarcopenia is a generalized muscle condition that develops with aging and complicates many common chronic diseases, resulting in low muscle mass, weakness, and impaired physical function. Sarcopenia contributes to disability, increased hospitalizations, healthcare costs, and risk of death. Despite being under- recognized clinically, sarcopenia is a major public health concern, with the worldwide prevalence projected to increase by up to 72% in the next 30 years. However, limited knowledge of sarcopenia among clinicians, combined with time pressures in clinical encounters delay its detection, and limit opportunity for intervention or recruitment into clinical trials. To overcome this barrier to detecting sarcopenia, we propose to use advanced big data and machine learning methods to identify additional component variables predicting sarcopenia among the rich electronic health record (EHR) data and develop a validated and portable sarcopenia computable phenotype (which uses a computer algorithm to detect patient characteristics or outcomes from the EHR). This innovative proposal takes advantage of key resources at Indiana University and its affiliation with the Regenstrief Institute and the Indiana Network for Patient Care (INPC), a statewide multi-health system clinical data warehouse including >100 healthcare entities and >18 million unique patients with both coded and text-based data, combined with the ability to perform comprehensive musculoskeletal measurements in the Musculoskeletal Function Imaging and Tissue (MSK-FIT) Core funded through a NIAMS Core Center for Clinical Research grant (P30AR072581). Our long-term goal is to accurately identify patients with, or at risk for, sarcopenia and its consequences in order to provide targeted interventions. We hypothesize that by using medical informatics and machine learning innovations, computable phenotypes can identify patients with sarcopenia from the EHR, predict deficits in measured muscle strength and physical function, and prospectively predict risk of hospitalization and death. In Aim 1, we will categorize >2000 adult participants in the MSK-FIT Core with accessible EHR data, as either sarcopenic or nonsarcopenic according to measurements of muscle strength, muscle mass and physical performance. We will then use 75% of the MSK- FIT Core cohort to train machine deep learning algorithms to detect combinations of variables from these subjects’ EHR predicting whether the patient is sarcopenic or not sarcopenic. The performance of the resulting computable phenotype will then be tested in the remaining 25% of the MSK-FIT Core participants. In Aim 2, we will test the performance of the sarcopenia computable phenotype to detect a clinically meaningful phenotype in the entire INPC adult population (>18 million), by evaluating the ability to predict the rate of hospitalizations and death among patients rated as sarcopenic versus matched controls. Such a computable phenotype will then enable large scale targeted recruitment, pragmatic clinical trials, clinical evaluation and intervention. PROJECT NARRATIVE Sarcopenia is a generalized muscle condition that develops with aging and complicates many common chronic diseases, resulting in low muscle mass, weakness, and impaired physical function, and contributing to disability, increased hospitalizations and risk of death.

"Role of State Medicaid Policies in Improving Access to Dental Care among Low-Income Adults PROJECT SUMMARY The purpose of this study is to examine how access to dental care among low-income adults is impacted by state Medicaid policies regarding eligibility, dental coverage, cost-sharing and dentist reimbursement. Oral health is integral to overall health, economic productivity and well-being. Yet access to dental care continues to be a major public health problem for low-income adults, leading to untreated disease, pain, poor systemic health and substantial economic burden. In recent years, several policy changes under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) such as Medicaid expansion and dependent care coverage could significantly impact access to dental care among the poor non-elderly adults. In addition, there is extensive cross-state variation in terms of dental benefits covered for Medicaid adults. These variations provide natural experiments to examine the effect of Medicaid policies on access to dental care. Moreover, under the current health reform discussions, state Medicaid programs are anticipated to gain autonomy in resource allocation, yet may receive significantly less federal funding, making the need for robust evidence on relative effectiveness of Medicaid policy alternatives available to the states paramount. The overarching goal of this application is to advance the research career of the candidate (Dr. Singhal) by protecting her time for training and research on these critical issues in oral health policy. This goal will be accomplished through additional training in complementary disciplines of econometrics and machine learning, and their application to estimate the impacts of Medicaid coverage and payment generosities on access to dental care. The project brings together complementary secondary data from multiple sources including: large national survey data (National Health Interview Survey), administrative enrollment and claims data (Medicaid Analytic eXtract) and linked survey and claims data. Leveraging these data and training resources, this project will: 1) develop synthetic indices of Medicaid dental coverage and payment generosities; 2) estimate the effect of each policy alternative and combined generosity indices on various measures of access to dental care; and 3) predict the relative effectiveness of policy alternatives and their combinations on access to dental care. We will use econometric methods including instrumental variables, difference-in-difference and regression discontinuity models to develop the generosity indices and to estimate the impact of Medicaid generosity. To develop and validate the predictive model, we will use supervised machine learning approaches (e.g. decision tree learning) using linked survey and claims data. The results will provide evidence needed to inform future strategies to ensure efficient use of health care resources to reduce oral health disparities. The completion of this project will also enable Dr. Singhal to establish a research program as an independent research investigator with support from her multi-disciplinary mentoring and advising teams and the vibrant research community at Boston University. PROJECT NARRATIVE Access to dental care is a major public health problem among low-income adults, as evidenced by declining rates of dental care utilization, high unmet dental need, and the increasing rate of emergency department visits for dental problems by this vulnerable population. The research plan of this career development award aims to: 1) examine how state Medicaid policies regarding eligibility, coverage and dentist reimbursement impact access to dental care among low-income adults, and 2) develop a model to predict the impact of hypothetical policy changes. A clearer understanding of the relative effectiveness of policy alternatives available to states is critical to ensuring the efficient use of healthcare resources and achieving NIDCR’s strategic goal to reduce income-based disparities in access to and outcomes of oral health care services.",Role of State Medicaid Policies in Improving Access to Dental Care among Low-Income Adults,10198898,K08DE027720,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affordable Care Act', 'Big Data', 'Boston', 'Caring', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Cost Control', 'Cost Sharing', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dental', 'Dental Care', 'Dental Health Services', 'Dentists', 'Development Plans', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Economic Burden', 'Economics', 'Effectiveness', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Emergency department visit', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Expenditure', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Reform', 'Health Policy', 'Health Services', 'Health Services Research', 'Healthcare', 'Improve Access', 'Income', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Low Income Population', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medicaid', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Health Interview Survey', 'National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research', 'Natural experiment', 'Oral health', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Production', 'Productivity', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Public Policy', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Allocation', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'cost', 'decision tree learning', 'design', 'disparity reduction', 'econometrics', 'evidence base', 'health care service', 'health disparity', 'health economics', 'improved', 'indexing', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple data sources', 'payment', 'population health', 'population survey', 'predictive modeling', 'pressure', 'programs', 'relative effectiveness', 'supervised learning']",NIDCR,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,K08,2021,130317
"An Interoperable HL7 FHIR-based Medical Device Data System (MDDS) For Accessing And Integrating Live Point-Of-Care Data From High-Acuity Bedside Patient Monitoring Equipment Abstract The overall goal of this proposal is to combine expertise and approaches from biomedical engineering and critical care medicine to design a universal system to acquire, record and transmit physiological signals from bedside monitored patients. Patient monitors generate over a million datapoints of information per hour, however, only a tiny fraction of those data are transmitted or recorded. In order to improve data exchange in healthcare, the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard was published in 2014. However, it has yet to make a significant impact on Medical Device Integration (MDI), which is the process of automating the flow of clinical data from bedside medical devices, such as patient monitors, to external systems such as Electronic Medical Records (EMR). Also, MDI is a complex task because data from these devices are high-frequency and high- volume and because most devices use proprietary protocols and outdated interfaces such as serial cables. Hospitals and researchers have therefore been left with few options except to use expensive and vendor-specific MDI solutions to access these data or to use manual data entry into the patient EMR, which leads to data entry errors, late entry of data, and lost time for clinical care. Manual data entry only captures a tiny fraction of the available data, and with increased research interest in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning, there is a growing need for a standardized way to access the vast amounts of data from bedside devices. This project will develop a vendor-neutral software-based Medical Device Data System (MDDS) that acquires and records data from bedside devices across a hospital network and makes live data available to 3rd party systems using a FHIR application programming interface (API). The proposed proof-of-concept will consist of three elements: [i] a transmitter which encrypts and transmits patient signals across the network, [ii] an aggregator which receives, translates and records the signals to a central location, and [iii] a FHIR Server with API for allowing external systems to access live data as FHIR resources. This proposal seeks to create a novel design that will overcome a critical barrier in healthcare, medicine and research. The proposed MDDS will be valuable to hospitals, clinicians, researchers and app developers because it makes data accessible which were previously only available to clinicians at the bedside in real-time. Narrative MediCollector’s proposed vendor-neutral medical device data system (MDDS) will be a valuable research tool to access, acquire and record high-frequency bedside patient monitor data for facilitating clinical research in hospitals. In addition, it will make live patient monitor data accessible to external systems through an HL7 FHIR application programming interface (API), thereby improving interoperability in hospitals and opening the doors to the integration of live data into external systems, such as smartphone apps and artificial intelligence algorithms, which can improve clinical workflow and healthcare in general.",An Interoperable HL7 FHIR-based Medical Device Data System (MDDS) For Accessing And Integrating Live Point-Of-Care Data From High-Acuity Bedside Patient Monitoring Equipment,10353084,R43EB030890,"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Elements', 'Equipment', 'Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Information Systems', 'Left', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical Device', 'Medicine', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Signal Transduction', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Vendor', 'application programming interface', 'base', 'clinical care', 'data access', 'data exchange', 'design', 'encryption', 'improved', 'intelligent algorithm', 'interest', 'interoperability', 'novel', 'point of care', 'smartphone Application', 'tool']",NIBIB,"MEDICOLLECTOR, LLC",R43,2021,40963
"Big Data Methods for Comprehensive Similarity based Risk Prediction Project Summary Electronic health records (EHR) provide rich source of data about representative populations and are yet to be fully utilized to enhance clinical decision-making. Conventional approaches in clinical decision-making start with the identification of relevant biomarkers based on subject-matter knowledge, followed by detailed but limited analysis using these biomarkers exclusively. As the current scientific literature indicates, many human disorders share a complex etiological basis and exhibit correlated disease progression. Therefore, it is desirable to use comprehensive patient data for patient similarity. This proposal focuses on deriving a comprehensive and integrated score of patient similarity from complete patient characteristics currently available, including but not limited to 1) demographic similarity; 2) genetic similarity; 3) clinical phenotype similarity; 4) treatment similarity; and 5) exposome similarity (here exposome defined as all available attributes of the living environment an individual is exposed to), when some of the aspects may overlap and interact. We will optimize information fusion and task-dependent feature selection for assessing patient similarity for clinical risk prediction. Since currently there does not exist a pipeline that is able to extract executable complete patient determinant data, to achieve the research goal described above, we propose first deliver an open- source data preparation pipeline that is based on a widely used clinical data standard, the OMOP (Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership) Common Data Model (CMD) version 5.2. Moreover, to mitigate common missingness and sparsity challenges in clinical data, we describe the first attempt to represent patients' sparse clinical information with missingness, including diagnosis information, medication data, treatment intervention, with a fixed-length feature vector (i.e. the Patient2Vec). This project has four specific aims. Aim 1 is to develop a clinical data processing pipeline for harmonizing patient information from multiple sources into a standards-based uniformed data representation and to evaluate its efficiency, interoperability, and accuracy. Aim 2 is to leverage a powerful machine learning technique, Document2Vec, from the natural language processing literature, to create an open-source Patient2Vec framework for the derivation of informative numerical representations of patients. Aim 3 is to develop a unified machine learning clinical- outcome-prediction framework for Optimized Patient Similarity Fusion (OptPSF) that integrates traditional medical covariates with the derived numerical patient representations from Patient2Vec (Aim 2) for improved clinical risk prediction. Aim 4 is to evaluate our similarity framework for predicting 1) the risk of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) in general EHR patient population and 2) the risk of death among patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). The project focus on developing a novel data science pipeline which includes a clinical data processing pipeline to format comprehensive patient health determinants from a variety of sources of clinical, genomic, socioenvironmental data, and a clinical-outcome-prediction framework that optimally fuses relevant patient health determinants to define patient similarity for improved clinical risk predictions.",Big Data Methods for Comprehensive Similarity based Risk Prediction,10087958,R01LM013061,"['Address', 'Automation', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Biometry', 'Case Study', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Science', 'Derivation procedure', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Electronic Health Record', 'End stage renal failure', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Professional', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Length', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Social Environment', 'Source', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical risk', 'data analysis pipeline', 'data modeling', 'data standards', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'feature selection', 'health data', 'improved', 'interoperability', 'mortality risk', 'novel', 'open data', 'open source', 'outcome prediction', 'patient health information', 'patient population', 'precision medicine', 'predict clinical outcome', 'risk prediction', 'socioeconomics', 'support tools', 'vector']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2021,455669
"Improving risk prediction of adverse outcomes in hemodialysis patients by incorporating non-traditional risk factors PROJECT SUMMARY: Candidate: The primary objective of this application is to support Dr. Lili Chan's career development into an independently funded clinical investigator leveraging electronic health records (EHR) and improve risk prediction of adverse outcomes in patients on hemodialysis (HD) by incorporating social determinants of health. To accomplish this goal, Dr. Chan has assembled a multidisciplinary mentoring and advisory team lead by Dr. Steven Coca, Associate Professor of Medicine and Director of Clinical Research in Nephrology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, and co-mentor Dr. Peter Kotanko, Adjunct Professor of Medicine at Mount Sinai and Research Director of the Renal Research Institute. Her advisory team consists of Dr. Weng, an expert and in machine learning and natural language processing (NLP), Dr. Alex Federman, who has contributed significantly to the literature on the effects of psychosocial factors on patient care, and Dr. Mazumdar, an expert in biostatistics and risk prediction modeling. Dr. Chan's proposed training plan focuses on four areas, (1) advanced statistical methodology; (2) bioinformatics; (3) patient centered outcomes; and (4) career development. Environment: The Icahn school of Medicine at Mount Sinai is a national leader in research. Specifically the Division of Nephrology has over 30 funded investigators and has successfully mentored five faculty members from K awards to R01 awards. Research: Given the high morbidity and mortality of HD patients, there is a critical need for better risk stratification and identification of high risk groups in order for targeted interventions to be tested. This project utilizes prospectively collected surveys and retrospective chart review of a cohort of diverse patients on chronic HD who receive care from four Renal Research Institute and six Mount Sinai Health System hemodialysis units located throughout New York City. The Specific Aims of the research are: (1) to determine the association between domains of social determinants of health and hospitalizations using survey research methods; (2) to identify social determinants of health in an accurate manner using natural processing language; and (3) to create risk prediction models for hospitalization among patients on HD utilizing both standard measures and social determinants of health using standard statistical methods and machine learning. This research leverages novel computational methods to examine the association of social determinants of health and hospitalizations in HD patients and incorporates SDOH into risk prediction models which will allow for identification of high risk HD patients for inclusion in future intervention trials. The results of this proposal sets the foundation for future R01 studies validating these findings in external data sets and testing the utility of EHR integrated clinical decision tools on reducing hospitalizations, readmissions, and mortality. PROJECT NARRATIVE Patients on hemodialysis have high rates of hospitalizations. Yet, social determinants of health (economic instability, education, neighborhood and built environment, social and community context, and health and healthcare access), which have previously been demonstrated to be associated with hospitalization in hemodialysis patients, are not easily identified and used in research. We plan to identify these factors using prospective surveys and natural language processing software on electronic health records, where these factors are routinely documented, and add these factors to standard clinical factors in complex machine learning models to identify patients at higher risk for hospitalization, and in the process train Dr. Lili Chan into an independent clinical investigator in the field of “big data” research in nephrology.",Improving risk prediction of adverse outcomes in hemodialysis patients by incorporating non-traditional risk factors,10127066,K23DK124645,"['Advisory Committees', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Algorithms', 'Appointment', 'Area', 'Award', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biometry', 'Blood Vessels', 'Caring', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Coca', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Element', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Economics', 'Education', 'Electronic Health Record', 'End stage renal failure', 'Environment', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Hemodialysis', 'Hospitalization', 'International Classification of Disease Codes', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neighborhoods', 'Nephrology', 'New York City', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Polypharmacy', 'Population', 'Process', 'Psychosocial Factor', 'Quality of life', 'Reference Standards', 'Research', 'Research Institute', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Self Care', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum Albumin', 'Social Identification', 'Social support', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transportation', 'Treatment/Psychosocial Effects', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'built environment', 'career development', 'cohort', 'data standards', 'discrete data', 'electronic structure', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'health care availability', 'health data', 'health economics', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'hospital readmission', 'hospitalization rates', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'machine learning method', 'medical schools', 'member', 'mid-career faculty', 'mortality', 'multidimensional data', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'prediction algorithm', 'professor', 'prospective', 'risk prediction', 'risk prediction model', 'risk stratification', 'social', 'social health determinants', 'social relationships', 'standard measure', 'tool']",NIDDK,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,K23,2021,191778
"Studying exceptional treatment non-responders and genetics to predict treatment response in rheumatoid arthritis PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT A major challenge in caring for patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is determining the optimal therapy. Several effective biologic disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) are available for RA, reflecting both advances in therapy, and the heterogeneity of RA; subsets of patients respond while others do not. Prior studies focused on patients with a good response to tumor necrosis factor inhibitor (TNFi), the most common bDMARD, with limited success in finding predictors that can be used in clinical care. This proposal seeks to address that gap in knowledge by taking a different direction. The objective of this study is to focus on exceptional bDMARD non-responders, defining and characterizing patients who have been on ≥3 classes of bDMARDs for RA. We will test whether data available in clinical electronic health record data (EHR) or genomic data can identify exceptional non-responders from TNFi responders. In Aim 1, we leverage data from an EHR cohort of ~16K RA patients to determine clinical factors associated with exceptional non-response using traditional epidemiologic approaches. As well, we will apply approaches using machine learning and topic modeling that will enable us to evaluate the predictiveness of a broader range of features. Examples of features include billing codes, prescriptions, and medical concepts extracted from text notes using natural language processing. In Aim 2, we will test whether RA genetic risk factors available in a subset of patients in Aim 1, and those of other inflammatory arthritides, e.g. axial spondyloarthropathy, can predict exceptional non- response to bDMARD therapy. As part of aim 2, we will also incorporate any predictive clinical factors identified in Aim 1 through the traditional or topic modeling approach. The overarching hypothesis is that the exceptional non-responders may be less “RA-like” than patients who respond to TNFi, with fewer RA genetic risk alleles and classic RA features from the narrative notes. This definition provides a new way to sub- phenotype RA, focusing on those that will have a poor response to therapy. This study is significant because a screen will be helpful not only in the clinic but can also identify patients to target for future studies of novel drug targets. This approach is innovative because it considers contemporary data where patients now have more “opportunity” to fail 3 classes of bDMARDs, where in the past there were only a limited number available. These data will be examined both using traditional epidemiologic models and newer approaches such as topic modeling that can integrate a broader range of data types. Finally, this proposal is designed to anticipate a time when patients will come for their visit with genetic data as part of their medical record. PROJECT NARRATIVE Rheumatoid arthritis is the most common autoimmune joint disease worldwide. In line with NIAMS’ mission to conduct research in the treatment of arthritis, this proposal will investigate approaches using recent data and state-of-the-art approaches to improve RA management. In this proposal, we will define the poorly understood subgroup of RA patients where multiple therapies have been ineffective, enabling future studies to expand our understanding of inflammatory arthritis, and to inform discovery of novel treatment targets.",Studying exceptional treatment non-responders and genetics to predict treatment response in rheumatoid arthritis,10301407,R21AR078339,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Antirheumatic Agents', 'Arthritis', 'Autoimmune Process', 'Biological', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Cohort Studies', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Disease-Modifying Second-Line Drugs', 'Drug Costs', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiology', 'Future', 'Gene Cluster', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Models', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genotype', 'Heterogeneity', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Arthritis', 'Insurance', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medical Records', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Risk-Taking', 'Spondylarthropathies', 'Subgroup', 'TNF gene', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Visit', 'arthropathies', 'base', 'biobank', 'clinical care', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'cost', 'demographics', 'design', 'electronic data', 'electronic structure', 'epidemiological model', 'epidemiology study', 'follow-up', 'genetic predictors', 'genetic risk factor', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'infection risk', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'joint inflammation', 'new therapeutic target', 'non-drug', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'optimal treatments', 'patient screening', 'patient subsets', 'predicting response', 'response', 'risk variant', 'small molecule', 'success', 'supervised learning', 'treatment response']",NIAMS,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R21,2021,251507
"Evaluating and Improving Utilization of Evidence-Based Medical Therapy in Patients with Heart Failure using Automated Tools in the Electronic Health Record PROJECT SUMMARY Heart failure (HF) affects over 6 million US adults, with high rates of hospitalization and nearly 50% mortality at 5 years from diagnosis. Nearly half of these patients have systolic HF with multiple evidence-based therapeutic options proven to reduce the risk of hospitalization and mortality in this subgroup of patients. Evaluating the appropriate utilization of these therapies is currently limited to post-hoc assessments of manually abstracted patient records at a limited number of hospitals participating in quality improvement registries. These manual abstraction strategies do not offer opportunities to improve care in real-time, and even at hospitals engaged in quality improvement efforts, only 1 in 5 of eligible patients with HF receive all first-line evidence based medical treatments. In this patient-oriented mentored career development award proposal, Dr. Rohan Khera proposes to leverage the ubiquitous digitization of medical records in the electronic health record (EHR) to address the adequate utilization of evidence based medical therapy in HF. He proposes to use a large, publicly accessible, deidentified EHR database to develop and validate an algorithm that uses deep learning based natural language processing (NLP) within unstructured clinical documentation for hospitalized HF patients to identify those with systolic HF (Aim #1). He will engage clinicians to design consensus-based algorithms to identify contraindications to HF treatments, developed as algorithms within the EHR (Aim #2). Finally, he will construct a prototypic clinical decision support (CDS) tool identifying HF treatment eligibility in real-time using the algorithms and evaluate potential implementation strategies using qualitative evaluation of feedback from clinicians and patients (Aim #3). While proposed as a strategy to evaluate quality of care of individual patients, the proposed research will also model a fully automated electronic clinical quality measure for HF. The algorithms will be made open source to allow institutions to validate and apply them to their individual care setting. The proposal is supported by strong mentorship from experts in quality measure design, informatics, advanced NLP, CDS design, and qualitative research methodology. The facilities at Yale Center of Outcomes Research and Evaluation, which designs and evaluates national quality measures, and has access to computational resources required to accomplish the research goals as well as to the Yale EHR to validate the models are major strengths of the application. The proposed period of mentored research will support Dr. Khera’s training in medical informatics, advanced analytic tools such as NLP, and qualitative research methodology. The experience and skillset acquired during this period will support Dr. Khera’s transition to independence where he plans to lead multi-institutional collaboratives to evaluate the use of automated tools in the measurement and improvement of the quality of medical care in HF. The career development plan that accompanies the proposal is designed to support Dr. Khera’s long-term career goal to be a national leader in the design and implementation of informatics- based approaches of delivering high quality, patient-centered, cardiovascular care. PROJECT NARRATIVE The scope of quality improvement programs that focus on improving the utilization of first-line evidence-based medical therapies in patients with heart failure is limited by mechanisms to identify those who are eligible for specific treatments. The current proposal aims to design automated tools to identify patients eligible for heart failure therapies using various data components already captured in the electronic health record in hospitalized patients. The proposal will then pilot test strategies of improving treatment utilization with electronic alerts delivered to clinicians based on these tools.",Evaluating and Improving Utilization of Evidence-Based Medical Therapy in Patients with Heart Failure using Automated Tools in the Electronic Health Record,10214973,K23HL153775,"['Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Address', 'Adrenergic beta-Antagonists', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithm Design', 'Algorithms', 'Anaphylaxis', 'Angiotensin Receptor', 'Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Angiotensins', 'Automated Clinical Decision Support', 'Automation', 'Bradycardia', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Consensus', 'Coughing', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Documentation', 'Echocardiography', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Feedback', 'Focus Groups', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Healthcare', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Intensive Care', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Low Cardiac Output', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical History', 'Medical Informatics', 'Medical Records', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Mineralocorticoid Receptor', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neprilysin', 'Outcomes Research', 'Outpatients', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Qualitative Evaluations', 'Qualitative Research', 'Quality of Care', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Systolic heart failure', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Failure', 'Validation', 'Ventricular', 'advanced analytics', 'analytical tool', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'care delivery', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision support', 'computing resources', 'deep learning', 'design', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'health data', 'hospitalization rates', 'hyperkalemia', 'implementation strategy', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'mortality', 'open source', 'patient oriented', 'patient subsets', 'point of care', 'programs', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'structured data', 'support tools', 'time use', 'tool']",NHLBI,YALE UNIVERSITY,K23,2021,193510
"Biomedical Informatics Tools for Applied Perioperative Physiology Project Summary / Abstract Even though US hospitals have widely adopted electronic health record (EHR) documentation of patient care, interoperability of these systems remains an issue, leading to challenges in data integration. In the operating room (OR) setting, during surgery, physiological waveforms (arterial pressure, EKG, SpO2, central venous pressure, etc.) represent a large source of information used by clinical monitors to extract and display information in order for healthcare providers to make clinical decisions. Integration and synchronization of high-quality EHR and physiological waveform data in large datasets of surgical patients would allow machine learning and deep learning approaches to plumb these datasets for clinically relevant signatures that would promote advanced OR patient monitoring systems to define present state, predict state trajectory, suggest effective counter measures to minimize patients decompensated states, and define the usefulness and efficacy of new monitoring devices. The objective of this proposal is to focus the resources of an interdisciplinary team from academia (University of California Los Angeles (UCLA), University of California Irvine (UCI), and Carnegie Mellon University Computer Sciences), industry (Edwards Lifesciences Critical Care), and clinical medicine (anesthesiology, surgery, and critical care at UCLA, UCI, Beth Israel, and University of Pittsburgh Medical Center) to create, develop, and organize large surgical datasets combining EHR and high fidelity physiological waveform data, to make these datasets freely accessible, and to develop new predictive/forecasting monitoring systems for the surgical patients. The study will begin with the development of a machine learning algorithm to predict cardiovascular collapse during surgery. This algorithm development will be based on physiological signatures predictive of cardiovascular collapse identified in the animal models of shock. The study hypothesis is that the combination of two separate OR databases containing EHR and physiological waveforms will allow for training and development of monitoring solutions, predictive and/or prescriptive analytics tools, clinical decision support, and validate them on an independent, external validation database. The surgical setting is relevant because although 5.7 million Americans are admitted annually to an Intensive Care Unit, more than 50 million undergo surgery. OR databases are unique in medicine because: 1) Changes occur quickly and the lead-time before an event is compressed; 2) Knowledge of baseline/pre-stress status of surgical patients allows normalization, calibration, and markedly enhances prediction; 3) Continuous and immediate presence of dense skilled acute care practitioners allows faster implementation of complex treatment algorithms in the OR; and 4) Defined stages, procedures, and stressors allow building large common relational database registries. By helping to focus the provider's attention on significant events and changes in the patient's state and by suggesting physiological interpretations of that state, such systems will permit early detection of complex problems and provide guidance on therapeutic interventions improving patient outcomes. Project Narrative The objective of this proposal is to focus the resources of an interdisciplinary team from academia (University of California Los Angeles (UCLA), University of California Irvine (UCI), and Carnegie Mellon University Computer Sciences), industry (Edwards Lifesciences Critical Care), and clinical medicine (anesthesiology, surgery, and critical care at UCLA, UCI, Beth Israel, and University of Pittsburgh Medical Center) to create, develop, and organize large surgical datasets combining electronic health record and high-fidelity physiological waveform data, to make these datasets freely accessible, and to develop new predictive/forecasting monitoring systems for the surgical patients. We hypothesize that the combination of two separate OR databases containing electronic health record and physiological waveforms will allow us and other investigators to train and develop monitoring solutions, predictive and/or prescriptive analytics tools, clinical decision support, and validate them on an independent, external validation database.

"ACILIA will be a low-cost kit with SaaS platform that integrates an embodied conversational agent using AI capabilities to provide educational information and emotional coping support PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Currently, 5.7 million people live with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia (ADRD) in the United States, and this number is projected to reach 13.8 million by 2050. Two-thirds of individuals with ADRD live at home and as a result, approximately 15 million unpaid care partners, mostly family members, are increasingly required to perform complex tasks which causes them significant stress. The major contributors to care partners’ stress are: 1) having low confidence in their competency in their caregiving tasks, such as managing activities of daily living (ADLs), instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs) and behavioral symptoms of ADRD as they change over the course of the disease and 2) being socially isolated with feelings of loneliness. Benten proposes to address these problems through creation of the Avatar Companion to Improve the Lives of Informal care partners of individuals with Alzheimer’s (ACILIA), a home kit with SaaS platform that integrates an embodied conversational agent using AI capabilities (i.e., emotion analysis, sentiment analysis and life-long machine learning [L3] algorithm), with home speakers, a smart watch, and mobile app, to support the CPs on the care journey. ACILIA will provide just-in--time guidance and support to care partners in addition to stage- appropriate education and training on how to manage caregiving tasks. It will also engage in natural conversations with the care partners detecting sentiments of stress and offering advice and support and connection to a virtual community. ACILIA aims to assist in reducing the family care partners’ stress levels by improving their competency and capabilities in providing care and by providing companionship and support, which will reflect positively on their quality of life and that of their loved ones living with ADRD and aging in place. During this Phase I project, we will develop of a prototype ACILIA using input from an advisory board of informal care partners and people living with ADRD. We will also conduct a pilot test for feasibility of ACILIA among 20 individuals who are in early-middle stage ADRD and their informal care partners to evaluate the usability and acceptance of ACILIA prototype. Successful completion of Phase I will lead to Phase II and evaluating its outcomes. improving informal care partners’ competency, reducing their feeling of loneliness, and reducing their stress levels in an adequately powered randomized controlled trial (RCT). PROJECT NARRATIVE User-centered design and pilot testing conducted for the Phase 1 development of ACILIA will make it possible to evaluate the feasibility of ACILIA to support informal care partners of PLWAD in their care efforts. In the long-term, Benten envisions ACILIA becoming a valuable tool for informal care partners, enabling them to perform their caregiving tasks more effectively by delivering just-in-time stage-appropriate training and stress- reduction support, and offering companionship throughout the journey of providing dementia care.",ACILIA will be a low-cost kit with SaaS platform that integrates an embodied conversational agent using AI capabilities to provide educational information and emotional coping support,10250533,R43AG069659,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Anger', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavioral Symptoms', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Chicago', 'Communities', 'Companions', 'Competence', 'Complex', 'Consultations', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Education', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Feeling', 'Frustration', 'Home environment', 'Illinois', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Loneliness', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Research', 'Role', 'Services', 'Social isolation', 'Stress', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Support', 'Training and Education', 'United States', 'Universities', 'aging in place', 'base', 'care burden', 'caregiving', 'coping', 'cost', 'dementia care', 'design', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'feasibility testing', 'improved', 'informal care', 'informal support', 'innovation', 'instrumental activity of daily living', 'loved ones', 'member', 'mindfulness-based stress reduction', 'mobile application', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'online community', 'prototype', 'smart watch', 'social', 'stress reduction', 'tool', 'usability', 'user centered design']",NIA,"BENTEN TECHNOLOGIES, INC.",R43,2021,196867
"Machine Learning of Physiological Waveforms and Electronic Health Record Data to Predict, Diagnose, and Treat Hemodynamic Instability in Surgical Patients Project Summary / Abstract If one could accurately predict who, when and why patients develop cardiorespiratory instability (CRI) during surgery, then effective preemptive treatments could be given to improve postoperative outcome and more effectively use healthcare resources. But signs of shock often occur late once organ injury is already present. The goal of this proposal is to develop, validate, and test real-time intraoperative risk prediction tools based on electronic health record (EHR) data and high-fidelity physiological waveforms to predict CRI and make the databases of intraoperative data and waveforms used for these developments freely accessible. This is extremely relevant because although 5.7 million Americans are admitted to an Intensive Care Units (ICU) in one year, more than 42 millions undergo surgery annually. Previous and ongoing studies conducted in the ICU and in the step down unit have built the architecture to collect real-time high-fidelity physiological waveform data streams and integrate them with patient demographics from the EHR to build large data sets, and derive actionable fused parameters based on machine learning (ML) analytics as well as display information in real time at the bedside to drive clinical decision support (CDS) in the critical care setting. The goal of this proposal is to apply these ML approaches to the complex and time compressed environment of high-risk surgery where greater patient and disease variability exist and shorter period of time is available to deliver truly personalized medicine approaches. The work will be initiated using an already existing annotated intraoperative database from the University of California Irvine including EHR and high-fidelity waveform data. This operating room database already exists and needs only to be extracted. This data will be used for the initial training and development of the ML model that will then be tested on prospectively collected University of California Los Angeles and University of Pittsburgh Medical Center databases. Simultaneously, this approach will use existing knowledge of CRI patterns derived from previous step down unit / intensive care unit cohorts, MIMIC II data, University of California Irvine data, and animal studies to create smart alarms and graphic user interface for clinical decision support based on functional hemodynamic monitoring principles. The next step will then leverage the focus on the issues and strengths of the intraoperative environment, some of which can be listed as: 1) Known patients characteristics before surgery to define pre-stress baseline, allowing functional hemodynamic monitoring stress evaluations, preconditioning, and other preoperative calibrations, 2) High degree of direct observation and data density during most phases of surgery allowing close semi-autonomous monitoring and titration of novel treatment algorithms early, 3) Defined stages in the initial part of surgery (induction, intubation, skin incision) allowing ML approaches to build large common relational database registries, and 4) Defined surgical procedure and stressors (anesthesia induction, intra-abdominal air insufflation, and other surgery-specific interventions), which will alter the impact of CRI on measured variables. Project Narrative The purpose of this study is to first develop multivariable models through data-driven classification techniques to predict parsimoniously cardiorespiratory instability, etiology and response to treatment in patients undergoing high-risk surgery. Using high-fidelity intraoperative physiological waveform data augmented with extensive electronic health record derived annotation and applying machine learning approaches we will characterize and quantify common patterns in subjects destined to develop cardiorespiratory instability during high-risk surgery. We will use these inputs in simulated real-time bedside management to develop an iteratively designed prototype clinical decision support system suitable for intraoperative care.","Machine Learning of Physiological Waveforms and Electronic Health Record Data to Predict, Diagnose, and Treat Hemodynamic Instability in Surgical Patients",10086996,R01HL144692,"['Acute', 'Adopted', 'Air', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anesthesia procedures', 'Animals', 'Architecture', 'Calibration', 'California', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Homeostasis', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hospitals', 'Hypotension', 'Insufflation', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Intra-abdominal', 'Intraoperative Care', 'Intraoperative Period', 'Intubation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Operating Rooms', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perioperative', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Postoperative Complications', 'Postoperative Period', 'Process', 'Recommendation', 'Registries', 'Resources', 'Resuscitation', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Shock', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin', 'Specificity', 'Stress', 'Surgical incisions', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Titrations', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'data integration', 'data streams', 'data structure', 'database structure', 'deep neural network', 'demographics', 'density', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'electronic data', 'graphical user interface', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'information display', 'insight', 'interoperability', 'iterative design', 'large datasets', 'machine learning algorithm', 'model development', 'mortality', 'neural network algorithm', 'novel', 'organ injury', 'patient population', 'personalized medicine', 'preconditioning', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'pressure', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'relational database', 'response', 'risk prediction', 'simulation environment', 'stressor', 'support tools', 'surgical risk', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2021,734363
"Development of an automated healthcare system for effective management of patients with chronic diseases. PROJECT SUMMARY Care delivery at primary and urgent clinics is critically hindered by doctor shortage, time constraints and the inappropriate use of infrastructures. The rising aging population and unhealthy lifestyle are expected to drive the increase of chronic disease and the national health expenditures associated (20% of the U.S. gross domestic product by 2025). Telemedicine has been proposed as a possible solution to reduce the cost of access to care minimizing the dependence of patients on health professionals. However, current solutions that connect patients with doctors don’t allow accurate diagnosis due to the lack or inappropriate use of medical devices. AdviNOW proposes to implement computer vision to offer a clinically reliable approach to perform self- evaluation of vital parameters. AdviNOW is developing the first Augmented Reality (AR) algorithms to guide any non-trained people to correct usage of Class 2 medical devices at the point of need. The new approach will represent the core component of a novel clinical decision support system (CDSS) which will be integrated into telemedicine platforms, kiosks or any medical office to automate medical visits, improving the management of chronic diseases. In Phase I, we validated the feasibility of our product by developing a module for heart stethoscope exams. Users were able to autonomously take a phonocardiogram measurement in <8 seconds, while the system verified the correct use of the device. In this Phase II project, the additional modules required for a minimum viable product (MVP) with significant clinical and commercial impact will be developed. This will include modules for Respiratory Auscultation, Otoscopic Ear Examination, Mouth Examination, and temperature control. The developed modules will be then integrated within the current front-end structure. The MVP will be validated in a clinical setting, where its usability, benefits, and clinical effectiveness will be assessed. Additionally, the platform will be integrated with major providers of Electronic Health Records. At the end of this SBIR Phase II project, an MVP ready to enter the market will have been fully developed. Future R&D efforts of AdviNOW Medical will be aimed at the development of Artificial Intelligence based diagnosis of abnormal medical conditions from self-measured biometric parameters. The mission of AdviNOW Medical is to develop a disruptive solution for the delivery of healthcare that is safe, effective, timely, efficient, and available in centralized and decentralized locations. By reducing the time for routine analysis, the actual doctor-patient encounter will be more meaningful, improving the clinical outcome as well as patient satisfaction. This invention promises to disrupt healthcare, as providers will improve cost management and profitability by visiting more patients. PROJECT NARRATIVE New strategies for accurate and efficient delivery of healthcare to chronic disease patients are required. This project will develop the first Augmented Reality (AR) algorithms which will guide patients to use Class II medical devices for self-assessment of vital parameters to monitor the health status of chronic conditions. The project is expected to introduce a novel clinical decision support system (CDSS) to Primary and Urgent care clinics and remote settings to allow improved medical outcomes and cost management of chronic diseases.",Development of an automated healthcare system for effective management of patients with chronic diseases.,10139479,R44NR018631,"['Abdomen', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Augmented Reality', 'Auscultation', 'Automation', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Blood Pressure', 'Caring', 'Chest', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Client satisfaction', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical effectiveness', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Decentralization', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion', 'Drops', 'Ear', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Family member', 'Future', 'Health Expenditures', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Professional', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health Status', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Image', 'Infrastructure', 'Injectable', 'Location', 'Lung', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Assistance', 'Medical Device', 'Medical Records', 'Medicine', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Nose', 'Oral cavity', 'Otoscopes', 'Outcome', 'Oxygen', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharyngeal structure', 'Phase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Primary Health Care', 'Protocols documentation', 'Provider', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiratory Sounds', 'Self Assessment', 'Self-Examination', 'Site', 'Site Visit', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Stethoscopes', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Telemedicine', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Thermometers', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Weight', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'aging population', 'base', 'care delivery', 'clinical decision support', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'design', 'digital', 'health care delivery', 'health care quality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'invention', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'pressure', 'prevent', 'product development', 'research and development', 'respiratory', 'sound', 'support tools', 'tool', 'unhealthy lifestyle', 'urgent care', 'usability', 'volunteer']",NINR,"ADVINOW, INC.",R44,2021,776150
"Analyzing Online Reviews to Evaluate Quality of Care at Substance Use Disorder Treatment Facilities In the United States (US), an estimated 20 million adults have been diagnosed with substance use disorder (SUD). A major challenge for patients is to identify the most appropriate treatment with the best outcomes. Patients receive care in outpatient and inpatient facilities yet quality metrics at the level of these individual facilities are not publicly available.  In the era of digital data, the Internet and peer-to-peer resources are often the first place where individuals look to find information about healthcare resources. Online reviews on sites like Google and Yelp provide narratives about healthcare facilities and assign easily interpretable star ratings ranging from one to five stars. These reviews of healthcare facilities provide information about patient experience, structure (e.g. physical education) facility, organizational characteristics, payment methods), process (e.g. diagnosis, treatment, patient and outcomes (e.g. knowledge, health-related quality of life morbidity, mortality).  Prior work has demonstrated that online ratings of hospitals correlate with ratings from the national Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) survey. Little work however has evaluated the utility of unvalidated, spontaneously generated, but widely accessible online reviews of SUD treatment facilities. These reviews could fill a niche with providing patients and their family members with useful information about the questions and experiences that are most important to them. Or these reviews could be limited and provide misinformation or only biased perspectives. To date, less is known about the potential value or usefulness of this emerging data source.  For this proposal we aim to study online reviews of SUD treatment facilities in the US to identify the areas of care that are reported as most important to patients and family members. For Aim 1, we will first extract approximately 50,000 online reviews of SUD treatment facilities and code them for themes using qualitative methodologies that involve manual coding and big data analytics using machine learning and natural language processing. We hypothesize that these online narratives will include qualitative data about patient experience and the type and quality of care (e.g. evidence-based treatments) provided at SUD treatment facilities. For Aim 2, we will then assess how star ratings differentiate facilities relative to structure and process measures reported in the National Survey of Substance Abuse Treatment Services.  Overall, emerging online data resources have the potential to provide new information about a critically vulnerable population affected by the opioid and more broadly the SUD crisis. Our project seeks to rigorously study these new patient-centric data sources viewed by millions of individuals for the purposes of better understanding the needs of patients and family members. These efforts can lay the groundwork for future work in developing measures of quality for a critically important healthcare resource, SUD treatment facilities. Narrative We aim to evaluate narratives and star ratings from online reviews to assess how this consumer generated, data can inform our understanding of care delivery for substance use disorder (SUD). Identifying the themes and measures of quality revealed in these reviews and how they relate to traditional measures of quality could inform future development of patient centric performance measures and ratings for SUD treatment facilities.",Analyzing Online Reviews to Evaluate Quality of Care at Substance Use Disorder Treatment Facilities,10116356,R21DA050761,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Ambulatory Care', 'Area', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Drug Addiction', 'Equilibrium', 'Evidence based practice', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health care facility', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Misinformation', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nursing Homes', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Outpatients', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Physical Education', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Process Measure', 'Provider', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Quality of Care', 'Recovery', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Time', 'United States', 'Visit', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Work', 'base', 'care delivery', 'cost', 'data resource', 'digital', 'empowered', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'health related quality of life', 'improved', 'insight', 'medication-assisted treatment', 'mortality', 'opioid abuse', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid mortality', 'opioid use disorder', 'patient engagement', 'payment', 'peer', 'satisfaction', 'substance abuse treatment', 'treatment center', 'treatment program', 'treatment services', 'urgent care', 'web site']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R21,2021,202917
"Harnessing the power of CTSA-CDRN data networks: Using social determinants of health, frailty and functional status to identify at-risk patients and improve risk adjustment Postoperative complications and readmissions rates are higher in minority and low socioeconomic status (SES) patients. Low SES is associated with frailty, one of the best predictors of 30-day postoperative complications and early hospital readmission. Despite their influence on health outcomes, frailty and social risk factors are not considered in risk adjustment for reimbursement and quality measures. CMS developed financial incentive- based programs to improve quality of care. Yet this strategy disproportionately penalizes minority-serving, major teaching and safety net hospitals (SNH), further constraining resources for the care of vulnerable populations. Our long-term goal is to use frailty and social risk factors to identify at-risk patients to design more effective clinical care pathways. Frailty can be derived retrospectively using the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS NSQIP) dataset. Data networks are powerful research tools that can be used to answer important questions. However, extracting data from EHR is challenging. The Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) developed 13 Clinical Data Research Networks (CDRN) that have considerable overlapping membership with Clinical Translational Science Award (CTSA) institutions. While steady progress has been made, multiple barriers exist to efficiently access and use data. We will engage 3 CTSA hubs, each members of a different CDRN, to locally merge identified datasets developing data accessing and linking strategies at diverse institutions for dissemination across sites within CDRNs and to ultimately perform similar studies across CDRNs. We will use the SMART IRB reliance platform to harmonize the regulatory approval process as much as possible for each step of this project to identify barriers to use in data networks. We propose the following Aims: 1) Determine the predictive power of ethnicity, race, SES, and frailty for postoperative complications, mortality  and readmissions to improve risk adjustment at 3 CTSA/CDRNs 2) Estimate postoperative functional status using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning  algorithms on inpatient physical therapy (PT), occupational therapy (OT) and nursing notes for ACS NSQIP  patients to predict long-term functional status 3) Develop methods to predict long-term loss of independence after major surgery 4) Determine hospital resource utilization stratified by SES, frailty and minority status The significance of our study is the incorporation of social risk factors, frailty and functional status in risk adjustment forming the basis for future interventions by targeting patients at the highest risk for postoperative complications and reducing health care disparities. Our innovative approach harnesses data sources at diverse institutions with the goal of disseminating these methods across 3 CDRNs and the CTSA network. Project Narrative: Patients with social risk factors, including poverty, being a minority, lack of an education and frailty are all associated with having worse health outcomes and with more difficulties recovering after surgical procedures. Safety net hospitals take care of many people with social risk factors and are being judged on the quality of care provided without accounting for the challenges faced by poor people. We will study the effect of social risk factors and frailty on health outcomes after surgery to identify patients that would benefit from care pathways that help poor and/or frail people.","Harnessing the power of CTSA-CDRN data networks: Using social determinants of health, frailty and functional status to identify at-risk patients and improve risk adjustment",10199784,U01TR002393,"['Accounting', 'Agreement', 'Ambulatory Care Facilities', 'American', 'American College of Surgeons', 'Authorization documentation', 'Caring', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical and Translational Science Awards', 'Community Surveys', 'Costs and Benefits', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Education', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Fibrinogen', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hispanics', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Institution', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Occupational Therapy', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Physical therapy', 'Postoperative Complications', 'Postoperative Period', 'Poverty', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of Care', 'Race', 'Recovery of Function', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Institute', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Adjustment', 'Risk Factors', 'Site', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Testing', 'Text', 'United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'base', 'clinical care', 'cost effective', 'data access', 'design', 'electronic data', 'financial incentive', 'frailty', 'functional status', 'health care disparity', 'high risk', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'incentive program', 'innovation', 'low socioeconomic status', 'machine learning algorithm', 'member', 'mortality', 'outcome prediction', 'payment', 'postoperative recovery', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'readmission rates', 'safety net', 'simulation', 'social', 'social health determinants', 'tool', 'usability']",NCATS,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCIENCE CENTER,U01,2021,100000
"Developing scalable algorithms to incorporate unstructured electronic health records for causal inference based on real-world data Project Summary/Abstract The routine operation of the US Healthcare system produces an abundance of electronically-stored data that captures the care of patients as it is provided in settings outside of controlled research environments. The potential for utilizing these data to inform future treatment choices and improve patient care and outcomes of all patients in the very system that generates the data is widely acknowledged. Given these key properties of the routine-care data and the abundance of electronic healthcare databases covering millions of patients, it is critical to strengthen the rigor of analyses of such data. Our group has previously developed an analytic approach to reduce bias when analyzing routine-care databases, which has proven effective in more than 50 empirical research studies across a range of topics and data sources. However, this approach currently cannot incorporate free-text information that is recorded in electronic health records, such as clinical notes and reports. This limitation has left a large amount of rich patient information underutilized for clinical research. We thus aim to adapt and refine a set of established computerized natural language processing algorithms that can identify and extract useful information from the clinical notes and reports in electronic health records and incorporate them into our validated analytical approach for balancing background risks of different comparison groups, a key step to ensure fair evaluation when comparing different therapeutic options. To test this newly integrated and augmented approach, we will implement and adapt it in simulation studies where we can evaluate and improve the performance of these new analytic methods in a controlled but realistic fashion. In addition, we will assess the performance of our new approach in 8 practical studies comparing medical or surgical treatments that are highly relevant to patients. To ensure highest level of data completeness and quality, we have linked multiple healthcare utilization (claims) databases, spanning from 2007 to 2016, with 3 electronic health records systems, including one each in Massachusetts, North Carolina, and Texas. This data will allow testing of our newly integrated approach in a variety of care delivery systems and data environments, which will be very informative for the application of our products in the real-world settings. Narrative The project will yield a highly flexible and effective analytical method for reducing confounding bias in studies that utilize routine-care data to compare effects of medical or surgical treatments. This method will enable researchers to leverage a large amount of patient information recorded in the clinical notes and reports that are contained within electronic health records to adjust for differences in background risks of different comparison groups. Our proposal can improve the quality of evidence based on electronic healthcare data generated in the routine-care settings to better inform patient care and optimal prescribing.",Developing scalable algorithms to incorporate unstructured electronic health records for causal inference based on real-world data,10168610,R01LM013204,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Cohort Studies', 'Comparative Effectiveness Research', 'Complex', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Data Store', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Elements', 'Empirical Research', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Influentials', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge acquisition', 'Left', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Massachusetts', 'Medical', 'Medicare/Medicaid', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'North Carolina', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Probability', 'Property', 'Proxy', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Semantics', 'Severities', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Stratification', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Text', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'care delivery', 'care outcomes', 'comparative effectiveness study', 'comparison group', 'computerized', 'cost', 'disorder risk', 'evidence base', 'flexibility', 'health care service utilization', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'novel strategies', 'operation', 'outcome forecast', 'preservation', 'randomized trial', 'research study', 'routine care', 'safety study', 'simulation', 'sound', 'tool', 'treatment choice', 'unstructured data']",NLM,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2021,469927
"Identifying Personalized Risk of Acute Kidney Injury with Machine Learning PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) is a common and highly lethal health problem, affecting 10-15% of all hospitalized patients and >50% of patients in intensive care units (ICUs). It has been shown that a small increase in serum creatinine (SCr) of ≥0.5 mg/dl was associated with a 6.5-fold increase in the odds of death, a 3.5-day increase in length of stay, and nearly $7,500 in excess hospital costs. Unfortunately, no specific treatment exists to cure AKI once it has developed. The ability to predict AKI in hospitalized patients would provide clinicians the opportunity to modify care pathways and implement interventions, which could in turn prevent AKI and yield better outcomes. Although electronic medical record (EMR) based monitoring systems for AKI have led to expedited interventions and may increase the percentage of patients returning to baseline kidney function, most of these systems are reactive rather than proactive, with little or no contribution to AKI prevention. Moreover, our current knowledge of AKI risk factors is far from complete, especially in the ICU and general inpatient populations, characterized by numerous deficiencies and systematic failings that may be avoidable To transform the reactive AKI care to proactive and personalized care, early identification of high risk patients and better understanding of individual modifiable risk factors for AKI is the key. In Aim 1, to discover novel risk factors predictive of AKI, we propose to develop an ensemble multi-view feature selection framework to simultaneously consider the differences and interrelations between feature spaces and obtain robust knowledge by synthesizing findings from diverse patient populations across multiple institutions in nine US states. In Aim 2, to discover general modifiable causes of AKI to help physicians design more effective AKI prevention policies, we propose to develop a novel multi-cause inference method to identify causal relationships between modifiable factors and AKI for susceptible patient subgroups. In Aim 3, to explain what caused AKI in individual patients to support physicians in designing personalized AKI intervention, we propose to develop a new causal explanation method by integrating causal inference and case based reasoning to quantify patient-level causal significance of modifiable factors. The proposed study will have a significant clinical impact by not only expanding the capacity of clinicians to identify high risk patients for AKI early and advancing the general knowledge on causal and modifiable risk factors for AKI but also supporting personalized AKI intervention with suggestions on potential patient-specific actionable items. The work will not only advance AKI but also the machine learning and clinical research informatics community and the methodology developed is generalizable to other clinical domains. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is to identify clinical risk factors of acute kidney injury (AKI) in hospitalized patients from electronic medical records (EMRs) with machine learning. AKI risk factors discovered from EMR of diverse populations from multiple institutions across nine US states will be reliable and robust and can assist clinicians in providing proactive and personalized care to high-risk patients.",Identifying Personalized Risk of Acute Kidney Injury with Machine Learning,10200790,R01DK116986,"['Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Creatinine', 'Data', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early identification', 'Elderly', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Geographic Locations', 'Geographic state', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hospitals', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Injury to Kidney', 'Inpatients', 'Institution', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Kidney', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Length of Stay', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Myocardial', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Physiology', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Predictive Factor', 'Renal function', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sepsis', 'Series', 'Serum', 'Suggestion', 'System', 'Time', 'Work', 'adjudication', 'base', 'case-based', 'clinical predictors', 'clinical risk', 'design', 'feature selection', 'heterogenous data', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'injury prevention', 'machine learning algorithm', 'modifiable risk', 'mortality risk', 'nephrotoxicity', 'novel', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'personalized care', 'prevent', 'risk prediction']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,506211
"Combining Systems Pharmacology Modeling With Machine Learning To Identify Sub-Populations At Risk Of Drug-Induced Torsades de Pointes Project Summary  Torsades de Pointes, a lethal ventricular arrhythmia, is a side effect of several commonly used antiarrhythmics, antibiotics, antipsychotics, antihistamines and other ‘non-cardiovascular’ therapies. Though this adverse event is rare, it can lead to ventricular fibrillation and sudden cardiac death. The ignorance about the underlying differences between those at high risk versus low risk of forming this drug-induced arrhythmia halts any considerable progress in preventing it. Rather than simply removing these drugs from the market, a closer examination of the physiological and clinical traits of patients who benefited from the treatment and those who formed the arrhythmia needs to be performed. This highlights the idea of precision medicine and the importance of identifying relevant sub-groups of patients likely to benefit from a treatment versus those who are highly susceptible to a drug-induced adverse event. The current standards for predicting risk, a lengthened action potential (AP) duration of cells and a prolonged QT interval on an echocardiogram (ECG) have proven ineffective. Thus, there is a need to extract pertinent information from the cellular and tissue levels before administration of the therapeutic to detect patterns only apparent in the high-risk population. To analyze this concept, I plan to (1) explain at a mechanistic level the differences between the healthy and at-risk patients, (2) identify important AP and ECG signatures that can predict risk early on, and (3) connect the physiological and clinical findings to improve the profile and description of the high-risk population. I will combine two complementary computational techniques: (1) simulations with mechanistic quantitative systems pharmacology models of heart cells and tissues; and (2) advanced machine learning approaches that can identify hidden patterns. Thus, this project aims to develop an algorithm which will improve risk prediction and upgrade the current imperfect and unreliable standards for prescribing proarrhythmic therapies. Project Narrative Current standards for identifying patients at risk of forming the rare but lethal ventricular tachycardia, Drug- induced Torsades de Pointes include measuring the QT interval on the electrocardiogram (ECG). Although this decently predicts susceptibility, there remains a percentage of patients who still succumb to an arrhythmia with a normal QT. To improve patient risk stratification, this research project aims to develop an algorithm that can unmask subtle precursors at both the physiological and clinical levels, classify high risk patients, and upgrade the current imperfect standards for prescribing these therapies.",Combining Systems Pharmacology Modeling With Machine Learning To Identify Sub-Populations At Risk Of Drug-Induced Torsades de Pointes,10082298,F31HL149358,"['Action Potentials', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Antibiotics', 'Antihistamines', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Arrhythmia', 'Biological Factors', 'Cardiac', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computational Technique', 'Consumption', 'Disease', 'Echocardiography', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Exposure to', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Ion Channel', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Muscle Cells', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Predisposition', 'Reporting', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Torsades de Pointes', 'Translating', 'Ventricular', 'Ventricular Arrhythmia', 'Ventricular Fibrillation', 'Ventricular Tachycardia', 'base', 'complex data', 'delayed rectifier potassium channel', 'drug market', 'efficacious treatment', 'experimental study', 'heart cell', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'insight', 'patient subsets', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'responders and non-responders', 'risk prediction', 'risk stratification', 'side effect', 'simulation', 'sudden cardiac death', 'supervised learning', 'trait']",NHLBI,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,F31,2021,44436
"Intention-aware Recommender System for Improving Trauma Resuscitation Outcomes PROJECT SUMMARY Critically injured patients have a four-fold higher risk of death from medical errors than other hospitalized patients, with nearly half of preventable deaths related to errors during the initial resuscitation phase. Although protocols, simulation, and leadership training improve team performance in this setting, as many as 12 protocol deviations per resuscitation have been observed, even with experienced teams. Given adverse outcomes that can result from performance gaps, there is a critical need to establish novel approaches for applying real-time decision support in critical-care settings. The long-term goal is to implement decision support for trauma resuscitation and other fast-paced, high-risk critical care settings that improves performance, reduces errors, and prevents adverse outcomes. The overall objective for this renewal is to vertically advance what was achieved during the first funding period by designing, implementing and testing an intention-aware recommender system that (1) recognizes and tracks current goals using sensor data, the output from patient monitors, and data captured from digital devices, (2) derives recommendations that support adherence to goal- based protocols, and (3) displays these recommendations in real time on wall displays. The central hypothesis is that decision support aligning with intentions (“intended” or “current” goals) will enhance protocol compliance, leading to improved outcomes related to trauma resuscitation. The rationale for this renewal is that recommendations supporting protocol compliance that are aligned with team intentions are more likely to be adopted by being less distracting and associated with lower cognitive load. Guided by preliminary data, the central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two specific aims: 1) design and implement an automated real- time approach for predicting and monitoring the assessment and treatment goals of trauma resuscitation; and 2) generate and display a recommended plan of activities that supports current goal pursuit during trauma resuscitation. For the first Aim, machine learning approaches will be applied for recognizing goals using data obtained from sensors and other digital data sources. Under the second Aim, a machine learning strategy will be implemented and tested that generates recommendations responsive to team intentions. The proposed research is innovative because it focuses on development of real-time methods that integrate goals as an input for making recommendations that meet the most current and relevant information needs. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to improve the care of severely injured and other critically ill patients by promoting timely and appropriate achievement of critical assessment and treatment goals in settings that remain at high-risk for medical errors. The results of this research continuum are expected to have an important positive impact on the outcome by addressing the mismatch between complex decision-making and human vulnerability to error that remain in critical care settings. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed project is relevant to public health because it focuses on the design and implementation of a novel real-time decision support system that will reduce errors associated with adverse patient outcomes by providing recommendations that support the current information needs of multidisciplinary trauma teams. The proposed project is relevant to the part of the NLM's mission related to development of biomedical communications systems, methods, and technologies, and information dissemination and utilization among health professionals.",Intention-aware Recommender System for Improving Trauma Resuscitation Outcomes,10163257,R01LM011834,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Area', 'Awareness', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Critical Care', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Failure', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health Professional', 'Hemorrhage', 'Human', 'Human Activities', 'Information Dissemination', 'Injury', 'Intention', 'Leadership', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical Errors', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multiple Trauma', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Progress Reports', 'Protocol Compliance', 'Protocols documentation', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Stream', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trauma', 'Variant', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'cognitive load', 'computerized', 'design', 'digital', 'disability', 'experience', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'learning strategy', 'member', 'mortality risk', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'preference', 'prevent', 'preventable death', 'radio frequency', 'sensor', 'severe injury', 'simulation', 'success']",NLM,CHILDREN'S RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2021,654500
"Data Driven Methods for Missing Data Imputation in Surgical Disparities Research Project Summary/Abstract Disparities in health and health care have been a longstanding challenge in the United States. One specific area of medical care in which racial/ethnic disparities have been identified is total joint arthroplasty (TJA), particularly total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and total hip arthroplasty (THA). Large, population based studies necessary to address healthcare disparities can be costly and difficult to perform, and may be compromised by sampling strategies and patient selection biases. Efficient alternatives are publicly-available nationally representative databases such as the HCUP State Inpatient Databases (SID) and National Inpatient Sample (NIS). The SID provide information on all patients admitted to hospitals within participating states, allowing for comparison of health care access among many vulnerable populations, across states, and over time. The NIS is the largest publicly-available all-payer inpatient health care database in the nation. It is sampled from the SID through a complex survey design, yielding national estimates of health care utilization, quality, and outcomes. A significant limitation of the NIS and the SID is the quantity of missing data. In particular, “patient race”, a key indicator for health disparities research, has a high proportion of missingness. Multiple imputation (MI) approaches have been increasingly popular for providing sound statistical methods to account for missing data. When conducting MI, it is suggested that imputation models be as general as data allow them to be, in order to accommodate a wide range of subsequent analyses of imputed data sets. This requires all relationships that are going to be investigated in any subsequent analysis, such as nonlinearities and interactions, to be included in the imputation model. Unfortunately, traditional MI methods, such as the multivariate imputation by chained equations (MICE), are built on parametric imputation models. These models are often not flexible enough to capture interactions and nonlinearities in high dimensional and large scale data settings. Unlike parametric models, machine learning techniques (MLTs) are model-free methods, and thus provide flexibility for missing data imputation. MLTs use algorithms that automatically and iteratively learn from all data to detect statistical dependencies in observations without being explicitly programmed where to look. The goal of this study is to make the two HCUP databases a more useful resource for the study of surgical disparities and other areas of medicine. Accordingly, we propose novel MI methods based on MLTs to impute missing data in the SID and the NIS, and to use the imputed datasets to measure racial disparity in TKA. Project Narrative It would be challenging to approach the goal of eliminating healthcare disparities without identifying disparities and analyzing the underlying causes using nationally representative databases such as the HCUP SID and NIS. This proposal imputes missing data for surgical disparities research using the two databases.",Data Driven Methods for Missing Data Imputation in Surgical Disparities Research,10199999,R01MD013901,"['Address', 'Area', 'Caring', 'Companions', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Decision Trees', 'Dependence', 'Discipline', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Equation', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Hybrids', 'Inpatients', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Length of Stay', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Research', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Musculoskeletal', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient Selection', 'Patients', 'Population Study', 'Race', 'Records', 'Replacement Arthroplasty', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Selection Bias', 'Statistical Methods', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'administrative database', 'autoencoder', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'cost', 'design', 'flexibility', 'health care availability', 'health care disparity', 'health care service utilization', 'health disparity', 'high dimensionality', 'hip replacement arthroplasty', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'innovation', 'knee replacement arthroplasty', 'large scale data', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'neural network', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'racial and ethnic disparities', 'racial disparity', 'random forest', 'simulation', 'software development', 'sound', 'success', 'surgery outcome', 'tool', 'underserved community', 'usability']",NIMHD,GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,241504
"Improving the measurement and analysis of long-term, patient-centered outcomes following acute respiratory failure PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This Pathway to Independence Award application is submitted by a pulmonary and critical care epidemiologist committed to improving the quality of patient-oriented research for patients experiencing acute respiratory failure (ARF). Worldwide, millions of patients develop ARF annually. In the U.S., nearly one million patients with ARF require mechanical ventilation annually, accounting for a quarter of all intensive care unit (ICU) admissions. As improvements in ICU care reduce such patients’ in-hospital mortality rates, attention has shifted to the challenges ARF survivors face in regaining their prior cognitive, physical, and psychosocial functioning. However, there is a key barrier for randomized clinical trials (RCTs) testing new interventions to improve ARF survivorship – that is, the current lack of an endpoint that (1) captures long-term patient dispositions, (2) incorporates patient preferences and perspectives, and (3) is able to be analyzed without concern for statistical biases. The overarching goal of this research is to support clinical innovation by developing new approaches to measure and report long-term patient-centered outcomes that overcome the methodological barriers currently limiting ARF RCTs. The applicant will accomplish his goals under the mentorship of established researchers in critical care, patient-centered outcomes research, statistics, and informatics to assure his transition to a tenure-track faculty position in the R00 phase and his emergence as a leading pulmonary and critical care epidemiologist. First, the applicant will use an innovative combination of qualitative and quantitative research methods to elicit and integrate ARF survivors’ and their caregivers’ perspectives into a new patient-centered, long-term composite outcome measure (K99 phase). During the R00 phase, the applicant will recruit ARF survivors to participate in a prospective cohort, and follow these patients to describe the burden of ARF survivorship over 1-year using the new endpoint developed during the K99 phase. This endeavor will also provide key data that will facilitate sample size calculations in future ARF RCTs. Data from this cohort will additionally be used to develop an electronic health record (EHR)-based algorithm to predict risks for adverse long-term outcomes among ARF patients early in their ICU stays. Thus, this K99/R00 will augment ARF research by establishing a new outcome measure anchored in patient perspectives, improving the understanding and clinical prognostication of post-ICU morbidity following ARF, and facilitate the efficiency and clinical relevance of future ARF RCTs by enabling measurement of patients’ baseline risks for different outcomes. Concurrently, the didactic work, individual study, and hands-on learning in mixed-methods research, natural language processing, and predictive analytics will fill key training gaps for the applicant, thereby positioning him for a successful, independently-funded research career advancing the science of outcomes measurement and analysis for ARF RCTs. PROJECT NARRATIVE Randomized trials testing strategies to improve long-term outcomes for survivors of acute respiratory failure (ARF) are hampered by the lack of valid, patient-centered endpoints. Using interviews with ARF survivors and their caregivers, statistical simulation, consensus building among stakeholders, and a prospective cohort study, the applicant will develop, describe the epidemiology of, and predict a new patient-oriented outcome that will support trials of innovative approaches to improve ARF survivorship outcomes.","Improving the measurement and analysis of long-term, patient-centered outcomes following acute respiratory failure",10064003,R00HL141678,"['Accounting', 'Acute respiratory failure', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Competence', 'Consensus', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Face', 'Faculty', 'Financial Support', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Outcomes Research', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Preferences', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physical Function', 'Physicians', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Process', 'Property', 'Prospective Studies', 'Prospective cohort', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Provider', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Rogaine', 'Sample Size', 'Science', 'Statistical Bias', 'Structure', 'Survivors', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'care outcomes', 'career', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'design', 'emotional functioning', 'experience', 'hands-on learning', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'novel strategies', 'outcome prediction', 'patient health information', 'patient oriented', 'patient oriented research', 'prediction algorithm', 'prognostic', 'psychosocial', 'randomized trial', 'recruit', 'residence', 'simulation', 'statistics', 'structured data', 'survivorship', 'tenure track', 'unstructured data', 'ventilation']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R00,2021,249000
"Discovering and Applying Knowledge in Clinical Databases PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The long-term goal of our ongoing project, “Discovering and applying knowledge in clinical databases,” is to learn from data in the electronic health record (EHR) and to apply that knowledge to understand and improve health. The EHR, because of its broad capture of human health, greatly amplifies our ability to carry out observational research, opening the possibility of covering emerging problems, diverse populations, rare diseases, and chronic diseases in long-term longitudinal studies. Unfortunately, the strength of EHR data—its breadth and flexible nature—imposes additional challenges. We have found that the biggest challenge comes from the inaccuracy, incompleteness, complexity, and resulting bias inherent in the recording of the health care process. We previously showed that health care process bias exists to the extent, for example, that simple use of the data can create signals implying the opposite of what we know to be true. One of the most important factors is sparse, irregular sampling; we found that sampling bias can be reduced by reparameterizing time and that prediction techniques that can accommodate EHR-specific data and resist their biases like data assimilation can be used on EHR data to produce good estimates of glucose and HA1c. The previous cycle of this project produced 75 publications. We propose to develop methods to accommodate health care process bias, using both knowledge engineering and experience with health care process bias as well as advanced statistical techniques that employ dynamical models and latent variables. We hypothesize that heuristics and models combined with knowledge can improve our ability to generate inferences and learn phenotypes despite health care process bias. Our aims are as follows: (1) Taking a knowledge engineering approach, study the effect of preprocessing and analytic choices on reducing health care process bias, and using machine learning techniques, learn more about health care process bias. (2) Taking a more empirical approach, use dynamic latent factor modeling and variation inference to accommodate health care process bias, learning how a patient's health state and health processes affect censoring, exploiting information from many variables at once. (3) Use data assimilation and mechanistic models to learn otherwise unmeasurable physiologic phenotypes despite irregular, sparse sampling typical of electronic health records. (4) Use the developed models and generated phenotypes to answer clinical questions, and disseminate the results.

(3) Use data assimilation and mechanistic models to learn otherwise unmeasurable physiologic phenotypes despite irregular, sparse sampling typical of electronic health records. (4) Use the developed models and generated phenotypes to answer clinical questions, and disseminate the results. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project studies the biases that health care processes bring to electronic health record data, and it develops methods to overcome those biases to improve reuse of the data for purposes such as clinical research and quality improvement.",Discovering and Applying Knowledge in Clinical Databases,10116464,R01LM006910,"['Active Learning', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Assimilations', 'Award', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Drug Side Effects', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Functional disorder', 'Generations', 'Glucose', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Insulin', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Nonlinear Dynamics', 'Observational Study', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Process', 'Publications', 'Rare Diseases', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Biases', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'clinical database', 'data reuse', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'heuristics', 'improved', 'novel', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2021,568584
"A Pragmatic Latent Variable Learning Approach Aligned with Clinical Practice Abstract With growing interest in personalized medicine and the rise of machine learning, constructing good risk prediction and prognostic models has been drawing renewed attention. In this development, much effort is concentrated in identifying good predictors of patient outcomes, although the same level of rigor is often absent in improving the outcome side of prediction. The majority of popular supervised techniques (e.g., regularized logistic regression and its variations), which can be readily applied in risk model development, assumes that the prediction target is a clear single outcome measured at a single time point. In clinical reality, patient outcomes are often complex, multivariate, and measured with errors. Even when a target is a relatively clear univariate outcome (e.g., death, cancer, diabetes, etc), the process that leads to this ultimate outcome often involves complex intermediate outcomes, where predicting and understanding this intermediate process can be crucial in providing effective care and preventing negative ultimate outcomes. The situation calls for a ﬂexible learning framework that can easily incorporate this important but neglected aspect in model development - better characterizing and constructing prediction targets before building prediction models.  Focusing on risk labels as prediction targets, we propose a pragmatic 3-stage learning approach, where we sequentially 1) generate latent labels, 2) validate them using explicit validators, and 3) go on with supervised learning with labeled data. Latent variable (LV) strategies used in Satge 1 have great potentials in handling complex outcome information. The unsupervised nature of LV strategies makes highly ﬂexible data synthesis and organization possible. The same nature, however, can also be seen as esoteric and subjective, which is not desirable in situations where transparency and reproducibility are of great concern such as in risk prediction. As a practical solution to this problem, we propose the use of explicit clinical validators, which not only makes LV-based labels closely aligned with contemporary science and clinical practice, but also makes it possible to automatically validate and narrow a large pool of candidate labels. With the goal of developing a practical and transparent system of learning and inference for clinical research and practice, we formed a highly interdisciplinary team of researchers with expertise in latent variable modeling, machine learning, psychometrics and causal inference along with clinical/substantive expertise. Our streamlined learning framework focuses on direct and transparent validation of latent variable solutions to ensure clear communication across risk model developers, clinical researchers and practitioners. The project ultimately aims to improve personalized treatment and care by improving risk prediction. Narrative This project intends to develop a pragmatic learning and risk predction framework that will facilitate utilization of multivariate data collected from research and health care services, which otherwise is underutilized in developing methods to improve personalized care of future patients. The project ultimately aims to improve personalized treatment and care by improving risk prediction, and therefore will have positive impact on public health.",A Pragmatic Latent Variable Learning Approach Aligned with Clinical Practice,10212944,R01MH123443,"['Address', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Brain', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Ensure', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heart', 'Hybrids', 'Hyperglycemia', 'Intention', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manic', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Process', 'Psychometrics', 'Public Health', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Side', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'acceptability and feasibility', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'clinical risk', 'comorbidity', 'data exploration', 'flexibility', 'health care service', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'interest', 'model development', 'neglect', 'personalized care', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'risk prediction', 'risk prediction model', 'simulation', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'unsupervised learning']",NIMH,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,558490
"Predictive Analytics in Hemodialysis: Enabling Precision Care for Patient with ESKD ABSTRACT End stage kidney disease (ESKD) is a complex disease with individuals having variable life- expectancies, with 25% dying within 1 year and 41% surviving at least 5 years. While providers recognize that patients are different – and ought to be differently – there are no tools to reliably forecast individual life expectancy and aid in treatment individualization. Instead, providers are left with often unclear or incomplete guidelines on how best to manage patients. In order to provide precision care for patients on hemodialysis (HD), there is a critical need to be able to (1) dynamically assess life expectancy for medical decision-making; and (2) identify distinct clinical phenotypes to enhance clinical monitoring and care planning. Our central hypothesis is that there is heterogeneity in patient survivorship and disease trajectory that, when known, can be used to provide more personalized and effective care. By coupling novel machine learning approaches for survival prediction with granular clinical data on HD patients, we will be able to develop the analytic tools necessary to support precision care. At the completion of this proposal we will have tools to dynamically assess a patient's life expectancy and insights into heterogeneous disease phenotypes for patients with ESKD. These tools will allow providers to make informed treatment decisions as well as lay the groundwork for further precision research into optimized patient care. NARRATIVE End stage kidney disease (ESKD) is a complex disease with individuals having variable life- expectancies. However, there are no tools to reliably forecast individual life expectancy.

"Developing and validating EHR-integrated readmission risk prediction models for hospitalized patients with diabetes PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Hospital readmission is an undesirable, costly outcome that may be preventable. Hospitalized patients with diabetes are at higher risk of readmission within 30 days (30-d readmission) than patients without diabetes, and >1 million readmissions occur among diabetes patients in the US annually. Certain interventions can reduce readmission risk, but applying these interventions widely is cost prohibitive. One approach for improving the efficiency of interventions that reduce readmission risk is to target high-risk patients. We previously published a model, the Diabetes Early Readmission Risk Indicator (DERRITM), that predicts the risk of all-cause 30-d readmission of patients with diabetes. The DERRI, however, has modest predictive accuracy (C-statistic 0.63- 0.69), and requires manual data input. Recently, we demonstrated that adding variables to the DERRI substantially improves predictive accuracy (DERRIplus, C-statistic 0.82). However, using this larger model to predict readmission risk based on manual input of data would be too labor intensive for clinical settings. Indeed, most readmission risk prediction models are limited by the trade-off between accuracy and ease of use; lack of translation to a tool that integrates with clinical workflow; modest accuracy; lack of validation; and dependence on data only available after hospital discharge.  The objectives of the current proposal are: 1) To develop more accurate all-cause unplanned 30-d readmission risk prediction models using electronic health record (EHR) data of patients with diabetes (eDERRI); 2) To translate the models to an automated, EHR-based tool that predicts % readmission risk of hospitalized patients; and 3) To prospectively validate the eDERRI models and tool. The new eDERRI models will expand upon the variables in the DERRIplus based on availability in EHR data (e.g., sociodemographics, encounter history, medication use, laboratory results, comorbidities, and length of stay). To develop the models, we will leverage data from the PaTH Clinical Data Research Network (CDRN), a multi-center, 40-plus hospital member of the National Patient-Centered Clinical Research Network (PCORnet). We will apply state-of-the-art deep-learning methods to develop optimal predictive models. This project will analyze a large, multi-center cohort of nearly 340,000 discharges with cutting-edge techniques to develop better models and translate them to an automated tool that predicts readmission risk for individual patients with diabetes. The proposed tool would identify higher risk patients more likely to benefit from intervention, thus improving care and reducing costs. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project seeks to develop more accurate models that predict the risk of repeat hospitalizations among patients with diabetes. The models will be programmed into a tool that will be integrated with an electronic health record system and automatically predict the re-hospitalization risk of patients. Such a tool could be used to identify higher risk diabetes patients more likely to benefit from intervention, thus improving care and reducing costs.",Developing and validating EHR-integrated readmission risk prediction models for hospitalized patients with diabetes,10245208,R01DK122073,"['Admission activity', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Paths', 'Clinical Research', 'Collection', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Goals', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Institution', 'Insulin', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Length of Stay', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Modeling', 'Participant', 'Patient Readmission', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Publishing', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'comorbidity Index', 'cost', 'cost outcomes', 'deep learning', 'demographics', 'design', 'diabetes risk', 'experience', 'high risk', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'learning strategy', 'member', 'model development', 'patient oriented', 'patient subsets', 'point of care', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'prospective', 'readmission risk', 'risk prediction', 'risk prediction model', 'sociodemographics', 'statistics', 'tool']",NIDDK,TEMPLE UNIV OF THE COMMONWEALTH,R01,2021,562886
"Harnessing Big Data to Identify Effective Peripheral Artery Disease Treatments in Chronic Kidney Disease PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Peripheral artery disease (PAD), characterized by diseased arteries to the limbs, affects 200 million people worldwide and 9 million people in the U.S. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects 20 million people in the U.S. and confers a markedly higher risk for PAD. Yet patients with CKD are less likely to have revascularization procedures and are more likely to undergo lower extremity amputation than patients without CKD. In addition to a high prevalence of traditional risk factors such as hypertension and diabetes mellitus, patients with CKD have other unique risk factors such as chronic inflammation or uremia, which in turn can lead to more aggressive PAD at a younger age. Therefore, patients with CKD need dedicated study. Our overarching goal is to help close these evidence gaps and address these limitations by harnessing the power of Optum Clinformatics Data Mart, which includes over 7 billion claims records on over 83 million unique lives from all 50 states spanning 2005-2019. Our secondary goal is to facilitate future PAD studies using real-world data by leveraging the power of natural language processing to improve our ability to accurately and automatically ascertain PAD from large electronic health record databases. Our innovative algorithm will be of particular importance among subgroups where clinical trial evidence is limited, such as in advanced CKD. Our proposal has the Specific Aims. Aim 1: To evaluate lower extremity revascularization in patients with non-dialysis- requiring CKD. We hypothesize that patients with CKD undergoing surgical versus endovascular revascularization will have longer initial hospitalization, but fewer subsequent major adverse limb events. AIM 2: To evaluate antiplatelet and anticoagulant medications after lower extremity revascularization in patients with non-dialysis-requiring CKD. We hypothesize that real-world patients with CKD treated with antiplatelet medications or direct oral anticoagulants after lower extremity revascularization will have higher rates of bleeding but lower rates of major adverse limb events. AIM 3: To develop an algorithm that accurately and automatically ascertains PAD from electronic health record databases. We hypothesize that a natural language processing-approach applied to diagnostic vascular testing reports will have better test performance (i.e. sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values) for identifying PAD than a traditional approach that uses administrative billing codes. Manual chart review will serve as the gold standard. PROJECT NARRATIVE Peripheral artery disease (PAD) affects millions of people around the world, causing decreased mobility, non- healing wounds, gangrene and amputations. Patients with chronic kidney disease have a higher risk for PAD and its complications, but relatively little is known about what treatments are effective in this population. Our project aims to narrow some of these knowledge gaps to improve PAD treatment practices for patients with chronic kidney disease.",Harnessing Big Data to Identify Effective Peripheral Artery Disease Treatments in Chronic Kidney Disease,10180665,R01HL151351,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Amputation', 'Anticoagulants', 'Arteries', 'Aspirin', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Big Data', 'Biometry', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Data', 'Data Mart', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Future', 'Gangrene', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hemorrhage', 'High Prevalence', 'Home environment', 'Hospitalization', 'Hypertension', 'Inflammation', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Limb structure', 'Lower Extremity', 'Manuals', 'Medial', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Minerals', 'Modernization', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nephrology', 'Observational Study', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Peripheral arterial disease', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Procedures', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Safety', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Stroke', 'Subgroup', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Uremia', 'calcification', 'career', 'cohort', 'cost', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'health related quality of life', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'non-healing wounds', 'novel', 'performance tests', 'programs', 'virtual']",NHLBI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,354432
"TECTONICS (Telemedicine Control Tower for the OR: Navigating Information, Care and Safety) trial Abstract Adverse outcomes, including death, respiratory failure and renal failure, are common after surgery, and represent a serious public health challenge. Such adverse outcomes can be mitigated through integrated, collaborative health information technology solutions that provide clinicians cognitive and computational support. The chief motivation for the TECTONICS (Telemedicine Control Tower for the OR: Navigating Information, Care and Safety) trial is that a multi-faceted telemedicine solution has the potential to facilitate the dynamic assessment of risk, diagnose negative patient trajectories, and implement evidence-based practices. The net result for patients would be improved safety and outcomes. Our telemedicine solution, called the Anesthesiology Control Tower (ACT), encompasses real-time patient data integration from the electronic health record, clinician decision support, machine learning algorithms that predict adverse outcomes, and remote monitoring for the operating room (OR). This conceptualization of sophisticated remote monitoring for the OR is somewhat analogous to an air traffic control tower for a busy airport. The innovative TECTONICS trial will build on a series of preliminary studies (funded by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, and the National Science Foundation) that have (i) established the usefulness and usability of a prototype telemedicine ACT; (ii) customized and enhanced decision-support alerts for the ACT, based on clinician user feedback; (iii) designed, developed, and tested machine learning algorithms that predict adverse postoperative outcomes; and (iv) established the feasibility of conducing a real-world randomized trial of the prototype ACT. The TECTONICS trial builds logically on these preliminary studies. Aim 1 is to show that we can implement and sustain an integrated ACT system. As part of this, we will iteratively assess the accuracy of our machine learning algorithms and modify them to improve their ability to predict in real time when patients are at high risk for experiencing negative outcomes. Aim 2 is to understand how the ACT system affects clinicians’ (anesthesiologists and certified registered nurse anesthetists [CRNAs]) thinking, decision-making and behavior. This understanding will help us to enhance the ACT system, improve workflow processes in the ACT and in the OR, and improve collaborative interactions between anesthesiologists and CRNAs. Aim 3 is to conduct a rigorous clinical trial. We will evaluate the impact of the ACT system on the quality of care in the OR, and clinical outcomes such as intraoperative awareness, and postoperative delirium, renal failure, respiratory failure, and 30-day mortality. TECTONICS will be the first practical and scientifically rigorous trial of a telemedicine solution for the operating room, and will inform the usefulness of incorporating such technology in routine care of surgical patients, including under-resourced healthcare settings. With many millions undergoing surgery yearly, this feasible application of technology could signal a major shift in the safety and quality of perioperative care, and translate into substantial societal gain. Narrative Adverse outcomes, including death, are common after surgery and represent a public health challenge. There is an urgent need to assess the potential usefulness of a remote technology-based control center for the operating room to dynamically assess risk, diagnose negative patient trajectories, implement evidence-based practices, and improve outcomes. This innovative study will rigorously assess whether the implementation of an 'anesthesiology control tower', with sophisticated decision-support tools, improves the care, safety and outcomes of surgical patients.","TECTONICS (Telemedicine Control Tower for the OR: Navigating Information, Care and Safety) trial",10120737,R01NR017916,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Affect', 'Air', 'Algorithms', 'Anesthesia procedures', 'Anesthesiology', 'Anesthetics', 'Area', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Caring', 'Certified registered nurse anesthetist', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Computer software', 'Consent', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Decision Making', 'Delirium', 'Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Enabling Factors', 'Engineering', 'Evidence based practice', 'Failure', 'Feedback', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Funding Agency', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Informatics', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Kidney Failure', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Motivation', 'Network-based', 'Operating Rooms', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Perioperative', 'Perioperative Care', 'Perioperative complication', 'Postoperative Period', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Quality of Care', 'Randomized', 'Resources', 'Respiratory Failure', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Safety', 'Science', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'System', 'Technology', 'Telemedicine', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality', 'Update', 'adverse outcome', 'algorithm development', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive process', 'computer science', 'data integration', 'design', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'health care settings', 'health information technology', 'high risk', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'modifiable risk', 'mortality', 'neural network', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'postoperative delirium', 'prediction algorithm', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'randomized trial', 'remote monitoring', 'remote patient monitoring', 'risk prediction', 'routine care', 'safety outcomes', 'support tools', 'surgery outcome', 'usability', 'user-friendly', 'waiver']",NINR,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,645032
"Improving the performance of an AI-enabled clinical decision support tool for detecting suicidal risk and other mental health concerns PROJECT SUMMARY—Clarigent Health is refining an AI-enabled clinical decision support tool that uses linguistic and acoustic patterns in recorded patient interviews to identify patients at risk of harm due to suicidal ideation or other mental health concerns. In an ongoing study, Clarigent is collecting > 6,000 patient interviews from adolescents and adults in schools, primary care offices, and other settings to improve risk prediction and refine the platform for data collection and reporting. Prior studies indicate the tool will have broad clinical utility, but the impacts of patient characteristics and interview setting on the tool’s performance are unknown. Characterizing these effects would support tailored models, inform prospective trials, and aid in selecting the correct regulatory pathways and settings for deployment. Further development is expected to provide a rapid and reliable objective assessment of suicidal ideation and other actionable mental health concerns to reduce loss of life and improve mental health among adolescents and adults. Each year, ~13% of adolescents and 7% of adults in the US experience a major depressive episode. Many contemplate or attempt suicide, resulting in > 45,000 deaths. Early risk identification and treatment could prevent many of these, but at- risk individuals rarely receive screening until symptoms are severe. Universal screening and diagnostic tools deployed in schools and physicians’ offices could address this problem, but the lack of an objective risk assessment tool for use in these settings is a major barrier. In the absence of blood-based or genetic biomarkers, verbal and nonverbal language cues can be used to identify risk. The complexity and broad variability of these thought markers resists easy classification by a clinician, but AI approaches can identify consistent, meaningful patterns. Two trials have demonstrated the ability of AI-enabled algorithms to use linguistic and acoustic features of a brief interview to correctly categorize suicide risk. Clarigent, which was formed to further develop and commercialize this technology for use in diverse settings, is collecting > 6,000 patient interviews to improve the performance of this tool for predicting suicidality, depression, and anxiety. This Phase I SBIR will assess the effects of age, sex, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, geographic area, or interview environment on model performance; validate modified models; and inform key decisions regarding commercialization path and future trial designs. Aim 1. Characterize the effects of patient and setting characteristics on model performance. Factors that improve model performance by ≥ 0.05 AUC will be considered for separate model development. Aim 2. Validate updated algorithms with a holdout data set. Successful models will correctly classify risk categories with an AUC ≥ 0.80. Milestones for Progression to Phase II—The goal is to identify patient or setting characteristics that improve model performance ≥ 0.05 AUC. Models that correctly classify risk categories with an AUC ≥ 0.80 will be advanced for evaluation in prospective trials. Clarigent will consult with FDA and advisors to determine the correct regulatory path depending on model performance and intended use. PROJECT NARRATIVE The availability of a clinical decision support tool that predicts suicidal ideation, depression, and other mental health concerns prior to an emergency situation is a critical advance for human health.

"Personalized Statin Treatment Plan to Optimize Clinical Outcomes Using Big Data PROJECT SUMMARY An estimated 47% of Americans 65 years of age and older take statins, which are highly effective in lowering low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), and reducing all-cause mortality. Unfortunately, ~50% of patients prescribed statins do not obtain these critical benefits because they discontinue use within 1 year of treatment initiation. There, Statin discontinuation has been identified as a major public-health concern due to increased morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs associated with ASCVD. In clinical practice, statin-associated symptoms (SAS) often result in dose reduction or discontinuation of these life-saving medications. Currently, physicians employ reactive strategies to manage SAS concerns after they manifest, such as offering an alternative statin treatment plan (e.g., reducing dosage or changing medication) or a `statin holiday'. However, with numerous statin treatment strategies available and no means of optimizing their match to a given patient, physician decision-making is based on minimal patient data elements. Moreover, using a single patient's data to identify the optimal statin regimen and treatment plan is inadequate to ensure that the harms of statin use are minimized and the benefits are maximized. A decision- support system, by contrast, can use a vast number of variables from a large number of patients (“big data”) to match an optimal statin treatment plan to an individual patient prospectively. We propose to use complex patient information to develop and test an effective predictive model and tool, the personalized statin treatment plan (PSTP) platform, which could be used by physicians to optimize personalized statin treatment to minimize harms (SAS and statin discontinuation) while at the same time maximizing benefits (LDL reduction). The proposed study leverages data from the OptumLabs Data Warehouse (which includes more than 20 years of insurance claims and electronic health records data from more than 150 million patients across the United States), as well as clinical trial simulations, for model development, validation, and evaluation. We will address the following specific aims: 1) Develop and validate a deep-learning model to predict both SAS and statin discontinuation using linked insurance claims and EHR data; 2) Develop and validate the PSTP platform to identify statin treatment plans that optimize both LDL reduction (benefit) and SAS and statin discontinuation (harm) for a given patient profile; and 3) Evaluate the PSTP relative to current and guideline-driven practices using CTS to assess clinical benefits and harms. The proposed study will produce a precision-medicine tool to empower physicians to make proactive clinical decisions regarding statin treatment planning (i.e., selecting the statin drug and dosage optimized for a particular patient to maximize LDL reduction and minimize statin discontinuation and SAS) before any statin is prescribed. The implementation of such a tool would substantially improve public health by reducing statin discontinuation and sub-optimal clinical outcomes inherent in current reactive statin-prescribing strategies based on non-personalized statin treatment plans. PROJECT NARRATIVE About 50% of patients prescribed statins do not obtain critical benefits in lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, and reducing all-cause mortality because they discontinue use within 1 year of treatment initiation largely due to statin-associated symptoms. Statin discontinuation has been identified as a major public-health concern due to increased morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs associated with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.

"Optimizing stroke prevention for older adults with atrial fibrillation: Towards rigorous evaluation and judicious application of a new device PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Atrial fibrillation (AF) affects about 10% of older adults and accounts for a growing proportion of strokes. Lifelong oral anticoagulation, with warfarin or a non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant (NOAC), is recommended for stroke prevention in most AF patients. However, the drugs increase the risk of bleeding and the adherence to the lifelong drug therapy is poor, leaving many patients under-treated. The recently-approved Watchman device offers an attractive alternative to lifelong drug therapy for AF stroke prevention. However, the device has been studied in only two clinical trials, both of which compared it to warfarin. Little is known about how Watchman compares with the current mainstay therapy, NOACs, or how Watchman compares with no treatment in patients who have difficulties taking anticoagulation drugs. Furthermore, for preventive treatment with a high upfront cost and some procedural risks, a personalized approach is needed to target Watchman to patients who are most likely to benefit and avoid it in those who have little to gain. Therefore, the overall objective of this project is to address these evidence gaps and develop new prediction tools to optimize the use of Watchman for AF stroke prevention. In Aim 1, we will conduct comparative effectiveness studies using a large national administrative database (OptumLabs) that contains insurance claims for over two million patients with AF of all ages and races from all 50 states with linked EHRs in a subset. The findings will provide timely evidence to address the key unanswered questions highlighted in current practice guidelines and will facilitate the design, analysis, and interpretation of future clinical trials. In Aim 2, we will develop and validate machine-learning models to predict how Watchman compares with non-invasive therapies. We will develop the models using the OptumLabs data, and validate the models in two RCTs and two large health systems’ EHRs, thereby validating models in both clinical trial and routine practice settings. The new prediction models will provide personalized estimates for the benefits and harms, and thus, engage patients in making informed choices consistent with their preferences and ease clinicians’ cognitive burden. In Aim 3, we will assess how the Watchman decisions made in contemporary practice agree with those suggested by the new prediction models. We will use machine-learning methods to identify patient and provider characteristics associated with incongruent decisions. Such findings will highlight patient and provider groups who may particularly benefit from the decision support, thereby informing future implementation and translation efforts. We have assembled a team with complementary clinical and research expertise, a solid record of successful collaboration, and extensive experience in outcomes research and prediction modeling. We also have developed a web-based decision aid that is ready to translate the prediction models to reduce unwarranted variation in care delivery, patient outcomes, and medical costs. PROJECT NARRATIVE The findings will provide timely evidence to bridge the gaps between clinical trials and everyday practice. The new prediction models, once embedded in a decision aid, will bring personalized outcome estimates to shared decision making to promote evidence-based and patient-centered care. Therefore, the proposed project has great potentials to improve the care for millions of patients with AF at risk for stroke.",Optimizing stroke prevention for older adults with atrial fibrillation: Towards rigorous evaluation and judicious application of a new device,10074511,R01AG062436,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Anticoagulants', 'Anticoagulation', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Big Data', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Aid', 'Decision Making', 'Devices', 'Elderly', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Future', 'Health system', 'Hemorrhage', 'Judgment', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Modeling', 'Online Systems', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patient-Centered Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Practice Guidelines', 'Preventive treatment', 'Provider', 'Race', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk-Benefit Assessment', 'Signal Transduction', 'Solid', 'Stroke', 'Stroke prevention', 'Suggestion', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Variant', 'Warfarin', 'administrative database', 'care delivery', 'cognitive load', 'comparative effectiveness study', 'cost', 'design', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'improved', 'insurance claims', 'machine learning method', 'mortality risk', 'outcome prediction', 'personalized approach', 'personalized medicine', 'practice setting', 'predictive modeling', 'preference', 'preservation', 'routine practice', 'shared decision making', 'stroke risk', 'tool']",NIA,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2021,493168
"ADAPT: Autonomous Delirium Monitoring and Adaptive Prevention Project Summary Recent large-scale trials have shown no significant benefit of pharmacological interventions in delirium patients, and non-pharmacological approaches remain the cornerstone of delirium prevention. Among those strategies, minimizing patient immobility and circadian desynchrony are particularly difficult to implement, as their assessment is dependent on sporadic human observations. The overall objective of this application is to develop ADAPT, the Autonomous Delirium Monitoring and Adaptive Prevention system using novel pervasive sensing and deep learning techniques. It will autonomously quantify patients’ mobility and circadian desynchrony in terms of nightly disruptions, light intensity, and sound pressure level. This will allow for integration of these risk factors into a dynamic model for predicting delirium trajectories. It will also enable adaptive action prompts aimed at increasing patients’ mobility, reducing nightly disruptions, optimizing ambient light, and reducing noise, based on precise real-time quantification. The rationale is that successful application of the proposed technology would augment clinical-decision making in the fast-paced ICU environment and would promote more targeted interventions. The overall objective will be achieved by pursuing three specific aims. (1) Developing and validating an interpretable deep learning algorithm for precise and dynamic prediction of the delirium trajectory, to determine if it is more accurate in predicting delirium trajectory transitions compared to existing tools, while providing interpretable information to the physician. (2) Developing a pervasive sensing system for autonomous monitoring of mobility and circadian desynchrony, to determine if it can provide accurate assessments compared to human expert and circadian biomarkers, and if it can enrich delirium trajectory prediction when combined with clinical data. (3) Developing and evaluating prompts for adaptive delirium prevention using real-time monitoring system, to determine if the system has acceptable satisfaction and perceived benefit among ICU physicians. The approach is innovative, because it represents the first attempt to (1) dynamically predict precise delirium trajectory, (2) autonomously monitor mobility and circadian desynchrony risk factors in the ICU, and (3) implement adaptive preventions in real time. The proposed research is significant since it will address several key problems and critical barriers in critical care, including (1) lack of precise and real-time delirium trajectory prediction models, (2) uncaptured aspects of mobility and circadian desynchrony, and (3) the need for novel approaches for non-pharmacological prevention. Ultimately, the results are expected to improve patient outcomes and decrease hospitalization costs, as well as lifelong complications. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because it can result in enhanced critical care workflow and early critical care intervention, ultimately improving patient outcomes and decreasing hospitalization costs. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of NIH's mission that pertains to advancing disease diagnosis through medical applications of new tools and technologies, as the proposed research applies advanced computational methods and sensing technologies to automatically quantify and convey patient status in real-time.",ADAPT: Autonomous Delirium Monitoring and Adaptive Prevention,10178157,R01NS120924,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Biological Markers', 'Circadian Dysregulation', 'Circadian desynchrony', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Collaborations', 'Coma', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Critical Care', 'Critical Illness', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Delirium', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Hospital Costs', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Intelligence', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Light', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Neurology', 'Noise', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmacology', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'advanced disease', 'base', 'brain dysfunction', 'circadian', 'circadian regulation', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision-making', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'disease diagnosis', 'dynamic system', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'light intensity', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'patient mobility', 'predictive modeling', 'pressure', 'prospective', 'real time monitoring', 'satisfaction', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'sound', 'tool']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,R01,2021,612618
"BIGDATA: Causal Inference in Large-Scale Time Series Project summary Large datasets generated by hospitals could have a transformative effect on medical knowledge and patient care. Yet currently the volume of data is more likely to overwhelm clinicians and the challenges of the data can overwhelm machine learning algorithms. Intensive care units (ICUs) generate data at a resolution of seconds, for the entirety of a patient's stay. Our long-term goal is to turn these data into actionable knowledge, like risk factors for a disease, early intervention targets, and real-time information to support clinical decisions. This is a broad problem, but particularly important in ICUs, which involve high stakes decisions being made in a complex environment under time pressure. We focus in particular on understanding consciousness in adults, and neurologic status in neonates. While 7% of ICU admissions are due to loss of consciousness, and degree of consciousness is critical to evaluating prognosis, making difficult choices such as when to withdraw care, and providing early interventions to improve quality of life, there are no objective or automated assessments for consciousness (adults) or neurologic status (neonates). We have shown that unresponsive patients with brain activation were twice as likely to regain the ability to follow commands compared to unresponsive patients without such activation, yet these assessments are too time consuming for regular clinical use. However we also showed that physiological data routinely collected in ICUs can be used as a proxy to classify consciousness. It is still not known why it changes and we must be sure that the patterns we find are in fact causal to avoid treating symptoms instead of a disease or launching unsuccessful clinical trials. There have been two key barriers preventing a causal understanding of consciousness. First, variables measured for each ICU patient differ, and can differ within a patient over the course of their admission. This leads to confounding when attempting to infer causal models, and has prevented learning a single model for all patients, which limits generalizability. Second, while the challenges of medical data require new methods, researchers are rarely able to rigorously evaluate and compare them, since real-world data lacks ground truth and often cannot be shared for privacy reasons. To address these challenges, we aim 1) to develop methods that learn generalizable causal models with latent variables (by intelligently sharing and combining information across patients), 2) to develop data driven simulations methods for testing machine learning algorithms while preserving privacy, and 3) to apply these methods to neonatal and neurological ICU data. We aim to create better indicators for consciousness and to uncover causes of both neurological status in ICU and its link to long-term functional outcomes. Our work turns potential weaknesses of medical data (different variables measured across individuals) into a strength, and will enable better use of large-scale observational biomedical data for real-time treatment decisions. Project Narrative Big data can form the basis for more precise, personalized, interventions for ICU patients, but it is challenging for clinicians to integrate a large number of complex signals. Our work will allow data to guide treatment by making machine learning more accurate and providing better ways of combining insights from many patients (each of whose data may be incomplete). These will aid in understanding consciousness in neurological and neonatal ICUs.",BIGDATA: Causal Inference in Large-Scale Time Series,10123124,R01LM011826,"['Ablation', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Altered Level of Consciousness', 'Behavior assessment', 'Big Data', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Conscious', 'Consensus', 'Consumption', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Electroencephalography', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intelligence', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neonatal', 'Neonatal Intensive Care Units', 'Neurologic', 'Neurological status', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Privacy', 'Proxy', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Risk Factors', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Unconscious State', 'Withdrawal', 'Withdrawing Care', 'Work', 'causal model', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical practice', 'effective intervention', 'functional outcomes', 'improved', 'insight', 'large datasets', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'neonatal patient', 'neonate', 'open source', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized intervention', 'premature', 'pressure', 'prevent', 'privacy preservation', 'respiratory', 'response', 'simulation', 'stroke patient', 'symptom treatment', 'tool']",NLM,STEVENS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2021,295006
"Synthesizing Intraoperative Multivariate Time Series with Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks Project Summary/Abstract Patient safety is paramount in anesthesia. Intraoperative complications and hemodynamic instability are associated with reduced long-term survival and can lead to risks such as myocardial injury, stroke, kidney injury, and even death. Therefore, predicting and preventing intraoperative hemodynamic instability is very important in the decision-making process of anesthesia providers. An ideal pre-operative assessment system would predict, from patient information, all intraoperative complications and physiological changes before a surgical procedure begins. Predicting intraoperative hemodynamic instability during surgery requires analyzing an enormous amount of physiological data and spotting patterns in that data before adverse events occur. However, doing this requires a large volume of high-resolution intraoperative data taken directly from the physiological monitors in the operating room to train machine learning models, and these data currently are unavailable. Therefore, the research goal of this proposed training program is to generate a continuous multivariate intraoperative physiological time series that display the effects of anesthesia management using state-of-the-art mathematic tools. The generated data can provide unlimited and realistic intraoperative data to identify intraoperative complications and later build a real-time intraoperative clinical decision support system. The proposed training program has two aims. Aim 1 will enable the applicant to create a data-driven objective approach for intraoperative complication prediction and risk assessment. Key information from anesthesia pre- op assessment will be used to generate synthetic low-resolution intraoperative physiological data. This data will inform anesthesia providers of the type, timing, and range of a given patient’s intraoperative hemodynamic instability and complications before surgery. Aim 2 will enable the applicant to build a virtual database that will provide unlimited high-resolution intraoperative data to train machine learning algorithms for a future real-time intraoperative clinical decision support system. The recorded low-resolution intraoperative data and the key information from anesthesia pre-op assessment will be inputted into the second tool to upscale existing minute- resolution intraoperative data to second-resolution level for data augmentation to boost the number of available surgical cases. This K08 research program will enable the applicant to fill key knowledge gaps in applying data science in the existing low-resolution intraoperative data in medical records and non-recorded high-resolution intraoperative data displayed by anesthesia devices. The results will orient anesthesia providers and researchers in the design and implementation of data-driven perioperative prediction systems over traditional anesthesia risk assessment. Ultimately, this K08 award will provide the applicant with the senior mentorship, skills, research experience and data resources to become an independent nurse investigator after training. Project Narrative The proposed training program will enable the applicant to apply generative adversarial network (GAN) architecture to widely available pre-operative evaluation notes and data from an anesthesia information management system (AIMS) to improve patient outcomes. The training will comprise the creation of (1) one GAN framework for generating realistic synthetic low-resolution AIMS data from patient profiles in pre- operative evaluation notes and (2) The second GAN framework for generating synthetic high-resolution intraoperative physiological data from low-resolution AIMS data and patient profiles. From this, the applicant aims to (1) investigate the feasibility of using GAN architecture to improve pre-operative risk assessment and (2) create a database for intraoperative high-resolution multivariate time series gathered from both low- resolution AIMS data and pre-operative evaluation notes, which can be used to train machine learning algorithms for a future real-time intraoperative clinical-decision support system designed to assist anesthesia providers deliver safer care.",Synthesizing Intraoperative Multivariate Time Series with Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks,10188838,K08GM141489,"['Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Anesthesia procedures', 'Award', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Investigator Award', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Display', 'Data Management Resources', 'Data Science', 'Data Security', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Devices', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Injury to Kidney', 'Intervention', 'Intraoperative Complications', 'Intraoperative Monitoring', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Management Information Systems', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Medical Records', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Nurses', 'Operating Rooms', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perioperative', 'Physiologic Monitoring', 'Physiological', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Records', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Science', 'Series', 'Spottings', 'Stroke', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Training Programs', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'data resource', 'design', 'experience', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'large scale data', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality', 'myocardial injury', 'network architecture', 'network models', 'novel', 'older patient', 'patient safety', 'prediction algorithm', 'preservation', 'prevent', 'profiles in patients', 'programs', 'risk prediction', 'skills', 'success', 'tool', 'virtual']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,K08,2021,189794
"Development and Validation of Quantitative Anterior Segment OCT-based Methods to Evaluate Patients with Primary Angle Closure Disease PROJECT SUMMARY Primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG), the most severe form of primary angle closure disease (PACD), is a leading cause of permanent blindness worldwide. Gonioscopy, a qualitative and subjective angle assessment method, is the current clinical standard for diagnosing PACD despite its limited ability to quantify disease severity, especially in patients with early angle closure. Anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT) is a quantitative and objective imaging-based method for assessing the angle. However, there are limited methods for clinicians to apply AS-OCT to the care of angle closure patients. The primary objectives of this K23 career development proposal are: 1) to demonstrate the benefit of a quantitative anterior segment OCT-based approach to evaluating patients with PACD and develop classification models for PACD based on AS-OCT measurements; and 2) to provide an academic glaucoma specialist with the training and mentored research experience necessary to conduct independent clinical research. Achieving these objectives will provide critical skills and experiences necessary to establish an independent research program focused on applying AS-OCT imaging to improve the clinical care of patients with PACD. The proposed K23 application will provide additional training in four vital areas: 1) epidemiology and mechanisms of chronic disease; 2) classification of disease and prediction of disease risk; 3) biostatistical methods for clinical research; 4) machine learning and automated data analysis. The proposed research will use population-based data collected as part of the NIH-funded Chinese American Eye Study (CHES) to compare AS-OCT and gonioscopic assessments of angle width and determine the strength of association between these assessments and known PACD risk factors. The relationship between the degree of angle closure, measured by AS-OCT, and intraocular pressure (IOP), a sequela of angle closure and strong risk factor for glaucoma, will be characterized with CHES data and validated with data obtained by using a novel pupil control system on PACD patients recruited from the USC Roski Eye Institute (USCREI). Classification models for PACD stage and severity based on AS-OCT data from CHES will be developed using machine learning algorithms and validated with prospective data from USCREI patients with PACD. The results of the proposed research will provide the foundation for a future longitudinal study examining the benefit of using anterior segment OCT-based assessments and classification models to evaluate PACD patients and deliver targeted treatment to patients with higher risk for PACG. The ultimate goal of my research is to develop quantitative imaging-based diagnostic and treatment protocols that guide the standardized care of PACD patients and decrease the incidence of PACG and its associated ocular morbidity. PROJECT NARRATIVE The management of angle closure patients at risk for primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG), the most severe form of primary angle closure disease (PACD) and a leading cause of permanent vision loss worldwide, poses a significant challenge for eye care providers. Gonioscopy, a qualitative and subjective angle assessment method, is the current clinical standard for evaluating angle closure patients despite its limited ability to quantify PACD severity and predict progression to PACG.

"Predicting Diabetic Retinopathy from Risk Factor Data and Digital Retinal Images African American and Latinx communities nationally and in California not only bear a disproportionate burden of COVID-19 positive cases and deaths but are also not taking part in COVID-19 testing for a wide range of understudied reasons. This can have profound implications in safety net health care settings where vulnerable patients, who are in need of clinical procedures to prevent significant morbidity, are refusing such potentially lifesaving procedures because of fear of COVID-19 testing and/or contracting COVID-19. The Los Angeles County Department of Health Services (LACDHS) is the second largest publicly operated county safety net health care system in the United States, serving more than 750,000 patients annually. Timely access to health care in this under-resourced, high-need setting has been an ongoing challenge for its majority Latinx and African American patients. With the current pandemic, COVID-19 testing for patients has become an essential first step in the provision of critical procedural care. However, the range of reasons why patients refuse COVID-19 testing is little understood. To this end, we propose to explore the obstacles to COVID-19 pre- procedural testing and provide COVID-19 specific training to LACDHS Community Health Workers (CHWs) from these same communities to effectively address: a) the primary goal of increasing COVID-19 testing for individual patients, and the secondary goals of b) facilitating needed procedural care in a timely manner for the safety net health system, and c) developing a sustained public health presence in these communities to build trust and preparedness for critical COVID-19 related future needs. Trained CHWs can help to more effectively overcome obstacles to COVID-19 testing, including historical barriers of mistrust, provide COVID-19 health education, help address social determinants of health and help facilitate technological literacy to improve patient access to testing and care in a telehealth environment. The proposal uses a multidisciplinary, mixed- methods approach including unsupervised machine learning and qualitative interviews to systematically explore barriers and facilitators to COVID-19 testing among vulnerable safety net patients. We will then train clinically based, ethnically/linguistically matched CHWs to implement a hypothesis-driven intervention consisting of six group classes and six personalized patient encounters with African American and Latinx safety net patients. This study has the following specific aims: Aim 1- Utilize machine learning methods to assess whether there are characteristics that define African American and Latinx safety-net patients who engage in or refuse COVID-19 testing; Aim 2 - Conduct in-depth interviews with African American and Latinx patients who either declined or accepted COVID testing to explore contextual, behavioral, and attitudinal factors shaping patient circumstances and concerns; Aim 3 - Develop, implement, and pre-test a CHW intervention with the information from Aims 1 and 2, utilizing a randomized control design among African American and Latinx safety net patients to assess the effect of the CHW hypothesis-driven intervention on trust, self-efficacy, and intent to participate in COVID-19 testing. Project Narrative With the current pandemic, COVID-19 testing for patients has become an essential first step in the provision of critical procedural care. However, the range of reasons why vulnerable patients in safety net health care settings refuse COVID-19 testing is little understood. This grant is an innovative proposal that seeks to (1) bring together machine learning and behavioral methods to understand the reasons why Los Angeles County Department of Health Services (LACDHS) safety net patients who require COVID-19 testing for procedures refuse or accept COVID-19 testing, and (2) utilize the knowledge gleaned to implement a Community Health Worker (CHW)-based intervention, using LACDHS CHWs, that addresses the multilevel obstacles to COVID- 19 testing. Insights gained from this research may be of benefit to improve COVID-19 uptake in other similar safety net settings with CHWs and in planning the future uptake of COVID-19 vaccines in such medically underserved settings.",Predicting Diabetic Retinopathy from Risk Factor Data and Digital Retinal Images,10258973,R01LM012309,"['Address', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Behavioral', 'COVID testing', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 testing', 'COVID-19 vaccine', 'California', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Community Health Aides', 'Community Health Services', 'Contracts', 'County', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Environment', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Feedback', 'Food', 'Fright', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Glean', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health Services', 'Health Status', 'Health education', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Housing', 'Insurance Coverage', 'Intention', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Linguistics', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Marital Status', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'PhenX Toolkit', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Randomized', 'Readiness', 'Religion', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'SARS-CoV-2 positive', 'Science', 'Self Efficacy', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Transportation', 'Trust', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Ursidae Family', 'Vaccines', 'Weighing patient', 'base', 'comorbidity', 'design', 'digital', 'economic need', 'health care availability', 'health care settings', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'insight', 'literacy', 'machine learning method', 'medically underserved', 'multidisciplinary', 'outreach', 'pandemic disease', 'patient population', 'prevent', 'retinal imaging', 'safety net', 'skills', 'social health determinants', 'socioeconomics', 'telehealth', 'testing access', 'testing uptake', 'unsupervised learning', 'uptake', 'vaccine acceptance', 'virtual intervention', 'virtual patient']",NLM,CHARLES R.

"Clinical Biomechanics of Hip Fracture Over 300,000 hip fractures occur each year in the U.S. and up to 25% of hip-fracture patients die within a year of their injury. Despite the importance of this clinical problem, the diagnostic screening rate for osteoporosis is only 5% of the eligible population, and the sensitivity of measuring bone mineral density (BMD) by DXA, the clinical standard test for diagnosis, is only 50%. Therefore, most patients are not being screened diagnostically for osteoporosis, and for those who are, about half who will experience a hip fracture are missed. Given that the current empirical approach is inadequate, we propose to pursue a more mechanistic approach, combining state-of-the-art biomechanics and machine learning approaches. Biomechanically, the three etiological elements of hip fracture are fall risk, femoral strength, and femoral impact force. In this project, our overall goal is to provide a deeper understanding of how all three biomechanical etiological elements interact in the event of a hip fracture and from that, directly improve clinical fracture risk assessment through the use of a single predictive “Integral Biomechanical Risk (IBR)” parameter. In addition, we will also address the problem of low DXA screening rates by further developing our Biomechanical Computed Tomography (BCT) technology. This test estimates the breaking strength of the femur using finite element analysis of routine clinical CT scans previously acquired for any medical reason, and represents an improvement compared to the use of BMD alone. Since millions of patients are scanned with CT each year, this approach could double screening rates if offered as an alternative to DXA. The proposed study will investigate this biomechanical approach in a large incident hip fracture, case-cohort study (3,000 patients with hip fracture, 6,000 without). This retrospective study will include patients seen at Kaiser Permanente who had an abdominal CT scan as part of medical care prior to any hip fracture; and have standard geriatric measurements in their electronic medical records, which we will use to estimate fall risk. Specifically, our aims are to: 1) utilize electronic medical record data and CT scans to obtain patient-specific measurements related to fall risk, femoral strength, and fall severity, and 2) combine the different elements of hip fracture etiology into the IBR parameter to test the hypothesis that this metric predicts hip fracture independent of age, sex, BMI, race/ethnicity, and history of prior fracture and improves hip fracture prediction compared to the clinical standard (BMD with FRAX). Scientifically, a major novelty of this work is its use of contemporary machine learning algorithms to inform construction of a mechanistic model of the three etiological elements of hip fracture, which should better capture any interactions between these elements compared to a purely statistical-regression approach. In addition, the study cohort will be the largest and most diverse CT-based hip fracture cohort ever assembled. Importantly, positive results from this project would provide a compelling “second front” to DXA that could be quickly translated to widespread clinical practice, profoundly impacting osteoporosis care. STATEMENT OF RELEVANCE More than half of individuals who experience hip fracture do not have osteoporosis as assessed by DXA. This project draws together the latest technological advances in CT-based finite element modeling and combines it into a probabilistic model of fracture risk that uses as inputs, data typically available in medical records. By going beyond BMD, the fracture risk prediction tool developed by this work aims to significantly improve clinical fracture risk assessment and substantially impact the preventative care and treatment of osteoporosis.",Clinical Biomechanics of Hip Fracture,10144396,R01AR074958,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Archives', 'Biomechanics', 'Blinded', 'Body mass index', 'Bone Density', 'Calibration', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Discrimination', 'Dual-Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry', 'Economics', 'Elderly', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Equilibrium', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Femur', 'Finite Element Analysis', 'Fracture', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hip Fractures', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intramuscular', 'Investigation', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Modeling', 'Muscle', 'Osteoporosis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Preventive care', 'Preventive treatment', 'Probability', 'Race', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regression Analysis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Statistical Models', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'abdominal CT', 'base', 'biomechanical model', 'bone', 'bone strength', 'clinical practice', 'clinical risk', 'clinical translation', 'cohort', 'diagnostic screening', 'ductile', 'electronic data', 'experience', 'fall risk', 'falls', 'fracture risk', 'high risk', 'hip bone', 'improved', 'indexing', 'insight', 'kinematics', 'machine learning algorithm', 'neuromuscular', 'older patient', 'patient health information', 'risk prediction', 'screening', 'sex', 'soft tissue', 'standing height', 'theories', 'tool']",NIAMS,"O.

"Identification of Postoperative Pulmonary Complication Risk by Phenotyping Adult Surgical Patients who Underwent General Anesthesia with Mechanical Ventilation ABSTRACT Science: One in five patients who develop a postoperative pulmonary complication (PPC) dies within 30 days of surgery. PPCs are the second most frequent surgical complications and lead to increased admission to intensive care units, longer hospital length of stay, and high resource utilization. Ventilator induced lung injury (VILI) secondary to intraoperative mechanical ventilation is a risk for PPCs. Lung protective ventilation, which entails lower tidal volume, sufficient positive end expiratory pressure, optimal inspiratory time and an alveolar recruitment maneuver, has been adopted for intraoperative use to protect pulmonary parenchyma against VILI and ultimately reduce PPC incidence. However, we still do not know the optimal ventilator parameters to yield the lowest incidence of PPCs, because what is best varies from patient to patient. Personalized ventilator parameters are a potential solution to solve this problem. A retrospective study leveraging electronic health records (EHRs) is proposed to identify PPC risks by phenotyping adult surgical patients who underwent general anesthesia with mechanical ventilation. The specific aims of this project are to: (1) Examine the incidence of PPCs in the overall study population and phenotype patients based on nonmodifiable patient, surgical, and anesthesia characteristics; and examine the incidence of PPCs within each phenotypic subgroup; (2) Determine the optimal modifiable intraoperative ventilatory parameters associated with the lowest severity of PPCs within each phenotypic subgroup; and (3) Explore machine learning algorithms for predictive models of the incidence of PPCs on patient, surgical, and anesthesia characteristics as well as intraoperative ventilator parameters. The goal of this aim is to gain knowledge and training in machine learning to lay a foundation for postdoctoral training. Training: My long-term training goal is to become a leading nurse scientist in precision health using data science to improve patient outcomes following surgery, such as reducing PPCs. To achieve this goal, I have three short-term goals during my fellowship training: (1) gain knowledge and skills in research design to enhance precision health in anesthesiology to, (2) gain knowledge in advanced analytic techniques for conducting research using big data, and (3) gain an advanced understanding of pulmonary physiology and pathophysiology that influence anesthesia and patient surgical outcomes. This fellowship will allow me protected time to reach my training goals and to build a foundation for my long-term career goals. During the next twenty-six months as a trainee, I will obtain additional training in (1) research methods and design, (2) advanced statistical methods, (3) precision health, and (4) advanced pulmonary physiology and pathophysiology. PROJECT NARRATIVE This retrospective observational study leveraging electronic health records will improve our understanding of risks for lung complications after surgery that are associated with high mortality and morbidity. Knowledge gained from this study will inform development of interventions to reduce the incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications and improve the surgical patients’ outcomes.",Identification of Postoperative Pulmonary Complication Risk by Phenotyping Adult Surgical Patients who Underwent General Anesthesia with Mechanical Ventilation,10311613,F31NR020128,"['Address', 'Admission activity', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Age', 'Alveolar', 'Anatomy', 'Anesthesia procedures', 'Anesthesiology', 'Applications Grants', 'Area Under Curve', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Body mass index', 'Characteristics', 'Complication', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Day Surgery', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Fellowship', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'General Anesthesia', 'Goals', 'Health system', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospitals', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Intensive Care', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Length of Stay', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Institute of Nursing Research', 'Nurses', 'Observational Study', 'Odds Ratio', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Oxygen', 'Pathology', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Pneumonia', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Positive-Pressure Respiration', 'Postoperative Period', 'Precision Health', 'Problem Solving', 'Procedures', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Methodology', 'Resources', 'Respiratory Signs and Symptoms', 'Respiratory System', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Secondary to', 'Severities', 'Smoking', 'Statistical Methods', 'Subcategory', 'Subgroup', 'Surgical complication', 'Techniques', 'Tidal Volume', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Ventilator', 'Ventilator-induced lung injury', 'advanced analytics', 'base', 'career', 'clinically significant', 'comorbidity', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality', 'personalized care', 'personalized strategies', 'post-doctoral training', 'predictive modeling', 'pressure', 'prevent', 'provider adherence', 'recruit', 'reduce symptoms', 'sex', 'skills', 'study population', 'supplemental oxygen', 'support tools', 'surgery outcome', 'therapy development', 'ventilation']",NINR,DUKE UNIVERSITY,F31,2021,37662
"Advancing Quality and Outcomes Measurement in Rheumatology PROJECT SUMMARY Healthcare has changed rapidly in the last decade with the widespread use of electronic health records (EHRs) and the creation of national EHR-based data networks that aim to improve the quality of care. The American College of Rheumatology's RISE registry is a federally Qualified Clinical Data Registry that collects EHR data from the practices of almost 1000 rheumatologists nationally, analyzes these data centrally, and continuously feeds back performance on quality measures to practices via a web-based dashboard. In this K24 proposal, the applicant proposes to utilize novel methods in clinical informatics to increase the accuracy of quality measurement, while also developing and testing new EHR-based quality measures relevant to rheumatic diseases. The proposed research will leverage her strong research portfolio, including grants from the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, her successful track record of achieving national endorsement for EHR-based quality measures, existing data from over 1.4 million patients in the RISE database, and the outstanding institutional environment at the University of California, San Francisco. It will also support her ongoing career development in clinical informatics methods relevant to EHR-based clinical research. For this five year K24 award proposal, she plans to increase the time spent mentoring junior investigators in the field or quality and outcomes measurement in rheumatology, with the goal of helping trainees successfully launch academic research careers in patient- oriented research. Aligned with a comprehensive mentoring plan, the proposal outlines two specific aims, including using natural language processing to increase the accuracy of EHR-based quality measurement in RISE, and developing and validating new, prototype electronic clinical quality measures to monitor and address high impact gaps in care for patients with rheumatic disease. The work will prioritize outcome measures and use eMeasurement standards, including the Quality Data Model and Health Quality Measures Format to develop, specify and test measures. Measures developed through this research and mentoring program will be candidates for nationwide dissemination across rheumatology practices to improve care for individuals with rheumatic disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE This mid-career investigator award will support a program in patient-oriented research in rheumatic diseases at the University of California, San Francisco. The award will allow the applicant to expand her research on the development and validation of health care quality measures and support her mentoring of early investigators. The proposed research aims to create quality measures that can be deployed across rheumatology practices to improve the quality of care, while training new researchers to perform innovative patient-oriented research in the area of electronic health record-based quality and outcomes measurement.",Advancing Quality and Outcomes Measurement in Rheumatology,10070083,K24AR074534,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Area', 'Award', 'Back', 'Benchmarking', 'California', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Research', 'Collection', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Dictionary', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Feeds', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Gout', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'High Prevalence', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Infrastructure', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Mid-Career Clinical Scientist Award (K24)', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Online Systems', 'Ontology', 'Osteoporosis', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Preventive care', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Quality of Care', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rheumatism', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Rheumatology', 'Role', 'Safety', 'San Francisco', 'Scientist', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'college', 'comorbidity', 'dashboard', 'data mining', 'data modeling', 'data registry', 'data repository', 'data standards', 'design', 'digital', 'evidence base', 'health care quality', 'improved', 'informatics infrastructure', 'innovation', 'interest', 'learning progression', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'patient oriented research', 'patient registry', 'patient safety', 'programs', 'prototype', 'research study', 'rheumatologist', 'structured data', 'success', 'tool']",NIAMS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K24,2021,189666
"Impact of Telemedicine on Medicare Beneficiaries with Mental Illness PROJECT SUMMARY Access to mental health specialists is difficult for many patients in the U.S., particularly for the poor and those who live in rural communities. Telemental health is one potential solution for this access problem, and there has been rapid growth in the number of live video-based telemental health visits in the U.S. While there are numerous rigorous randomized-control trials comparing telemental health visits to in-person mental health specialist care, there have been little research on how telemental health is being used in real-world settings. The uptake of telemental health has been very uneven geographically, and what explains this variation is also largely unknown. Our mixed-methods proposal centers on filling these gaps in knowledge. Under the first aim, we will conduct a series of descriptive analyses of data on 75 million adults with Medicare or commercial insurance to understand how telemental health is being used in conjunction with in-person care and whether the growth of telemental health has decreased disparities in the use of mental health specialists among disadvantaged populations. Under the second aim, we seek to explain why there is geographic variation in uptake using robust statistical machine learning. Under the third aim, we exploit the variation in uptake to assess whether communities with greater telemental health penetration have experienced improvements in care for patients with mental illness. In the fourth aim we will conduct qualitative interviews with providers to complement the empirical analyses and understand the key contextual factors underlying our findings. Understanding how telemental health is being used, why there is variation in use of telemental health, and whether telemental health use is associated with higher quality care could help drive future telemental health interventions and influence the ongoing policy debate on telemedicine regulations and reimbursement. Together the results of these aims are consistent with the NIMH's expressed interest in innovative delivery models that can improve care for underserved communities. It is difficult for many patients with mental illness to access care from a mental health specialist. Telemental health is one way to potentially help these patients receive care and the number of such visits for mental illness has increased rapidly. In this project, we will study how telemental health is being used to care for patients with mental illness, what drives variation in use, and whether telemedicine is associated with receipt of higher quality care.",Impact of Telemedicine on Medicare Beneficiaries with Mental Illness,10063830,R01MH112829,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Congresses', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Diffusion', 'Disabled Persons', 'Emergency department visit', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Growth', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health system', 'Hospitalization', 'Improve Access', 'Insurance', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Laws', 'Literature', 'Low income', 'Medicaid', 'Medicare', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Penetration', 'Persons', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Provider', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Quality of Care', 'Randomized', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Rural', 'Rural Community', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Series', 'Specialist', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Telemedicine', 'Telemental', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Videoconferencing', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'beneficiary', 'care costs', 'contextual factors', 'control trial', 'demographics', 'design', 'disadvantaged population', 'experience', 'geographic difference', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'medical specialties', 'medication compliance', 'older patient', 'population health', 'programs', 'racial and ethnic disparities', 'rapid growth', 'rural area', 'severe mental illness', 'statistical and machine learning', 'trend', 'trial comparing', 'underserved community', 'uptake']",NIMH,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,R01,2021,643165
"Communicating narrative Concerns entered by RNs (CONCERN) PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Annually, more than 200,000 patients die in U.S. hospitals from cardiac arrest1 and over 130,000 patients inpatients deaths are attributed to sepsis.2 These deaths are preventable if patients who are at risk are detected earlier. Our prior work found that nursing documentation within electronic health records (EHRs) contains information that could contribute to early detection and treatment, but these data are not being analyzed and exposed by EHRs to clinicians to initiate interventions quickly enough to save patients.3–6 We defined a new source of predictive data by analyzing the frequency and types of nursing documentation that indicated nurses' increased surveillance and level of concern for a patient. These data documented in the 48 hours preceding a cardiac arrest and hospital mortality were predictive of the event.3 While clinicians strive to provide the best care, there is a systematic problem within hospital settings of non-optimal communication between nurses and doctors leading to delays in care for patient at risk.6–8,9 Well-designed and tested EHRs are able to trend data and support communication and decision making, but too often fall short of these goals and actually increase clinician cognitive load through fragmented information displays, “note bloat”, and information overload.10 Substitutable Medical Applications & Reusable Technologies (SMARTapps) using Fast Health Interoperability Resource (FHIR) standard allow for open sharing and use of innovations across EHR systems. The aim of this project is to design and evaluate a SMARTapp on FHIR used across two large academic medical centers that exposes to physicians and nurses our new predictive data source from nursing documentation to increase care team situational awareness of at risk patients to decrease preventable adverse outcomes. The SMARTapp we will design and evaluate is the Communicating Narrative Concerns Entered by RNs (CONCERN) Clinical Decision Support (CDS) system. This will be integrated at four hospitals part of two health systems, Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH) and Newton Wellesley Hospital (NWH), part of Partners Healthcare System (PHS) in Boston, and NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital-Columbia University Medical Center (NYP-CUMC) and The Allen Hospital, part of New York Presbyterian Health System (NYP) in New York. Specifically, we will: 1) validate desired thresholds for the CONCERN SMARTapp, 2) integrate the CONCERN SMARTapp for early warning of risky patient states within CDS tools, 3) evaluate the CONCERN SMARTapp on primary outcomes of in-hospital mortality and length of stay and secondary outcomes of cardiac arrest, unanticipated transfers to the intensive care unit, and 30-day hospital readmission rates. The methods we will use include: data-mining and natural language processing, factorial design surveys, simulation testing for evaluating team-based situational awareness, and outcomes evaluation in the Medical Intensive Care Units and Acute Care Units (non-ICU) at our study sites. Project narrative There are patients who die or have a bad outcome in the hospital and this could be prevented. Data in the nurses' notes could be used by computers and Apps to tell the care team that a patient is not doing well and that they should act more quickly. This project will build an App that makes it easier for the care team to see and understand that data and act quickly to save patients.",Communicating narrative Concerns entered by RNs (CONCERN),10105371,R01NR016941,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Acute', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Awareness', 'Big Data Methods', 'Boston', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Death', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Chiroptera', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Communication', 'Computers', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Documentation', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Early treatment', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronic Mail', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart Arrest', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Inpatients', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Length of Stay', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New York', 'Notification', 'Nurses', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Predictive Value', 'Presbyterian Church', 'Process', 'Proxy', 'Published Comment', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sepsis', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Woman', 'Work', 'acute care', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'clinically relevant', 'clinically significant', 'cognitive load', 'computerized', 'data mining', 'design', 'experience', 'falls', 'information display', 'innovation', 'interoperability', 'meetings', 'member', 'mortality', 'patient safety', 'patient subsets', 'point of care', 'prevent', 'preventable death', 'primary outcome', 'readmission rates', 'secondary outcome', 'simulation', 'software systems', 'support tools', 'tool', 'trend', 'user-friendly']",NINR,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2021,514581
"Identifying primary care patients at increased risk of atrial fibrillation for screening interventions Project Summary/Abstract Atrial Fibrillation (AF) increases the risk of stroke 5-fold and accounts for roughly 15% of all strokes in the United States. Many individuals may have undiagnosed AF whose arrhythmia does not prompt evaluation either because of minimal symptoms or brief episodes. Oral anticoagulation (OAC) is highly effective at reducing stroke risk in patients with AF, but is only prescribed to individuals with recognized disease. Identifying subjects with undiagnosed AF is important so they may be treated with OAC and prevent strokes from occurring. This project will help advance our knowledge of screening patients for undiagnosed AF in the primary care setting by identifying patients at high risk of developing AF for targeted clinic and home-based screening strategies. Fundamental questions of who to target and how to implement a screening program in the United States remain unanswered. To address these gaps in knowledge, the principal investigator (PI) proposes a career development program that blends rigorous methodologic and content area training with an innovative research agenda. This plan has three scientific objectives: 1) To identify predictors of AF incidence from electronic health record structured and free-text data, 2) To develop and implement an electronic algorithm that improves upon existing models to identify patients at increased risk for AF in a primary care population, and 3) To implement and evaluate feasibility, acceptability, appropriateness, and usability of a clinic and home-based screening program to identify undiagnosed AF. This project aligns with several objectives of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute’s Strategic Vision by implementing novel diagnostic tools to diagnose AF and prevent strokes, by optimizing clinical and implementation research to improve health and reduce disease, and leveraging emerging opportunities in data science, through the use of natural language processing of text data in the electronic health record, to improve identification of patients at high risk for AF. The long-term goal of this career development award is to establish the PI as an independent researcher with expertise in cardiovascular disease and targeting populations for prevention of cardiovascular disease events. Career development activities include training in biomedical informatics, data mining and risk prediction, survey research design, implementation research, and cardiovascular disease pathophysiology and clinical management through formal coursework, clinical shadowing, as well as mentorship by an exceptionally qualified team of senior scientists. Successful completion of this career development proposal will improve prediction of which patients are at the highest risk of developing AF, and evaluate how to use this risk information to implement an effective screening strategy in primary care. Pilot data from this award will lay the groundwork for a highly competitive application for NIH R01 funding. Project Narrative Atrial fibrillation increases the risk of ischemic stroke and the prevalence is estimated to increase from 5.2 million adults in the United States to more than 12 million by 2030, however, many additional individuals have undiagnosed disease. The proposed research program will significantly advance our understanding of screening for undiagnosed atrial fibrillation, by 1) improving identification of patients at high risk of developing atrial fibrillation, and 2) targeting patients at high risk of developing atrial fibrillation in the primary care setting with an efficient strategy for clinic and home-based screening. This program will significantly increase knowledge of how to overcome the real-world issue of how to effectively and efficiently screen for atrial fibrillation in clinical practice.",Identifying primary care patients at increased risk of atrial fibrillation for screening interventions,10188627,K01HL148506,"['Address', 'Adhesives', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anticoagulation', 'Area', 'Arrhythmia', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Award', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'General Hospitals', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Technology', 'Home environment', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Massachusetts', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Oral', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Health Care', 'Principal Investigator', 'Program Development', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Senior Scientist', 'Stroke', 'Stroke prevention', 'Structure', 'Survey Methodology', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Target Populations', 'Techniques', 'Text', 'Training', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'cardiovascular disorder prevention', 'career development', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'data mining', 'data registry', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'implementation research', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mHealth', 'medical specialties', 'mobile computing', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'patient screening', 'population based', 'practice setting', 'primary care setting', 'programs', 'prospective', 'randomized trial', 'risk minimization', 'risk prediction', 'screening', 'screening program', 'stroke risk', 'structured data', 'tool', 'usability']",NHLBI,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K01,2021,177788
