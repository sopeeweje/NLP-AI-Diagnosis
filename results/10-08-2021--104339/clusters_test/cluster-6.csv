"Ex vivo single molecule tools to analyze membrane receptor dynamics Membrane receptors play a crucial role in many physiological processes throughout the body by mediating communication between cells. Single molecule imaging has been used extensively to study membrane receptor assembly and stoichiometry in vitro using isolated protein and to a lesser extent cell culture. While studies in isolated cellular systems provide insight into many processes, they lack the context of the complex environment present in an animal where communication between cell types residing in tissue is critical for receptor activity. Single- molecule imaging of native proteins synthesized in vivo would provide a direct approach to measure processes, such as receptor dimerization, that regulate physiological activity. However, current methods are not capable of applying single molecule techniques to study the regulation of protein dynamics taking place within the complex environment of an animal. We have made recent advances in the development of ex vivo single molecule techniques to monitor changes in protein assembly that occur within specific organs. The goal of this proposal is to develop and validate ex vivo single molecule tools that provide new capabilities to monitor the properties of oligomeric membrane receptor assembly, resolve cell type and subcellular region specific single membrane receptors, and automate single molecule data analysis using a machine learning platform. This novel ex vivo technology will enable researchers to take a snap shot in time of the membrane receptor dynamics that took place in the mouse and monitor changes in membrane receptor assembly in response to changes in the animal's physiological environment such as disease and exposure to therapeutics. Membrane receptors are important therapeutic targets for many diseases and are expressed throughout the body. Understanding the role of receptor assembly in the complex environment of a live animal is an important step in understanding their mechanism of activation and regulation. We will develop ex vivo single-molecule methods that for the first time will enable quantitative studies of stoichiometry for receptors extracted from mice.",Ex vivo single molecule tools to analyze membrane receptor dynamics,10207891,R01GM138837,"['Address', 'Animal Communication', 'Animal Disease Models', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cardiac', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dimerization', 'Disease', 'Encapsulated', 'Environment', 'Exposure to', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'High Performance Computing', 'Image', 'In Vitro', 'Knock-in', 'Knock-in Mouse', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Mediating', 'Membrane', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'Organ', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Physiological', 'Physiological Processes', 'Play', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Process Measure', 'Property', 'Protein Dynamics', 'Proteins', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'RyR2', 'Ryanodine Receptor Calcium Release Channel', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Vesicle', 'alpha-SNAP', 'animal tissue', 'base', 'cell type', 'cluster computing', 'convolutional neural network', 'design', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'large datasets', 'molecular imaging', 'nanoscale', 'nanovesicle', 'novel', 'open source', 'postsynaptic neurons', 'presynaptic', 'prototype', 'receptor', 'response', 'sex', 'single molecule', 'stoichiometry', 'technique development', 'therapeutic target', 'tissue preparation', 'tool', 'trafficking']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY,R01,2021,299122
"Understanding membrane proteins’ allosteric modulation with cryo-EM Project Summary/Abstract My laboratory's research is focused on understanding the molecular mechanisms key to the regulation of membrane protein function and to the modulation of their output signaling. We use cryo-EM and advanced classification methods, such as manifold embedding, combined with modeling and molecular dynamics to study how ligands produce shifts in conformation equilibria and bias signaling output. We are currently studying two systems that allow us to study how different types of ligands influence the gating of ion channels. We are studying the role of lipids in triggering gating of mechanosensitive channels of the MscS family, a model system of membrane tension-sensing which can yield important information about the fundamental principles governing ion channel gating and the role that lipid-protein interactions play in this process. We have a longstanding interest in the mechanism and modulation of the ryanodine receptor (RyR), a calcium release channel fundamental to heart and skeletal function. We are using manifold embedding, a machine learning-based method to analyze cryo-EM images, to better understand how small molecules and ions such as calcium and ATP affect the conformational energy landscape of the channel. We aim to shed light on the gating mechanism of this very large ion channel, a prerequisite to understanding of its modulation by protein ligands, post-translational modifications and drugs. Our approach to these fundamental problems is to use a commbination of cryo-electron microscopy, advanced image classification techniques, modelling and molecular dynamics simulations to delineate allosteric pathways mechanistically and then test proposed models with biophysical methods such as single-channel measurements, HDX-MS and mutagenesis. Our ultimate aim is to greatly increase our molecular understanding of the gating and allosteric modulation of ion channels. Progress towards such knowledge has the potential to open the way for the design of small molecule allosteric modulators with very well controlled effects on their targets, aiding the development of drugs with limited side effects. A longer-term aim is to further develp and use our tools towards gaining a better understanding of allosteric modulation in other classes of membrane proteins of therapeutic importance. In particular, G protein-coupled receptor ligands can induce the selective binding of different transducers in a process called biased signaling. The molecular mechanisms at play in this process are still poorly understood despite their fundamental importance for the development of safer drugs. Project Narrative Ion channels are involved in a large number of vital processes, such as heart and muscle function for the ryanodine receptor and function of kidneys and regulation of blood pressure for mechanosensitive channels. This work focuses on understanding the function and regulation of ion channels. Better understanding of small ligand and lipid-protein interactions in these channels can lead more generally to a better understanding of ion channels function and to the design of drugs treating the numerous diseases associated with their malfunction.",Understanding membrane proteins’ allosteric modulation with cryo-EM,10178048,R35GM133598,"['Affect', 'Binding', 'Biological Models', 'Calcium', 'Classification', 'Cryoelectron Microscopy', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Design', 'Family', 'G-Protein-Coupled Receptors', 'Heart', 'Image', 'Ion Channel', 'Ion Channel Gating', 'Ions', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratory Research', 'Lead', 'Ligands', 'Light', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Membrane', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Muscle function', 'Mutagenesis', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Regulation', 'Renal function', 'Role', 'Ryanodine Receptor Calcium Release Channel', 'Signal Transduction', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Transducers', 'Work', 'base', 'biophysical techniques', 'blood pressure regulation', 'design', 'drug development', 'heart function', 'interest', 'molecular dynamics', 'protein function', 'side effect', 'skeletal', 'small molecule', 'therapeutic protein', 'tool']",NIGMS,ADVANCED SCIENCE RESEARCH CENTER,R35,2021,392500
"Altering Hepatitis B Virus assembly through pharmacological intervention Project Summary/Abstract Viruses are one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide, with Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) being one of the most infectious and prevalent among them. Roughly 250 million people worldwide suffer from chronic HBV infection, including 1-2 million in the United States. Of those infected, approximately 15-25% will develop se- rious liver problems, including cirrhosis, cancer, and ultimately failure, leading to 600,000 deaths annually. While therapies exist to manage chronic HBV infection, all target viral genomic processes such as reverse transcription and DNA replication, and none provide a cure due to viral persistence and resistance. A promising orthogonal approach to eliminating infection is to target HBV's capsid, the protein shell that encapsulates the viral genome. The Finn laboratory has previously developed compounds that induce the misdirected assembly of non-functional HBV capsids, showing that small molecules have the power to affect the structures of these large multi-protein assemblies. While much is known about the structures of the intermolecular interactions with these compounds identiﬁed after the fact, little about the dynamics of such interactions has been explored, and a predictive under- standing of functional (antiviral) binding has yet to be developed. Both deﬁciencies will begin to be addressed in this program. Using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations coupled with in vitro experiments on HepAD38 cells, the PIs have identiﬁed seven compounds based on motifs previously unknown to interact with HBV that target the capsid assembly process. These compounds bind in a known pocket at the interface of two capsid-protein (Cp) dimers, possess moderate antiviral activity, and low toxicity. In the ﬁrst aim, using docking, free-energy perturba- tion, and synthetic chemistry, the PIs will optimize the lead compound to improve its efﬁcacy against HBV. In the second aim, using molecular dynamics simulations, advanced free-energy calculations, and experimental assays on different HBV protein oligomers, up to and including the whole virus capsid, the PIs will determine how small molecules interfere with capsid assembly. Both aims will beneﬁt from using a machine-learning-based classiﬁ- cation scheme as well as novel enhanced sampling methods. The lessons learned here concerning how small molecules can re-direct the assembly pathway into unproductive conformations can be generalized for application to other viruses. Project Narrative In spite of the dramatic increase in our understanding of the structure and properties of hepatitis B virus (HBV), this pathogen remains a major threat to human health. That knowledge also makes HBV an important test case for new antiviral strategies. This project aims to limit the impact of HBV by using computer simulations and synthetic chemistry to develop an improved understanding of the assembly process of HBV as well as new drugs that can eliminate HBV infection in ways that may be generalized to other pathogenic viruses.",Altering Hepatitis B Virus assembly through pharmacological intervention,10159864,R01AI148740,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Capsid', 'Capsid Proteins', 'Cations', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic Hepatitis B', 'Cirrhosis', 'Classification', 'Classification Scheme', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Coupled', 'Cryoelectron Microscopy', 'DNA biosynthesis', 'Development', 'Docking', 'Encapsulated', 'Equilibrium', 'Failure', 'Free Energy', 'Goals', 'HIV-1', 'Health', 'Hepatitis B Virus', 'Human', 'Image', 'In Vitro', 'Infection', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Liver', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmacology', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protein Conformation', 'Protein Dynamics', 'Resistance', 'Reverse Transcription', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Structure', 'Synthesis Chemistry', 'Testing', 'Toxic effect', 'United States', 'Viral', 'Viral Genome', 'Virus', 'Virus Assembly', 'Virus Diseases', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'design', 'dimer', 'drug development', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'intermolecular interaction', 'lead optimization', 'molecular dynamics', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic virus', 'programs', 'protein oligomer', 'protein protein interaction', 'protein structure', 'simulation', 'small molecule', 'success', 'viral genomics']",NIAID,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2021,393060
"Simulation of Proton Translocation in Biomolecules PROJECT SUMMARY  The transport of protons in biomolecular systems is a phenomenon of fundamental importance to processes such as ATP synthesis, enzyme catalysis, the maintenance of pH gradients, proton pumping, viral infection, and substrate/ion transport across membranes via protein transporters, symporters, and antiporters. Modeling biomolecular proton translocation in silico is a significant challenge due to the complex chemical reactions involved in Grotthuss proton shutting between water molecules and with protonatable amino acids, as well as the complexity of the target biomolecular systems. In most cases, it is not only important to understand the mechanism of proton binding and transport, but also its coupling to other mechanistically relevant biomolecular processes, such as protein conformational changes, substrate binding, other protonation events, and dynamic hydration.  In this project the continued development and application of a powerful multiscale computer simulation methodology is described for the study of proton transport in several key classes of proton translocating biomolecular systems, including channels (influenza A and B M2 channels), antiporters/symporters (ClC Cl-/H+ antiporter and phosphate transporter, respectively), and transporters (proton-coupled oligopeptide transporter and EmrE multidrug transporter). The overall research plan is made possible by a novel reactive molecular dynamics simulation approach integrated with quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) methods that allows for the study of explicit long-length and -time scale proton transport through water molecules and ionizable molecular groups in hydrogen-bonded networks, as well as by new innovations in enhanced free energy sampling methodology, machine learning, kinetic network theory, and coarse-graining. A primary goal in the research with this methodology in hand is to reveal the mechanisms of proton transport, as well as its coupling to hydration and conformational changes, in the above mentioned biomolecular systems. All of these studies will be carried out in collaboration with leading experimentalists, while continuing to add a new dimension to the field of biomolecular computer simulation as a whole. 1 PROJECT NARRATIVE  In this project, computer simulations will be used to study proton transport in several important biomolecular systems. Proton translocation is of fundamental significance throughout biology, as demonstrated by the pH-dependence of biomolecular structure and function and the central role of transmembrane proton gradients in bioenergy conversion. Moreover, understanding proton transport is of fundamental importance and direct relevance to numerous aspects of human health, including metabolism, aging, diabetes, neurodegeneration, retinal degeneration, antivral and anti-bacterial therapeutics, and homeostasis. 1",Simulation of Proton Translocation in Biomolecules,10167719,R01GM053148,"['ATP Synthesis Pathway', 'Achievement', 'Aging', 'Agreement', 'Amino Acids', 'Anions', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Binding', 'Biology', 'Carrier Proteins', 'Catalysis', 'Charge', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consult', 'Coupled', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diffusion', 'Dimensions', 'Elements', 'Entropy', 'Enzymes', 'Event', 'Free Energy', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Hydration status', 'Hydrogen Bonding', 'Influenza', 'Influenza A virus', 'Influenza B Virus', 'Inorganic Phosphate Transporter', 'Ion Transport', 'Kinetics', 'Length', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Membrane', 'Metabolism', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Motion', 'Mutation', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Oligopeptides', 'Outcome', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Process', 'Progress Reports', 'Protein Conformation', 'Proteins', 'Proton Pump', 'Protons', 'Publishing', 'Quantum Mechanics', 'Reaction', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Retinal Degeneration', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Biases', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Transport Process', 'Travel', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Virus Diseases', 'Water', 'Wisconsin', 'anti-influenza drug', 'antiporter', 'chemical bond', 'chemical reaction', 'experimental study', 'in silico', 'innovation', 'inorganic phosphate', 'insight', 'kinetic model', 'migration', 'molecular dynamics', 'molecular mechanics', 'multi drug transporter', 'novel', 'pH gradient', 'protonation', 'quantum', 'simulation', 'symporter', 'theories']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R01,2021,310328
"Open data-driven infrastructure for building biomolecular force fields for predictive biophysics and drug design PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The study of biomolecular interactions and design of new therapeutics requires accurate physical models of the atomistic interactions between small molecules and biological macromolecules. Over the least few decades, molecular mechanics force ﬁelds have demonstrated the potential that physical models hold for quantitative biophysical modeling and predictive molecular design. However, a signiﬁcant technology gap exists in our ability to build force ﬁelds that achieve high accuracy, can be systematically improved in a statistically robust manner, be extended to new areas of chemistry, can model post-translational and covalent modiﬁcations, are able to quantify systematic errors in predictions, and can be broadly applied across a high-performance software packages. In this project, we aim to bridge this technology gap to enable new generations of accurate quantitative biomolec- ular modeling and (bio)molecular design for chemical biology and drug discovery. In Aim 1, we will produce a modern, open infrastructure to enable practitioners to rapidly and conveniently construct and employ accurate and statistically robust physical force ﬁelds via automated machine learning methods. In Aim 2, we will construct open, machine-readable experimental and quantum chemical datasets that will accelerate next-generation force ﬁeld development. In Aim 3, we will develop statistically robust Bayesian inference techniques to enable the auto- mated construction of type assignment schemes that avoid overﬁtting and selection of physical functional forms statistically justﬁed by the data. This approach will also provide an estimate of the systematic error in predicted properties arising from uncertainty in parameters or functional form choices—generally the dominant source of error—to be quantiﬁed with little added expense. In Aim 4, we will integrate and apply this infrastructure to produce open, transferable, self-consistent force ﬁelds that achieve high accuracy and broad coverage for modeling small molecule interactions with biomolecules (including unnatural amino or nucleic acids and covalent modiﬁcations by organic molecules), with the ultimate goal of covering all major biomolecules. This research is signiﬁcant in that the technology developed in this project has the potential to radically transform the study of biomolecular phenomena by providing highly accurate force ﬁelds with exceptionally broad chemical coverage via fully consistent parameterization of organic (bio)molecules. In addition, we will produce new tools to automate force ﬁeld creation and tailoring to speciﬁc problem domains, quantify the systematic error in predictions, and identify new data for improving force ﬁeld accuracy. This will greatly improve our ability to study diverse biophysical processes at the molecular level, and to rationally design new small-molecule, protein, and nucleic acid therapeutics. This approach will bring statistical rigor to the ﬁeld of force ﬁeld construction and application by providing a means to make data-driven decisions, while enhancing reproducibility by enabling it to become a rigorous and reproducible science using a fully open infrastructure and datasets. PROJECT NARRATIVE Scientists use computer simulations of proteins, DNA, and RNA, at atomic detail, to learn how these molecules of life do their jobs. They also use simulations to help design new medications – compounds that can bind and inﬂuence the behavior of these molecules of life, and thereby block diseases at the molecular level. We aim to greatly increase the utility of all of these simulations by improving the accuracy of the formulas they use to compute the forces acting between atoms.",Open data-driven infrastructure for building biomolecular force fields for predictive biophysics and drug design,10105344,R01GM132386,"['Address', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biophysical Process', 'Biophysics', 'Charge', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Design', 'Electrostatics', 'Ensure', 'Error Sources', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Investigation', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Occupations', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Readability', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Scheme', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Therapeutic', 'Thermodynamics', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior influence', 'biophysical model', 'chemical synthesis', 'cheminformatics', 'data infrastructure', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'macromolecule', 'models and simulation', 'molecular mechanics', 'multidisciplinary', 'new technology', 'next generation', 'novel therapeutics', 'nucleic acid-based therapeutics', 'open data', 'open source', 'physical model', 'physical property', 'quantum', 'simulation', 'simulation software', 'small molecule', 'software infrastructure', 'sound', 'tool', 'unnatural amino acids']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO,R01,2021,608856
"Combined computational and structural studies to create novel macromolecular recognition properties PROJECT SUMMARY The design of macromolecular binding interactions and complexes, and corresponding alteration of binding specificity, is a challenging endeavor that remains recalcitrant to computational approaches. This is true both for the creation of protein-protein complexes (which are driven by a enthalpic changes established primarily by stereochemical complementarity, balanced against large competing entropic changes) and for the redesign of protein-DNA complexes (which are heavily dependent upon DNA bending, hydrogen-bonds, electrostatic contacts, and the presence of solvent and counterions throughout the molecular interface). Over the past several years we have collaborated with several computational groups to help develop and validate computational approaches for the design and optimization of protein-protein recognition, protein-DNA recognition, and protein-small molecule recognition. Those studies have contributed to several new computational engineering approaches, including hybrid strategies that combine ab initio design of protein folds and binding sites, the ‘Rotamer Interaction Feld’ (RIF) docking protocol for efficient sampling of protein sequence and conformation, and novel parametric design approaches to create new tandem repeat proteins. We propose to continue this work through two specific aims to further develop and improve upon computational approaches for protein design. As part of this project, we will solve atomic resolution crystal structures of many selected and designed molecular complexes and provide them to our immediate collaborators as well as to a public structure prediction project, for computational prediction challenges. Aim 1. We will design and characterize novel self-associating circular tandem repeat proteins (using both de novo computational design and using high-throughput selections) and then further design them to undergo ligand-induced protein-protein association. Beyond the challenge of combining protein scaffold design and ligand binding design, the motivation for this aim is to determine the structural and mechanistic features of small molecule ligand-binding, and balance of forces, that facilitate ligand-induced protein-protein association. Aim 2. We will improve our understanding and ability to design novel protein-DNA recognition specificities and behaviors. To accomplish this, we will: (1) Systematically select and optimize a series of variants of a model DNA-binding protein, that display altered binding specificity across two regions of partially overlapping sequential clusters of basepairs and neighboring protein residues. (2) Determine the high-resolution structures and binding behavior of each construct. (3) Supervise blinded computational efforts, using multiple approaches, to predict the same structures. (4) Compare and analyze the results of computational predictions versus multiple computational prediction strategies to define features influencing predictive accuracy. For both aims, we will further exploit our crystallographic structures by computationally ‘reverse engineering’ each construct using validated protein structures, to further understand the performance of design approaches. PROJECT NARRATIVE The redesign of a macromolecular binding interfaces and corresponding alteration of specificity is a challenging endeavor that remains recalcitrant to structure-based computational approaches. This is true both for the creation of novel protein-protein complexes and binding specificities, as well as for the creation of new DNA-binding proteins.

"Defining the multi-dimensional code of zinc finger specificity-Resubmission-1 Project Summary The Cys2His2 zinc finger DNA-binding domain is the most common domain in human yet the DNA-binding specificities for the great majority of these proteins remain undefined. Mutations in many of these domains, both with and without known DNA-binding data, have been linked to a host of diseases from Alzheimers (REST) to Cancer (e.g. Slug, WT1, CTCF). Therefore, the characterization of these proteins holds great value. Unfortunately common methodologies used to determine the DNA-binding specificity of transcription factors have failed to address the zinc finger, at least in part because of an inability to fully define the large target specificities required of the average mammalian zinc finger protein. Even when ChIP-Seq data exists it is limited because the size of the genome does not allow us to capture the full binding potential of a factor that could offer a ≥21bp target sequence. As a result, without a comprehensive understanding of a protein’s binding potential, SNPs across the genome will continue to represent potential binding sites that we are unable to predict. In sum, decades of research have enlightened our understanding of this domain but we are still in the dark when it comes to its function as a transcription factors. Recently we have taken an alternative approach to define this domain, demonstrating that a synthetic, one-by-one screen of individual zinc fingers allows us to predict the specificity of multi-fingered proteins with similar or greater accuracy than all prior prediction algorithms. However, this approach fails to take into consideration the influences that adjacent fingers have on one another. We have produced the equivalent of a comprehensive snapshot of what a zinc finger is capable of in just one of many potential contextual environments. Here we propose to scale this approach and screen the zinc finger under an inclusive set of contextual environments. We will consider the most common direct and indirect influences on adjacent finger binding as well as factors that impact the geometry with which the zinc fingers engage the DNA. We will use these results to provide a complete picture of how adjacent zinc fingers determine their specificity and by scaffolding these two-fingered models, predict and design the specificity of large, multi-fingered proteins. In this way, we will define a multi-dimensional code of zinc finger specificity that allows us to predict all zinc finger DNA-binding specificities, how any neighbor finger context would modify this specificity, and the factors that result in adjacent finger incompatibility and loss of DNA-binding function. We will apply this model to predict the specificity of all human zinc finger proteins, validate these predictions through in vivo characterization of an informed set of transcription factors, and test predicted mechanisms of multi-fingered binding with designer, artificial factors. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because the ZF domain is the most common in human yet it remains largely uncharacterized. A holistic understanding of ZF function will provide insight into how ZF mutations are related to disease and allow us to predict harmful binding sites due to SNPs across the genome.",Defining the multi-dimensional code of zinc finger specificity-Resubmission-1,10093062,R01GM118851,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amino Acids', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'ChIP-seq', 'Charge', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Comprehension', 'DNA', 'DNA Binding', 'DNA Binding Domain', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Environment', 'Exposure to', 'Fingers', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammals', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Nucleotides', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Series', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'WT1 gene', 'Work', 'Zinc Fingers', 'base', 'design', 'exhaustion', 'experimental study', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'loss of function', 'model design', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'scaffold', 'screening', 'slug', 'transcription factor', 'user-friendly', 'web site']",NIGMS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2021,393339
"Predicting and analyzing variation in cellular interactomes Project Summary Over the last two decades, significant experimental efforts have determined large sets of “reference” interactions for humans and other model organisms, along with substantial knowledge about the binding specificities of proteins, including for a large fraction of human transcription factors (TFs). The resulting data have proven to be an incredibly useful resource for understanding how cells function; nevertheless, they do not capture how molecular interactions and networks are different from the reference across individuals. Indeed, while human genomes in both healthy and disease populations are rapidly being sequenced, the corresponding individual-specific interaction networks remain largely unexamined; this represents a major gap in our knowledge, as mutations that alter molecular interactions underlie a wide range of human diseases. Further, the substantial amount of genetic variation across populations makes it infeasible in the near term to experimentally determine per-individual interaction networks. Thus our long-term goal is to develop computational methods to uncover whether and how mutations within coding and non-coding portions of the genome perturb cellular interactions and networks. Our specific aims are: (1) We will develop computational structure-based approaches to identify and catalog, at proteome-scale, variations within proteins that are likely to impact their ability to bind with DNA, RNA, small molecules, peptides or ions, thereby providing a comprehensive resource for analyzing protein interaction variation. (2) We will develop novel structure-based and probabilistic methods to predict how DNA-binding specificities are altered when a TF is mutated; since mutated TFs have been linked to numerous diseases, this will be a great aid in understanding disease networks and pathology. (3) We will develop new methods to uncover non-coding somatic mutations that alter human regulatory networks in cancer; this is a critical step towards ultimately uncovering patient-specific cancer networks. Overall by pursuing these aims—which integrate mutational information with existing knowledge about reference interactions, interfaces and specificities—we will develop novel computational methods that will significantly advance our understanding of molecular interactions perturbed in disease and healthy contexts. Narrative The proposed research will yield new software tools that predict whether specific genetic mutations alter molecular interactions and networks. Since many human diseases are caused by mutations that affect molecular interactions, this research will expand our understanding of the underlying basis of disease and will provide new avenues for diagnosis and treatment.",Predicting and analyzing variation in cellular interactomes,10112245,R01GM076275,"['Affect', 'Alleles', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animal Model', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Catalogs', 'Cell physiology', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA', 'DNA Binding', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'DNA-Protein Interaction', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Internet', 'Ions', 'Knowledge', 'Ligand Binding', 'Link', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Organism', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peptides', 'Play', 'Population', 'Property', 'Protein Analysis', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'RNA', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Software Tools', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Zinc Fingers', 'base', 'cancer genome', 'disease-causing mutation', 'experimental study', 'human disease', 'improved', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'predictive tools', 'preference', 'small molecule', 'software development', 'transcription factor', 'tumor', 'virtual']",NIGMS,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,312660
"High Resolution Modeling and Design of T-Cell Receptors Accurate modeling of the structure and recognition of adaptive immune receptors is a major challenge in computational biology. Despite a shared immunoglobulin structural framework, highly variable antigen binding loop sequences and structures, with intrinsic dynamics and binding conformational changes, are often not accurately represented or correctly modeled using current algorithms. There is an even greater need to address this challenge due to the rapidly growing field of immune sequencing, which often results in thousands of sequences of antigen-specific immune receptors from the repertoire of a single individual per experiment. In the absence of reliable modeling tools, the observed shared sequence motifs and areas of divergence lack a structural and mechanistic explanation, given that experimental structural characterization is not practical or feasible for more than a handful of molecules. The focus of this application is on T cell receptors (TCRs), which recognize antigenic peptides by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), leading to the cellular immune response. We will develop advanced modeling and design algorithms to address the challenges of flexible loop modeling through informatics and knowledge-based developments to help unravel their recognition code. This will entail the development of algorithms to reliably model TCR structures from sequence (Aim 1), model TCR recognition of peptide-MHCs through docking (Aim 2), and design TCR recognition through loop engineering (Aim 3). These Aims will be accomplished through validation against existing experimental structural and affinity data, as well as close partnership with experimental laboratories that will provide sequence, structural, dynamic, and binding measurements of TCRs, and validate affinity and structure of designed receptors. Collectively, these developments will allow the illumination of the mechanistics underpinning recognition by specific and repertoire-level TCRs from sequence, improved loop modeling and docking algorithms, and the capability to effectively control and engineer TCR recognition through structure-based design. T cell receptors are exceptionally diverse and capable of engaging a broad array of antigens, and are of high interest as therapeutics and in the study of immune response to diseases and viruses. This goal of this project is to generate a robust modeling and design framework to accurately predict structures of T cell receptors from sequence, model antigen recognition, and to design new T cell receptors with desired targeting capabilities, which will be applied to T cell receptors from immune repertoire sequencing efforts and those of medical and therapeutic interest.",High Resolution Modeling and Design of T-Cell Receptors,10168567,R01GM126299,"['Address', 'Affinity', 'Algorithm Design', 'Algorithms', 'Antibodies', 'Antigens', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Biophysics', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Complementarity Determining Regions', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Engineering', 'Epitopes', 'Exhibits', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunity', 'Immunologic Receptors', 'Immunology', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Laboratories', 'Libraries', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Histocompatibility Complex', 'Measurement', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Motion', 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance', 'Peptides', 'Performance', 'Protein Engineering', 'Protocols documentation', 'Receptor Cell', 'Resolution', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Sampling', 'Specificity', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'T-Cell Receptor', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'Work', 'X-Ray Crystallography', 'algorithm development', 'antigen binding', 'antigen-specific T cells', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'deep sequencing', 'design', 'engineered T cells', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'immunoglobulin structure', 'improved', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'large datasets', 'model design', 'molecular recognition', 'mutant', 'novel', 'receptor', 'response', 'tool']",NIGMS,"UNIV OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK",R01,2021,321398
"Methods for determination of glycoprotein glycosylation similarities among disease states Abstract This application addresses NIGMS PAR-17-045 “Focused Technology Research and Development (R01)”. This initiative supports projects that focus solely on development of technologies with the potential to enable biomedical research. Dysregulation of the cellular microenvironment occurs in cancers, neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric diseases. Known as the matrisome, the set of extracellular matrix and cell surface molecules control the availability of growth factors to cellular receptors and the mechanical-physical properties of the cell microenvironment. Currently, the limited understanding of regulation of matrisome glycosylation hinders understanding of the roles of glycosylation-dependent matrisome networks in the basic mechanisms necessary for targeted intervention of many diseases. Matrisome function depends on networks of interaction among glycosylated proteins and glycan-binding lectins. It is not possible using present proteomics and glycoproteomics methods to compare using rigorous statistics similarities of glycoproteins that differ by disease-related changes in site-specific glycosylation. We propose to develop technologies to meet this need. Present proteomics methods quantify proteins using a few representative peptides per gene product; sequence coverage for most proteins is low. Such low sequence coverage does not suffice to reconstruct the predominant glycosylated proteoforms active in a biological context. We propose to develop technologies to compare glycoprotein similarities among biological sample sets. To do this, we will develop MS acquisition and bioinformatics methods for rapid, sensitive and reproducible mapping of glycoprotein glycosylation to enable statistically rigorous comparison of glycoprotein similarities. By making these technologies available, we will enable a new level of understanding of the roles of matrisome networks in human diseases. Project narrative The matrisome consists of glycosylated extracellular matrix and cell surface proteins that surround cells and support normal physiological activity. While it is known that glycosylation changes during disease processes, it has not been possible to quantitatively compare glycoprotein structure among biological samples. We aim to develop technologies to meet this need.",Methods for determination of glycoprotein glycosylation similarities among disease states,10194553,R01GM133963,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Binding', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biomedical Research', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'CSPG3 gene', 'Cell Surface Proteins', 'Cell surface', 'Cells', 'Chondroitin Sulfate Proteoglycan', 'Collagen', 'Complex', 'Core Protein', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Dissociation', 'Electron Transport', 'Environment', 'Enzymes', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Family', 'Functional disorder', 'Genes', 'Glycopeptides', 'Glycoproteins', 'Growth Factor', 'Growth Factor Receptors', 'Heart', 'Heparitin Sulfate', 'Intelligence', 'Intervention', 'Ions', 'Knowledge', 'Lectin', 'Liquid Chromatography', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mechanics', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Morphogenesis', 'National Institute of General Medical Sciences', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Pathway interactions', 'Peptides', 'Physiological', 'Polysaccharides', 'Process', 'Protein Glycosylation', 'Proteins', 'Proteoglycan', 'Proteomics', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', 'Regulation', 'Reproducibility', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Signal Pathway', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Tissues', 'aggrecan', 'bioinformatics tool', 'brevican', 'cell growth', 'data acquisition', 'data to knowledge', 'extracellular', 'gene product', 'glycoprotein structure', 'glycoproteomics', 'glycosylation', 'human disease', 'hydrophilicity', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'pathogen', 'physical property', 'rapid technique', 'receptor', 'statistics', 'technology development', 'technology research and development', 'versican']",NIGMS,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,R01,2021,420750
"Blending deep learning with probabilistic mechanistic models to predict and understand the evolution and function of adaptive immune receptors Project Summary Scientific understanding of adaptive immune receptors (i.e. antibodies and T cell receptors) has the potential to revolutionize prophylaxis, diagnosis, and treatment of disease. High‐throughput DNA sequencing and functional experiments have now brought the study of adaptive immune receptors into the big‐data era. To realize this potential of these data they must be matched with appropriately powerful analytical techniques. Existing probabilistic and mechanistic models are insufficient to capture the complexities of these data, while a naïve application of machine learning cannot leverage our profound existing knowledge of the immune system. The goal of this project is to blend deep learning with mechanistic modeling in order to predict and understand the evolution and function of adaptive immune receptors. Aim 1: Develop generative models of immune receptor sequences that capture the complexity of real adaptive immune receptor repertoires. These will combine deep learning along with our knowledge of VDJ recombination, and provide a rigorous platform for detailed repertoire comparison. Aim 2: Develop quantitative mechanistic models of antibody somatic hypermutation that incorporate the underlying biochemical processes. Estimate intractable likelihoods using deep learning to infer important latent variables, and validate models using knock‐out experiments in cell lines. Aim 3: Develop hybrid deep learning models to predict binding properties from sequence data, combining large experimentally‐derived binding data with even larger sets of immune sequences from human immune memory samples. Incorporate structural information via 3D convolution or distance‐based penalties. These tools will reveal the full power of immune repertoire data for medical applications. We will obtain more rigorous comparisons of repertoires via their distribution in a relevant space. These will reveal the effects of immune perturbations such as vaccination and disease, allowing us to pick out sequences that are impacted by these perturbations. We will have a greater quantitative understanding of somatic hypermutation in vivo, and statistical models that appropriately capture long‐range effects of collections of mutations. We will also have algorithms that will be able to combine repertoire data and sparse binding data to predict binding properties. Put together, these advances will enable rational vaccine design, treatment for autoimmune disease, and identification of T cells that are promising candidates for cancer immunotherapy. Project Narrative Adaptive immune receptors (i.e. antibodies and T cell receptors) enable our body to fight off disease, “remember” pathogens, and train the immune system through vaccination. Immunologists have learned via high‐throughput sequencing that adaptive immune receptors have a truly remarkable diversity. In this proposal, we develop machine‐learning methods for these sequence data, which will allow us to predict the maturation, statistical distribution, and binding properties of adaptive immune receptors, and thus to better design vaccinations, autoimmune disease treatment, and immunotherapy treatment for cancer.",Blending deep learning with probabilistic mechanistic models to predict and understand the evolution and function of adaptive immune receptors,10159730,R01AI146028,"['3-Dimensional', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Affinity', 'Antigens', 'Architecture', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Automobile Driving', 'Big Data', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Process', 'Categories', 'Cell Line', 'Characteristics', 'Collection', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Entropy', 'Evolution', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Gene Conversion', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'High-Throughput DNA Sequencing', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunoglobulin Somatic Hypermutation', 'Immunologic Memory', 'Immunologic Receptors', 'Immunological Models', 'Immunologics', 'Immunologist', 'Immunology', 'Immunotherapy', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Knock-out', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Mutation', 'Pathway interactions', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Prophylactic treatment', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Statistical Distributions', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'T-Cell Receptor', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'T-cell receptor repertoire', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Update', 'V(D)J Recombination', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccine Design', 'Vaccines', 'Validation', 'Work', 'algorithm training', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'biochemical model', 'cancer immunotherapy', 'cancer therapy', 'complex data', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'deep sequencing', 'design', 'experimental study', 'fighting', 'functional group', 'in vivo', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'large datasets', 'machine learning method', 'markov model', 'pathogen', 'progenitor', 'receptor', 'repaired', 'response', 'success', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool']",NIAID,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2021,689648
"Intelligently predicting viral spillover risks from bats and other wild mammals PROJECT SUMMARY The transmission or ‘spillover’ of wildlife viruses to humans is a critical threat to global health, with outbreaks of viral pathogens like filoviruses, paramyxoviruses, and coronaviruses all originating in wild mammals. A key outstanding question is whether specific taxonomic groups, such as bats, warrant extra surveillance as ‘special reservoirs’ of viruses that are potentially pathogenic to humans. However, existing host-virus datasets are not sufficiently resolved to predict fine-grain risk for species or genera. An effective response must therefore address two core aims: (i) synthesizing knowledge regarding virus-to-mammal interactions; and (ii) using that knowledgebase to robustly predict future spillover events (i.e., zoonotic risk). To enable robust analysis and reusability of public datasets of NIAID’s Bioinformatics Resource Center (BRC; especially NCBI Virus and Virus Pathogen Resources, ViPR), the project will develop Host-Virus Data Intelligence to address three main problems for data reuse: confidence of the taxonomic assignments of mammals and viruses in observations; confidence in the evidence for proposed mammal-virus interactions; and connecting all the relevant data in published texts that are hidden from existing databases. The project team will construct a novel bioinformatic pipeline that will digitally connect taxonomic knowledge, use it to search dark data to find evidence of potential host-virus interactions, and then link it together using metadata layers (‘data about the data’) to form a more expansive host-virus knowledge graph than previously feasible. The project’s computational approach leverages information extraction methods in natural language processing as well as novel applications of artificial intelligence methods such as probabilistic inductive logic programming. A key anticipated outcome is to expand the dataset of host-virus interactions by 3-fold compared to comprehensive existing datasets. The proposed project will lay the foundation for a new generation of work reusing host-virus interaction data to test previously inaccessible hypotheses about how species’ traits impact viral spillover to humans. Shifting the paradigm to graph-based analyses, compared to purely taxonomic representations of host-virus interactions, will allow researchers to directly investigate the impact of ecosystem structure and human encroachment upon viral loads. Determining whether all mammals have equal risk of viral spillover, or whether some groups have higher taxon-specific zoonotic risk (e.g., horseshoe bats, murid rodents), is critical information for public health workers and epidemiologists. More definitive risk quantification will also help researchers identify which ecophysiological adaptations predispose certain groups to tolerating more viruses, which may in turn lead to clinical treatments by modeling the immune responses of wild mammals. Filling the identified gaps in host-virus knowledge is therefore essential to aid the progress of zoonotic disease research in the wake of COVID-19. PROJECT NARRATIVE Synthesizing scientific data about mammal-to-virus interactions is essential to predicting the risk of future events like the COVID-19 pandemic. The project overcomes major obstacles to full and accurate reuse of existing mammal-virus data by applying computational methods for unifying relevant but disconnected data from published sources. Anticipated results will triple available knowledge, opening the door for asking whether some mammals carry more viruses than others and why with unprecedented levels of precision.",Intelligently predicting viral spillover risks from bats and other wild mammals,10289637,R21AI164268,"['Address', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attention', 'Base Sequence', 'Bioinformatics', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Chiroptera', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coronavirus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Ecology', 'Ecosystem', 'Epidemiologist', 'Event', 'FAIR principles', 'Feces', 'Filovirus', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Graph', 'Human', 'Immune Tolerance', 'Immune response', 'Immunological Models', 'Infectious Diseases Research', 'Information Retrieval', 'Infrastructure', 'Intelligence', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Logic', 'Mammals', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Muridae', 'Names', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Paramyxovirus', 'Pathogenicity', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Rodent', 'Sampling', 'Serology', 'Services', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Taxon', 'Taxonomy', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Trees', 'Uncertainty', 'Urine', 'Viral', 'Viral Load result', 'Viral reservoir', 'Virus', 'Work', 'Zoonoses', 'base', 'bioinformatics pipeline', 'bioinformatics resource', 'data reuse', 'digital', 'flexibility', 'global health', 'high risk', 'improved', 'inclusion criteria', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'knowledge graph', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic virus', 'prevent', 'response', 'secondary analysis', 'surveillance study', 'trait', 'transmission process', 'virus host interaction']",NIAID,ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY-TEMPE CAMPUS,R21,2021,244519
"Computational modulator design and machine learning to target protein-protein interactions Abstract The overall goal of my research program is to develop and apply computational tools to facilitate the rational design of modulators of important cellular pathways for therapeutic use. Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are central factors in cellular signaling and gene regulation networks. Their misregulation is associated with a variety of diseases, including cancer, neurodegenerative disease, autoimmune disease, and diabetes. Inevitably, many PPIs are biologically compelling targets for drug discovery. But despite a few notable successes, most PPIs have not been successfully targeted and remain undruggable. The fundamental challenge derives from their intrinsic structural features: the binding surfaces of many PPIs are generally large in area, flat, and dynamic. PPIs are often transient and involve multivalent contacts. Currently, one most promising PPI inhibitor discovery strategy is to use miniature protein domain mimetics (PDMs) to reproduce the key interface contacts utilized by nature. PDMs are advantageous as medium-sized molecules with high surface complementarity and a broader set of contact points than typical small molecules, but are still limited because—by definition—only a portion of the total PPI binding energy is captured in the interaction. The binding affinity of the synthetic domains is often lower than the cognate full-length proteins. On the other hand, targeted covalent inhibition is an orthogonal therapeutic approach fit to overcome the fundamental binding limitations at PPIs, but has a well-known drawback: the high reactivity of typical covalent warheads leads to nonspecific inhibition, and toxicity. Here we aim to develop computational methods for a new design strategy that will leverage the strengths of these two methods—PDMs and covalent inhibition—while simultaneously mitigating their respective limitations. The focus of the effort is to rationally discover potent inhibitors that will non-covalently recognize and then covalently target protein-protein binding interfaces with exquisite specificity. Furthermore, our development of robust scoring functions by integrating multitask machine learning and molecular modeling would significantly accelerate the rational drug discovery process. The planned work builds on our recent advances in three state-of-the-art computational approaches: AlphaSpace for fragment- centric topographical mapping of PPI interfaces; ab initio QM/MM molecular dynamics for modeling covalent inhibition; and a novel delta-machine learning strategy to simultaneously improve scoring, docking and screening performance of a protein-ligand scoring function. Our design efforts will result in highly specific and potent modulators of a variety of therapeutically important but previously undruggable PPI interfaces, providing new leads for drug development. Project Narrative Our computational methodology development work will lead to powerful computational tools for rational design of covalent and non-covalent inhibitors, which would significantly accelerate the drug discovery process. Our computational modulator design would result in highly specific and potent inhibitors of a variety of therapeutic targets, which can be used as tools for studying cell signaling and gene regulation, and as new leads for drug development.",Computational modulator design and machine learning to target protein-protein interactions,10152659,R35GM127040,"['Affinity', 'Area', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biological', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Drug Targeting', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Goals', 'Length', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Tertiary Protein Structure', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Uses', 'Toxic effect', 'Work', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'improved', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'learning strategy', 'mimetics', 'molecular dynamics', 'molecular modeling', 'multitask', 'novel', 'programs', 'protein protein interaction', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'success', 'therapeutic target', 'tool']",NIGMS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R35,2021,556806
"Investigation of ssDNA binding proteins and protein-ssDNA interactions Project Summary/Abstract Molecular interactions between proteins and single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) play crucial roles in many fundamental biological processes, such as DNA replication, DNA recombination, DNA repair, gene regulation, and genome stability. ssDNA-binding proteins encompass various degrees of binding specificity, ranging from highly specific to non-specific. Despite the critical roles of protein-ssDNA interactions in essential biological processes, the investigation of protein-ssDNA interactions lags far behind other types of protein-nucleic acids interactions, such as protein-double stranded DNA (dsDNA) interaction. Currently there are no comprehensive, well-annotated resources for studying protein- ssDNA interactions. This proposal aims to investigate the mechanism of protein-ssDNA interactions by first constructing well-annotated protein-ssDNA data resources and by performing comparative analysis at two different levels. The first is to compare structural features between protein-ssDNA complexes with different binding specificity. The second is to investigate the similarity/differences between protein- ssDNA and protein-dsDNA complexes. In addition, we propose to predict novel ssDNA binding proteins from the unannotated protein sequences by combining structure-based protein threading methods and sequence-based machine learning approaches. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal aims to build comprehensive data resources for studying complexes between protein and single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and to investigate the structure and function of ssDNA binding proteins. Protein-ssDNA interaction is critical in many biological processes and plays essential roles in maintaining genome integrity, promoting genome stability and transcription regulation.

"Quantitative Modeling of Transcription Factor-DNA Binding Title: Quantitative Modeling of Transcription Factor–DNA Binding PI: Rohs, Remo PROJECT SUMMARY Genes are regulated through transcription factor (TF) binding to specific DNA target sites in the genome. These target sites are recognized through several layers of specificity determinants. The most extensively studied layer of binding specificity are hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic contacts between protein amino acids and functional groups of the base pairs mainly in the major groove. Base readout recognizes nucleotide sequence within a short core-binding site of only a few base pairs. However, these distinct sequence combinations in a TF binding motif occur many times in the genome and only a very small fraction of putative binding sites are functional. It is still unknown how a TF locates and identifies its in vivo binding sites in the plethora of possible genomic target sites. Recognition of three-dimensional DNA structure is an additional layer that refines base readout. While the latter is restricted to direct contacts with the core motif, shape readout is a mechanism through which flanking regions of the core motif or spacer regions between half-sites of dimeric TFs contribute to binding specificity. Other layers of in vivo TF binding determinants are chromatin structure, DNA accessibility, histone modifications, DNA methylation, cofactors and cooperative binding, and cell type. Given this multi-layer nature of TF recognition, we will develop quantitative models to predict TF binding with high accuracy. More important, however, is that our models will reveal recognition mechanisms in the absence of experiment-based structural information. We will build models where each distinct layer of TF binding specificity determinants is added to a base-line model combining DNA sequence and shape. Since it is expected that the importance of each of these TF binding specificity determinants will vary dramatically across protein families, we will use feature selection to identify relative contributions of each feature group as a function of TF or TF family. We will also develop a deep learning framework where individual feature modules can be added or removed from the input layer of convolutional neural networks. This approach will leverage the advantages of deep learning while circumventing the “black box” nature of standard deep learning methods. We will also generate experimental data for specific TFs using the SELEX-seq technology. This approach is currently able to probe the effect of cofactors, cooperative binding, and protein mutations on the binding specificity of a TF. We will add nucleosomes to the SELEX-seq binding assay and, thereby, probe chromatin effects on TF binding using an in vitro experiment in the absence of other cellular contributions. This project will result in a better mechanistic understanding of TF-DNA binding and reveal the impact of various specificity determinants across multiple scales. The new insights will describe different combinations of readout mechanisms on a protein-family specific basis. Our new methods will yield progress in biomedical innovation that is based on transcription and gene regulation. The generated knowledge will better integrate genomics and biophysics, and the project will contribute to the training and mentoring of a new generation of scientists. Title: Quantitative Modeling of Transcription Factor–DNA Binding PI: Rohs, Remo PROJECT NARRATIVE Gene regulatory mechanisms require the binding of transcription factors to highly selective target sites in the genome. By itself, the DNA sequence of the core motif is often insufficient to explain transcription factor binding to a very small fraction of the many more available putative sites.
