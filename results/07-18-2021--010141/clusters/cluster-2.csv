"Novel computer vision-based assessment of infant-caregiver synchrony as an early level II screening tool for autism PROJECT SUMMARY This R21 addresses a critical need for accurate and scalable screening tools able to detect autism spectrum disorder (ASD) within the first year of life. This project will pilot an innovative digital phenotyping screening method, which uses computer vision and machine learning to measure synchrony within simple infant-caregiver interactions. Synchrony refers to the tendency for infants to spontaneously and dynamically coordinate their behaviors with their caregivers in time. This critical and early-emerging developmental process may provide unique and precise information about an infant’s risk for ASD, while also offering a lens for understanding early social interaction differences at the core of ASD. Significance: This project represents a paradigm shift in ASD screening, moving beyond behavior rating scales toward methods that are better suited to capture the subtle early indicators of ASD. Caregiver rating scales lack the granularity and objectivity necessary for detecting signs of ASD that emerge slowly and subtly throughout the first year. Approach: The interdisciplinary study team will leverage cutting-edge technology to objectively and granularly measure synchrony within 5-minute, play-based infant-caregiver interactions. Markerless computer vision will be used to quantify facial movements, captured unobtrusively with small, bidirectional cameras. The dyadic synchrony among infants’ and caregivers’ facial movements will then be calculated throughout the interaction, as part of an automated machine learning pipeline. Preliminary Data: We evaluated this approach in young adults with and without ASD during brief conversational interactions with research staff members. In a machine learning analysis pipeline, synchrony features classified diagnosis with 91% accuracy - significantly better than expert clinicians assessing the same videos. The same set of synchrony features significantly predicted symptom severity in the ASD group, suggesting that this method is effective for both diagnostic classification and dimensional prediction of individual differences. Importantly, the pipeline also classified diagnosis in children with similarly high accuracy, demonstrating the reproducibility of results across age groups. Aims. This project extends these computer vision-based methods to infants, with the overarching goal of evaluating their utility as a Level II screener for ASD. Aim 1 will evaluate the concurrent validity of our computational measures of interactional synchrony by evaluating their relationships with an established clinician-administered assessment of early ASD markers. Aim 2 will assess the utility of our interactional synchrony measure as a Level II screening tool at 12 months, by testing its ability to predict future ASD diagnosis with high specificity. Impact: This R21 will provide initial validation for a novel, computer vision- based screener for ASD in infancy. By targeting the dynamics of natural infant-caregiver interactions, this method has the potential to identify very early signs of disrupted social development, even before classic ASD symptoms emerge. Moreover, this quick interaction-based screener would fit easily into the context of routine pediatric care, holding promise as a Level II screener deployable within a universal screening framework. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project tests a new method of screening for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in infancy, leveraging computer vision and machine learning to develop a screening tool that detects alterations in the dynamic social coordination between infants and caregivers during brief, play-based interactions. There are currently no screening tools capable of reliably detecting ASD in the first year of life, and in particular, no tools based on direct measurement of behavior that can be feasibly deployed in primary care. This project addresses this critical public health challenge by examining an objective, granular, and scalable Level II screener, which has potential to lower the average age of diagnosis by identifying very early signs of disrupted social development, even before classic ASD symptoms emerge.",Novel computer vision-based assessment of infant-caregiver synchrony as an early level II screening tool for autism,9861937,R21HD102078,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Age-Months', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Developmental Process', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Face', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Infant', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Life', 'Low Prevalence', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Parents', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Predictive Value', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Screening procedure', 'Severities', 'Social Development', 'Social Interaction', 'Specificity', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'age group', 'analysis pipeline', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'behavior rating scale', 'digital', 'early screening', 'high risk', 'high risk infant', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'learning strategy', 'lens', 'member', 'novel', 'primary care setting', 'screening', 'social', 'temporal measurement', 'tool', 'young adult']",NICHD,CHILDREN'S HOSP OF PHILADELPHIA,R21,2019,264000,0.19415339579817795
"Novel video-based approaches for detection of autism risk in the first year of life Signs of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) emerge in the first year of life in many children, but diagnosis is typically made much later, at an average age of 4 years in the United States. Early intervention is highly effective for young children with ASD, but is typically reserved for children with a formal diagnosis, making accurate identification as early as possible imperative. A screening tool that could identify ASD risk during infancy offers the opportunity for intervention before the full set of symptoms is present. In this application, we propose two novel video-based methods of detecting ASD in the first year of life. First, we will validate a recently developed instrument, the Video-referenced Infant Rating System for Autism (VIRSA), in a general community sample of infants. The VIRSA is a brief web-based instrument that utilizes video depictions rather than written descriptions of behavior to detect signs of ASD. It leverages thousands of hours of already collected and hand-coded video obtained through previous NIH funding. Videos demonstrating a continuum of behaviors and developmental competence are presented to parents, who identify the ones most representative of their child. Through previous funding, we have established that the VIRSA has good psychometric properties when used by parents with previous experience of ASD (i.e., have an older affected child) and demonstrated that it is able to distinguish infants developing ASD in the first year of life. In Aim 1, we will examine the measure’s use by parents who are naïve to ASD, with no family history of the disorder. In Aim 2, we propose another innovative method of utilizing video for ASD detection. Machine learning is an application of artificial intelligence in which computer programs “learn” and adjust themselves in response to training data to which they are exposed, improving performance and generalization to novel data without being explicitly programmed. We propose to use the videos from the VIRSA, previously demonstrated in our initial validation study to be sensitive to early signs of ASD, as training inputs to develop machine-learning algorithms for automatic detection of ASD-related behaviors. The huge video archive available for this project, with hand- coded time-stamped behavioral tags, is a highly valuable resource for machine learning. Aim 2 will lay the foundation for future attempts to develop video-based mobile applications for ASD recognition, which require validated classifiers that can recognize behavioral events central to early detection of ASD. The ultimate goal of the two aims of the proposed project is to develop low-cost, low-burden measures that capitalize on new technologies, including mobile platforms, video, and machine learning methods, to detect ASD risk in infancy. Such measures would have significant public health applications, including screening large community-based samples and longitudinally tracking development in pediatric settings to identify children requiring evaluation. Identification of ASD in infancy would afford treatment at an optimal age, when the brain is most malleable, which could lessen disability and possibly prevent the emergence of later-appearing symptoms. PROJECT NARRATIVE Symptoms of autism spectrum disorder emerge in infancy, yet the average age of diagnosis in the United States is still 4 years. In this application, we propose to develop two novel video-based methods of detecting risk for ASD in the first year of life, harnessing new technologies and automated approaches that pose low burden to families. These methods have potential to improve access to care and reduce the time lag between symptom emergence and diagnosis.",Novel video-based approaches for detection of autism risk in the first year of life,9860951,R01MH121344,"['4 year old', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Age-Months', 'Algorithms', 'Archives', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Competence', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Early treatment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Facial Expression', 'Family', 'Family history of', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Hour', 'Improve Access', 'Infant', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Lifestyle-related condition', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Online Systems', 'Parents', 'Performance', 'Property', 'Psychometrics', 'Public Health Applications Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Secure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'autistic children', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'computer program', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'disability', 'disease classification', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'gaze', 'high risk', 'improved', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'instrument', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mobile application', 'mobile computing', 'new technology', 'novel', 'prevent', 'recruit', 'response', 'screening', 'validation studies', 'vocalization']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R01,2019,730137,0.2195489857886023
"Predicting Autism and Social Functioning from Computer Vision Analyses of Motor Synchrony During Dyadic Interactions PROJECT SUMMARY Our innovative and fully automated approach to the analysis of social behavior addresses the pressing need for precise and scalable measurements of the autism spectrum disorder (ASD) phenotype. Using computer vision and machine learning methods, we have created a novel, quantitative method for fine-grained analysis of social interactions. Our approach directly measures interpersonal motor synchrony, a construct which we use as a lens for understanding the social interaction differences that are at the core of ASD. Significance: Genomics and neuroimaging methods continuously evolve, providing deeper insights into the biology of ASD. However, methods for measuring the outward manifestations of ASD have not changed substantially in decades. ASD is fundamentally a disorder of social interaction, but current clinical tools do not directly measure observable social interactions. Instead, they summarize global impressions of these interactions via informant report questionnaires or observational coding schemes that typically lack the behavioral granularity needed to robustly measure individual differences and changes across time (e.g., treatment related change). Inter-rater agreement on questionnaires is typically modest, while the alternative “deep phenotyping” by expert clinicians is a time- consuming and often cost-prohibitive burden to studies, especially when large samples are required (e.g., in genomics research). Approach: To resolve these problems, our team created a novel computational framework that leverages advances in markerless video motion capture, computer vision, and machine learning to directly capture dyadic social interactions. This allows us to capture all behaviors observable by expert clinicians but with exquisite digital precision and objectivity. Preliminary Data: We developed a fully automatic quantitative assessment of interpersonal social behavior focused on features of dyadic facial motor synchrony. When applied to videos of brief conversations between confederates and young adults with or without ASD, our assessment predicted diagnostic status with 91% accuracy – significantly better than highly trained clinical experts assessing the same video recordings. The set of predictive social motor synchrony features that we identified also correlated significantly with symptom severity in the ASD group, suggesting that it can be used for both diagnostic classification and evaluating individual differences (vital for advancing precision medicine goals). Importantly, our findings were reproducible across samples: the same features identified in our adult analysis also predicted diagnosis in a child sample with high accuracy. Aims. In Aim 1, we will test the specificity of our computer vision approach by expanding comparisons to include a mixed psychiatric disorder group; Aim 2 will test dyadic synchrony in other body movements, and Aim 3 will define associations between interpersonal motor synchrony and dimensional aspects of social communication that span diagnostic categories. Impact: Our approach is designed for fast and rigorous assessment of social communication, providing a scalable solution to diagnosing ASD diagnosis and measuring individual variability, within a transdiagnostic, precision medicine framework. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project tests a new technique for measuring social communication problems in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Using markerless motion capture, computer vision, and machine learning, we will measure humans’ natural tendency to coordinate their behavior with a conversational partner. The results of this project will impact public health by making it easier to reliably diagnose ASD, providing access to precise phenotypic information for genotypic studies, and by providing the theoretical and empirical foundation for an objective way to determine whether some treatments work better than others.",Predicting Autism and Social Functioning from Computer Vision Analyses of Motor Synchrony During Dyadic Interactions,9642534,R01MH118327,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Agreement', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biologic Development', 'Biology', 'Categories', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Face', 'Foundations', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Individual Differences', 'Limb structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Schools', 'Severities', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Functioning', 'Social Interaction', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Models', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Video Recording', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'autistic children', 'computer framework', 'computerized', 'cost', 'design', 'digital', 'dyadic interaction', 'experimental study', 'impression', 'individual variation', 'informant', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'lens', 'natural language', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'skills', 'social', 'social communication', 'social deficits', 'tool', 'wearable device', 'young adult']",NIMH,CHILDREN'S HOSP OF PHILADELPHIA,R01,2019,835525,0.12342732495458734
"Scalable Computational Platform For Active Closed-Loop Behavioral Coding in Autism Spectrum Disorder SCALABLE COMPUTATIONAL PLATFORM FOR ACTIVE CLOSED-LOOP BEHAVIORAL CODING IN  AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER ABSTRACT Despite significant recent advances in molecular genetics and neuroscience, behavioral ratings based on clinical observations are still the gold standard for screening, diagnosing, and assessing outcomes in neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Such behavioral ratings are subjective, require significant clinician expertise and training, typically do not capture data from the children in their natural environments, and are not scalable for large population screening, low-income communities, or longitudinal monitoring. The development of scalable digital approaches to standardized objective behavioral assessment is thus a significant unmet need in ASD, here addressed via machine learning and computer vision with the goal of providing scalable methods for assessing existing biomarkers, from eye tracking to movement and posture patterns, and tools for novel discovery. Our long-term goal is to develop validated scalable tools for the automatic behavioral analysis of neurodevelopmental disorders. The proposed computational project leverages results and big data derived from our previous studies (N=1,864 participants) and our recently funded NIH Autism Center of Excellence (ACE) award (N=7,436 participants). The ACE project will allow us to develop and validate our tools on several thousand toddlers recruited in Duke pediatric primary care and followed longitudinally for whom gold-standard diagnoses of ASD, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), developmental and language delay and extensive electronic health record (EHR) data will be available; and in a case control study of 224 age-matched groups of young children with ASD, ADHD, and typical development from whom gold-standard diagnostic, extensive phenotypic, Tobii eye- tracking, and EEG will be collected. This project aims to develop novel computational methods using these datasets, from sensing in scalable fashion behaviors such as attention and gaze (Aim 1) and motor/posture (Aim 2), to their multimodal integration (Aim 3). A unique aspect of our computational approach is the closed- loop integration of stimuli design for actively eliciting behavioral symptoms, use of consumer-grade sensors, and automatic behavioral analysis. This contrasts with the current approach of independently selecting stimuli and using expensive lab-based professional grade sensors with off-the-shelf algorithms to capture behavioral biomarkers expected from the stimuli. Our approach involves active elicitation of behavior which is also different from commonly used digital approaches that involve gathering large datasets from passive sensing, such as actigraphy monitoring of spontaneous behavior at home. Our framework results in active closed-loop sensing, where participants are engaged in short and developmentally appropriate activities on ubiquitous devices, while the sensors in the same device capture information for the automatic and quantitative analysis of behavioral biomarkers. This scalable, objective, and standardized way of stimulating, sensing, and analyzing allows the collection of large behavioral datasets for machine learning. SCALABLE COMPUTATIONAL PLATFORM FOR ACTIVE CLOSED-LOOP BEHAVIORAL CODING IN  AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER NARRATIVE Neurodevelopmental disorders such as Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder affect 15% of children, most of them lacking the appropriate access to behavioral assessments for screening, diagnosis, or treatment to help them reach their full potential. To address this challenge, we are developing integrated, objective, and scalable computational tools for digital behavioral phenotyping that are based on computer vision and machine learning. The project brings together expertise in clinical and behavioral science with computer science and engineering to develop improved computational methods for scalable quantitative tools for behavioral assessment that will ultimately increase knowledge and access to screening, diagnosis, and treatment for ASD and other neurodevelopmental disorders.",Scalable Computational Platform For Active Closed-Loop Behavioral Coding in Autism Spectrum Disorder,9791518,R01MH120093,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavior monitoring', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Behavioral Symptoms', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cephalometry', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Funding', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hand', 'Home environment', 'Knowledge', 'Language Delays', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Matched Group', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Periodicity', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Posture', 'Primary Health Care', 'Questionnaires', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Stimulus', 'Symptoms', 'Tablets', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'actigraphy', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'autistic children', 'base', 'computational platform', 'computer design', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'data integration', 'design', 'developmental disease', 'diagnosis standard', 'digital', 'gaze', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'preference', 'recruit', 'screening', 'sensor', 'social', 'tool']",NIMH,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,388353,0.12656611160615594
"ARGUS-MDS: automated, quantitative and scalable system for social processes in behavioral health Argus Cognitive STTR Grant Application Abstract Standardized behavioral observation methods are integral to developmental, educational, and behavioral science research. However, existing observational strategies are too laborious to use in large-scale, intervention and dissemination trials needed in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). In addition, current observational strategies do not yield sufficiently quantitative, comparable and granular assessment that could drive the comparison of therapies in clinical trials or the optimization and personalization of intervention. We are developing a minimally intrusive medical device technology (“ARGUS-MDS”) to simultaneously monitor multiple key social and problem behaviors in individuals with ASD and related neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). Our team represents an essential collaboration between computer and clinical scientists with expertise in artificial intelligence (AI), NDDs, diagnostics, multi-modal interventions, and psychometrics. We seek support in the form of a Fast Track STTR grant to validate the psychometric properties of ARGUS-MDS and its ability to provide data on change in target behaviors in early childhood and school-aged children. This would then support the development of a scalable, digital treatment progress indicator for behaviors reflecting social, repetitive behavior, and associated symptom profiles in ASD. In Phase I, video and audio data will be collected during gold-standard diagnostic evaluations individuals with ASD (n=15). Aim 1.1 will establish quality and clinical validity of ARGUS-MDS algorithms for key social communication behaviors, while Aim 1.2 will evaluate test-retest reliability of biometric output. Phase I will show that ARGUS-MDS meets quality metrics for biometric output, validates the clinician- technician feedback system, and establishes intraclass correlation coefficients for automated social communication (AutoSC) output. In Phase II our focus shifts to establishing psychometric properties of derived scores for AutoSC analysis, evaluating convergence with established clinical and functional measures, and preparing for regulatory filing in Phase III. Aim 2.1. will develop scores from biometric data through exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses of social communication behaviors. Aim 2.2 evaluates correspondence of AutoSC scores to scores on standardized clinical assessments. Aim 2.3 develops a comprehensive Validation Strategy and executes Analytical Validation, per medical device design control regulation and FDA guidance. Phase II will develop scores from AutoSC output, evaluate measurement characteristics of AutoSC scores, reliability & validity of Autos SC scores, and executes all Analytical Validations per the strategy document and FDA guidance. Phase I and II milestones will set us up for commercialization in Phase III, including filing for regulatory approval and product launch. Successful completion of this project will provide a novel, scalable medical device technology to support objective, automated clinical evaluations of social impairments in ASD and other NDDs. Argus Cognitive STTR Grant Application NARRATIVE We seek to contribute to the digital health movement through validation of a minimally intrusive monitoring system (“ARGUS-MDS”) to simultaneously track multiple key social and problem behaviors in individuals with ASD and related neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) including Fragile X Syndrome (FXS). This new technology will make diagnosis and monitoring of these disorders quantitative, scalable, and affordable, removing a serious bottleneck in the current patient journey, related to 1) the limited availability of highly trained human experts and 2) the qualitative and subjective nature of the results attained with current observational strategies. Using advanced video and audio analytics and machine learning, ARGUS-MDS achieves an automated, quantitative, and comprehensive assessment of each patient, across settings (clinical trials, academic research, specialty clinics, pediatric offices and homes), without requiring the presence of a human expert during the monitored diagnostic, monitoring or therapy sessions.","ARGUS-MDS: automated, quantitative and scalable system for social processes in behavioral health",9906771,R44MH121965,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automation', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Biometry', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'DSM-V', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based practice', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Factor Analysis', 'Feedback', 'Fragile X Syndrome', 'Gestures', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention Trial', 'Language', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Device', 'Medical Device Designs', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'Nature', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Nonverbal Communication', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Problem behavior', 'Process', 'Property', 'Psychometrics', 'Public Health', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'School-Age Population', 'Scientist', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Processes', 'Speech', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Validity and Reliability', 'analog', 'associated symptom', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'autistic children', 'behavior observation', 'behavioral health', 'clinical practice', 'commercialization', 'communication behavior', 'digital', 'disability', 'dissemination trial', 'early childhood', 'experimental study', 'functional disability', 'functional outcomes', 'gaze', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'medical specialties', 'motor control', 'multi-component intervention', 'neuropsychiatry', 'new technology', 'novel', 'personalized intervention', 'programs', 'repetitive behavior', 'research clinical testing', 'screening', 'showing emotion', 'social', 'social communication', 'social deficits', 'social reciprocity']",NIMH,"ARGUS COGNITIVE, INC.",R44,2019,139681,0.07224180664469654
"Genome Clustering for Clinical Subtype Detection in Autism Project Summary/Abstract Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a developmental neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by a wide range of clinical manifestations and genetic heterogeneity. This complex genetic landscape poses a serious challenge to eﬀorts to ﬁnd a relationship between genotype and clinical phenotype in ASD. Therefore, the disorder remains poorly understand, and diagnostic and treatment tools are lacking. Though genetic overlap between patients is low, many mutations in autism likely aﬀect stereotyped biological pathways, resulting in subgroups of autistic patients with similar functional mutation burden. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that patients with functionally similar mutations can be clustered together in order to reveal previously unidentiﬁed groups that share both molecular mechanisms and disease related cognitive traits. This proposal ﬁrst describes an algorithm for genomic subtype detection of autistic patients using graph clustering and a novel distance function that is based on gene ontology, a database that describes the functional relationship of genes. Next, it is shown that resulting patient clusters are deﬁned by both unique and convergent involvement of genetic pathways, which provides insight into the variety of disease mechanisms that may be present in ASD. These potential mechanisms can be explored at the cellular level by connecting the clustering algorithm with data from ASD patient derived neurons. Finally, cluster membership is associated with diﬀerences in the clinical and cognitive variables, validating the relevance of the genomic subtypes. In addition, deep learning approaches to describe individualized clinical prediction are discussed. Genome clustering in autism is an important step towards deﬁning both mechanistic and clinical subtypes in this complex disorder, and this proposal addresses a growing need for algorithmic tools that connect genotype to phenotype in the context of heritable mental illnesses. Narrative Neuropsychiatric disorders, such as autism, remain a leading cause of global disease burden, due to a limited understanding of their fundamental causes. This application proposes a novel computational method that harnesses the power of genomics to identify groups of similar patients that suﬀer from autism spectrum disorder. The insights gained from this research will shed light on the biological mechanisms of this disease, thereby facilitating the discovery of new diagnostic and treatment tools for autism.",Genome Clustering for Clinical Subtype Detection in Autism,9773221,F30MH115584,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithm Design', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Symptoms', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Categories', 'Cell Line', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Curiosities', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disabled Persons', 'Disease', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Graph', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mutation', 'Neurobehavioral Manifestations', 'Neurons', 'Ontology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Research', 'Salvelinus', 'Schizophrenia', 'Source', 'Stereotyping', 'Subgroup', 'Synapses', 'Weight', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'autistic', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical subtypes', 'clinically relevant', 'computerized tools', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'disorder risk', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'interest', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'outcome forecast', 'patient subsets', 'prognostic', 'risk variant', 'social', 'tool', 'trait']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",F30,2019,43812,0.11804868888008135
"Testing the Bottom-Up vs Top-Down Imbalance Hypothesis of ASD ABSTRACT / PROJECT SUMMARY  Functional connectivity in the brains of individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) has emerged as an important marker of neural abnormalities associated with the disorder. However, despite hundreds of studies on the topic, the specific nature of functional connectivity abnormalities that characterize the disorder remains unresolved and no unifying framework has emerged to describe it. Constructing a consistent model of the functional connectivity abnormalities that underlie ASD is absolutely essential for advancing our understanding of the neural etiology of the disorder. While the commonly accepted model is one where long- range functional connectivity is decreased in ASD while local functional connectivity is increased, many studies have shown increased or normal long-range functional connectivity in ASD and the evidence supporting the hypothesis that local functional connectivity is increased remains scant and indirect.  To date, the vast majority of studies of functional connectivity in ASD have been carried out using fMRI, a technique that relies on the hemodynamic response and thus has a temporal resolution of <1Hz. It is well known, however, that functional connectivity is usually mediated by much faster frequency bands, commonly divided into five fundamental frequency bands: delta (1-2 Hz), theta (3-7 Hz), alpha (8-12 Hz), beta (13-30 Hz), and gamma (31-80 Hz). There is also recent evidence that these frequency bands mediate functional connectivity with preferred directionality. Based on our own preliminary data and current studies, we propose to test the hypothesis that ASD is characterized by increased long-range bottom-up (feedforward) functional connectivity, alongside decreased long-range top-down (feedback ) functional connectivity, and that the gamma and beta frequency bands, respectively, mediate these functional connectivity abnormalities.  Here, we propose to test our hypothesis by obtaining MEG (magnetoencephalography) data from two spatial attention paradigms, visual and auditory, optimized for assessing bottom-up versus top-down functional connectivity, in 50 TD and 60 ASD individuals, ages 14-17. Specifically, we propose the following aims: (1) Test the hypothesis that bottom-up functional connectivity is abnormally increased in ASD in the auditory and visual domains, and this is manifested primarily in the gamma frequency band. (2) Test the hypothesis that top- down functional connectivity is abnormally reduced in ASD in the auditory and visual domains, and this is manifested primarily in the beta frequency band. (3) Test the hypothesis that neurophysiological functional connectivity measures derived using MEG will be predictive of ASD severity, diagnosis, and behavioral features, using robust correlations, canonical correlations, and machine learning techniques. We expect that the results of this study will lead to a substantially more detailed, comprehensive, and mechanistically motivated framework for the wide range of functional connectivity abnormalities observed in ASD. Project Narrative (Relevance to Public Health) The proposed research will elucidate the neurophysiological underpinnings of specific functional connectivity abnormalities in autism spectrum disorders (ASD) with an unprecendent level of detail. It will advance the field by elucidating specific abnormalities, and potentially reconciling over prior disparate results. The outcomes of this study could potentially contribute to treatments designs, and give a neurophysiological picture of connectivity abnormalities detailed enough to advance the field of animal models for ASD.",Testing the Bottom-Up vs Top-Down Imbalance Hypothesis of ASD,9773231,R01MH117998,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Age', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Attention', 'Auditory', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Etiology', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Generations', 'Grouping', 'Individual', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetoencephalography', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Nature', 'Outcome Study', 'Plant Roots', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Sensory', 'Severities', 'Social Interaction', 'Specificity', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Visual', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'hemodynamics', 'millisecond', 'neurophysiology', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'somatosensory', 'temporal measurement', 'therapy design']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2019,799760,0.1189532694055935
"Impact of Multisensory Function on Symptomatology in Young Children with ASD Project Summary/Abstract Atypical responses to sensory stimuli are highly prevalent in autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Somatosensory sensitivities in particular occur prominently and with high frequency in the disorder. While core symptomatology is comprised of both sensory dysfunctions and sociocommunicative deficits, the impact of aberrant somatosensory and multisensory processing on sociocommunication abilities remains unknown. It is not well-understood how sensory discrimination anomalies predict later sociocommunicative impairment, or which manifestations of sensory abnormalities result in more severe outcomes. Thus, the objective of this proposal is to investigate the behavioral and neural patterns underlying somatosensory and multisensory discrimination abnormalities longitudinally in young children with ASD compared to TD peers at 4-5 years and 6-7 years of age and identify potential patterns of developmental causality between sensory and sociocommunicative impairments. We theorize that behavioral dysfunction and disruptions in functional and structural connectivity between neural systems in ASD interfere with normative development. Within this theoretical framework, we make three key predictions regarding sensory processing in ASD: (1) Behavioral manifestations of sensory discrimination anomalies in ASD will be objectively observable and quantifiable; (2) functional and structural connectivity patterns within and between sensory and multisensory networks will be atypical; and (3) these atypical network connections will be linked to behavioral manifestations of sensory abnormalities, and combined will predict later sociocommunicative impairments. To examine these hypotheses, we propose a longitudinal and multimodal approach, including behavioral measures, task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), resting state functional connectivity MRI (fcMRI), diffusion weighted imaging (DWI), and neuropsychological indices, along with machine- learning methods, which will be able to reveal distinct patterns within and across modalities, and pinpoint patterns that may most heavily impact autism symptomatology in young children. The distinct strengths of this proposal lie in the application of quantitative behavioral measures to examine sensory discrimination thresholds in young developmental populations, in combination with the use of advanced neuroimaging tools to measure functional activity and (functional and structural) network connectivity between multiple brain systems and the implementation of machine-learning predictive approaches.  The proposed training plan incorporates analytic approaches to multimodal neuroimaging and machine-learning, as well as training in neuropsychological evaluation and assessment, which are essential to the applicant's research goals of investigating sensory abnormalities in, and atypical development of, the brain and behavior. This career development award will permit her to develop new expertise necessary for successful completion of the proposed research, while building upon her extensive experience of multisensory development and functional neuroimaging in young children. The Psychology Department at San Diego State University, together with the carefully selected mentorship team, will create an exceptional training environment to further her long-term career goal to become a successful, independent autism researcher in the field of developmental cognitive neuroscience with a focus on sensorimotor processing. Project Narrative The proposed research investigation seeks to examine the impact of somatosensory and multisensory abnormalities on sociocommunication deficits in young children with autism longitudinally. Training over the duration of the career development award will emphasize analytic approaches to multimodal neuroimaging and machine-learning, as well as training in neuropsychological assessment, which will provide the PI with expertise necessary for investigating the links between behavioral and neural mechanisms underlying the heterogeneity of sensory manifestations and autism symptomatology. As the increasing prevalence of autism renders it a serious public health issue, findings from the proposed research will have implications for early detection and intervention directed toward sensory processing.",Impact of Multisensory Function on Symptomatology in Young Children with ASD,9692797,K01MH113819,"['7 year old', 'Age', 'Anisotropy', 'Applications Grants', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Mechanisms', 'Brain', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Development', 'Diffuse', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mentorship', 'Modality', 'Neuropsychology', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Psychology', 'Psychophysics', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Sensory', 'Sensory Manifestations', 'Severities', 'Social Interaction', 'Stereotyping', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'TEP1 gene', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'autistic children', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'behavioral impairment', 'brain behavior', 'career', 'cognitive development', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'comparative', 'developmental psychology', 'experience', 'falls', 'haptics', 'imaging modality', 'indexing', 'learning strategy', 'multidisciplinary', 'multimodality', 'multisensory', 'neural patterning', 'neurobehavioral', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'peer', 'relating to nervous system', 'repetitive behavior', 'response', 'sensory cortex', 'sensory discrimination', 'sensory input', 'sensory integration', 'sensory stimulus', 'somatosensory', 'support network', 'symptomatology', 'tool']",NIMH,SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY,K01,2019,195916,0.12300383321881453
"Data-driven multidimensional modeling of nonverbal communication in typical and atypical development ABSTRACT This proposal will develop innovative technology for data-driven, multimodal characterization of nonverbal communication (NVC) in typical and atypical development. Prior research has provided qualitative descriptions of the development of children's use of gaze and gesture to regulate social interactions, but there are no objective, automated tools for measuring NVC behaviors, nor computational models to explain their coordination and timing in social interactions. This proposal will apply advanced probabilistic modeling techniques from machine learning and data mining to a rich corpus of children's behavior, including automated measures of children's posture, head pose, gaze direction, arm movements, and hand configurations derived from color and depth cameras and accelerometers. By automatically learning probabilistic latent variable models from movement data, we will obtain compact, data-driven descriptions of NVC and its coordination in children with autism, children with developmental delays without autism, and typically developing children (Aim 1). We will validate our models by demonstrating their ability to predict children's behavior, including diagnostic group and one-year language outcomes (Aim 2). We will test whether novel NVC patterns can be uncovered with bottom-up clustering of motor movement data (Aim 3). We predict our models will have greater explanatory and predictive power compared to current measures of NVC, which are typically human-coded behaviors that are descriptive, but rely on a-priori definitions of higher level behaviors. The models we develop will capture the fine-grained structure, coordination, and timing of NVC behaviors during social interactions, and thus allow us to characterize these behaviors with an unprecedented level of detail. Because interventions for young children with ASD target NVC skills, our automated measurement tools will provide clinicians with powerful new tools to assess the extent to which these treatments are efficacious. In addition, automated tools for dense measurement of fine-grained changes in NVC would enable clinicians to assess profiles of strengths and weaknesses for purposes of treatment planning, to dynamically tailor treatment to clients' changing abilities, and ultimately to accurately capture whether treatment is working. Finally, the measurement capabilities will provide researchers with a novel, cost-effective approach to analyze video recordings, at a scale that is not currently feasible due to a reliance on human coding.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) affects 1 in 68 children in the US. This project is focused on developing automated tools to characterize behaviors considered to be core, early emerging markers of autism, and that represent common treatment targets in this group.

"Neuroethics of Predictive MRI Testing: Parental Attitudes Towards Pre-Symptomatic Identification of Autism Spectrum Disorder PROJECT SUMMARY Machine-learning-based classification of neuroimaging data (hereafter ML-MRI) to predict clinical diagnoses has increased substantially in the last decade. Despite the promise of ML for clinical classification and prediction, no work has been done to anticipate the ethical obligations and challenges that emerge when ML algorithms predict clinical diagnoses in pre-symptomatic individuals. Two recent reports from the Infant Brain Imaging Study (IBIS) have exemplified the ML classification approach by predicting 24-month clinical diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) from 6-month MRI data in infants at high and low familial risk for ASD. These preliminary results demonstrated—for the first time—the feasibility of identifying infants prior to onset of ASD symptoms, and raised critical ethical questions about whether and how to disclose predictive ML- MRI classification of ASD to parents of pre-symptomatic infants. The proposed research aims to investigate parental attitudes towards predictive ML-MRI testing in IBIS, and addresses a core principle of BRAIN Initiative: considering the ethical implications of neuroscience research. Aim 1 will review the bioethics literature on disclosure of results in genetic research, and identify overlapping and distinct ethical considerations for disclosure using ML-MRI vs. genetic testing for disease prediction. Aim 2 will use a theory-based approach to assess the attitudes of IBIS parents towards predictive ML-MRI testing through qualitative interviews and a quantitative survey. The knowledge gained through this research will help investigators make ethical decisions about disclosure in future neuroimaging studies of high-risk infants. Our long-term goal is to develop guidelines for navigating the unique ethical challenges posed by a new frontier in neuroimaging research: clinical prediction via increasingly powerful and sophisticated ML-based analyses of large neuroimaging datasets. The proposed research and training plan will leverage the resources of the University of Washington Autism Center, the Treuman Katz Center for Pediatric Bioethics at Seattle Children’s Hospital, and the multi-site, longitudinal Infant Brain Imaging Study. The applicant will receive formal training in neuroethics, pediatric bioethics, and qualitative research methods, which will complement her prior skillset and prepare her for an independent research career investigating ethical issues in pediatric neuroscience. PROJECT NARRATIVE Machine learning-based statistical techniques, recently applied to neuroimaging data, have allowed researchers to predict disease and disorder from brain data alone. Investigators working at this new frontier in neuroimaging research now face ethical challenges about whether and how to disclose a predictive clinical diagnosis to pre-symptomatic individuals. By combining bioethical theory with the perspectives of participants, the current research will generate new knowledge to guide ethical judgments about the disclosure of predictive diagnoses in future neuroimaging research.",Neuroethics of Predictive MRI Testing: Parental Attitudes Towards Pre-Symptomatic Identification of Autism Spectrum Disorder,10003829,F32MH118689,"['Address', 'Attitude', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Behavioral Model', 'Belief', 'Bioethics', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain imaging', 'Categories', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disclosure', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Ethical Issues', 'Ethics', 'Face', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Research', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Intention', 'Interview', 'Judgment', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Modality', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Population', 'Predictive Factor', 'Qualitative Research', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Review Literature', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'University resources', 'Validation', 'Washington', 'Work', 'autism onset', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'autistic children', 'base', 'career', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical predictors', 'frontier', 'high risk infant', 'imaging study', 'interest', 'neuroethics', 'neuroimaging', 'parental influence', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive test', 'programs', 'recruit', 'systematic review', 'theories']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,F32,2019,66610,0.07111944792059403
"Harmonization for multisite Connectomics: parsing heterogeneity and creating markers in ASD Diffusion MRI (dMRI) provides a superior characterization of white matter and connectivity compared to other MRI modalities, and is routinely included in studies of disorders with atypical brain connectivity like autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The field could benefit tremendously from combining studies, to have comprehensive representation of the underlying heterogeneity in connectivity-based disorders. This is rendered challenging by dMRI being very sensitive to acquisition parameters, needing sophisticated statistical harmonization tools due to the complicated effect of scanner related changes. This also calls for a robust automated quality control (QC) protocol prior to data harmonization. Thus, in this proposal, we will develop tools to facilitate integration of dMRI data across studies. In Aim 1, we will develop and validate a deep learning based tool for automating QC for dMRI data that will identify different data artifacts (caused by multiple sources like scanner, coil, scan parameters, motion etc), and the appropriate action that needs to be taken (like motion and eddy correction). In Aim 2, we will develop a suite of tools for harmonizing dMRI measures to remove acquisition differences. The effectiveness of our proposed tools will be demonstrated by harmonizing ~1500 datasets (ages 6-32 years) from 11 ASD studies. These large harmonized datasets create the need for a subject-wise characterization of the sample and for diagnostic markers that harness the imaging heterogeneity of the larger harmonized sample. To address this new need, we will develop additional connectomic analysis tools, that will be adapted to ASD to create the CHARM (Connectomic Heterogeneity in Autism Research through Multi-site dMRI harmonization) suite comprising of a generalizable biomarker of ASD, as well as a dimensional connectomic coordinate system. In Aim 3, we will characterize each subject using a connectivity phenotype, cluster the integrated ASD sample based on this connectivity-phenotype, define a classifier for each cluster; and create a connectivity-based ensemble biomarker of ASD, called the CHARM-marker, combining these cluster-specific classifier decisions. Finally, in Aim 4, we will create a subject-wise characterization of ASD by designing a multi-dimensional connectomic coordinate system using metric learning, to quantify the dissimilarity of each subject from the harmonized healthy controls. We will elucidate the link of these CHARM-coordinates to ASD constructs, by correlating core ASD symptoms with the CHARM coordinates in the harmonized/combined sample. This will enable the ASD community to associate informative connectomic dimensions with each subject, facilitating subject-wise longitudinal assessment, paving the way for precision medicine. Such a group- based and subject-wise characterization of ASD could not have been possible without data integration. Additionally, the neuroimaging community will have new dMRI harmonization and connectomic analysis tools enabling the integration of studies for a more comprehensive connectomic investigation of existing data. It will pave the way for such studies in other connectivity-related disorders that affect mental health. Project narrative The project aims at developing an automated quality assessment protocol and statistical harmonization tools for diffusion MRI data, that will enable the integration of data collected with different acquisition protocols. We will also create connectomic tools that will enable disorder- specific and patient-specific analysis of the harmonized data. Using these methods, we will combine several studies in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and create a biomarker that capitalizes on the underlying imaging heterogeneity in the data, as well as place each ASD subject in a connectomic coordinate system, that will pave the way for precision medicine.",Harmonization for multisite Connectomics: parsing heterogeneity and creating markers in ASD,9746821,R01MH117807,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Anisotropy', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavioral Genetics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diffuse', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Mood Disorders', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Quality Control', 'Research', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Site', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'data integration', 'deep learning', 'design', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'indexing', 'neuroimaging', 'precision medicine', 'preservation', 'repetitive behavior', 'sex', 'social', 'success', 'tool', 'white matter']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2019,783284,0.1898366160609229
"Infant Vocalizations as Early Markers of Autism Spectrum Disorder Abstract The goal of this R03 is to characterize longitudinal vocal development in infants and toddlers at risk for ASD and use these metrics to predict subsequent diagnosis and dimensional social/language abilities. There is a critical need for reliable markers of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) that can be used to detect the condition in infancy and hasten the onset of early intervention services. Preliminary data from our team indicates that infant vocalization features distinguish groups beginning in the first year of life, and account for significant variance in later diagnostic status and social/language phenotype. For example, we found that infants later diagnosed with ASD produce fewer speech-like vocalizations, fewer vocalizations directed toward others, more crying, and altered vocalization acoustics. However, the longitudinal development of these early-emerging differences has not been completely described, and while they hold promise as early markers, their ability to predict individual clinical outcomes has not been directly tested in a large sample. Therefore, the power of these early vocalization differences to improve clinical detection has not been fully harnessed. To address this gap, we leverage a large existing dataset collected through the Infant Brain Imaging Study (IBIS; NICHD R01HD055741, PI: Dr. Joseph Piven). In this successful longitudinal multi-site study, infants at high and low familial risk for ASD completed video-recorded behavioral assessments at 6, 12, and 24 months of age, as well as neuroimaging at the same time points. Our research plan includes annotating infant vocalizations produced during these interactions using an expanded version of a coding scheme we have already developed, manualized, and trained annotators to reliably implement, and measuring the acoustic properties of each annotated vocalization. In Aim 1, we will use mixed models to analyze developmental group differences in vocalization features, determining which qualities distinguish groups and when. In Aim 2, we will use machine learning to test whether vocalization features produced during the first year of life can accurately predict diagnostic and social/language outcomes at age 2. This work will provide evidence of the clinical utility of infant vocalizations as pre-diagnostic behavioral biomarkers, setting the stage for subsequent studies of the relationship between early vocal behavior and brain development (measured using previously collected neuroimaging data from the same participants). The  Project Narrative This R03 proposal tackles a persistent public health challenge – detecting autism spectrum disorder (ASD) during infancy – by identifying characteristics of infant vocalizations that predict whether a given child will develop the condition. To achieve this goal, we use computational linguistics and machine learning to analyze existing audio/video recordings from a large longitudinal cohort of infants at high and low risk for autism. This work has high public health relevance because it aims to identify markers that improve early identification of ASD, which is essential for initiating early intervention services and improving long-term functional outcomes.",Infant Vocalizations as Early Markers of Autism Spectrum Disorder,9726509,R03DC017944,"['2 year old', 'Acoustics', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Age-Months', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Computational Linguistics', 'Crying', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Distress', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Funding', 'Genetic Risk', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Infant', 'Infrastructure', 'Language', 'Laughter', 'Letters', 'Life', 'Linguistics', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Speech', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Training', 'United States', 'Video Recording', 'Videotape', 'Visit', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'biobehavior', 'clinically relevant', 'early onset', 'functional outcomes', 'high risk', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'improved functioning', 'indexing', 'infancy', 'language outcome', 'neuroimaging', 'peer', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'service intervention', 'social', 'success', 'vocalization']",NIDCD,CHILDREN'S HOSP OF PHILADELPHIA,R03,2019,88000,0.14050002485335158
"Gene-brain-environment interactions as determinants of typical and atypical developmental trajectories Project Summary Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a heritable neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by heterogeneous genetic etiology and behavioral symptomatology. While recent genetics research suggests that the cumulative effects of many single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on many genes confer increased risk of ASD, very little is known about how additive genetic risk impacts brain function and structure. My dissertation work leverages variation at the genetic, neural, and behavioral levels by investigating how cumulative genetic risk for ASD on a gene implicated in social behavior across species – the oxytocin receptor gene (OXTR) – impacts network-level activity and connectivity in brain regions critical for social reward processing, and how risk-allele dosage relates to individual differences in ASD symptomatology. Results of my first dissertation study have shown that OXTR risk-allele dosage modulates resting-state connectivity of the reward network in both youth with ASD and typically developing (TD) youth, although in different ways. In youth with ASD, greater OXTR risk is associated with reduced connectivity between nodes of the reward circuit and greater symptom severity. Conversely, in TD youth, greater OXTR risk-allele dosage is associated with greater connectivity between the reward network and frontal brain regions involved in mentalizing and this, in turn, is associated with better social functioning (Hernandez et al., 2016a). These findings in TD youth suggest a compensatory neural mechanism in the face of increased genetic risk for ASD, and raise further questions about the role of other genetic (i.e., epistatic) and environmental/experiential variables in steering development along typical vs. atypical trajectories. My ongoing dissertation study examines the moderating effects of diagnosis and gender on the relationship between OXTR risk-allele dosage and neural processing of social rewards using functional neuroimaging (fMRI). While I have gained strong expertise in connectivity-based neuroimaging, genetics, and the neurobiology of ASD, my last dissertation project will provide additional training in analysis of task-related fMRI data and assessment of changes in task-based functional connectivity (i.e., training in psychophysiological interaction analyses). My dissertation work thus far highlights how little is known about the mechanisms by which individuals with the same genetic risk for mental illness have different outcomes (i.e., affected vs. resilient). As a post-doctoral researcher, I aim to gain additional training in the assessment of environmental and experiential variables that affect neurodevelopmental outcomes, as well as in advanced data-analytic approaches to model multilevel interactions between gene-brain-environment measures (e.g., statistical analysis of longitudinal data, machine learning algorithms, imaging-genetics of genome-wide data) with the ultimate goal of combining these data to better predict risk for mental illness and inform interventions. These aims are in line with the NIH Blueprint for NIMH, NICHD, and NINDS, as they seek to elucidate the neurobiological mechanisms underlying complex human behavior and neurodevelopmental disorders. Project Narrative The proposed dissertation research examines how cumulative genetic risk for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) on a gene implicated in social behavior across species – the oxytocin receptor gene (OXTR) – impacts brain activity and connectivity in youth with and without ASD, as well as how risk-allele dosage relates to individual differences in ASD symptomatology and social functioning. Future postdoctoral research will investigate how genetic, environmental, and experiential factors impact neurodevelopmental trajectories with a focus on adolescence, a period during which many psychiatric disorders emerge. A better understanding of how complex gene-brain-environment interactions confer vulnerability or resilience to mental illness may lead to earlier diagnosis, more efficacious treatment, and improved outcome.",Gene-brain-environment interactions as determinants of typical and atypical developmental trajectories,9764485,K00MH119663,"['Adolescence', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Animals', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Childhood', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Exposure to', 'Female', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Research', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genetic study', 'Goals', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Neural Pathways', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Other Genetics', 'Outcome', 'Oxytocin', 'Oxytocin Receptor', 'Pattern', 'Penetrance', 'Persons', 'Play', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychophysiology', 'Receptor Gene', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Functioning', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Youth', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'biobehavior', 'brain behavior', 'career', 'dosage', 'endophenotype', 'frontal lobe', 'gender difference', 'gene environment interaction', 'genetic variant', 'genome-wide', 'imaging genetics', 'improved outcome', 'longitudinal analysis', 'machine learning algorithm', 'male', 'multilevel analysis', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'outcome forecast', 'psychologic', 'relating to nervous system', 'resilience', 'reward circuitry', 'reward processing', 'risk variant', 'sex', 'skills', 'social', 'symptomatology', 'task analysis']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,K00,2019,75492,0.1567633591512041
"A Longitudinal MRI Study Characterizing Very Early Brain Development in Infants with Down Syndrome Longitudinal MRI Characterization of Very Early Brain Development  in Infants with Down Syndrome Project Summary/Abstract Down syndrome (DS), the most common genetic cause of intellectual disability, is associated with varying degrees of cognitive and behavioral impairments. Pharmacologic therapies and genetic modulators are emerging which, if administered early in conjunction with traditional therapies, show promise for improving developmental outcomes in children with DS. However, the stark absence of early neurodevelopment knowledge in DS hampers these efforts. The main goal of this proposal is to develop biomarkers as future targets for specific therapies based on careful characterization of early aberrant neurodevelopmental patterns. This study will be a combined effort with WU as the coordinating center and six other research groups: UNC, UW, CHOP, MNI, NYU, and University of Minnesota. These groups comprise the ACE-IBIS (Autism Center of Excellence Infant Brain Imaging Study) network, a well-established and experienced group that has been productively collaborating for 8 years on MRI imaging and behavioral characterization of infants at high risk for autism, healthy typical infants (TYP), and infants with Fragile X. The aims of this proposal are: 1) Define the longitudinal characteristics of early brain development in infants (3 to 24 months) with DS in comparison to TYP infants and infants with other developmental disabilities (ASD and Fragile X) using three different types of neuroimaging (MRI, DTI, rsfMRI); 2) Develop predictive models for developmental outcomes in infants with DS based on longitudinal structural or functional MRI characteristics; and 3) Characterize brain-behavior correlates with coordinated multimodal imaging in infancy characterizing the interrelationship between longitudinal network imaging parameters and cognitive, behavioral and neurodevelopmental outcomes using sophisticated multivariate support vector machine (SVM) analytic strategies. 120 infants with DS and 40 TYP control infants will be followed longitudinally from 3 to 24 months. MRI scans will be obtained during natural sleep and a series of well-validated developmental and behavioral assessments will be completed at each visit. This project will be the first to define the nature and timing of alterations in brain development in infants with DS. The proposed project addresses several key research recommendations from the “NICHD 2014-The NIH Research Plan on Down Syndrome.” The study aims match the recommendation for the quantitative characterization based on imaging of early brain development and the relationship of cognitive, behavioral and social development to early aberrant neurodevelopment in DS. This project will also address recommendations for investigation of comorbid ASD in DS, which could be as high as 5-10%. The IBIS network is uniquely qualified to examine early neurodevelopmental patterns, utilizing the ASD, TYP and FraX infant data sets to better characterize and examine specificity of DS early developmental patterns including ASD qualities and impairments in social development. It is clear that quantification of neurodevelopmental trajectories in infants with DS will be critical to identification of personalized intervention strategies and to assess the efficacy of early life, targeted, highly novel and mechanistically specific DS interventions. Project Narrative Down's syndrome (DS), the most common genetic cause of intellectual disability, is associated with a wide range of cognitive and behavioral impairments. Through the use of cutting edge MRI technology that allows us to look at the shape, function, and connections within the brain, we will be able to study and better understand early brain development in infants with DS. Working toward the goal to be able to assess the impact of specific early intervention therapies that are most helpful in improving the developmental outcomes of children with DS. This study mirrors and expands on the study designs and techniques that were developed to study infants with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), Fragile X, and typically developing infants, and will allow us to further our understanding of maturation patterns of infant brains that we can apply to DS, ASD, Fragile X, and other disabilities.",A Longitudinal MRI Study Characterizing Very Early Brain Development in Infants with Down Syndrome,9789674,R01HD088125,"['Address', 'Age', 'Age-Months', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Attention', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cerebellum', 'Cerebrum', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Cognitive', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Developmental Disabilities', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion', 'Down Syndrome', 'Early Intervention', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Fragile X Syndrome', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Intellectual functioning disability', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Life', 'Life Expectancy', 'Live Birth', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Minnesota', 'Motor', 'Motor Skills', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Myelin', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Nature', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacology', 'Pregnancy', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Rest', 'Sedation procedure', 'Sensory', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Sleep', 'Social Development', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Thick', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Visit', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'behavioral impairment', 'brain behavior', 'cognitive development', 'congenital heart disorder', 'data acquisition', 'developmental disease', 'disability', 'experience', 'functional disability', 'gastrointestinal', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'infancy', 'malformation', 'morphometry', 'multimodality', 'neural circuit', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'personalized intervention', 'predictive modeling', 'preservation', 'recruit', 'skills', 'targeted treatment', 'traditional therapy', 'white matter']",NICHD,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,2314238,0.09102282565521008
"Novel Approaches to Infant Screening for ASD in Pediatric Primary Care ABSTRACT – Novel Approaches to Infant Screening for ASD in Pediatric Primary Care  The overall goal of this project is to develop and validate novel tools to identify risk for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in infants 6-12 months of age in a pediatric primary care setting. Research has confirmed that ASD is associated with changes in brain and behavior that are evident during infancy, and proof-of-concept studies suggest that early intervention during the infant period can improve early brain function and developmental outcomes. Moreover, early universal autism screening has been shown to reduce existing disparities based on socioeconomic status (SES) and ethnicity/race in access to early diagnosis and treatment. This project leverages ongoing work that is currently funded as part of the Duke NIH Autism Center of Excellence (ACE) Award (NICHD P50 HD093074; Dawson, Center Director), which is evaluating a novel digital phenotyping tool for early ASD risk assessment in toddler-age children in a pediatric primary care setting. Our novel screening tool, SenseToKnow, is based on active closed-loop sensing, where children are shown brief, developmentally-appropriate, dynamic stimuli on a smart tablet or smartphone, while the sensors in the same device capture information for automatic, objective quantification of several behavioral risk markers, based on patterns of attention, orienting, affect, vocalizations, and motor behavior. The proposed research will 1) evaluate a novel infant version of the app, SenseToKnow-Infant, in a large population of infants in the context of routine pediatric care, and 2) examine the utility of a multi- modal approach to risk assessment that combines information from SenseToKnow-I with information from infant and maternal electronic health records (EHRs). Using both direct digital behavioral measurement via SenseToKnow-I and data readily available in the EHR, we aim to develop and validate a multimodal ASD risk assessment algorithm for use in infants (6-12 months of age) that can be deployed in the general population. RELEVANCE STATEMENT – Novel Approaches to Infant Screening for ASD in Pediatric Primary Care The overall goal of this project is to develop and validate novel tools to identify risk for autism spectrum disorder in infants 6-12 months of age in a pediatric primary care setting.

"Subnetwork-based Quantitative Imaging Biomarkers for Therapy Assessment in Autism Project Summary Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a developmental disorder characterized by impairment of social interaction and communication, as well as repetitive behaviors, with severity ranging from mild to signiﬁcantly disabling. The prevalence in the United States is rising (currently about 1 in 68 children) and the associated costs are great. In our most recent previous efforts on this project, we have initiated development of a graph-based, Bayesian neuroimage analysis framework and have used it to characterize brain pathology in ASD and identify abnormal functional subnetworks from groupwise data. Key results demonstrated clear differences in task- based functional brain networks between ASD and typically developing control (TDC) groups associated with the perception of biological motion. While our efforts (and those of others) are important for characterizing ASD, advances in the characterization of response to therapy with imaging are crucial for improved understanding, and ultimately personalization, of these therapies. Thus, we propose to put forth a bold new direction: to further develop our analysis methodology and study these task-based subnetworks, now with the goal of characterizing individuals in terms of their predicted response to treatment. We will focus on Pivotal Response Treatment (PRT), an intensive behavioral therapy for children with ASD that improves social communication skills. We ﬁrst propose to fully develop our uniﬁed Bayesian framework to detect both hyper- and hypo-synchronous functional subnetworks within whole-brain, groupwise, task-based fMRI data on a large training dataset of ASD and TDC subjects. We will identify dense subgraphs (communities) that exhibit group differences in functional synchrony between ASD and TDC groups. The groupwise subnetworks will then be mapped to single subject, task-based fMRI data acquired from a cohort of ASD subjects treated with PRT. For each subject, imaging biomarkers based on activation signal strength and functional connectivity will be derived for regions within each hyper- and hypo- synchronous subnetwork at both baseline and after 16 weeks of therapy. Using a random forest regression strategy, we will use a combination of biomarkers from the baseline data to predict response to PRT (using change in Social Responsiveness Scale, 2nd Edition as the primary clinical outcome measure). In addition, we will use a combination of biomarkers from baseline and 16 weeks to predict treatment persistence at 32 weeks. We will compare the prediction capability of our new approach using task-based fMRI to a set of biomarkers with regions identiﬁed from groupwise analysis of resting state fMRI (rsfMRI) networks found from the same training subjects noted above using an alternative state-of-the-art method. We will also develop methods to examine potential metabolic alterations in networks using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) of GABA and glutamate (the major excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters) to explore possible biochemical differences associated with ASD, changes in response to PRT and the use of this information as additional imaging biomarkers. Project Narrative Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a difﬁcult and growing problem. The goal of this project is to develop sensi- tive and quantitative imaging and image analysis methodology for the study of ASD aimed at measuring brain pathology and using it to characterize and predict response to therapy.

"The Psychiatric Cell Map Initiative: Connecting Genomics, Subcellular Networks, and Higher Order Phenotypes SUMMARY The global burden of mental illness, including autism spectrum disorders (ASD), intellectual disability, epilepsy, Tourette disorder, schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, is enormous, whether measured in health care expenditures, lost productivity, or personal suffering. Unfortunately, there is a striking lack of insight into the underlying molecular biology of these syndromes. However, recent advances in gene discovery are setting the stage for a transformation in the understanding of these psychiatric disorders. Understanding pathobiology and developing novel treatments is becoming increasingly dependent on knowledge of biological networks of multiple types, including physical interactions among proteins and synthetic­lethal and epistatic interactions among genes. Here we seek support for a new effort, the Psychiatric Cell Map Initiative (PCMI, www.pcmi.ucsf.edu), aimed at comprehensively understanding these complex interactions in psychiatric disorders and how they differ between diseased and healthy states. While we will focus on ASD in this proposal, this work will establish a paradigm to investigate other psychiatric disorders in future work. The PCMI is a multi­campus initiative of the University of California, involving UC San Francisco, UC San Diego and UC Berkeley, which leverages genomics, proteomics, high­throughput sequencing, advanced network mapping, computational analysis, and research platforms developed by multiple PCMI investigators over the past decade. Thus primed, these platforms will be tuned to efficiently generate, assemble, and analyze molecular networks linked to ASD, in relevant cell types, with a view towards pathway and network­based personalized therapy. Specifically, over the next five years the PCMI will seek to catalyze major phase transitions in ASD research and therapy by (1) Comprehensively mapping the networks of physical interactions among proteins linked to ASD, revealing the protein complexes and higher­order molecular units underlying ASD in multiple cell types of the human brain; (2) Mapping the parallel networks of synthetic­lethal and epistatic interactions among ASD genes using CRISPR­based approaches; (3) Establishing the robust computational methodology, end­user software, and databases for assembly and use of ASD cell network maps in both basic and clinical modalities; (4) Translating molecular insights into an understanding of higher order phenotypes; (5) Building a critical mass of leading investigators focused on psychiatric disorders worldwide to expand PCMI into a global coordinated partnership; and (6) Training the current and next­generation of scientists in Network Biology and its applications to research focused on psychiatric disorders. NARRATIVE Although the past few years have ushered in much success in identifying the genes linked to autism spectrum disorders (ASD), we need to move beyond simply cataloguing component genes in order to gain a mechanistic and actionable understanding of ASD and other psychiatric disorders. More specifically, it is critical to understand the many interactions between these genes and the proteins they encode, and how these complex networks are connected to the underlying pathobiology of ASD. To address this challenge, the Psychiatric Cell Map Initiative (PCMI, www.pcmi.ucsf.edu) will apply systematic approaches to comprehensively map the molecular networks that underlie ASD and translate them to higher order biological insights, which will form a key resource for precision medicine.","The Psychiatric Cell Map Initiative: Connecting Genomics, Subcellular Networks, and Higher Order Phenotypes",9776620,U01MH115747,"['ASCL1 gene', 'Address', 'Architecture', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'CRISPR interference', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'California', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coupled', 'Cryoelectron Microscopy', 'DNA sequencing', 'DNA-Protein Interaction', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Engineering', 'Epilepsy', 'Eukaryotic Cell', 'Future', 'Gene Combinations', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Screening', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Gilles de la Tourette syndrome', 'Goals', 'Health Expenditures', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Intellectual functioning disability', 'Knowledge', 'Libraries', 'Ligands', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Microscopy', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Mutation', 'Network-based', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Ontology', 'Organism', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phase Transition', 'Phenotype', 'Point Mutation', 'Productivity', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'San Francisco', 'Schizophrenia', 'Scientist', 'Slice', 'Structural Protein', 'Structure', 'Syndrome', 'Tadpoles', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Xenopus', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'automated image analysis', 'base', 'cell type', 'deep neural network', 'excitatory neuron', 'experimental study', 'gene discovery', 'in vivo', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'inhibitory neuron', 'insight', 'interest', 'link protein', 'molecular phenotype', 'multidisciplinary', 'neural network', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'next generation', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'protein complex', 'protein structure', 'rare variant', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'small molecule', 'success', 'transcriptome']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",U01,2019,3605729,0.14335073703788526
"Dose Reduction in Pediatric/Adolescent Brain PET Imaging Through Artificial Neural Networks Project Summary/Abstract  Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a group of complex neurodevelopment disorders affecting nearly 1.5 percent of American children. The underlying and contributing mechanisms of ASD are largely undetermined and there are no FDA-approved medications to treat the core social-communicative symptoms of the disorder. Unlike other brain disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD), there is a gross disparity between the high prevalence of ASD and the small number of PET research studies; this condition should be addressed since the opportunities for PET imaging to have an impact in ASD research are substantial.  Synapses allow for the transmission of electrochemical information, which is the essential means of communication in the brain. Synaptic pathology has been associated with brain disorders including AD, epilepsy, autism, depression, and schizophrenia. Our recent development of 11C-UCB-J, a PET radioligand that binds to synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A (SV2A), provides the ability to quantify synaptic density in the living human brain. 11C-UCB-J for SV2A PET imaging has the potential to make game-changing contributions to ASD research and potential diagnosis. However, because of the current imaging dose, the technique cannot be applied regularly in autism research of children due to the requirement of low radiation exposure especially for longitudinal studies in the same individuals at different developmental stages.  The goal of this proposal is to reduce the clinical 11C-UCB-J PET imaging dose to be lower than the radiation one receives from a round-trip cross-country flight. To accomplish this goal, we will develop artificial neural network-based dose-reduction techniques. We hypothesize that 1) the proposed techniques will enhance (parametric) images from 1/10 of the dose so that they are comparable to the full-dose (parametric) images in terms of noise and resolution and 2) with the reduced dose, the test-retest reproducibility and the ability to differentiate patients from controls will not be diminished.  The proposed research will be the first study to demonstrate that PET imaging dose can be reduced to a point of acceptability for ASD research in children and other diseases of adolescence. This effort is in line with the NIBIB I/START program to develop clinical technologies for imaging development in children and synergizes with the NIH supported large scale ABCD (Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development) longitudinal study for brain development in children, where MRI has been widely used but PET has not. If successful, we will apply for a larger grant to use SV2A PET to characterize the mechanisms of ASD neuropathology toward more effective diagnosis and personalized treatment. Project Narrative A newly developed positron emission tomography (PET) imaging tracer can be used to measure synaptic density in the living human brain. Synaptic pathology has been associated with many brain disorders including autism spectrum disorder (ASD), which affects 1.5% of American children. The project will use machine learning techniques to explore whether the radiation dose of synaptic PET imaging can be effectively lowered to roughly that of a round-trip cross-country airline flight for its regular utilization in ASD research in children and adolescents.",Dose Reduction in Pediatric/Adolescent Brain PET Imaging Through Artificial Neural Networks,9727470,R03EB028070,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'American', 'Autopsy', 'Binding', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Country', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Early Intervention', 'Effectiveness', 'Epilepsy', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'FDA approved', 'Glycoproteins', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'High Prevalence', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Image Enhancement', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Kinetics', 'Learning', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Movement Disorders', 'National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering', 'Network-based', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neurodevelopmental Disability', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Noise', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Process', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation exposure', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Scheme', 'Schizophrenia', 'Seizures', 'Symptoms', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic Vesicles', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tracer', 'Training', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'analytical method', 'artificial neural network', 'attenuation', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'brain research', 'cognitive development', 'cognitive function', 'deep learning', 'density', 'design', 'healthy volunteer', 'high risk', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'memory process', 'nervous system disorder', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuropathology', 'novel', 'parametric imaging', 'personalized medicine', 'prevent', 'programs', 'radiation effect', 'radioligand', 'reconstruction', 'research study', 'social', 'success', 'task analysis', 'transmission process', 'uptake']",NIBIB,OAKLAND UNIVERSITY,R03,2019,228409,0.10018773763012978
"Using complex video stimuli to elucidate atypical brain functioning in ASD ABSTRACT A major gap in our understanding of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is in knowing how the brain functions during conditions that approximate the complex processing demands of the real world. Instead, almost everything we know about brain functioning in ASD comes from reductionist studies that often use highly simpliﬁed stimuli and isolated task demands, or even from studies that lack a stimulus or task altogether, as in the case of resting-state functional connectivity. Yet, successful processing “in the wild” (i.e., in the real world) relies on the simultaneous engagement and seamless integration of multiple brain regions, brain networks, and cognitive processes. Understanding how these neural systems behave and interact during real-time processing of complex and dynamic stimuli, therefore, is critical for understanding how real-world behavior and cognition emerge from brain activity, and this remains a major gap in our understanding of ASD. The purpose of the current proposal is to ﬁll this gap, by using complex video stimuli that sample broadly from the natural world and engage multiple diverse perceptual and cognitive systems simultaneously, thus evoking activity across the entire brain at once. From this data, rich high-dimensional measures can be generated and used in combination with multivariate analytic methods ideally-suited to detect idiosyncratic and heterogeneous patterns of neural responding, which can then be related back to phenotypic variability across individuals. Our proposed studies will take place over 5 years and include 4 speciﬁc aims. In the ﬁrst two aims, we will identify neural systems most affected in ASD during the presentation of a complex video stimulus, parse the heterogeneity at the neural level using data-driven approaches and relate it back to heterogeneity at the behavioral level, and explore the stimulus dimensions (social and non-social alike, both sampled broadly) that underlie these neural abnormalities. In a third aim, we will examine video-evoked functional connectivity both within and across brain networks, comparing this directly against resting-state connectivity, and examining both modes of functional connectivity across various timescales (including dynamic coupling). A ﬁnal exploratory aim will assess the short-term and long-term stability of these measures, as well as their sensitivity in tracking change following experimental perturbation—important characteristics for potential biomarkers and/or predictor and outcome measures for use in intervention studies. Altogether, this work will provide new insight into brain activity and brain connectivity during conditions that more closely reﬂect processing demands of the natural world, help to link individual differences in brain functioning with individual differences in behavior (i.e., heterogeneity), and assess whether these neural measures may be viable candidates as biomarkers for use in future studies. This proposal addresses the Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee's Strategic Plan (2013 Update) that includes comprehensive examination of the neural circuitry in individuals with ASD across the lifespan, including throughout adulthood, as well as a focus on heterogeneity. PROJECT NARRATIVE Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is an alarmingly common neurodevelopmental disorder that affects approximately 1% of the population, making it a major public health concern.

"Prediction and Early Language Development in Young Children with ASD Abstract Language delay is often one of the first concerns of parents of toddlers with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and early language abilities predict broader outcomes for children on the autism spectrum. Yet, mechanisms underlying language deficits in children with ASD remain unspecified. One prominent component of linguistic behavior is the use of predictions or expectations during learning and processing. Several researchers have recently posited prediction-deficit accounts of ASD. The basic assumption of the prediction accounts is that information is processed by making predictions and testing violations against expectations (prediction errors). Flexible (neurotypical) brains attribute differential weights to prediction errors to determine when new learning is appropriate, while individuals with ASD are thought to assign disproportionate weight to prediction errors. These prediction deficits are hypothesized to lead to higher levels of perceived novelty, resulting in `hyperplasticity' of learning based on the most recent input. The proposed project will be the first study to examine whether language deficits in young children with ASD are linked to atypical domain-general prediction processes. Seven studies are proposed to address the following Specific Aims: (1) to determine the ability of toddlers with ASD to generate predictions compared to typically developing (TD) peers; (2) to establish whether toddlers with ASD exhibit hyperplasticity of learning relative to TD peers; (3) to examine the extent to which certain child characteristics predict individual variability in predictive behavior and hyperplasticity in toddlers with ASD; and (4) establish whether predictive behavior or hyperplasticity of learning on verbal/visual tasks predicts vocabulary and/or syntactic ability one year later in young children with ASD. The sample will be comprised of 75 ASD toddlers (three cohorts of 25 toddlers) and 75 TD controls distribution-matched on cognition (raw scores), SES, and sex. In this project we will utilize anticipatory eye movements (AEMs) and looking-while-listening (LWL) methods to investigate prediction in visual and verbal tasks in toddlers with and without ASD. Studies 1 (auditory) and 2 (visual) examine prediction as indexed by AEMs under conditions in which probabilities of the occurrence of events are relatively stable. Studies 3 (verbal) and 4 (nonverbal) will investigate hyperplasticity of learning in AEM tasks in which probabilities of the events change and predictions must be updated. Study 5 will explore hyperplasticity within the context of novel word learning using a LWL task. Study 6 will examine the relationship between child characteristics (cognition, language, autism symptom severity) and prediction. In Study 7, performance on Studies 1-5 will be used to predict language abilities in the same sample of toddlers one year later (from 18-35 mo to 30-47 mo) using both standardized tasks and an online incremental language processing task. All studies were developed to have minimal task demands in order to include toddlers with ASD across a wide range of functioning. Findings from this research will provide important new insights into ASD phenotypes and mechanisms underlying language development that could open new pathways for intervention. Project Narrative Individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) exhibit challenges in numerous domains of functioning which often include significant impacts on language development. The proposed research investigates the assumption that individuals with ASD have difficulties making predictions, leading to atypical learning. Using methods designed to study learning in toddlers based on their eye movements, the proposed studies will examine links between language abilities and performance on verbal and visual learning tasks in toddlers with ASD and toddlers with typical development.",Prediction and Early Language Development in Young Children with ASD,9797068,R01DC017974,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Area', 'Auditory', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Development', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'Exhibits', 'Eye Movements', 'Generations', 'Hyperplasia', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Language', 'Language Delays', 'Language Development', 'Language Disorders', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Linguistics', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Matched Group', 'Measures', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Mind', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Overweight', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Speed', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Task Performances', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'Variant', 'Verbal Learning', 'Visual', 'Vocabulary', 'Weight', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'autistic children', 'base', 'central coherence', 'cohort', 'design', 'expectation', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'indexing', 'individual variation', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'language outcome', 'language processing', 'novel', 'peer', 'sequence learning', 'sex', 'social', 'social communication', 'syntax', 'theories', 'visual learning', 'visual processing', 'word learning']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2019,609106,0.1537962516957265
"The role of statistical learning in the atypical language development in ASD Abstract ! Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) show enormous heterogeneity in core language abilities, such as phonology and grammar. Over 50% of verbal children with ASD have borderline or impaired language. Deciphering how children with ASD learn language is important for understanding the heterogeneity of language abilities in this population, as well as for the development of more effective interventions for children with ASD who also have language difficulties. Based on decades of behavioral research in typical language acquisition, statistical learning is essential for encoding rich regularities and variability for first language development. Whereas statistical learning has been linked to typical language development and Developmental Language Disorder (DLD), existing studies investigating statistical learning in ASD lack consensus regarding whether statistical learning is impaired in ASD. Both the enormous heterogeneity of ASD population and the recently reported variation in one’s ability to learn statistics across linguistic and non-linguistic domains, as well as across sensory modalities, might have contributed to such inconclusive results. The overall goal of this research is to understand whether the language heterogeneity in ASD can be attributed to variations of statistical learning in a specific domain (linguistic vs. nonlinguistic) or modality (auditory vs. visual). Aim 1 proposes to first characterize the relationship between children’s language abilities and statistical-learning profiles across domains and modalities in a large sample of children with ASD (6 to 8 years old) and typically developing (TD) controls. Both groups will be evaluated using a novel web-based testing platform. Aim 2 will focus on probing the neural mechanisms during statistical learning in each domain and modality in ASD, and how relative strengths and weaknesses in the groupings are related to language performance. Comparing the neural responses during statistical learning tasks among children with ASD in relation to high vs. low statistical learning abilities grouped by domain and modality, the study will test whether language performance in ASD is related to domain-specific, modality-specific, or domain/modality-general neural substrates of statistical learning. The proposed study will pave the way towards a deeper understanding of the mechanisms involved in language impairment in ASD. The results will provide crucial preliminary data for future investigations aiming to elucidate the causal relationship between statistical learning ability and language learning in a longitudinal intervention study and how statistical learning profile is related to different genetic risks in children with ASD. Narrative: The proposed research aims to understand the cognitive and neural bases of learning mechanisms underlying the heterogeneity of language abilities in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). The findings of this work will characterize the behavioral phenotypes of statistical learning in a large sample of children with ASD and provide critical pilot data for the brain bases that constrain language learning in children with ASD.!",The role of statistical learning in the atypical language development in ASD,9813899,R21DC017576,"['11 year old', '8 year old', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Auditory', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Research', 'Brain', 'Child', 'Child Language', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Foundational Skills', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Genetic Risk', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention Studies', 'Investigation', 'Judgment', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Language Development Disorders', 'Learning', 'Learning Skill', 'Light', 'Linguistics', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Neurocognitive', 'Online Systems', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sensory', 'Severities', 'Social Environment', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'autistic children', 'base', 'cognitive process', 'effective intervention', 'innovation', 'language impairment', 'learning ability', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'phonology', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'skills', 'social', 'specific language impairment', 'statistics', 'white matter']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF DELAWARE,R21,2019,152317,0.05828047017511825
"Temporal connectomics for infant brain: neurodevelopment modulated by pathology Abstract Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a highly heritable neurodevelopmental disorder affecting more than 1% of children (and almost 2% of boys), with those born in a high risk (HR) family with a child diagnosed with ASD having a ~20 fold greater risk than the general population. Although it can only be reliably diagnosed after the second year of life, ASD originates from a neurodevelopmental mechanism, with symptoms emerging as early as 6 months of age. Prospective large-scale longitudinal neuroimaging studies like the Infant Brain Imaging Study (IBIS), of those born into a high-risk (HR) family, are extremely valuable as they facilitate discovery of the earliest manifestations of ASD. The overarching goal of this proposal is a comprehensive comparative longitudinal analysis of brain organization of high- and low-risk populations, by using IBIS diffusion MRI (dMRI) data collected at 3 time points in the first 2 years of life, to elucidate the earliest manifestations of ASD and disorder trajectory. In addition, we aim to create a biomarker of ASD risk from brain connectivity features and their developmental trajectories, and to understand the brain bases of familial risk (independent of ASD). dMRI provides an insight into the structural organization of the brain represented as a connectome. “Miswiring” of the structural connectome can manifest as neuro-immaturity of WM and changes in network structures, that is, subnetworks (collection of strongly inter-connected regions associated with a distinct communication pattern), and the communication backbone (overall architecture of communication between subnetworks). Both connectivity and WM quality can be compromised in ASD compared to controls, suggesting a “miswired” connectome. Studying ASD related early developmental changes in connectivity requires design of novel analysis methods based on “longitudinal” connectomic features that are 4D features that incorporate their temporal evolution over development, culminating in the creation of novel imaging-based biomarkers. In Aim 1, we will create a new method of extracting longitudinal fiber tracts to identify and analyze differences between the developmental tract trajectories in LR-, HR- and HR+ subjects using geometry and quality features derived from the fiber bundles, to identify differences in neuro-immaturity. In aim 2, we will design novel methods to extract longitudinal network structures like structurally-cohesive and functionally-defined subnetworks and the global communication backbone, and investigate developmental differences modulated by familial risk and gender. Finally, in Aim 3 we will use the tract and network features extracted from Aims 1 and 2 to develop imaging based markers that will assist with early ASD prediction, identifying siblings who could gain from an early therapeutic intervention and provide an index of development in the form of brain connectivity “maturational age” to help characterize developmental delays and brain patterns corresponding to the same. The longitudinal analysis methods developed in the proposal will be generalizable to other clinical populations that can gain from longitudinal analysis spanning several time points. Project narrative The project aims at comprehensive comparative analysis of diffusion-based structural connectivity in high- and low-risk populations, to elucidate the earliest manifestation of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). This will require the design of novel sophisticated longitudinal analysis methods based on longitudinal tracts and network structures that inherently incorporate the temporal evolution over development. Finally, using the developmental trajectories of these features, we aim to create imaging-based biomarkers of familial risk, development and predictive of ASD prior to the age of diagnosis.",Temporal connectomics for infant brain: neurodevelopment modulated by pathology,9640127,R01HD089390,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Age-Months', 'Anisotropy', 'Architecture', 'Attenuated', 'Base of the Brain', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Child', 'Chronology', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Evolution', 'Family', 'Fiber', 'Funding', 'Gender', 'General Population', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Heritability', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Length', 'Life', 'Longitudinal prospective study', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Sex Differences', 'Siblings', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vertebral column', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'boys', 'cohesion', 'comparative', 'connectome', 'design', 'disorder risk', 'high risk', 'high risk infant', 'high risk population', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging study', 'indexing', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'longitudinal analysis', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'organizational structure', 'predictive marker', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'social communication', 'spatiotemporal', 'white matter']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2019,571164,0.18772250047562347
"Adapting Biomarker Assays for Individuals with Autism and Intellectual Disability Project Summary/Abstract The field of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) research lacks objective, sensitive quantifications of symptomatology with sufficient evidence to justify use as biomarkers in clinical trials. In the current proposal we investigate two promising markers, neural response to faces, measured by electroencephalogram (EEG), and visual attention to faces, measured by eye-tracking (ET). Published work and our preliminary data indicate that these measures: reflect clinically meaningful differences in the core symptoms of ASD, both by discriminating groups with ASD from those with typical development (TD) and by correlating with symptomatology in individuals with ASD; have strong test-retest reliability; demonstrate sensitivity to change in clinical status, both in the context of pharmacological and behavioral intervention; are collected by objective, automated tools not vulnerable to issues associated with inter-rater or inter-operator reliability; are minimally invasive and highly tolerable and therefore applicable across a wide range of ages and functional levels, with acceptable burden for participants and families; are collected using economical and accessible technologies that are scalable for large multisite studies with potential utility in the near term. Despite the promise of these biomarkers, their appropriateness in individuals with ASD and intellectual disability (ASD+ID) is poorly understood. In this application, we propose a novel integration of technologies and an innovative experimental approach to investigate these promising biomarkers in this critically understudied population. We leverage two complementary lines of research developed by the PIs: Dr. McPartland's Autism Biomarkers Consortium for Clinical Trials (ABC-CT), a multisite study collecting large samples of highly reliable EEG and ET data in children with ASD, and Dr. Naples' suite of gaze- and behaviorally-contingent technologies permitting concurrent collection of ET and EEG data in individuals with severe ID. The proposed work will incorporate robust ABC-CT experiments into an innovative experimental approach to study 30 6-11 year old children with ASD+ID and a matched sample of 30 individuals with ID without ASD. We test the hypotheses that individuals with ASD+ID will display longer latency of the N170 event-related potential (ERP) to human faces and reduced proportion of looking time to human faces in static social scenes relative to individuals with ID without ASD and that face N170 and visual attention to faces will correlate with clinician and caregiver ratings of social- communicative function. This innovative project uses a suite of contingent technologies to acclimate participants to the testing environment and apparatus, to attenuate motion, to permit real time feedback on data quality to prioritize stimulus delivery, and to support post-processing of motion artifact using computer vision derived motion estimates. By adapting robust markers for administration to individuals with ASD and ID, this application holds promise for development of biomarkers viable in an understudied but critically important segment of the autism spectrum.

"Infant Vocal Communication: Typical Development and Autism Risk ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Research is now tracking early infant vocal communication using all-day recordings evaluated with human coding and in limited cases with automated analysis at very large scales. Results reveal unexpected features of development, illustrating foundations of language. Much of this work conducted at the University of Memphis (UM) is founded in an infrastructural theory of language development that has produced notable successes by supplying a widely-used stage model of vocal development and by providing the basis for determining clinically useful markers, especially associated with the onset and consolidation of canonical babbling (CB), a key foundation for spoken language. The UM empirical work within the infrastructural framework, based primarily on human-coding of longitudinal all-day recordings, has also begun to produce a new account of vocal foundations and vocal interaction both in the 1st months after full-term birth and in infants born prematurely by >2 months and still in the hospital. This work points toward possible indicators of risk for disorders in the first months of life. Further development of the new account holds promise for illuminating the development of vocal language and supplying predictors for conditions such as autism spectrum disorders (ASD).  The proposed research will expand the UM effort to much larger scale and address prediction of language development and of ASD through an ASD sibling study. The work will combine forces between the UM and Emory University's Marcus Autism Center (MAC), which both independently and through its Autism Center of Excellence (ACE) Program Project from NIH, is in the process of collecting a massive set of longitudinal all-day recordings of infants 1) showing typical development (TD), 2) at risk for ASD because they have an older sibling with ASD, and 3) at risk for language delay (LD) due to low socioeconomic status (SES). The MAC/ACE research includes analysis of the recordings with automated acoustic methods, but does not include funding for human coding of the massive recording set. Extensive human coding is in fact crucial for the ACE project, because without it, there is insufficient gold-standard data in terms of which to advance the accuracy and relevance of automated methods for developmental prediction and for detection of developmental communication disorders. Furthermore, many aspects of vocal patterning and interaction are as yet simply not accessible by automated means-human coding is the only workable option. The proposed research will combine efforts of UM and MAC, with 1) MAC supplying longitudinal all-day recordings across the 1st year of life to UM from the 3 groups, 2) UM performing coding and human-assisted acoustic analysis on representatively sampled segments from the recordings, and 3) both sites working together to predict infant outcomes at 24 months based on the human coding/analysis and based on the automated analysis that will result from supervised machine learning made possible by the human coding/analysis. The work targets improving prediction of language development and early identification of ASD. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This work will provide scientific foundations on vocal development and language in three groups of children, including ASD siblings, infants of low SES, and controls (low risk). The work will lay new foundations for automated large-scale monitoring of infant vocalizations.",Infant Vocal Communication: Typical Development and Autism Risk,9599448,R01DC015108,"['Acoustics', 'Address', 'Age', 'Age-Months', 'Caregivers', 'Centers of Research Excellence', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Developmental Communication Disorders', 'Early identification', 'Faculty', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Gold', 'Home environment', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Infant', 'Infrastructure', 'Language', 'Language Delays', 'Language Development', 'Life', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders', 'Outcome Assessment', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pattern', 'Periodicity', 'Premature Infant', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Siblings', 'Site', 'Social Development', 'Socialization', 'Term Birth', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'disorder risk', 'hearing impairment', 'human model', 'improved', 'infant monitoring', 'infant outcome', 'insight', 'language outcome', 'longitudinal database', 'low socioeconomic status', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'social', 'success', 'supervised learning', 'symptomatology', 'theories', 'vocal learning', 'vocalization']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF MEMPHIS,R01,2019,506133,0.08742604602894255
"Neurophenotypic Trajectories and Behavioral Outcomes in Autism Spectrum Disorder ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has a common set of diagnostic features that nonetheless vary substantially in severity in different individuals. There are also many co-morbid features ranging from developmental delay to epilepsy to gastrointestinal disturbances that further complicate the phenotypes of ASD. To discover and integrate multilevel phenotypic information that would allow definition of biological subtypes and potentially predict and facilitate optimal outcomes, the MIND Institute initiated the Autism Phenome Project (APP) in 2006. To date, behavioral, medical, immunological and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data have been acquired on 279 children (189 ASD, 90 typically developing controls - TD) at 2-3.5 years of age. Of these, 210 (134 ASD, 76 TD) have received a second MRI scan one year later and thus far 142 (83 ASD, 59 TD) have received a third scan at 5-6.5 years of age. This program of research has identified a number of neurophenotypes of ASD related to abnormal amygdala growth and abnormal brain enlargement. But, do these brain differences really matter? An overarching goal of the proposed research is to determine whether identified neural phenotypes persist into middle childhood and are associated with the quality and severity of core and co-morbid behavioral impairments. A unifying hypothesis is that different morphometric patterns will be associated with clinical features and with the quality of behavioral outcome. We are particularly interested in whether there are different patterns of brain organization that may predict optimal behavioral outcomes in ASD. Using recently developed behavioral modification procedures that yield high quality MRI images from children at all severity levels of ASD, we propose to obtain an additional MRI time point and conduct extensive behavioral assessment of children enrolled in the APP when they reach 9-11 years of age. Based on previous return rates, we estimate that 195 children will participate. We will also recruit 100 new subjects into the APP program. This research would allow an unprecedented exploration of the relationship between brain development, behavioral abnormalities, and cognitive and functional outcome in children transitioning from early to middle childhood. We propose: 1. To evaluate brain and behavioral consequences of three patterns of early amygdala growth; 2. To evaluate brain and behavioral consequences of abnormal brain enlargement in early childhood; and 3. To identify a pattern of brain organization that is associated with optimal behavioral outcome. These projects are consistent with Objectives 1 and 2 of the NIMH Strategic plan and address the 2009 IACC Strategic Plan crosscutting themes of Heterogeneity and Lifespan Perspective. They also contribute to the still unmet research opportunity for ""Multi-disciplinary, longitudinal, biobehavioral studies of children, youths, and adults beginning during infancy that characterize neurodevelopmental and medical developmental trajectories across the multiple axes of ASD phenotype..."". An important goal is to identify children who will need additional or specialized help to achieve the highest quality of life. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: By studying nearly 300 children in the MIND Institute's Autism Phenome Project on three occasions from 3 to 6 years of age, we have discovered that children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have various altered patterns of brain development. The current application seeks funding to bring the children back for another visit when they are 9-11 years old to see if certain patterns of brain development are useful in predicting which children have more serious symptoms of ASD, have higher levels of cognitive and emotional problems or, conversely, have optimal behavioral outcomes. One important goal is to find those children who will need additional or specialized help in order to achieve the highest quality of life.",Neurophenotypic Trajectories and Behavioral Outcomes in Autism Spectrum Disorder,9637451,R01MH103371,"['11 year old', '5 year old', '6 year old', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anatomy', 'Anxiety', 'Atlases', 'Back', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Body Size', 'Brain', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Emotional', 'Enrollment', 'Epilepsy', 'Fright', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Immunologics', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Literature', 'Longevity', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Medical', 'Mutation', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Procedures', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Risk Factors', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structural defect', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Visit', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'autistic children', 'base', 'behavioral impairment', 'behavioral outcome', 'biobehavior', 'brain abnormalities', 'brain overgrowth', 'brain size', 'cognitive function', 'disability', 'early childhood', 'functional outcomes', 'gastrointestinal', 'infancy', 'interest', 'middle childhood', 'multidisciplinary', 'phenome', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'social', 'social communication']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R01,2019,648903,0.20038987505392467
"Co-occurring ADHD in young children with ASD: Precursors, detection, neural signatures, and early treatment ABSTRACT – Co-occurring ADHD in young children with ASD: Precursors, detection, neural signatures, and  early treatment Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) occurs in ~40-60% of individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and substantially contributes to poorer clinical outcomes. Yet, very little research has focused on the overlap of ASD and ADHD during early childhood. Thus, little is known about how these two conditions co- emerge early in life. Given the high prevalence and clinical impact of the comorbidity of ASD and ADHD, the overall goal of the Duke Autism Center of Excellence is to characterize how co-occurring ADHD influences early screening, neural signatures, developmental trajectories, and response to early treatment of young children with ASD. Project 1 will characterize risk factors for and emergence of co-occurring ADHD symptoms in young children at risk for ASD and examine how these symptoms influence early detection and progression of ASD. This project will clarify why children who have co-occurring ADHD are diagnosed at a much later age and inform more effective early detection strategies. Following a large sample of toddlers receiving routine care in Duke pediatric primary clinics (N = ~ 2800 patients/year), Project 1 will prospectively identify children at risk for ASD and collect data on risk factors, ADHD, and developmental outcomes. Project 2 will elucidate shared and distinct neural signatures and attention-related biomarkers related to ASD and ADHD, examine the functional impact of co-occurring ADHD in young children with ASD, and identify precursor characteristics during infancy that are predictive of later emergence of comorbid ASD and ADHD. This project will characterize children with ASD alone, ASD+ADHD, ADHD alone, and typically-developing children, using state-of-the-art methods, including neurophysiology, eye-tracking, movement-tracking, and computer vision analysis. Project 3 will evaluate a novel early intervention model personalized for young children with ASD+ADHD that pharmacologically addresses ADHD symptoms prior to initiating early behavioral intervention, and identify changes in behavioral and neurophysiological activity that may underlie response to treatment. This project will accomplish these goals by evaluating whether stimulant treatment (Adzenys-XR-ODT) augments the efficacy of a parent-delivered behavioral intervention based on the Early Start Denver Model. This project will examine whether changes in outcome are correlated with improvements in social attention, measured via eye-tracking biomarkers, and social engagement during parent-child interaction. This project will also examine neurophysiological changes underlying improvements in behavior. These projects will be supported by four cores: Administrative Core, Recruitment and Assessment Core, Data Management and Analysis Core, and Dissemination and Outreach Core. Functioning as a whole, the Duke Autism Center of Excellence will offer the most comprehensive understanding to date of the impact of ADHD on young children with ASD, providing important information that will allow for biologically informed and personalized methods for early detection and treatment that could mitigate the negative impact of co-occurring ADHD on individuals with ASD.   PROJECT NARRATIVE - Co-occurring ADHD in young children with ASD: Precursors, detection, neural signatures, and early treatment Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) affects 1 in 68 individuals in the U.S. and has an annual estimated cost of $126 billion. In ~40-60% of people with ASD, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) also occurs and is associated with later ASD diagnosis, delayed access to intervention, and substantially poorer clinical outcomes. To fill a critical gap in knowledge, the Duke Autism Center of Excellence will provide a comprehensive understanding of the impact of ADHD on young children with ASD, including work that will enable improved early detection and treatment that could mitigate the negative impact of ADHD symptoms and improve quality of life for people with ASD.","Co-occurring ADHD in young children with ASD: Precursors, detection, neural signatures, and early treatment",9759681,P50HD093074,"['Acceleration', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Age-Months', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Attentional deficit', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Comorbidity', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Education', 'Engineering', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Etiology', 'Eye', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Services Research', 'Heterogeneity', 'High Prevalence', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Link', 'Measures', 'Medical History', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Parent-Child Relations', 'Parents', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Social Interaction', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Source', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Temperament', 'Testing', 'Toddler', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'autistic children', 'base', 'care outcomes', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'cost', 'data management', 'developmental psychology', 'early childhood', 'early screening', 'effective therapy', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'inattention', 'individual response', 'infancy', 'model development', 'neuromechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'outreach', 'personalized medicine', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'routine care', 'screening', 'social', 'social attention', 'social engagement', 'social learning', 'statistics', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy']",NICHD,DUKE UNIVERSITY,P50,2019,100000,0.20892554627600682
"Sex-Specific Brain and Behavioral Predictors of Cognitive Aging in Middle-Aged Adults with Autism Spectrum Disorder Project Summary/Abstract Research Project Long-Term Objective: The long-term objective of this research is to describe the cognitive challenges associated with aging in adults with ASD to inform interventions and care plans. Aim 1: Identify the combination of sex-specific functional and structural brain measures in adults with ASD that (a) best describe age-related cognitive changes compared to matched-NT controls and (b) predict age-related cognitive decline.

"Parsing early emerging heterogeneity related to autism spectrum disorder A major impediment to early identification and intervention for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is our limited understanding of how different children present signs as toddlers, including what risk symptoms coincide across multiple dimensions to predict outcome. Our objectives are to quantify behavioral and brain connectivity based subtypes of risk that model the variability of ASD symptom expression in a community sample of toddlers. We will then test the predictive validity of this approach in the same cohort of children at three years of age in order to identify risk profiles that differentially predict later cognitive, behavioral, and clinical features. First, we will implement two unsupervised data-driven computational approaches in a community sample of 3000 children between 18-24 months old in order to characterize clusters of risk profiles. We hypothesize that each approach will identify a proportion of high-risk individuals consistent with epidemiological estimates of ASD and associated developmental disabilities (e.g., language or global DD). Based on our preliminary data, we anticipate that ~300 children will be identified by these data-driven risk-profiling methods. We also hypothesize that distinct patterns of structural and functional connectivity will distinguish groups of at-risk children and that these groups will differ from low-risk children. All children will be scanned with the same brain imaging sequences and procedures implemented in the Baby Connectome Project and will be compared to data from 100 low-risk children from that project. Our neuroimaging sample of 300 children will be reassessed at age three with direct clinical assessment using gold-standard diagnostic instruments as well as parent report. This will allow us to validate the risk profiling approach implemented at 18-24 months, to compare with a current screening approach, and to refine the risk profiling approach with supervised training of prediction algorithms that incorporates behavioral/clinical outcome data. We expect this method for risk stratification/subtyping to better model the heterogeneity inherent to the early at-risk and resilient phenotypes, which will subsequently improve early identification/diagnosis efforts. These outcomes will have translational impact because improved methods for early identification in ASD are necessary for the successful development of efficacious, personalized early interventions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Symptoms of autism present differently in toddlers, which makes it difficult to identify children at risk during their first two years of life. Our goal is to measure variation in behavior and brain functioning in this age that may predict differing clinical outcomes. Identifying different subtypes of risk will later help us develop individually-optimized clinical recommendations for children with autism and related disorders.",Parsing early emerging heterogeneity related to autism spectrum disorder,9662003,R01MH115046,"['3 year old', 'Age', 'Age-Months', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Categories', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Developmental Disabilities', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Life', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Procedures', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Stratification', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Toddler', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'autistic children', 'base', 'case control', 'case-based', 'clinically actionable', 'cohort', 'communication behavior', 'connectome', 'design', 'early screening', 'follow up assessment', 'high risk', 'improved', 'instrument', 'learning algorithm', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'outcome prediction', 'population based', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive test', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'repetitive behavior', 'screening', 'social communication', 'symptomatology', 'translational impact', 'unsupervised learning']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2019,802904,0.12052505508014136
"Neuronal Correlates of Autistic Traits in ADHD and Autism ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This study aims to conduct the first investigation of the neurobiological underpinnings of social communicative impairments, i.e., autistic traits (AT), in children with ADHD and ASD. AT, a key feature of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), occurs in 20-30% of children with ADHD. These children incur relatively elevated school failure and poor global functioning, highlighting the clinical significance of AT in children with ADHD (ADHD+AT). We aim to advance our understanding of AT across ADHD and ASD, applying state of the art brain imaging methodology as a first step in efforts to foster advances in treatment. Hypotheses emanate from the literature and our preliminary data. We aim to test that intrinsic functional connectivity (iFC) between the fusiform face area (FFA) and rostral anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) underpins AT across ASD and ADHD diagnoses. Specifically, we hypothesize: H1a: FFA-ACC iFC is reduced in children with ASD and in those with ADHD+AT, relative to children with ADHD but no AT (ADHD-AT); H1b: Across groups, weaker FFA-ACC iFC is associated with more severe AT. H2a: FFA-ACC iFC is positively associated with accuracy in emotion face recognition, and H2b: FFA-ACC iFC is significantly more related to accuracy on an emotion task than on a control non-emotion task. In addition, we will explore 1) similarities between R-fMRI and task-fMRI connectivity; 2) brain-behavior relationships beyond the FFA-ACC circuit, deriving whole-brain voxelwise R- fMRI metrics and iFC between regions-of-interest representing the `social brain'; 3) behavioral relations with structural connectivity indexed by fractional anisotroy, focusing on the inferior frontal occipital fasciculus, and other relevant tracts; and 4) data-drive approaches combining available clinical and imaging data to identify homogenous neurophenotypes regardless of diagnosis. Methods. We anticipate obtaining complete datasets from at least 70 children per group - ADHD+AT, ADHD-AT, and ASD (total N=210), group-matched for age, sex, full IQ, handedness and socioeconomic status. Assessments. A partial list includes: Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule-2 (administered ""blind"" to all other clinical data), K-SADS and ADI-R interviews, Parent and Teacher rating scales. The emotion face recognition task, and the holistic configural face processing task will assess emotion face processing; a Go-No Go task, and motion tracking will measure attention and motion. Brain-behavior analyses will rely on resting state fMRI (R-fMRI), structural, diffusion tensor imaging and task- fMRI (matching face task). Significance. The study informs the neurobiology of a shared phenotype, and will bring the field closer to a neural stratification of individuals with AT a critical step for developing neuroscientifically-informed treatments. Additionally, we will share unidentified data with National Database for Autism Research yearly to accelerate scientific progress.

"Development of a Commercial Platform for Discovery and Validation of Key Microbial Metabolites in CNS Disorders Despite a wealth of continued funding and ever emerging advancements in diagnostic and therapeutic technologies, the burden of central nervous system (CNS) disorders remains substantial. The cost of Substance Use Disorder (SUD) alone is estimated at > $181 billion (2002). The findings of numerous efforts tasked with identifying risk factors and causative agents of SUD suggest that vulnerability to dependence is a complex phenotype influenced by both genetics and environmental factors. Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) also appears to be largely impacted by both genetic and environmental factors, more specifically the gut microbiome. Recent studies have demonstrated that autism and SUD share common neural networks and molecular signaling pathways. Several of the gene-products associated with the ASD phenotype (e.g., synaptic cell adhesion molecules in the striatum and basal ganglia) affect synaptic transmission between neurons, which has also been implicated in the addiction and reward system. In addition, adults afflicted with high functioning autism exhibit greater susceptibility to drug dependence. We hypothesize that advancing the current state of knowledge regarding ASD, with particular regard to the attributes shared with drug addiction, will inspire the conceptualization and development of novel therapeutic interventions to correct common elements of striatal dysfunction. Testing this hypothesis will require a validated turn-key platform enabling customers the ability to ship clinical fecal samples from affected and unaffected subjects and receive a list of metabolites mediated by microbiome functions and a pre-clinical (in vivo) data package deciphering the phenotypic modulation of the CNS disease. With the funding received through this award, we will design, develop, and commercialize a robust CNS-microbiome-interplay (CMI) platform-based service that will enable (i) elucidation of novel microbiome-mediated targets in CNS diseases, including metabolites, proteins and peptides, (ii) pre-clinical data collection in standardized animal models, quantifying the influence of microbial bioactive molecules, and (iii) application across a wide range of therapeutic areas, such as SUD and ASD. The CMI platform-based service offering will allow medical and pharmaceutical pharma customers (i.e., our target market) to rapidly define diagnostic and therapeutic targets from clinical samples and deduce pre-clinical efficacy estimates sans investment in venture capital or complex infrastructure. The major problem confronting medical and pharmaceutical R&D companies is the difficulty involved with building and maintaining an infrastructure amenable to extensive “omics” enterprises. Second Genome will serve the academic and pharmaceutical R&D community by offering a validated turn-key platform enabling customers the ability to ship clinical fecal samples from affected and unaffected subjects and receive back, as a product: (1) a list of metabolites mediated by microbiome functions and (2) a pre-clinical (in vivo) data package demonstrating phenotypic modulation of Central Nervous System disorders.

"Genome Clustering for Clinical Subtype Detection in Autism Project Summary/Abstract Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a developmental neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by a wide range of clinical manifestations and genetic heterogeneity. This complex genetic landscape poses a serious challenge to eﬀorts to ﬁnd a relationship between genotype and clinical phenotype in ASD. Therefore, the disorder remains poorly understand, and diagnostic and treatment tools are lacking. Though genetic overlap between patients is low, many mutations in autism likely aﬀect stereotyped biological pathways, resulting in subgroups of autistic patients with similar functional mutation burden. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that patients with functionally similar mutations can be clustered together in order to reveal previously unidentiﬁed groups that share both molecular mechanisms and disease related cognitive traits. This proposal ﬁrst describes an algorithm for genomic subtype detection of autistic patients using graph clustering and a novel distance function that is based on gene ontology, a database that describes the functional relationship of genes. Next, it is shown that resulting patient clusters are deﬁned by both unique and convergent involvement of genetic pathways, which provides insight into the variety of disease mechanisms that may be present in ASD. These potential mechanisms can be explored at the cellular level by connecting the clustering algorithm with data from ASD patient derived neurons. Finally, cluster membership is associated with diﬀerences in the clinical and cognitive variables, validating the relevance of the genomic subtypes. In addition, deep learning approaches to describe individualized clinical prediction are discussed. Genome clustering in autism is an important step towards deﬁning both mechanistic and clinical subtypes in this complex disorder, and this proposal addresses a growing need for algorithmic tools that connect genotype to phenotype in the context of heritable mental illnesses. Narrative Neuropsychiatric disorders, such as autism, remain a leading cause of global disease burden, due to a limited understanding of their fundamental causes. This application proposes a novel computational method that harnesses the power of genomics to identify groups of similar patients that suﬀer from autism spectrum disorder.

"Testing the Bottom-Up vs Top-Down Imbalance Hypothesis of ASD ABSTRACT / PROJECT SUMMARY  Functional connectivity in the brains of individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) has emerged as an important marker of neural abnormalities associated with the disorder. However, despite hundreds of studies on the topic, the specific nature of functional connectivity abnormalities that characterize the disorder remains unresolved and no unifying framework has emerged to describe it. Constructing a consistent model of the functional connectivity abnormalities that underlie ASD is absolutely essential for advancing our understanding of the neural etiology of the disorder. While the commonly accepted model is one where long- range functional connectivity is decreased in ASD while local functional connectivity is increased, many studies have shown increased or normal long-range functional connectivity in ASD and the evidence supporting the hypothesis that local functional connectivity is increased remains scant and indirect.  To date, the vast majority of studies of functional connectivity in ASD have been carried out using fMRI, a technique that relies on the hemodynamic response and thus has a temporal resolution of <1Hz. It is well known, however, that functional connectivity is usually mediated by much faster frequency bands, commonly divided into five fundamental frequency bands: delta (1-2 Hz), theta (3-7 Hz), alpha (8-12 Hz), beta (13-30 Hz), and gamma (31-80 Hz). There is also recent evidence that these frequency bands mediate functional connectivity with preferred directionality. Based on our own preliminary data and current studies, we propose to test the hypothesis that ASD is characterized by increased long-range bottom-up (feedforward) functional connectivity, alongside decreased long-range top-down (feedback ) functional connectivity, and that the gamma and beta frequency bands, respectively, mediate these functional connectivity abnormalities.  Here, we propose to test our hypothesis by obtaining MEG (magnetoencephalography) data from two spatial attention paradigms, visual and auditory, optimized for assessing bottom-up versus top-down functional connectivity, in 50 TD and 60 ASD individuals, ages 14-17. Specifically, we propose the following aims: (1) Test the hypothesis that bottom-up functional connectivity is abnormally increased in ASD in the auditory and visual domains, and this is manifested primarily in the gamma frequency band. (2) Test the hypothesis that top- down functional connectivity is abnormally reduced in ASD in the auditory and visual domains, and this is manifested primarily in the beta frequency band. (3) Test the hypothesis that neurophysiological functional connectivity measures derived using MEG will be predictive of ASD severity, diagnosis, and behavioral features, using robust correlations, canonical correlations, and machine learning techniques. We expect that the results of this study will lead to a substantially more detailed, comprehensive, and mechanistically motivated framework for the wide range of functional connectivity abnormalities observed in ASD. Project Narrative (Relevance to Public Health) The proposed research will elucidate the neurophysiological underpinnings of specific functional connectivity abnormalities in autism spectrum disorders (ASD) with an unprecendent level of detail. It will advance the field by elucidating specific abnormalities, and potentially reconciling over prior disparate results. The outcomes of this study could potentially contribute to treatments designs, and give a neurophysiological picture of connectivity abnormalities detailed enough to advance the field of animal models for ASD.",Testing the Bottom-Up vs Top-Down Imbalance Hypothesis of ASD,9615416,R01MH117998,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Age', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Attention', 'Auditory', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Etiology', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Generations', 'Grouping', 'Individual', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetoencephalography', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Nature', 'Outcome Study', 'Plant Roots', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Sensory', 'Severities', 'Social Interaction', 'Specificity', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Visual', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'hemodynamics', 'millisecond', 'neurophysiology', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'somatosensory', 'temporal measurement', 'therapy design']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2018,841853,0.1189532694055935
"Impact of Multisensory Function on Symptomatology in Young Children with ASD Project Summary/Abstract Atypical responses to sensory stimuli are highly prevalent in autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Somatosensory sensitivities in particular occur prominently and with high frequency in the disorder. While core symptomatology is comprised of both sensory dysfunctions and sociocommunicative deficits, the impact of aberrant somatosensory and multisensory processing on sociocommunication abilities remains unknown. It is not well-understood how sensory discrimination anomalies predict later sociocommunicative impairment, or which manifestations of sensory abnormalities result in more severe outcomes. Thus, the objective of this proposal is to investigate the behavioral and neural patterns underlying somatosensory and multisensory discrimination abnormalities longitudinally in young children with ASD compared to TD peers at 4-5 years and 6-7 years of age and identify potential patterns of developmental causality between sensory and sociocommunicative impairments. We theorize that behavioral dysfunction and disruptions in functional and structural connectivity between neural systems in ASD interfere with normative development. Within this theoretical framework, we make three key predictions regarding sensory processing in ASD: (1) Behavioral manifestations of sensory discrimination anomalies in ASD will be objectively observable and quantifiable; (2) functional and structural connectivity patterns within and between sensory and multisensory networks will be atypical; and (3) these atypical network connections will be linked to behavioral manifestations of sensory abnormalities, and combined will predict later sociocommunicative impairments. To examine these hypotheses, we propose a longitudinal and multimodal approach, including behavioral measures, task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), resting state functional connectivity MRI (fcMRI), diffusion weighted imaging (DWI), and neuropsychological indices, along with machine- learning methods, which will be able to reveal distinct patterns within and across modalities, and pinpoint patterns that may most heavily impact autism symptomatology in young children. The distinct strengths of this proposal lie in the application of quantitative behavioral measures to examine sensory discrimination thresholds in young developmental populations, in combination with the use of advanced neuroimaging tools to measure functional activity and (functional and structural) network connectivity between multiple brain systems and the implementation of machine-learning predictive approaches.  The proposed training plan incorporates analytic approaches to multimodal neuroimaging and machine-learning, as well as training in neuropsychological evaluation and assessment, which are essential to the applicant's research goals of investigating sensory abnormalities in, and atypical development of, the brain and behavior. This career development award will permit her to develop new expertise necessary for successful completion of the proposed research, while building upon her extensive experience of multisensory development and functional neuroimaging in young children. The Psychology Department at San Diego State University, together with the carefully selected mentorship team, will create an exceptional training environment to further her long-term career goal to become a successful, independent autism researcher in the field of developmental cognitive neuroscience with a focus on sensorimotor processing. Project Narrative The proposed research investigation seeks to examine the impact of somatosensory and multisensory abnormalities on sociocommunication deficits in young children with autism longitudinally. Training over the duration of the career development award will emphasize analytic approaches to multimodal neuroimaging and machine-learning, as well as training in neuropsychological assessment, which will provide the PI with expertise necessary for investigating the links between behavioral and neural mechanisms underlying the heterogeneity of sensory manifestations and autism symptomatology. As the increasing prevalence of autism renders it a serious public health issue, findings from the proposed research will have implications for early detection and intervention directed toward sensory processing.",Impact of Multisensory Function on Symptomatology in Young Children with ASD,9527403,K01MH113819,"['7 year old', 'Age', 'Anisotropy', 'Applications Grants', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Mechanisms', 'Brain', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Development', 'Diffuse', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mentorship', 'Modality', 'Neuropsychology', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Psychology', 'Psychophysics', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Sensory', 'Sensory Manifestations', 'Severities', 'Social Interaction', 'Stereotyping', 'Stimulus', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'TEP1 gene', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'behavioral impairment', 'brain behavior', 'career', 'cognitive development', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'comparative', 'developmental psychology', 'experience', 'falls', 'haptics', 'imaging modality', 'indexing', 'learning strategy', 'multidisciplinary', 'multimodality', 'multisensory', 'neural patterning', 'neurobehavioral', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'peer', 'relating to nervous system', 'repetitive behavior', 'response', 'sensory cortex', 'sensory discrimination', 'sensory input', 'sensory integration', 'sensory stimulus', 'somatosensory', 'support network', 'symptomatology', 'tool']",NIMH,SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY,K01,2018,195916,0.12300383321881453

"Characterizing mechanistic heterogeneity across ADHD and Autism DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Progress in establishing the etiology of psychiatric illness is limited by the absence of objective biological measures able to detect and discriminate between disorders. This problem is particularly important in developmental disorders, where early identification could eventually assist in prevention of lifelong impairments. The two earlies onsets, most common and costly developmental disorders in child psychiatry are attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and Autism spectrum disorders (ASD). A recent 2011 study, surveying the years 1997-2008, has now verified that 1 in 6 children have a developmental disability, a 17% increase over the past decade driven largely by increases in ASD and ADHD. These developments highlight the need for innovative approaches to address the underlying cause of these disorders. It is likely that the clinical heterogeneity and the imprecise nature of their nosological distinctions represent fundamentally confounding factors limiting a better understanding of their etiology, prevention, and treatment.  Interestingly, an emerging observation regarding brain imaging in ASD and ADHD is that they often have the same atypical functional brain signatures. However, because these two syndromes are almost exclusively studied separately, it is difficult to determine atypical brain function that is common compared to what is distinct for each disorder. If we are to improve our understanding regarding the underlying etiology of these disorders, it will be necessary to study these populations simultaneously. With that said, simply comparing groups of children based on their DSM diagnosis is unlikely to suffice. The behavioral and biological heterogeneity within each syndrome further complicates the meaning of any given group difference found in brain imaging. Thus, progress in our understanding requires not only examining these disorders in the same studies, but also identifying how brain signatures relate to distinct behavioral components (i.e., endophenotypes) that span the syndromes.  Under this context, and consistent with NIMH's new strategic plan, Strategy 1.4 (also see RDoC), the current proposal aims to use resting state functional connectivity MRI (rs-fcMRI) and structural connectivity (DTI) to identify brain signatures that correspond to fundamental behavioral components (executive, facial recognition, and affect recognition) found in ADHD and/or ASD. We also aim to develop integrated, multimodal sub-classifications (i.e. neurotypes) or ""biosignatures"" of these disorders with computational tools that include Graph Theory and support vector machine (SVM) based pattern classification. The potential impact of the proposed mechanistic categorization on future functional, genetic, treatment, and other translational studies of ADHD and ASD are substantial. The proposed study uses relatively new and advanced imaging techniques (i.e. resting-state functional connectivity MRI, and diffusion tensor imaging), along with computational tools (i.e. Graph theory and pattern classification) to identify atypical brain physiology that is unique and shared across ADHD and Autism. The work will also advance new approaches and methods to classify these disorders based on specific behavioral and neurobiological measures. The result from this study will advance our knowledge regarding the neurobiological underpinnings of ADHD and Autism, and assist in the improved characterization of homogeneous subtypes of future genetic, functional, and therapeutic investigations.",Characterizing mechanistic heterogeneity across ADHD and Autism,9671829,R01MH096773,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Ants', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Bilateral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Child', 'Child Psychiatry', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Corpus Callosum', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Developmental Disabilities', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Early identification', 'Etiology', 'Face', 'Fusiform gyrus', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Heterogeneity', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impairment', 'Impulsivity', 'Inferior', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nature', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Output', 'Parietal', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physiology', 'Prevention', 'Psychometrics', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Speed', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Structure of superior temporal sulcus', 'Surveys', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'Work', 'Youth', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'biological heterogeneity', 'biosignature', 'clinical heterogeneity', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'developmental disease', 'early onset', 'endophenotype', 'executive function', 'graph theory', 'improved', 'innovation', 'multimodality', 'novel strategies', 'response', 'study population', 'translational study']",NIMH,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,194969,0.1433526346983921
"Data-driven multidimensional modeling of nonverbal communication in typical and atypical development ABSTRACT This proposal will develop innovative technology for data-driven, multimodal characterization of nonverbal communication (NVC) in typical and atypical development. Prior research has provided qualitative descriptions of the development of children's use of gaze and gesture to regulate social interactions, but there are no objective, automated tools for measuring NVC behaviors, nor computational models to explain their coordination and timing in social interactions. This proposal will apply advanced probabilistic modeling techniques from machine learning and data mining to a rich corpus of children's behavior, including automated measures of children's posture, head pose, gaze direction, arm movements, and hand configurations derived from color and depth cameras and accelerometers. By automatically learning probabilistic latent variable models from movement data, we will obtain compact, data-driven descriptions of NVC and its coordination in children with autism, children with developmental delays without autism, and typically developing children (Aim 1). We will validate our models by demonstrating their ability to predict children's behavior, including diagnostic group and one-year language outcomes (Aim 2). We will test whether novel NVC patterns can be uncovered with bottom-up clustering of motor movement data (Aim 3). We predict our models will have greater explanatory and predictive power compared to current measures of NVC, which are typically human-coded behaviors that are descriptive, but rely on a-priori definitions of higher level behaviors. The models we develop will capture the fine-grained structure, coordination, and timing of NVC behaviors during social interactions, and thus allow us to characterize these behaviors with an unprecedented level of detail. Because interventions for young children with ASD target NVC skills, our automated measurement tools will provide clinicians with powerful new tools to assess the extent to which these treatments are efficacious. In addition, automated tools for dense measurement of fine-grained changes in NVC would enable clinicians to assess profiles of strengths and weaknesses for purposes of treatment planning, to dynamically tailor treatment to clients' changing abilities, and ultimately to accurately capture whether treatment is working. Finally, the measurement capabilities will provide researchers with a novel, cost-effective approach to analyze video recordings, at a scale that is not currently feasible due to a reliance on human coding.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) affects 1 in 68 children in the US. This project is focused on developing automated tools to characterize behaviors considered to be core, early emerging markers of autism, and that represent common treatment targets in this group.

"Objective, MRI biomarkers for pre-symptomatic detection of autism spectrum disorder at 6 months old: commercial software development and optimization Project Summary Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a broad diagnosis for a disorder characterized by symptoms affecting repetitive behavior, social communication, and cognitive ability. 1 in 68 children in the US is affected with ASD (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2017) and the likelihood that a child will be affected with ASD is 10 times higher if they have a sibling with ASD. Traditionally, diagnosis occurs most frequently between age 3 to 6 and severe ASD can be diagnosed as early as 18 months. The infant brain is most plastic and susceptible to intervention in the first year of life. As such, there exists an infant population that is either diagnosed too late to receive a more-effective intervention or with a false negative diagnosis, or both. Thus, earlier prediction of the development of ASD can deliver improved likelihood of favorable outcomes. This Fast-Track proposal seeks to develop, standardize, and commercialize software methods and algorithms for neurobehavioral disorder prediction, creating objective biomarkers in a space dominated by subjective neurobehavioral testing and providing a software as a medical device that is a single, integrated, easy-to-use solution for MRI processing, analysis, and syndrome prediction. To create a Minimum Viable Product (MVP), we will: pull existing, academically vetted methods and software into a commercial design control process (Phase I, SA1); verify the integrated, full-stack solution on a set of IBIS Network data sets stored in the National Database for Autism Research (NDAR) and evaluate potential sources of classification error (Phase I, SA2); and conduct an Alpha release to IBIS Network sites for user interface and human factors feedback (Phase I, SA3).We will build the MVP into a commercially viable product as we: expand the utility of the pipeline to accommodate data sets not acquired at IBIS Network sites, optimize manual Quality Control (QC) workflows through semi-automated user interface design, integrate cortical surface area, cortical volume, functional connectivity, and other measurements into a common user interface and workflow, migrate image processing, machine learning, and database infrastructure to cloud-based tools that can scale on-demand, and iterate on the user experience given Alpha feedback (Phase II, SA1); evaluate synthetic data designed to approximate results from multiple MRI scanner types and signal to noise ratio conditions to ensure broad applicability of the software in clinical settings; expand the utility of the machine learning feature analysis and classification to include additional features and evaluate non-binary feature spaces, conduct latent variable analysis to identify one or more scale metrics for ASD prediction; and vet the new metrics through a thorough review of IBIS Network data and comparison with Alpha release results (Phase III, SA2); and develop a data report for clinical use and patient education, conduct a Beta release test across IBIS Network sites and at least one non-IBIS Network site; and perform formal software verification and validation to prepare for broader distribution of the software platform (Phase III, SA3). Narrative MRI technology is rapidly advancing our understanding of how the brain develops in the presence of neurobehavioral disorders like Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). This Fast-Track proposal seeks to develop, standardize, and commercialize software methods and algorithms for ASD prediction using structural and functional MRI data acquired on infants, creating objective biomarkers in a space dominated by subjective neurobehavioral testing and providing a software as a medical device that is a single, integrated, easy-to-use solution for MRI processing, analysis, and prediction of syndrome development. This technology will provide first-of-its kind, objective, brain-based biomarkers that will enable development of effective, early interventions and improve the standard of care for infants at high risk of developing ASD.","Objective, MRI biomarkers for pre-symptomatic detection of autism spectrum disorder at 6 months old: commercial software development and optimization",9680324,R44MH118763,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Age-Months', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Base of the Brain', 'Biological Markers', 'Blinded', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Ensure', 'Feedback', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Human', 'Infant', 'Infant Care', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Medical Device', 'Methods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patient Education', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Process', 'Quality Control', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Scanning', 'Siblings', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Software Tools', 'Software Validation', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Surface', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Technology', 'TensorFlow', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'brain morphology', 'clinical application', 'clinically relevant', 'cloud based', 'cognitive ability', 'commercialization', 'computerized data processing', 'design', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'high risk', 'image processing', 'improved', 'instrument', 'magnetic resonance imaging biomarker', 'neurobehavioral disorder', 'neurobehavioral test', 'patient variability', 'repetitive behavior', 'social communication', 'software development', 'standard of care', 'tool', 'verification and validation']",NIMH,"PRIMENEURO, INC.",R44,2018,179088,0.1629137995071655
"Infant Vocal Communication: Typical Development and Autism Risk ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Research is now tracking early infant vocal communication using all-day recordings evaluated with human coding and in limited cases with automated analysis at very large scales. Results reveal unexpected features of development, illustrating foundations of language. Much of this work conducted at the University of Memphis (UM) is founded in an infrastructural theory of language development that has produced notable successes by supplying a widely-used stage model of vocal development and by providing the basis for determining clinically useful markers, especially associated with the onset and consolidation of canonical babbling (CB), a key foundation for spoken language. The UM empirical work within the infrastructural framework, based primarily on human-coding of longitudinal all-day recordings, has also begun to produce a new account of vocal foundations and vocal interaction both in the 1st months after full-term birth and in infants born prematurely by >2 months and still in the hospital. This work points toward possible indicators of risk for disorders in the first months of life. Further development of the new account holds promise for illuminating the development of vocal language and supplying predictors for conditions such as autism spectrum disorders (ASD).  The proposed research will expand the UM effort to much larger scale and address prediction of language development and of ASD through an ASD sibling study. The work will combine forces between the UM and Emory University's Marcus Autism Center (MAC), which both independently and through its Autism Center of Excellence (ACE) Program Project from NIH, is in the process of collecting a massive set of longitudinal all-day recordings of infants 1) showing typical development (TD), 2) at risk for ASD because they have an older sibling with ASD, and 3) at risk for language delay (LD) due to low socioeconomic status (SES). The MAC/ACE research includes analysis of the recordings with automated acoustic methods, but does not include funding for human coding of the massive recording set. Extensive human coding is in fact crucial for the ACE project, because without it, there is insufficient gold-standard data in terms of which to advance the accuracy and relevance of automated methods for developmental prediction and for detection of developmental communication disorders. Furthermore, many aspects of vocal patterning and interaction are as yet simply not accessible by automated means-human coding is the only workable option. The proposed research will combine efforts of UM and MAC, with 1) MAC supplying longitudinal all-day recordings across the 1st year of life to UM from the 3 groups, 2) UM performing coding and human-assisted acoustic analysis on representatively sampled segments from the recordings, and 3) both sites working together to predict infant outcomes at 24 months based on the human coding/analysis and based on the automated analysis that will result from supervised machine learning made possible by the human coding/analysis. The work targets improving prediction of language development and early identification of ASD. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This work will provide scientific foundations on vocal development and language in three groups of children, including ASD siblings, infants of low SES, and controls (low risk). The work will lay new foundations for automated large-scale monitoring of infant vocalizations.",Infant Vocal Communication: Typical Development and Autism Risk,9388980,R01DC015108,"['Acoustics', 'Address', 'Age', 'Age-Months', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Caregivers', 'Centers of Research Excellence', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Developmental Communication Disorders', 'Early identification', 'Faculty', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Gold', 'Home environment', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Infant', 'Language', 'Language Delays', 'Language Development', 'Life', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Assessment', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pattern', 'Periodicity', 'Premature Infant', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Siblings', 'Site', 'Social Development', 'Socialization', 'Supervision', 'Term Birth', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'disorder risk', 'hearing impairment', 'human model', 'improved', 'infant monitoring', 'infant outcome', 'insight', 'longitudinal database', 'low socioeconomic status', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'social', 'success', 'symptomatology', 'theories', 'vocal learning', 'vocalization']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF MEMPHIS,R01,2018,517111,0.08742604602894255
"A Longitudinal MRI Study Characterizing Very Early Brain Development in Infants with Down Syndrome Longitudinal MRI Characterization of Very Early Brain Development  in Infants with Down Syndrome Project Summary/Abstract Down syndrome (DS), the most common genetic cause of intellectual disability, is associated with varying degrees of cognitive and behavioral impairments. Pharmacologic therapies and genetic modulators are emerging which, if administered early in conjunction with traditional therapies, show promise for improving developmental outcomes in children with DS. However, the stark absence of early neurodevelopment knowledge in DS hampers these efforts. The main goal of this proposal is to develop biomarkers as future targets for specific therapies based on careful characterization of early aberrant neurodevelopmental patterns. This study will be a combined effort with WU as the coordinating center and six other research groups: UNC, UW, CHOP, MNI, NYU, and University of Minnesota. These groups comprise the ACE-IBIS (Autism Center of Excellence Infant Brain Imaging Study) network, a well-established and experienced group that has been productively collaborating for 8 years on MRI imaging and behavioral characterization of infants at high risk for autism, healthy typical infants (TYP), and infants with Fragile X. The aims of this proposal are: 1) Define the longitudinal characteristics of early brain development in infants (3 to 24 months) with DS in comparison to TYP infants and infants with other developmental disabilities (ASD and Fragile X) using three different types of neuroimaging (MRI, DTI, rsfMRI); 2) Develop predictive models for developmental outcomes in infants with DS based on longitudinal structural or functional MRI characteristics; and 3) Characterize brain-behavior correlates with coordinated multimodal imaging in infancy characterizing the interrelationship between longitudinal network imaging parameters and cognitive, behavioral and neurodevelopmental outcomes using sophisticated multivariate support vector machine (SVM) analytic strategies. 120 infants with DS and 40 TYP control infants will be followed longitudinally from 3 to 24 months. MRI scans will be obtained during natural sleep and a series of well-validated developmental and behavioral assessments will be completed at each visit. This project will be the first to define the nature and timing of alterations in brain development in infants with DS. The proposed project addresses several key research recommendations from the “NICHD 2014-The NIH Research Plan on Down Syndrome.” The study aims match the recommendation for the quantitative characterization based on imaging of early brain development and the relationship of cognitive, behavioral and social development to early aberrant neurodevelopment in DS. This project will also address recommendations for investigation of comorbid ASD in DS, which could be as high as 5-10%. The IBIS network is uniquely qualified to examine early neurodevelopmental patterns, utilizing the ASD, TYP and FraX infant data sets to better characterize and examine specificity of DS early developmental patterns including ASD qualities and impairments in social development. It is clear that quantification of neurodevelopmental trajectories in infants with DS will be critical to identification of personalized intervention strategies and to assess the efficacy of early life, targeted, highly novel and mechanistically specific DS interventions. Project Narrative Down's syndrome (DS), the most common genetic cause of intellectual disability, is associated with a wide range of cognitive and behavioral impairments. Through the use of cutting edge MRI technology that allows us to look at the shape, function, and connections within the brain, we will be able to study and better understand early brain development in infants with DS. Working toward the goal to be able to assess the impact of specific early intervention therapies that are most helpful in improving the developmental outcomes of children with DS. This study mirrors and expands on the study designs and techniques that were developed to study infants with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), Fragile X, and typically developing infants, and will allow us to further our understanding of maturation patterns of infant brains that we can apply to DS, ASD, Fragile X, and other disabilities.",A Longitudinal MRI Study Characterizing Very Early Brain Development in Infants with Down Syndrome,9263673,R01HD088125,"['Address', 'Age', 'Age-Months', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Attention', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cerebellum', 'Cerebrum', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Cognitive', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Developmental Disabilities', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion', 'Down Syndrome', 'Early Intervention', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Fragile X Syndrome', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Intellectual functioning disability', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Life', 'Life Expectancy', 'Live Birth', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Minnesota', 'Motor', 'Motor Skills', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Myelin', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Nature', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacology', 'Pregnancy', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Rest', 'Sedation procedure', 'Sensory', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Sleep', 'Social Development', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Thick', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Visit', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'behavioral impairment', 'brain behavior', 'cognitive development', 'congenital heart disorder', 'data acquisition', 'developmental disease', 'disability', 'experience', 'functional disability', 'gastrointestinal', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'infancy', 'malformation', 'morphometry', 'multimodality', 'neural circuit', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'personalized intervention', 'predictive modeling', 'preservation', 'recruit', 'skills', 'targeted treatment', 'traditional therapy', 'white matter']",NICHD,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,2297205,0.09102282565521008
"Gene-brain-environment interactions as determinants of typical and atypical developmental trajectories Project Summary Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a heritable neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by heterogeneous genetic etiology and behavioral symptomatology. While recent genetics research suggests that the cumulative effects of many single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on many genes confer increased risk of ASD, very little is known about how additive genetic risk impacts brain function and structure. My dissertation work leverages variation at the genetic, neural, and behavioral levels by investigating how cumulative genetic risk for ASD on a gene implicated in social behavior across species – the oxytocin receptor gene (OXTR) – impacts network-level activity and connectivity in brain regions critical for social reward processing, and how risk-allele dosage relates to individual differences in ASD symptomatology. Results of my first dissertation study have shown that OXTR risk-allele dosage modulates resting-state connectivity of the reward network in both youth with ASD and typically developing (TD) youth, although in different ways. In youth with ASD, greater OXTR risk is associated with reduced connectivity between nodes of the reward circuit and greater symptom severity. Conversely, in TD youth, greater OXTR risk-allele dosage is associated with greater connectivity between the reward network and frontal brain regions involved in mentalizing and this, in turn, is associated with better social functioning (Hernandez et al., 2016a). These findings in TD youth suggest a compensatory neural mechanism in the face of increased genetic risk for ASD, and raise further questions about the role of other genetic (i.e., epistatic) and environmental/experiential variables in steering development along typical vs. atypical trajectories. My ongoing dissertation study examines the moderating effects of diagnosis and gender on the relationship between OXTR risk-allele dosage and neural processing of social rewards using functional neuroimaging (fMRI). While I have gained strong expertise in connectivity-based neuroimaging, genetics, and the neurobiology of ASD, my last dissertation project will provide additional training in analysis of task-related fMRI data and assessment of changes in task-based functional connectivity (i.e., training in psychophysiological interaction analyses). My dissertation work thus far highlights how little is known about the mechanisms by which individuals with the same genetic risk for mental illness have different outcomes (i.e., affected vs. resilient). As a post-doctoral researcher, I aim to gain additional training in the assessment of environmental and experiential variables that affect neurodevelopmental outcomes, as well as in advanced data-analytic approaches to model multilevel interactions between gene-brain-environment measures (e.g., statistical analysis of longitudinal data, machine learning algorithms, imaging-genetics of genome-wide data) with the ultimate goal of combining these data to better predict risk for mental illness and inform interventions. These aims are in line with the NIH Blueprint for NIMH, NICHD, and NINDS, as they seek to elucidate the neurobiological mechanisms underlying complex human behavior and neurodevelopmental disorders. Project Narrative The proposed dissertation research examines how cumulative genetic risk for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) on a gene implicated in social behavior across species – the oxytocin receptor gene (OXTR) – impacts brain activity and connectivity in youth with and without ASD, as well as how risk-allele dosage relates to individual differences in ASD symptomatology and social functioning. Future postdoctoral research will investigate how genetic, environmental, and experiential factors impact neurodevelopmental trajectories with a focus on adolescence, a period during which many psychiatric disorders emerge. A better understanding of how complex gene-brain-environment interactions confer vulnerability or resilience to mental illness may lead to earlier diagnosis, more efficacious treatment, and improved outcome.",Gene-brain-environment interactions as determinants of typical and atypical developmental trajectories,9747512,K00MH119663,"['Adolescence', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Childhood', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Exposure to', 'Female', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Research', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genetic study', 'Goals', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Neural Pathways', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Other Genetics', 'Outcome', 'Oxytocin', 'Oxytocin Receptor', 'Pattern', 'Penetrance', 'Persons', 'Play', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychophysiology', 'Receptor Gene', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Functioning', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Youth', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'biobehavior', 'brain behavior', 'career', 'dosage', 'endophenotype', 'frontal lobe', 'gender difference', 'gene environment interaction', 'genetic variant', 'genome-wide', 'imaging genetics', 'improved outcome', 'longitudinal analysis', 'male', 'multilevel analysis', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'outcome forecast', 'psychologic', 'relating to nervous system', 'resilience', 'reward circuitry', 'reward processing', 'risk variant', 'sex', 'skills', 'social', 'symptomatology', 'task analysis']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,K00,2018,75492,0.1567633591512041
"Autoscreen: An innovative e-health solution for early identification of autism spectrum disorder Project Summary:  Early accurate identification and treatment of young children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) represents a pressing public health and clinical care challenge. Given mounting evidence that early, accurate diagnosis of ASD is possible and very young children who receive intervention can demonstrate substantial gains in functioning, current American Academy of Pediatrics practice guidelines endorse formal ASD screening at 18 and 24 months of age. Ideally, this recommended screening would translate into early diagnosis and treatment for most children. Unfortunately, large numbers of children are still not screened for ASD; waits for specialized diagnostic assessment can be very long; and the average age of diagnosis in the US remains between 4 to 5 years of age. Further, groups from traditionally underserved communities are even more likely to be diagnosed at later ages. Delays in accurate diagnosis contribute to high levels of family stress and limit access to ASD behavioral intervention services, which are increasingly recognized as very important to children’s functioning. The current project tests a novel e-health system (“Autoscreen”) for rapid screening, diagnostic triage, referral, and treatment engagement of young children within community pediatric settings, with an embedded focus on reaching underserved populations. This tool fuses advanced computational strategies with expert knowledge and tools for ASD screening/assessment in order to realize an e-health application that not only provides support for enhanced screening across diverse communities, but also establishes a clear decision pathway for early, accurate diagnostic triage and meaningful engagement in early treatment.  We will integrate (a) our computational analyses of gold-standard assessments conducted across a very large-sample of toddlers with ASD and other developmental concerns with (b) a novel interactive assessment designed to target core areas of earliest ASD vulnerability, in order to create an e-screening application that can guide early action within traditional community pediatric settings. We will rigorously evaluate the feasibility, usability, compatibility, and potential utility of this tool in the current work. This evaluation will be conducted in order to ultimately create and test the efficacy of this innovative e-health product in terms of identifying and linking children with ASD more rapidly to meaningful interventions at young ages. We believe the potential market for such a system is quite substantial with common use developmental screening instruments identifying roughly 7-9% of children in first year of life. In this capacity, our tool will ultimately be designed as a practical, feasible, and reimbursable health-screening module for wide-scale use in community pediatric settings.

"Using complex video stimuli to elucidate atypical brain functioning in ASD ABSTRACT A major gap in our understanding of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is in knowing how the brain functions during conditions that approximate the complex processing demands of the real world. Instead, almost everything we know about brain functioning in ASD comes from reductionist studies that often use highly simpliﬁed stimuli and isolated task demands, or even from studies that lack a stimulus or task altogether, as in the case of resting-state functional connectivity. Yet, successful processing “in the wild” (i.e., in the real world) relies on the simultaneous engagement and seamless integration of multiple brain regions, brain networks, and cognitive processes. Understanding how these neural systems behave and interact during real-time processing of complex and dynamic stimuli, therefore, is critical for understanding how real-world behavior and cognition emerge from brain activity, and this remains a major gap in our understanding of ASD. The purpose of the current proposal is to ﬁll this gap, by using complex video stimuli that sample broadly from the natural world and engage multiple diverse perceptual and cognitive systems simultaneously, thus evoking activity across the entire brain at once. From this data, rich high-dimensional measures can be generated and used in combination with multivariate analytic methods ideally-suited to detect idiosyncratic and heterogeneous patterns of neural responding, which can then be related back to phenotypic variability across individuals. Our proposed studies will take place over 5 years and include 4 speciﬁc aims. In the ﬁrst two aims, we will identify neural systems most affected in ASD during the presentation of a complex video stimulus, parse the heterogeneity at the neural level using data-driven approaches and relate it back to heterogeneity at the behavioral level, and explore the stimulus dimensions (social and non-social alike, both sampled broadly) that underlie these neural abnormalities. In a third aim, we will examine video-evoked functional connectivity both within and across brain networks, comparing this directly against resting-state connectivity, and examining both modes of functional connectivity across various timescales (including dynamic coupling). A ﬁnal exploratory aim will assess the short-term and long-term stability of these measures, as well as their sensitivity in tracking change following experimental perturbation—important characteristics for potential biomarkers and/or predictor and outcome measures for use in intervention studies. Altogether, this work will provide new insight into brain activity and brain connectivity during conditions that more closely reﬂect processing demands of the natural world, help to link individual differences in brain functioning with individual differences in behavior (i.e., heterogeneity), and assess whether these neural measures may be viable candidates as biomarkers for use in future studies. This proposal addresses the Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee's Strategic Plan (2013 Update) that includes comprehensive examination of the neural circuitry in individuals with ASD across the lifespan, including throughout adulthood, as well as a focus on heterogeneity. PROJECT NARRATIVE Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is an alarmingly common neurodevelopmental disorder that affects approximately 1% of the population, making it a major public health concern. This proposal will provide novel insight into the neurobiological basis of ASD by assessing brain functioning during conditions that more closely approximate the complex processing demands of the real world.",Using complex video stimuli to elucidate atypical brain functioning in ASD,9412885,R01MH110630,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Arousal', 'Attention', 'Auditory', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Dimensions', 'Exhibits', 'Eye', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Future', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Movement', 'Nature', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Public Health', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Social Interaction', 'Speech', 'Stimulus', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Update', 'Visual', 'Voice', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'candidate marker', 'cognitive process', 'cognitive system', 'comparative', 'expectation', 'high dimensionality', 'insight', 'movie', 'neural circuit', 'neural patterning', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'potential biomarker', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'social', 'sound', 'stimulus processing']",NIMH,INDIANA UNIVERSITY BLOOMINGTON,R01,2018,546067,0.12837979363310192
"Temporal connectomics for infant brain: neurodevelopment modulated by pathology Abstract Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a highly heritable neurodevelopmental disorder affecting more than 1% of children (and almost 2% of boys), with those born in a high risk (HR) family with a child diagnosed with ASD having a ~20 fold greater risk than the general population. Although it can only be reliably diagnosed after the second year of life, ASD originates from a neurodevelopmental mechanism, with symptoms emerging as early as 6 months of age. Prospective large-scale longitudinal neuroimaging studies like the Infant Brain Imaging Study (IBIS), of those born into a high-risk (HR) family, are extremely valuable as they facilitate discovery of the earliest manifestations of ASD. The overarching goal of this proposal is a comprehensive comparative longitudinal analysis of brain organization of high- and low-risk populations, by using IBIS diffusion MRI (dMRI) data collected at 3 time points in the first 2 years of life, to elucidate the earliest manifestations of ASD and disorder trajectory. In addition, we aim to create a biomarker of ASD risk from brain connectivity features and their developmental trajectories, and to understand the brain bases of familial risk (independent of ASD). dMRI provides an insight into the structural organization of the brain represented as a connectome. “Miswiring” of the structural connectome can manifest as neuro-immaturity of WM and changes in network structures, that is, subnetworks (collection of strongly inter-connected regions associated with a distinct communication pattern), and the communication backbone (overall architecture of communication between subnetworks). Both connectivity and WM quality can be compromised in ASD compared to controls, suggesting a “miswired” connectome. Studying ASD related early developmental changes in connectivity requires design of novel analysis methods based on “longitudinal” connectomic features that are 4D features that incorporate their temporal evolution over development, culminating in the creation of novel imaging-based biomarkers. In Aim 1, we will create a new method of extracting longitudinal fiber tracts to identify and analyze differences between the developmental tract trajectories in LR-, HR- and HR+ subjects using geometry and quality features derived from the fiber bundles, to identify differences in neuro-immaturity. In aim 2, we will design novel methods to extract longitudinal network structures like structurally-cohesive and functionally-defined subnetworks and the global communication backbone, and investigate developmental differences modulated by familial risk and gender. Finally, in Aim 3 we will use the tract and network features extracted from Aims 1 and 2 to develop imaging based markers that will assist with early ASD prediction, identifying siblings who could gain from an early therapeutic intervention and provide an index of development in the form of brain connectivity “maturational age” to help characterize developmental delays and brain patterns corresponding to the same. The longitudinal analysis methods developed in the proposal will be generalizable to other clinical populations that can gain from longitudinal analysis spanning several time points. Project narrative The project aims at comprehensive comparative analysis of diffusion-based structural connectivity in high- and low-risk populations, to elucidate the earliest manifestation of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD).

"Phenotypic Characterization of Gene Disrupting Mutations in ASD DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a genetically and phenotypically heterogeneous disorder. Efforts to identifying subtypes based on the behavioral and neural phenotypes have been unsuccessful, and the rarity of specific genetic events renders subtyping at the CNV or exonic mutation level challenging and exceedingly resource-intensive. However, exploring the impact of gene disruptions in common pathways holds promise for elucidating phenotypic subtypes and clarifying genotype-phenotype relations in ASD. Most importantly, the identification of pathway-based subtypes will advance translational goals of selecting interventions, defining treatment targets, and predicting outcomes. The current project aims to investigate the behavioral and neural phenotype, obtained through electroencephalography (EEG), in pre-identified individuals with ASD with gene mutations in the beta-catenin pathway. This project addresses the critical need to understand the pathogenesis of ASD by elucidating the relationship between ASD risk genes, brain function and behavior and the need to address the wide heterogeneity in ASD by careful subtype identification. We will include 60 participants with ASD with gene mutations in the beta-catenin pathway, 60 participants with ASD with gene disruptions falling in other pathways, and 60 participants with ASD without any identified CNVs or gene disrupting mutations along with 30 typical individuals. Given the role of beta-catenin in neuronal adhesion, synapse formation, and in the transcription of target genes linked to cell growth, differentiation, and migration, as well as preliminary evidence of behavioral disruptions in learning and memory, evidence of dysfunction of beta-catenin may be observed at both the behavioral and neurophysiological level. Electrophysiological measures will allow us to specifically address the brain systems related to learning and memory as well as those related to the core features of autism. This research holds promise for discovery of gene-brain-behavior relationships, attained through integration of genotypic, EEG, and behavioral data.

"Neurophenotypic Trajectories and Behavioral Outcomes in Autism Spectrum Disorder ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has a common set of diagnostic features that nonetheless vary substantially in severity in different individuals. There are also many co-morbid features ranging from developmental delay to epilepsy to gastrointestinal disturbances that further complicate the phenotypes of ASD. To discover and integrate multilevel phenotypic information that would allow definition of biological subtypes and potentially predict and facilitate optimal outcomes, the MIND Institute initiated the Autism Phenome Project (APP) in 2006. To date, behavioral, medical, immunological and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data have been acquired on 279 children (189 ASD, 90 typically developing controls - TD) at 2-3.5 years of age. Of these, 210 (134 ASD, 76 TD) have received a second MRI scan one year later and thus far 142 (83 ASD, 59 TD) have received a third scan at 5-6.5 years of age. This program of research has identified a number of neurophenotypes of ASD related to abnormal amygdala growth and abnormal brain enlargement. But, do these brain differences really matter? An overarching goal of the proposed research is to determine whether identified neural phenotypes persist into middle childhood and are associated with the quality and severity of core and co-morbid behavioral impairments. A unifying hypothesis is that different morphometric patterns will be associated with clinical features and with the quality of behavioral outcome. We are particularly interested in whether there are different patterns of brain organization that may predict optimal behavioral outcomes in ASD. Using recently developed behavioral modification procedures that yield high quality MRI images from children at all severity levels of ASD, we propose to obtain an additional MRI time point and conduct extensive behavioral assessment of children enrolled in the APP when they reach 9-11 years of age. Based on previous return rates, we estimate that 195 children will participate. We will also recruit 100 new subjects into the APP program. This research would allow an unprecedented exploration of the relationship between brain development, behavioral abnormalities, and cognitive and functional outcome in children transitioning from early to middle childhood. We propose: 1. To evaluate brain and behavioral consequences of three patterns of early amygdala growth; 2. To evaluate brain and behavioral consequences of abnormal brain enlargement in early childhood; and 3. To identify a pattern of brain organization that is associated with optimal behavioral outcome. These projects are consistent with Objectives 1 and 2 of the NIMH Strategic plan and address the 2009 IACC Strategic Plan crosscutting themes of Heterogeneity and Lifespan Perspective. They also contribute to the still unmet research opportunity for ""Multi-disciplinary, longitudinal, biobehavioral studies of children, youths, and adults beginning during infancy that characterize neurodevelopmental and medical developmental trajectories across the multiple axes of ASD phenotype..."". An important goal is to identify children who will need additional or specialized help to achieve the highest quality of life. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: By studying nearly 300 children in the MIND Institute's Autism Phenome Project on three occasions from 3 to 6 years of age, we have discovered that children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have various altered patterns of brain development. The current application seeks funding to bring the children back for another visit when they are 9-11 years old to see if certain patterns of brain development are useful in predicting which children have more serious symptoms of ASD, have higher levels of cognitive and emotional problems or, conversely, have optimal behavioral outcomes. One important goal is to find those children who will need additional or specialized help in order to achieve the highest quality of life.",Neurophenotypic Trajectories and Behavioral Outcomes in Autism Spectrum Disorder,9422719,R01MH103371,"['11 year old', '5 year old', '6 year old', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anatomy', 'Anxiety', 'Atlases', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Back', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Body Size', 'Brain', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Emotional', 'Enrollment', 'Epilepsy', 'Fright', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Immunologics', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Literature', 'Longevity', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Medical', 'Mutation', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Procedures', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Risk Factors', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Visit', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'behavioral impairment', 'behavioral outcome', 'biobehavior', 'brain abnormalities', 'brain overgrowth', 'brain size', 'cognitive function', 'disability', 'early childhood', 'functional outcomes', 'gastrointestinal', 'infancy', 'interest', 'middle childhood', 'multidisciplinary', 'phenome', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'social', 'social communication']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R01,2018,649081,0.20038987505392467
"Co-occurring ADHD in young children with ASD: Precursors, detection, neural signatures, and early treatment ABSTRACT – Co-occurring ADHD in young children with ASD: Precursors, detection, neural signatures, and  early treatment Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) occurs in ~40-60% of individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and substantially contributes to poorer clinical outcomes. Yet, very little research has focused on the overlap of ASD and ADHD during early childhood. Thus, little is known about how these two conditions co- emerge early in life. Given the high prevalence and clinical impact of the comorbidity of ASD and ADHD, the overall goal of the Duke Autism Center of Excellence is to characterize how co-occurring ADHD influences early screening, neural signatures, developmental trajectories, and response to early treatment of young children with ASD. Project 1 will characterize risk factors for and emergence of co-occurring ADHD symptoms in young children at risk for ASD and examine how these symptoms influence early detection and progression of ASD. This project will clarify why children who have co-occurring ADHD are diagnosed at a much later age and inform more effective early detection strategies. Following a large sample of toddlers receiving routine care in Duke pediatric primary clinics (N = ~ 2800 patients/year), Project 1 will prospectively identify children at risk for ASD and collect data on risk factors, ADHD, and developmental outcomes. Project 2 will elucidate shared and distinct neural signatures and attention-related biomarkers related to ASD and ADHD, examine the functional impact of co-occurring ADHD in young children with ASD, and identify precursor characteristics during infancy that are predictive of later emergence of comorbid ASD and ADHD. This project will characterize children with ASD alone, ASD+ADHD, ADHD alone, and typically-developing children, using state-of-the-art methods, including neurophysiology, eye-tracking, movement-tracking, and computer vision analysis. Project 3 will evaluate a novel early intervention model personalized for young children with ASD+ADHD that pharmacologically addresses ADHD symptoms prior to initiating early behavioral intervention, and identify changes in behavioral and neurophysiological activity that may underlie response to treatment. This project will accomplish these goals by evaluating whether stimulant treatment (Adzenys-XR-ODT) augments the efficacy of a parent-delivered behavioral intervention based on the Early Start Denver Model. This project will examine whether changes in outcome are correlated with improvements in social attention, measured via eye-tracking biomarkers, and social engagement during parent-child interaction. This project will also examine neurophysiological changes underlying improvements in behavior. These projects will be supported by four cores: Administrative Core, Recruitment and Assessment Core, Data Management and Analysis Core, and Dissemination and Outreach Core. Functioning as a whole, the Duke Autism Center of Excellence will offer the most comprehensive understanding to date of the impact of ADHD on young children with ASD, providing important information that will allow for biologically informed and personalized methods for early detection and treatment that could mitigate the negative impact of co-occurring ADHD on individuals with ASD.   PROJECT NARRATIVE - Co-occurring ADHD in young children with ASD: Precursors, detection, neural signatures, and early treatment Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) affects 1 in 68 individuals in the U.S. and has an annual estimated cost of $126 billion.

"Neural Correlates of Biological Motion Perception in Children with ASD ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mentored Career Development Award for Frederick Shic, Ph.D. This application will support my development as a scientist, giving me the tools necessary to advance as an independent investigator. For the last 9 years, I have been invested in understanding the early visual social-cognitive processes of infants and toddlers with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). I have developed new technologies and new approaches for analyzing eye-tracking data, drawing heavily on my experiences as a software developer and engineer. I have conducted several studies of atypical visual social cognition in ASD, charting early developmental trajectories of the disorder and offering new perspectives on the nature of information processing atypicalities in ASD. I bring a unique toolset and perspective to the field of autism research. I am currently building a lab centered on developing new, consumer- ready technologies that translate theoretical mechanisms of change and laboratory findings into clinically- meaningful tools for individuals with ASD. At the moment, the development of new technologies for helping children with ASD is progressing incredibly rapidly. Countless software applications, tools, and techniques have been proposed, and the breadth and pace of these new developments is breathtaking. My goal is to ground these new developments in an approach that leverages a rich understanding of developmental theory, brain development, and behavior. Although I have experience studying behavior, I will benefit from more directed and concerted instruction; to become an expert in developmental theory and methods for the study of brain development, I will need a specific, comprehensive program of guided education as well as hands-on learning opportunities. Combining an understanding of developmental cognitive neuroscience with technology development will result in a more theoretically complete picture of the processes of change and will accelerate methods for developing and refining new technologies. This approach will make me an extremely unique investigator in the field of autism research, allowing me to use my talents and abilities to discover more about the fundamental nature of atypical developmental processes in ASD and to develop new technologies to effect positive change in individuals affected by the disorder. To this end, I am seeking to deepen and broaden my understanding of 3 fields: (a) developmental cognitive neuroscience and neuroimaging; (b) clinical/behavioral aspects of the developmental psychopathology of autism; and (c) statistical methods for combining and modeling complex data streams. In a keystone research experience, I propose to combine my expertise in eye tracking with functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), a neuroimaging technique applicable to individuals with ASD from infancy to adulthood and which targets the same underlying dynamic processes as the standard-of-field neuroimaging technique, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). In my proposal, I will examine neural correlates of emotional biological motion processing in toddlers and children with ASD (N = 30) as compared to typically developing (TD; N = 30) and developmentally delayed (DD; N = 20) toddlers and children. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This longitudinal study uses functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and eye tracking to examine atypical neural and behavioral responses in toddlers and young children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) presented with point light displays of emotional biological motion. This study will deepen our understanding of the fundamental nature of deficits in ASD by highlighting deficits in basic social-emotional information processing, and may lead to the discovery of new markers for the disorder and new methodologies for parsing the vast behavioral and clinical heterogeneity of ASD.",Neural Correlates of Biological Motion Perception in Children with ASD,9452117,K01MH104739,"['3 year old', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Age-Months', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Arousal', 'Attention', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Developmental Process', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Education', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Eye', 'Face', 'Fractals', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Fusiform gyrus', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Instruction', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratory Finding', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Motion Perception', 'Movement', 'Nature', 'Near-Infrared Spectroscopy', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Perception', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stream', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Structure of superior temporal sulcus', 'System', 'Talents', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Toddler', 'Translating', 'Visual', 'Work', 'animation', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'behavioral outcome', 'behavioral response', 'behavioral study', 'biobehavior', 'clinical heterogeneity', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cognitive process', 'cohort', 'computer science', 'data mining', 'design', 'disorder control', 'emotional stimulus', 'experience', 'gaze', 'hands-on learning', 'infancy', 'information processing', 'neural circuit', 'neural correlate', 'neurobehavioral', 'neuroimaging', 'new technology', 'novel marker', 'novel strategies', 'outcome prediction', 'preference', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'social', 'social cognition', 'spatiotemporal', 'technology development', 'theories', 'tool']",NIMH,SEATTLE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,K01,2018,175793,0.21198989608965432
"Sex-Specific Brain and Behavioral Predictors of Cognitive Aging in Middle-Aged Adults with Autism Spectrum Disorder Project Summary/Abstract Research Project Long-Term Objective: The long-term objective of this research is to describe the cognitive challenges associated with aging in adults with ASD to inform interventions and care plans. Aim 1: Identify the combination of sex-specific functional and structural brain measures in adults with ASD that (a) best describe age-related cognitive changes compared to matched-NT controls and (b) predict age-related cognitive decline.

"Mapping Regulatory Networks of Autism Risk at Cellular Resolution during Neurodevelopment Project Summary  Dr. Muhle is a practicing child psychiatrist with a strong track record of developing molecular and genetic tools to elucidate the mechanism of disease. The long-term goal of this career development award is to identify regulatory networks underlying autism spectrum disorder (ASD) through the integration of state-of-the- art functional genomics, single cell transcriptomics, and systems biology analyses with precision-engineered models of early brain development. She initiated this project during her time in the Adult and Child Psychiatry Research Training Program at the Yale Child Study Center, with the mentorship of James Noonan, Ph.D. and co-mentorship of Matthew State, M.D., Ph.D. With the guidance of Dr. Noonan, a world-wide leader in using functional genomics to understand development and evolution, and the support of Dr. State, an undisputed pioneer and leader in ASD genetics, Dr. Muhle developed expertise in regulatory genomics and the genetic architecture of ASD. Her career goal is to become an independent investigator, examining the role of the ASD risk gene Chromodomain Helicase DNA-binding Protein 8 (CHD8) in the development of ASD.  Her research goal is to determine the role of CHD8 and the impact of its loss on regulatory networks. Our hypothesis is that CHD8 regulates ASD risk-associated networks in specific cell-types that become dysregulated when CHD8 expression is altered. To address these questions, she successfully generated a Chd8 constitutive knockout mouse and an Avi-tagged Chd8 mouse that she will use to identify Chd8-regulated networks in specific cell-types at high cellular resolution. She also proposes a high-throughput small molecule screen to explore potential upstream developmental signaling pathways that effect CHD8-regulated expression networks. The following independent specific aims will address our hypothesis: 1) Determine cell-type specific expression changes due to Chd8 haploinsufficiency in the developing cortex. 2) Map Chd8-bound cell-type specific regulatory networks at high resolution in the cortex. 3) Identify bioactive modulators of CHD8 expression networks via high-throughput reporter assay. Our rationale is that by studying CHD8, a key regulatory molecule that targets other ASD risk genes, we will expand our knowledge of other ASD risk genes and identify CHD8-targeted regulatory networks in particular cell-types to further define the biology of ASD.  With the continued mentorship of Dr. Noonan and co-mentorship of Marina Picciotto, M.D., an expert in animal models of neurobehavioral disorders, with collaboration of Thomas Fernandez, M.D., a child psychiatrist with expertise in systems analyses of genetic risk factors, and Smita Krishnaswamy, Ph.D., a computational biologist on the cutting-edge of statistical and mathematical modeling, Dr. Muhle will develop the experimental and analytical skills necessary to fully utilize the model systems she has developed. Together with the resources of the Yale Child Study Center and her career development goals, she will attain her career goal to illuminate basic biological mechanisms underlying brain development and risk for ASD. Project narrative Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a highly prevalent congenital disorder most often characterized by life-long impairments in social communication that create significant obstacles to education, employment and formation of relationships. There is a significant public health need for therapeutics that target the core symptoms of ASD, but despite recent foundational advances in understanding genetic contributors to ASD etiology there is a gap in our understanding of how the diverse etiologies of ASD converge into common pathways on a molecular and cellular level. The studies proposed in this application combine cutting-edge functional genomics and single cell transcriptomics with novel animal and cellular models of early brain development to identify regulatory networks of genes and pathways associated with autism risk at unprecedented cellular resolution, which will provide new-found insight into the biological underpinnings of ASD pathology to inform the development of novel, targeted therapeutics.",Mapping Regulatory Networks of Autism Risk at Cellular Resolution during Neurodevelopment,9566985,K08MH115164,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affinity', 'Animal Model', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavioral Symptoms', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Availability', 'Biological Models', 'Biological Response Modifier Therapy', 'Biology', 'Biotin', 'Brain', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Child', 'Child Psychiatry', 'Collaborations', 'Congenital Disorders', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Education', 'Embryo', 'Employment', 'Engineering', 'Etiology', 'Evolution', 'Exposure to', 'Expression Profiling', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knockout Mice', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Ligands', 'Ligase', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Pathology', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Proteins', 'Psychiatrist', 'Public Health', 'RNA', 'Reporter', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Signal Pathway', 'Site', 'Statistical Models', 'Symptoms', 'Systems Analysis', 'Systems Biology', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training Programs', 'Variant', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'biochip', 'career', 'career development', 'cell type', 'chromatin immunoprecipitation', 'chromatin remodeling', 'differential expression', 'disorder risk', 'fetal', 'functional genomics', 'genetic architecture', 'genetic risk factor', 'genome-wide', 'helicase', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning network', 'mathematical model', 'neocortical', 'nerve stem cell', 'neurobehavioral disorder', 'neurodevelopment', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'risk variant', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'skills', 'small molecule', 'social communication', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic development', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NIMH,YALE UNIVERSITY,K08,2018,154085,0.1625271812192626
"The Psychiatric Cell Map Initiative: Connecting Genomics, Subcellular Networks, and Higher Order Phenotypes SUMMARY The global burden of mental illness, including autism spectrum disorders (ASD), intellectual disability, epilepsy, Tourette disorder, schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, is enormous, whether measured in health care expenditures, lost productivity, or personal suffering. Unfortunately, there is a striking lack of insight into the underlying molecular biology of these syndromes. However, recent advances in gene discovery are setting the stage for a transformation in the understanding of these psychiatric disorders. Understanding pathobiology and developing novel treatments is becoming increasingly dependent on knowledge of biological networks of multiple types, including physical interactions among proteins and synthetic­lethal and epistatic interactions among genes. Here we seek support for a new effort, the Psychiatric Cell Map Initiative (PCMI, www.pcmi.ucsf.edu), aimed at comprehensively understanding these complex interactions in psychiatric disorders and how they differ between diseased and healthy states. While we will focus on ASD in this proposal, this work will establish a paradigm to investigate other psychiatric disorders in future work. The PCMI is a multi­campus initiative of the University of California, involving UC San Francisco, UC San Diego and UC Berkeley, which leverages genomics, proteomics, high­throughput sequencing, advanced network mapping, computational analysis, and research platforms developed by multiple PCMI investigators over the past decade. Thus primed, these platforms will be tuned to efficiently generate, assemble, and analyze molecular networks linked to ASD, in relevant cell types, with a view towards pathway and network­based personalized therapy. Specifically, over the next five years the PCMI will seek to catalyze major phase transitions in ASD research and therapy by (1) Comprehensively mapping the networks of physical interactions among proteins linked to ASD, revealing the protein complexes and higher­order molecular units underlying ASD in multiple cell types of the human brain; (2) Mapping the parallel networks of synthetic­lethal and epistatic interactions among ASD genes using CRISPR­based approaches; (3) Establishing the robust computational methodology, end­user software, and databases for assembly and use of ASD cell network maps in both basic and clinical modalities; (4) Translating molecular insights into an understanding of higher order phenotypes; (5) Building a critical mass of leading investigators focused on psychiatric disorders worldwide to expand PCMI into a global coordinated partnership; and (6) Training the current and next­generation of scientists in Network Biology and its applications to research focused on psychiatric disorders. NARRATIVE Although the past few years have ushered in much success in identifying the genes linked to autism spectrum disorders (ASD), we need to move beyond simply cataloguing component genes in order to gain a mechanistic and actionable understanding of ASD and other psychiatric disorders. More specifically, it is critical to understand the many interactions between these genes and the proteins they encode, and how these complex networks are connected to the underlying pathobiology of ASD. To address this challenge, the Psychiatric Cell Map Initiative (PCMI, www.pcmi.ucsf.edu) will apply systematic approaches to comprehensively map the molecular networks that underlie ASD and translate them to higher order biological insights, which will form a key resource for precision medicine.","The Psychiatric Cell Map Initiative: Connecting Genomics, Subcellular Networks, and Higher Order Phenotypes",9595884,U01MH115747,"['ASCL1 gene', 'Address', 'Architecture', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biology', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'CRISPR interference', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'California', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coupled', 'Cryoelectron Microscopy', 'DNA sequencing', 'DNA-Protein Interaction', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Engineering', 'Epilepsy', 'Eukaryotic Cell', 'Future', 'Gene Combinations', 'Gene Components', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Screening', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Gilles de la Tourette syndrome', 'Goals', 'Health Expenditures', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Human', 'Image Analysis', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Intellectual functioning disability', 'Knowledge', 'Libraries', 'Ligands', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Microscopy', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Mutation', 'Network-based', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Ontology', 'Organism', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phase Transition', 'Phenotype', 'Point Mutation', 'Productivity', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'San Francisco', 'Schizophrenia', 'Scientist', 'Slice', 'Structure', 'Syndrome', 'Tadpoles', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Xenopus', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'cell type', 'deep neural network', 'excitatory neuron', 'experimental study', 'gene discovery', 'in vivo', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'inhibitory neuron', 'insight', 'interest', 'link protein', 'molecular phenotype', 'multidisciplinary', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'next generation', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'protein complex', 'protein structure', 'rare variant', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'small molecule', 'success', 'transcriptome']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",U01,2018,3641916,0.14335073703788526
"Subnetwork-based Quantitative Imaging Biomarkers for Therapy Assessment in Autism Project Summary Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a developmental disorder characterized by impairment of social interaction and communication, as well as repetitive behaviors, with severity ranging from mild to signiﬁcantly disabling. The prevalence in the United States is rising (currently about 1 in 68 children) and the associated costs are great. In our most recent previous efforts on this project, we have initiated development of a graph-based, Bayesian neuroimage analysis framework and have used it to characterize brain pathology in ASD and identify abnormal functional subnetworks from groupwise data. Key results demonstrated clear differences in task- based functional brain networks between ASD and typically developing control (TDC) groups associated with the perception of biological motion. While our efforts (and those of others) are important for characterizing ASD, advances in the characterization of response to therapy with imaging are crucial for improved understanding, and ultimately personalization, of these therapies. Thus, we propose to put forth a bold new direction: to further develop our analysis methodology and study these task-based subnetworks, now with the goal of characterizing individuals in terms of their predicted response to treatment. We will focus on Pivotal Response Treatment (PRT), an intensive behavioral therapy for children with ASD that improves social communication skills. We ﬁrst propose to fully develop our uniﬁed Bayesian framework to detect both hyper- and hypo-synchronous functional subnetworks within whole-brain, groupwise, task-based fMRI data on a large training dataset of ASD and TDC subjects. We will identify dense subgraphs (communities) that exhibit group differences in functional synchrony between ASD and TDC groups. The groupwise subnetworks will then be mapped to single subject, task-based fMRI data acquired from a cohort of ASD subjects treated with PRT. For each subject, imaging biomarkers based on activation signal strength and functional connectivity will be derived for regions within each hyper- and hypo- synchronous subnetwork at both baseline and after 16 weeks of therapy. Using a random forest regression strategy, we will use a combination of biomarkers from the baseline data to predict response to PRT (using change in Social Responsiveness Scale, 2nd Edition as the primary clinical outcome measure). In addition, we will use a combination of biomarkers from baseline and 16 weeks to predict treatment persistence at 32 weeks. We will compare the prediction capability of our new approach using task-based fMRI to a set of biomarkers with regions identiﬁed from groupwise analysis of resting state fMRI (rsfMRI) networks found from the same training subjects noted above using an alternative state-of-the-art method. We will also develop methods to examine potential metabolic alterations in networks using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) of GABA and glutamate (the major excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters) to explore possible biochemical differences associated with ASD, changes in response to PRT and the use of this information as additional imaging biomarkers. Project Narrative Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a difﬁcult and growing problem. The goal of this project is to develop sensi- tive and quantitative imaging and image analysis methodology for the study of ASD aimed at measuring brain pathology and using it to characterize and predict response to therapy. This work will advance our understanding of this disorder and its treatment and ultimately inform and guide personalized therapies.",Subnetwork-based Quantitative Imaging Biomarkers for Therapy Assessment in Autism,9504653,R01NS035193,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Aminobutyric Acids', 'Anatomy', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Pathology', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Derivation procedure', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Exhibits', 'Female', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic', 'Glutamates', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Judgment', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Methodological Studies', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Motion', 'Motion Perception', 'Motivation', 'Nature', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Prevalence', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Interaction', 'Standardization', 'Subgroup', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Visuospatial', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'biomarker development', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cohort', 'cost', 'developmental disease', 'evidence base', 'expectation', 'forest', 'gamma-Aminobutyric Acid', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'information processing', 'inhibitory neuron', 'member', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'patient biomarkers', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'predicting response', 'quantitative imaging', 'repetitive behavior', 'response', 'skills', 'social', 'social communication', 'theories', 'treatment response']",NINDS,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,371982,0.20130347040012014
"Neuronal Correlates of Autistic Traits in ADHD and Autism ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This study aims to conduct the first investigation of the neurobiological underpinnings of social communicative impairments, i.e., autistic traits (AT), in children with ADHD and ASD. AT, a key feature of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), occurs in 20-30% of children with ADHD. These children incur relatively elevated school failure and poor global functioning, highlighting the clinical significance of AT in children with ADHD (ADHD+AT). We aim to advance our understanding of AT across ADHD and ASD, applying state of the art brain imaging methodology as a first step in efforts to foster advances in treatment. Hypotheses emanate from the literature and our preliminary data. We aim to test that intrinsic functional connectivity (iFC) between the fusiform face area (FFA) and rostral anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) underpins AT across ASD and ADHD diagnoses. Specifically, we hypothesize: H1a: FFA-ACC iFC is reduced in children with ASD and in those with ADHD+AT, relative to children with ADHD but no AT (ADHD-AT); H1b: Across groups, weaker FFA-ACC iFC is associated with more severe AT. H2a: FFA-ACC iFC is positively associated with accuracy in emotion face recognition, and H2b: FFA-ACC iFC is significantly more related to accuracy on an emotion task than on a control non-emotion task. In addition, we will explore 1) similarities between R-fMRI and task-fMRI connectivity; 2) brain-behavior relationships beyond the FFA-ACC circuit, deriving whole-brain voxelwise R- fMRI metrics and iFC between regions-of-interest representing the `social brain'; 3) behavioral relations with structural connectivity indexed by fractional anisotroy, focusing on the inferior frontal occipital fasciculus, and other relevant tracts; and 4) data-drive approaches combining available clinical and imaging data to identify homogenous neurophenotypes regardless of diagnosis. Methods. We anticipate obtaining complete datasets from at least 70 children per group - ADHD+AT, ADHD-AT, and ASD (total N=210), group-matched for age, sex, full IQ, handedness and socioeconomic status. Assessments. A partial list includes: Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule-2 (administered ""blind"" to all other clinical data), K-SADS and ADI-R interviews, Parent and Teacher rating scales. The emotion face recognition task, and the holistic configural face processing task will assess emotion face processing; a Go-No Go task, and motion tracking will measure attention and motion. Brain-behavior analyses will rely on resting state fMRI (R-fMRI), structural, diffusion tensor imaging and task- fMRI (matching face task). Significance. The study informs the neurobiology of a shared phenotype, and will bring the field closer to a neural stratification of individuals with AT a critical step for developing neuroscientifically-informed treatments. Additionally, we will share unidentified data with National Database for Autism Research yearly to accelerate scientific progress. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A substantial proportion of children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder have autistic traits for which clinicians have no effective treatmens. We propose to use advanced brain imaging methods to identify circuit(s) responsible for difficulties in recognizing facial expressions and relating socially to others.

"Characterizing mechanistic heterogeneity across ADHD and Autism DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Progress in establishing the etiology of psychiatric illness is limited by the absence of objective biological measures able to detect and discriminate between disorders. This problem is particularly important in developmental disorders, where early identification could eventually assist in prevention of lifelong impairments. The two earlies onsets, most common and costly developmental disorders in child psychiatry are attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and Autism spectrum disorders (ASD). A recent 2011 study, surveying the years 1997-2008, has now verified that 1 in 6 children have a developmental disability, a 17% increase over the past decade driven largely by increases in ASD and ADHD. These developments highlight the need for innovative approaches to address the underlying cause of these disorders. It is likely that the clinical heterogeneity and the imprecise nature of their nosological distinctions represent fundamentally confounding factors limiting a better understanding of their etiology, prevention, and treatment.  Interestingly, an emerging observation regarding brain imaging in ASD and ADHD is that they often have the same atypical functional brain signatures. However, because these two syndromes are almost exclusively studied separately, it is difficult to determine atypical brain function that is common compared to what is distinct for each disorder. If we are to improve our understanding regarding the underlying etiology of these disorders, it will be necessary to study these populations simultaneously. With that said, simply comparing groups of children based on their DSM diagnosis is unlikely to suffice. The behavioral and biological heterogeneity within each syndrome further complicates the meaning of any given group difference found in brain imaging. Thus, progress in our understanding requires not only examining these disorders in the same studies, but also identifying how brain signatures relate to distinct behavioral components (i.e., endophenotypes) that span the syndromes.  Under this context, and consistent with NIMH's new strategic plan, Strategy 1.4 (also see RDoC), the current proposal aims to use resting state functional connectivity MRI (rs-fcMRI) and structural connectivity (DTI) to identify brain signatures that correspond to fundamental behavioral components (executive, facial recognition, and affect recognition) found in ADHD and/or ASD. We also aim to develop integrated, multimodal sub-classifications (i.e. neurotypes) or ""biosignatures"" of these disorders with computational tools that include Graph Theory and support vector machine (SVM) based pattern classification. The potential impact of the proposed mechanistic categorization on future functional, genetic, treatment, and other translational studies of ADHD and ASD are substantial. The proposed study uses relatively new and advanced imaging techniques (i.e. resting-state functional connectivity MRI, and diffusion tensor imaging), along with computational tools (i.e. Graph theory and pattern classification) to identify atypical brain physiology that is unique and shared across ADHD and Autism. The work will also advance new approaches and methods to classify these disorders based on specific behavioral and neurobiological measures. The result from this study will advance our knowledge regarding the neurobiological underpinnings of ADHD and Autism, and assist in the improved characterization of homogeneous subtypes of future genetic, functional, and therapeutic investigations.",Characterizing mechanistic heterogeneity across ADHD and Autism,9272012,R01MH096773,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Ants', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Bilateral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Child', 'Child Psychiatry', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Corpus Callosum', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Developmental Disabilities', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Early identification', 'Etiology', 'Face', 'Fusiform gyrus', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Heterogeneity', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impairment', 'Impulsivity', 'Inferior', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nature', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Output', 'Parietal', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physiology', 'Prevention', 'Psychometrics', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Speed', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Structure of superior temporal sulcus', 'Surveys', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'Work', 'Youth', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'biological heterogeneity', 'biosignature', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'developmental disease', 'early onset', 'endophenotype', 'executive function', 'graph theory', 'improved', 'innovation', 'multimodality', 'novel strategies', 'response', 'study population', 'translational study']",NIMH,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,389936,0.1433526346983921
"Genome Clustering for Clinical Subtype Detection in Autism Project Summary/Abstract Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a developmental neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by a wide range of clinical manifestations and genetic heterogeneity. This complex genetic landscape poses a serious challenge to eﬀorts to ﬁnd a relationship between genotype and clinical phenotype in ASD. Therefore, the disorder remains poorly understand, and diagnostic and treatment tools are lacking. Though genetic overlap between patients is low, many mutations in autism likely aﬀect stereotyped biological pathways, resulting in subgroups of autistic patients with similar functional mutation burden. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that patients with functionally similar mutations can be clustered together in order to reveal previously unidentiﬁed groups that share both molecular mechanisms and disease related cognitive traits. This proposal ﬁrst describes an algorithm for genomic subtype detection of autistic patients using graph clustering and a novel distance function that is based on gene ontology, a database that describes the functional relationship of genes. Next, it is shown that resulting patient clusters are deﬁned by both unique and convergent involvement of genetic pathways, which provides insight into the variety of disease mechanisms that may be present in ASD. These potential mechanisms can be explored at the cellular level by connecting the clustering algorithm with data from ASD patient derived neurons. Finally, cluster membership is associated with diﬀerences in the clinical and cognitive variables, validating the relevance of the genomic subtypes. In addition, deep learning approaches to describe individualized clinical prediction are discussed. Genome clustering in autism is an important step towards deﬁning both mechanistic and clinical subtypes in this complex disorder, and this proposal addresses a growing need for algorithmic tools that connect genotype to phenotype in the context of heritable mental illnesses. Narrative Neuropsychiatric disorders, such as autism, remain a leading cause of global disease burden, due to a limited understanding of their fundamental causes. This application proposes a novel computational method that harnesses the power of genomics to identify groups of similar patients that suﬀer from autism spectrum disorder. The insights gained from this research will shed light on the biological mechanisms of this disease, thereby facilitating the discovery of new diagnostic and treatment tools for autism.",Genome Clustering for Clinical Subtype Detection in Autism,9470779,F30MH115584,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithm Design', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Symptoms', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Categories', 'Cell Line', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Curiosities', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disabled Persons', 'Disease', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Graph', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mutation', 'Neurobehavioral Manifestations', 'Neurons', 'Ontology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Research', 'Salvelinus', 'Schizophrenia', 'Source', 'Stereotyping', 'Subgroup', 'Synapses', 'Weight', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinically relevant', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'disorder risk', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'interest', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'outcome forecast', 'prognostic', 'risk variant', 'social', 'tool', 'trait']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",F30,2017,49044,0.11804868888008135
"Infant Vocal Communication: Typical Development and Autism Risk ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Research is now tracking early infant vocal communication using all-day recordings evaluated with human coding and in limited cases with automated analysis at very large scales. Results reveal unexpected features of development, illustrating foundations of language. Much of this work conducted at the University of Memphis (UM) is founded in an infrastructural theory of language development that has produced notable successes by supplying a widely-used stage model of vocal development and by providing the basis for determining clinically useful markers, especially associated with the onset and consolidation of canonical babbling (CB), a key foundation for spoken language. The UM empirical work within the infrastructural framework, based primarily on human-coding of longitudinal all-day recordings, has also begun to produce a new account of vocal foundations and vocal interaction both in the 1st months after full-term birth and in infants born prematurely by >2 months and still in the hospital. This work points toward possible indicators of risk for disorders in the first months of life. Further development of the new account holds promise for illuminating the development of vocal language and supplying predictors for conditions such as autism spectrum disorders (ASD).  The proposed research will expand the UM effort to much larger scale and address prediction of language development and of ASD through an ASD sibling study. The work will combine forces between the UM and Emory University's Marcus Autism Center (MAC), which both independently and through its Autism Center of Excellence (ACE) Program Project from NIH, is in the process of collecting a massive set of longitudinal all-day recordings of infants 1) showing typical development (TD), 2) at risk for ASD because they have an older sibling with ASD, and 3) at risk for language delay (LD) due to low socioeconomic status (SES). The MAC/ACE research includes analysis of the recordings with automated acoustic methods, but does not include funding for human coding of the massive recording set. Extensive human coding is in fact crucial for the ACE project, because without it, there is insufficient gold-standard data in terms of which to advance the accuracy and relevance of automated methods for developmental prediction and for detection of developmental communication disorders. Furthermore, many aspects of vocal patterning and interaction are as yet simply not accessible by automated means-human coding is the only workable option. The proposed research will combine efforts of UM and MAC, with 1) MAC supplying longitudinal all-day recordings across the 1st year of life to UM from the 3 groups, 2) UM performing coding and human-assisted acoustic analysis on representatively sampled segments from the recordings, and 3) both sites working together to predict infant outcomes at 24 months based on the human coding/analysis and based on the automated analysis that will result from supervised machine learning made possible by the human coding/analysis. The work targets improving prediction of language development and early identification of ASD. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This work will provide scientific foundations on vocal development and language in three groups of children, including ASD siblings, infants of low SES, and controls (low risk). The work will lay new foundations for automated large-scale monitoring of infant vocalizations.",Infant Vocal Communication: Typical Development and Autism Risk,9178653,R01DC015108,"['Acoustics', 'Address', 'Age', 'Age-Months', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Caregivers', 'Centers of Research Excellence', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Developmental Communication Disorders', 'Early identification', 'Faculty', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Gold', 'Home environment', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Infant', 'Language', 'Language Delays', 'Language Development', 'Life', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Assessment', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pattern', 'Periodicity', 'Premature Infant', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Siblings', 'Site', 'Social Development', 'Socialization', 'Supervision', 'Term Birth', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'disorder risk', 'hearing impairment', 'improved', 'infant monitoring', 'infant outcome', 'insight', 'longitudinal database', 'low socioeconomic status', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'social', 'success', 'symptomatology', 'theories', 'vocal learning', 'vocalization']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF MEMPHIS,R01,2017,525611,0.08742604602894255
"Gene-brain-environment interactions as determinants of typical and atypical developmental trajectories Project Summary Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a heritable neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by heterogeneous genetic etiology and behavioral symptomatology. While recent genetics research suggests that the cumulative effects of many single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on many genes confer increased risk of ASD, very little is known about how additive genetic risk impacts brain function and structure. My dissertation work leverages variation at the genetic, neural, and behavioral levels by investigating how cumulative genetic risk for ASD on a gene implicated in social behavior across species – the oxytocin receptor gene (OXTR) – impacts network-level activity and connectivity in brain regions critical for social reward processing, and how risk-allele dosage relates to individual differences in ASD symptomatology. Results of my first dissertation study have shown that OXTR risk-allele dosage modulates resting-state connectivity of the reward network in both youth with ASD and typically developing (TD) youth, although in different ways. In youth with ASD, greater OXTR risk is associated with reduced connectivity between nodes of the reward circuit and greater symptom severity. Conversely, in TD youth, greater OXTR risk-allele dosage is associated with greater connectivity between the reward network and frontal brain regions involved in mentalizing and this, in turn, is associated with better social functioning (Hernandez et al., 2016a). These findings in TD youth suggest a compensatory neural mechanism in the face of increased genetic risk for ASD, and raise further questions about the role of other genetic (i.e., epistatic) and environmental/experiential variables in steering development along typical vs. atypical trajectories. My ongoing dissertation study examines the moderating effects of diagnosis and gender on the relationship between OXTR risk-allele dosage and neural processing of social rewards using functional neuroimaging (fMRI). While I have gained strong expertise in connectivity-based neuroimaging, genetics, and the neurobiology of ASD, my last dissertation project will provide additional training in analysis of task-related fMRI data and assessment of changes in task-based functional connectivity (i.e., training in psychophysiological interaction analyses). My dissertation work thus far highlights how little is known about the mechanisms by which individuals with the same genetic risk for mental illness have different outcomes (i.e., affected vs. resilient). As a post-doctoral researcher, I aim to gain additional training in the assessment of environmental and experiential variables that affect neurodevelopmental outcomes, as well as in advanced data-analytic approaches to model multilevel interactions between gene-brain-environment measures (e.g., statistical analysis of longitudinal data, machine learning algorithms, imaging-genetics of genome-wide data) with the ultimate goal of combining these data to better predict risk for mental illness and inform interventions. These aims are in line with the NIH Blueprint for NIMH, NICHD, and NINDS, as they seek to elucidate the neurobiological mechanisms underlying complex human behavior and neurodevelopmental disorders. Project Narrative The proposed dissertation research examines how cumulative genetic risk for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) on a gene implicated in social behavior across species – the oxytocin receptor gene (OXTR) – impacts brain activity and connectivity in youth with and without ASD, as well as how risk-allele dosage relates to individual differences in ASD symptomatology and social functioning. Future postdoctoral research will investigate how genetic, environmental, and experiential factors impact neurodevelopmental trajectories with a focus on adolescence, a period during which many psychiatric disorders emerge. A better understanding of how complex gene-brain-environment interactions confer vulnerability or resilience to mental illness may lead to earlier diagnosis, more efficacious treatment, and improved outcome.",Gene-brain-environment interactions as determinants of typical and atypical developmental trajectories,9470704,F99NS105206,"['Adolescence', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Childhood', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Exposure to', 'Female', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Research', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genetic study', 'Goals', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Neural Pathways', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Other Genetics', 'Outcome', 'Oxytocin', 'Oxytocin Receptor', 'Pattern', 'Penetrance', 'Persons', 'Play', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychophysiology', 'Receptor Gene', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Functioning', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Youth', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'biobehavior', 'brain behavior', 'career', 'dosage', 'endophenotype', 'frontal lobe', 'gender difference', 'gene environment interaction', 'genetic variant', 'genome-wide', 'imaging genetics', 'improved outcome', 'longitudinal analysis', 'male', 'multilevel analysis', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'outcome forecast', 'psychologic', 'relating to nervous system', 'resilience', 'reward circuitry', 'reward processing', 'risk variant', 'sex', 'skills', 'social', 'symptomatology', 'task analysis']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,F99,2017,39195,0.1567633591512041
"Using complex video stimuli to elucidate atypical brain functioning in ASD ABSTRACT A major gap in our understanding of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is in knowing how the brain functions during conditions that approximate the complex processing demands of the real world. Instead, almost everything we know about brain functioning in ASD comes from reductionist studies that often use highly simpliﬁed stimuli and isolated task demands, or even from studies that lack a stimulus or task altogether, as in the case of resting-state functional connectivity. Yet, successful processing “in the wild” (i.e., in the real world) relies on the simultaneous engagement and seamless integration of multiple brain regions, brain networks, and cognitive processes. Understanding how these neural systems behave and interact during real-time processing of complex and dynamic stimuli, therefore, is critical for understanding how real-world behavior and cognition emerge from brain activity, and this remains a major gap in our understanding of ASD. The purpose of the current proposal is to ﬁll this gap, by using complex video stimuli that sample broadly from the natural world and engage multiple diverse perceptual and cognitive systems simultaneously, thus evoking activity across the entire brain at once. From this data, rich high-dimensional measures can be generated and used in combination with multivariate analytic methods ideally-suited to detect idiosyncratic and heterogeneous patterns of neural responding, which can then be related back to phenotypic variability across individuals. Our proposed studies will take place over 5 years and include 4 speciﬁc aims. In the ﬁrst two aims, we will identify neural systems most affected in ASD during the presentation of a complex video stimulus, parse the heterogeneity at the neural level using data-driven approaches and relate it back to heterogeneity at the behavioral level, and explore the stimulus dimensions (social and non-social alike, both sampled broadly) that underlie these neural abnormalities. In a third aim, we will examine video-evoked functional connectivity both within and across brain networks, comparing this directly against resting-state connectivity, and examining both modes of functional connectivity across various timescales (including dynamic coupling). A ﬁnal exploratory aim will assess the short-term and long-term stability of these measures, as well as their sensitivity in tracking change following experimental perturbation—important characteristics for potential biomarkers and/or predictor and outcome measures for use in intervention studies. Altogether, this work will provide new insight into brain activity and brain connectivity during conditions that more closely reﬂect processing demands of the natural world, help to link individual differences in brain functioning with individual differences in behavior (i.e., heterogeneity), and assess whether these neural measures may be viable candidates as biomarkers for use in future studies. This proposal addresses the Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee's Strategic Plan (2013 Update) that includes comprehensive examination of the neural circuitry in individuals with ASD across the lifespan, including throughout adulthood, as well as a focus on heterogeneity. PROJECT NARRATIVE Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is an alarmingly common neurodevelopmental disorder that affects approximately 1% of the population, making it a major public health concern. This proposal will provide novel insight into the neurobiological basis of ASD by assessing brain functioning during conditions that more closely approximate the complex processing demands of the real world.",Using complex video stimuli to elucidate atypical brain functioning in ASD,9260306,R01MH110630,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Arousal', 'Attention', 'Auditory', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Dimensions', 'Exhibits', 'Eye', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Future', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Movement', 'Nature', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Public Health', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Social Interaction', 'Speech', 'Stimulus', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Update', 'Visual', 'Voice', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'candidate marker', 'cognitive process', 'cognitive system', 'comparative', 'expectation', 'high dimensionality', 'insight', 'movie', 'neural circuit', 'neural patterning', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'potential biomarker', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'social', 'sound', 'stimulus processing']",NIMH,INDIANA UNIVERSITY BLOOMINGTON,R01,2017,587342,0.12837979363310192
"Temporal connectomics for infant brain: neurodevelopment modulated by pathology Abstract Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a highly heritable neurodevelopmental disorder affecting more than 1% of children (and almost 2% of boys), with those born in a high risk (HR) family with a child diagnosed with ASD having a ~20 fold greater risk than the general population. Although it can only be reliably diagnosed after the second year of life, ASD originates from a neurodevelopmental mechanism, with symptoms emerging as early as 6 months of age. Prospective large-scale longitudinal neuroimaging studies like the Infant Brain Imaging Study (IBIS), of those born into a high-risk (HR) family, are extremely valuable as they facilitate discovery of the earliest manifestations of ASD. The overarching goal of this proposal is a comprehensive comparative longitudinal analysis of brain organization of high- and low-risk populations, by using IBIS diffusion MRI (dMRI) data collected at 3 time points in the first 2 years of life, to elucidate the earliest manifestations of ASD and disorder trajectory. In addition, we aim to create a biomarker of ASD risk from brain connectivity features and their developmental trajectories, and to understand the brain bases of familial risk (independent of ASD). dMRI provides an insight into the structural organization of the brain represented as a connectome. “Miswiring” of the structural connectome can manifest as neuro-immaturity of WM and changes in network structures, that is, subnetworks (collection of strongly inter-connected regions associated with a distinct communication pattern), and the communication backbone (overall architecture of communication between subnetworks). Both connectivity and WM quality can be compromised in ASD compared to controls, suggesting a “miswired” connectome. Studying ASD related early developmental changes in connectivity requires design of novel analysis methods based on “longitudinal” connectomic features that are 4D features that incorporate their temporal evolution over development, culminating in the creation of novel imaging-based biomarkers. In Aim 1, we will create a new method of extracting longitudinal fiber tracts to identify and analyze differences between the developmental tract trajectories in LR-, HR- and HR+ subjects using geometry and quality features derived from the fiber bundles, to identify differences in neuro-immaturity. In aim 2, we will design novel methods to extract longitudinal network structures like structurally-cohesive and functionally-defined subnetworks and the global communication backbone, and investigate developmental differences modulated by familial risk and gender. Finally, in Aim 3 we will use the tract and network features extracted from Aims 1 and 2 to develop imaging based markers that will assist with early ASD prediction, identifying siblings who could gain from an early therapeutic intervention and provide an index of development in the form of brain connectivity “maturational age” to help characterize developmental delays and brain patterns corresponding to the same. The longitudinal analysis methods developed in the proposal will be generalizable to other clinical populations that can gain from longitudinal analysis spanning several time points. Project narrative The project aims at comprehensive comparative analysis of diffusion-based structural connectivity in high- and low-risk populations, to elucidate the earliest manifestation of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). This will require the design of novel sophisticated longitudinal analysis methods based on longitudinal tracts and network structures that inherently incorporate the temporal evolution over development. Finally, using the developmental trajectories of these features, we aim to create imaging-based biomarkers of familial risk, development and predictive of ASD prior to the age of diagnosis.",Temporal connectomics for infant brain: neurodevelopment modulated by pathology,9247655,R01HD089390,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Age-Months', 'Anisotropy', 'Architecture', 'Attenuated', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Base of the Brain', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Child', 'Chronology', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Evolution', 'Family', 'Fiber', 'Funding', 'Gender', 'General Population', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Heritability', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Length', 'Life', 'Longitudinal prospective study', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Sex Characteristics', 'Siblings', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vertebral column', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'boys', 'cohesion', 'comparative', 'connectome', 'design', 'disorder risk', 'high risk', 'high risk infant', 'high risk population', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging study', 'indexing', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'longitudinal analysis', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'predictive marker', 'prospective', 'social communication', 'spatiotemporal', 'white matter']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2017,616714,0.18772250047562347
"Phenotypic Characterization of Gene Disrupting Mutations in ASD DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a genetically and phenotypically heterogeneous disorder. Efforts to identifying subtypes based on the behavioral and neural phenotypes have been unsuccessful, and the rarity of specific genetic events renders subtyping at the CNV or exonic mutation level challenging and exceedingly resource-intensive. However, exploring the impact of gene disruptions in common pathways holds promise for elucidating phenotypic subtypes and clarifying genotype-phenotype relations in ASD. Most importantly, the identification of pathway-based subtypes will advance translational goals of selecting interventions, defining treatment targets, and predicting outcomes. The current project aims to investigate the behavioral and neural phenotype, obtained through electroencephalography (EEG), in pre-identified individuals with ASD with gene mutations in the beta-catenin pathway. This project addresses the critical need to understand the pathogenesis of ASD by elucidating the relationship between ASD risk genes, brain function and behavior and the need to address the wide heterogeneity in ASD by careful subtype identification. We will include 60 participants with ASD with gene mutations in the beta-catenin pathway, 60 participants with ASD with gene disruptions falling in other pathways, and 60 participants with ASD without any identified CNVs or gene disrupting mutations along with 30 typical individuals. Given the role of beta-catenin in neuronal adhesion, synapse formation, and in the transcription of target genes linked to cell growth, differentiation, and migration, as well as preliminary evidence of behavioral disruptions in learning and memory, evidence of dysfunction of beta-catenin may be observed at both the behavioral and neurophysiological level. Electrophysiological measures will allow us to specifically address the brain systems related to learning and memory as well as those related to the core features of autism. This research holds promise for discovery of gene-brain-behavior relationships, attained through integration of genotypic, EEG, and behavioral data. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a genetically and phenotypically heterogeneous disorder.

"Neurophenotypic Trajectories and Behavioral Outcomes in Autism Spectrum Disorder ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has a common set of diagnostic features that nonetheless vary substantially in severity in different individuals. There are also many co-morbid features ranging from developmental delay to epilepsy to gastrointestinal disturbances that further complicate the phenotypes of ASD. To discover and integrate multilevel phenotypic information that would allow definition of biological subtypes and potentially predict and facilitate optimal outcomes, the MIND Institute initiated the Autism Phenome Project (APP) in 2006. To date, behavioral, medical, immunological and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data have been acquired on 279 children (189 ASD, 90 typically developing controls - TD) at 2-3.5 years of age. Of these, 210 (134 ASD, 76 TD) have received a second MRI scan one year later and thus far 142 (83 ASD, 59 TD) have received a third scan at 5-6.5 years of age. This program of research has identified a number of neurophenotypes of ASD related to abnormal amygdala growth and abnormal brain enlargement. But, do these brain differences really matter? An overarching goal of the proposed research is to determine whether identified neural phenotypes persist into middle childhood and are associated with the quality and severity of core and co-morbid behavioral impairments. A unifying hypothesis is that different morphometric patterns will be associated with clinical features and with the quality of behavioral outcome. We are particularly interested in whether there are different patterns of brain organization that may predict optimal behavioral outcomes in ASD. Using recently developed behavioral modification procedures that yield high quality MRI images from children at all severity levels of ASD, we propose to obtain an additional MRI time point and conduct extensive behavioral assessment of children enrolled in the APP when they reach 9-11 years of age. Based on previous return rates, we estimate that 195 children will participate. We will also recruit 100 new subjects into the APP program. This research would allow an unprecedented exploration of the relationship between brain development, behavioral abnormalities, and cognitive and functional outcome in children transitioning from early to middle childhood. We propose: 1. To evaluate brain and behavioral consequences of three patterns of early amygdala growth; 2. To evaluate brain and behavioral consequences of abnormal brain enlargement in early childhood; and 3. To identify a pattern of brain organization that is associated with optimal behavioral outcome. These projects are consistent with Objectives 1 and 2 of the NIMH Strategic plan and address the 2009 IACC Strategic Plan crosscutting themes of Heterogeneity and Lifespan Perspective. They also contribute to the still unmet research opportunity for ""Multi-disciplinary, longitudinal, biobehavioral studies of children, youths, and adults beginning during infancy that characterize neurodevelopmental and medical developmental trajectories across the multiple axes of ASD phenotype..."". An important goal is to identify children who will need additional or specialized help to achieve the highest quality of life. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: By studying nearly 300 children in the MIND Institute's Autism Phenome Project on three occasions from 3 to 6 years of age, we have discovered that children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have various altered patterns of brain development. The current application seeks funding to bring the children back for another visit when they are 9-11 years old to see if certain patterns of brain development are useful in predicting which children have more serious symptoms of ASD, have higher levels of cognitive and emotional problems or, conversely, have optimal behavioral outcomes. One important goal is to find those children who will need additional or specialized help in order to achieve the highest quality of life.",Neurophenotypic Trajectories and Behavioral Outcomes in Autism Spectrum Disorder,9211385,R01MH103371,"['11 year old', '5 year old', '6 year old', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anatomy', 'Anxiety', 'Atlases', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Back', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Body Size', 'Brain', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Emotional', 'Enrollment', 'Epilepsy', 'Fright', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Immunologics', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Literature', 'Longevity', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Medical', 'Mutation', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Procedures', 'Quality of life', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Risk Factors', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Visit', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'behavioral impairment', 'behavioral outcome', 'biobehavior', 'brain abnormalities', 'brain overgrowth', 'brain size', 'cognitive function', 'disability', 'early childhood', 'functional outcomes', 'gastrointestinal', 'infancy', 'interest', 'middle childhood', 'multidisciplinary', 'phenome', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'social', 'social communication']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R01,2017,663473,0.20038987505392467
"Co-occurring ADHD in young children with ASD: Precursors, detection, neural signatures, and early treatment ABSTRACT – Co-occurring ADHD in young children with ASD: Precursors, detection, neural signatures, and  early treatment Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) occurs in ~40-60% of individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and substantially contributes to poorer clinical outcomes. Yet, very little research has focused on the overlap of ASD and ADHD during early childhood. Thus, little is known about how these two conditions co- emerge early in life. Given the high prevalence and clinical impact of the comorbidity of ASD and ADHD, the overall goal of the Duke Autism Center of Excellence is to characterize how co-occurring ADHD influences early screening, neural signatures, developmental trajectories, and response to early treatment of young children with ASD. Project 1 will characterize risk factors for and emergence of co-occurring ADHD symptoms in young children at risk for ASD and examine how these symptoms influence early detection and progression of ASD. This project will clarify why children who have co-occurring ADHD are diagnosed at a much later age and inform more effective early detection strategies. Following a large sample of toddlers receiving routine care in Duke pediatric primary clinics (N = ~ 2800 patients/year), Project 1 will prospectively identify children at risk for ASD and collect data on risk factors, ADHD, and developmental outcomes. Project 2 will elucidate shared and distinct neural signatures and attention-related biomarkers related to ASD and ADHD, examine the functional impact of co-occurring ADHD in young children with ASD, and identify precursor characteristics during infancy that are predictive of later emergence of comorbid ASD and ADHD. This project will characterize children with ASD alone, ASD+ADHD, ADHD alone, and typically-developing children, using state-of-the-art methods, including neurophysiology, eye-tracking, movement-tracking, and computer vision analysis. Project 3 will evaluate a novel early intervention model personalized for young children with ASD+ADHD that pharmacologically addresses ADHD symptoms prior to initiating early behavioral intervention, and identify changes in behavioral and neurophysiological activity that may underlie response to treatment. This project will accomplish these goals by evaluating whether stimulant treatment (Adzenys-XR-ODT) augments the efficacy of a parent-delivered behavioral intervention based on the Early Start Denver Model. This project will examine whether changes in outcome are correlated with improvements in social attention, measured via eye-tracking biomarkers, and social engagement during parent-child interaction. This project will also examine neurophysiological changes underlying improvements in behavior. These projects will be supported by four cores: Administrative Core, Recruitment and Assessment Core, Data Management and Analysis Core, and Dissemination and Outreach Core. Functioning as a whole, the Duke Autism Center of Excellence will offer the most comprehensive understanding to date of the impact of ADHD on young children with ASD, providing important information that will allow for biologically informed and personalized methods for early detection and treatment that could mitigate the negative impact of co-occurring ADHD on individuals with ASD.   PROJECT NARRATIVE - Co-occurring ADHD in young children with ASD: Precursors, detection, neural signatures, and early treatment Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) affects 1 in 68 individuals in the U.S. and has an annual estimated cost of $126 billion. In ~40-60% of people with ASD, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) also occurs and is associated with later ASD diagnosis, delayed access to intervention, and substantially poorer clinical outcomes. To fill a critical gap in knowledge, the Duke Autism Center of Excellence will provide a comprehensive understanding of the impact of ADHD on young children with ASD, including work that will enable improved early detection and treatment that could mitigate the negative impact of ADHD symptoms and improve quality of life for people with ASD.","Co-occurring ADHD in young children with ASD: Precursors, detection, neural signatures, and early treatment",9385863,P50HD093074,"['Acceleration', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Age-Months', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Attentional deficit', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Comorbidity', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Education', 'Engineering', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Etiology', 'Eye', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Services Research', 'Heterogeneity', 'High Prevalence', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Link', 'Measures', 'Medical History', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Parent-Child Relations', 'Parents', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Social Interaction', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Source', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Temperament', 'Testing', 'Toddler', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'cost', 'data management', 'developmental psychology', 'early childhood', 'effective therapy', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'inattention', 'infancy', 'model development', 'neuromechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'outreach', 'personalized medicine', 'prospective', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'routine care', 'screening', 'social', 'social attention', 'social engagement', 'social learning', 'statistics', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy']",NICHD,DUKE UNIVERSITY,P50,2017,2380519,0.20892554627600682
"Neural Correlates of Biological Motion Perception in Children with ASD ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mentored Career Development Award for Frederick Shic, Ph.D. This application will support my development as a scientist, giving me the tools necessary to advance as an independent investigator. For the last 9 years, I have been invested in understanding the early visual social-cognitive processes of infants and toddlers with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). I have developed new technologies and new approaches for analyzing eye-tracking data, drawing heavily on my experiences as a software developer and engineer. I have conducted several studies of atypical visual social cognition in ASD, charting early developmental trajectories of the disorder and offering new perspectives on the nature of information processing atypicalities in ASD. I bring a unique toolset and perspective to the field of autism research. I am currently building a lab centered on developing new, consumer- ready technologies that translate theoretical mechanisms of change and laboratory findings into clinically- meaningful tools for individuals with ASD. At the moment, the development of new technologies for helping children with ASD is progressing incredibly rapidly. Countless software applications, tools, and techniques have been proposed, and the breadth and pace of these new developments is breathtaking. My goal is to ground these new developments in an approach that leverages a rich understanding of developmental theory, brain development, and behavior. Although I have experience studying behavior, I will benefit from more directed and concerted instruction; to become an expert in developmental theory and methods for the study of brain development, I will need a specific, comprehensive program of guided education as well as hands-on learning opportunities. Combining an understanding of developmental cognitive neuroscience with technology development will result in a more theoretically complete picture of the processes of change and will accelerate methods for developing and refining new technologies. This approach will make me an extremely unique investigator in the field of autism research, allowing me to use my talents and abilities to discover more about the fundamental nature of atypical developmental processes in ASD and to develop new technologies to effect positive change in individuals affected by the disorder. To this end, I am seeking to deepen and broaden my understanding of 3 fields: (a) developmental cognitive neuroscience and neuroimaging; (b) clinical/behavioral aspects of the developmental psychopathology of autism; and (c) statistical methods for combining and modeling complex data streams. In a keystone research experience, I propose to combine my expertise in eye tracking with functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), a neuroimaging technique applicable to individuals with ASD from infancy to adulthood and which targets the same underlying dynamic processes as the standard-of-field neuroimaging technique, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). In my proposal, I will examine neural correlates of emotional biological motion processing in toddlers and children with ASD (N = 30) as compared to typically developing (TD; N = 30) and developmentally delayed (DD; N = 20) toddlers and children. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This longitudinal study uses functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and eye tracking to examine atypical neural and behavioral responses in toddlers and young children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) presented with point light displays of emotional biological motion. This study will deepen our understanding of the fundamental nature of deficits in ASD by highlighting deficits in basic social-emotional information processing, and may lead to the discovery of new markers for the disorder and new methodologies for parsing the vast behavioral and clinical heterogeneity of ASD.",Neural Correlates of Biological Motion Perception in Children with ASD,9244850,K01MH104739,"['3 year old', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Age-Months', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Arousal', 'Attention', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Developmental Process', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Education', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Eye', 'Face', 'Fractals', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Fusiform gyrus', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Instruction', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratory Finding', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Motion Perception', 'Movement', 'Nature', 'Near-Infrared Spectroscopy', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Perception', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stream', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Structure of superior temporal sulcus', 'System', 'Talents', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Toddler', 'Translating', 'Visual', 'Work', 'animation', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'behavioral outcome', 'behavioral response', 'behavioral study', 'biobehavior', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cognitive process', 'cohort', 'computer science', 'data mining', 'design', 'disorder control', 'emotional stimulus', 'experience', 'gaze', 'hands-on learning', 'infancy', 'information processing', 'neural circuit', 'neural correlate', 'neurobehavioral', 'neuroimaging', 'new technology', 'novel marker', 'novel strategies', 'outcome prediction', 'preference', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'social', 'social cognition', 'spatiotemporal', 'technology development', 'theories', 'tool']",NIMH,SEATTLE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,K01,2017,175793,0.21198989608965432
"Mapping Regulatory Networks of Autism Risk at Cellular Resolution during Neurodevelopment Project Summary  Dr. Muhle is a practicing child psychiatrist with a strong track record of developing molecular and genetic tools to elucidate the mechanism of disease. The long-term goal of this career development award is to identify regulatory networks underlying autism spectrum disorder (ASD) through the integration of state-of-the- art functional genomics, single cell transcriptomics, and systems biology analyses with precision-engineered models of early brain development. She initiated this project during her time in the Adult and Child Psychiatry Research Training Program at the Yale Child Study Center, with the mentorship of James Noonan, Ph.D. and co-mentorship of Matthew State, M.D., Ph.D. With the guidance of Dr. Noonan, a world-wide leader in using functional genomics to understand development and evolution, and the support of Dr. State, an undisputed pioneer and leader in ASD genetics, Dr. Muhle developed expertise in regulatory genomics and the genetic architecture of ASD. Her career goal is to become an independent investigator, examining the role of the ASD risk gene Chromodomain Helicase DNA-binding Protein 8 (CHD8) in the development of ASD.  Her research goal is to determine the role of CHD8 and the impact of its loss on regulatory networks. Our hypothesis is that CHD8 regulates ASD risk-associated networks in specific cell-types that become dysregulated when CHD8 expression is altered. To address these questions, she successfully generated a Chd8 constitutive knockout mouse and an Avi-tagged Chd8 mouse that she will use to identify Chd8-regulated networks in specific cell-types at high cellular resolution. She also proposes a high-throughput small molecule screen to explore potential upstream developmental signaling pathways that effect CHD8-regulated expression networks. The following independent specific aims will address our hypothesis: 1) Determine cell-type specific expression changes due to Chd8 haploinsufficiency in the developing cortex. 2) Map Chd8-bound cell-type specific regulatory networks at high resolution in the cortex. 3) Identify bioactive modulators of CHD8 expression networks via high-throughput reporter assay. Our rationale is that by studying CHD8, a key regulatory molecule that targets other ASD risk genes, we will expand our knowledge of other ASD risk genes and identify CHD8-targeted regulatory networks in particular cell-types to further define the biology of ASD.  With the continued mentorship of Dr. Noonan and co-mentorship of Marina Picciotto, M.D., an expert in animal models of neurobehavioral disorders, with collaboration of Thomas Fernandez, M.D., a child psychiatrist with expertise in systems analyses of genetic risk factors, and Smita Krishnaswamy, Ph.D., a computational biologist on the cutting-edge of statistical and mathematical modeling, Dr. Muhle will develop the experimental and analytical skills necessary to fully utilize the model systems she has developed. Together with the resources of the Yale Child Study Center and her career development goals, she will attain her career goal to illuminate basic biological mechanisms underlying brain development and risk for ASD. Project narrative Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a highly prevalent congenital disorder most often characterized by life-long impairments in social communication that create significant obstacles to education, employment and formation of relationships. There is a significant public health need for therapeutics that target the core symptoms of ASD, but despite recent foundational advances in understanding genetic contributors to ASD etiology there is a gap in our understanding of how the diverse etiologies of ASD converge into common pathways on a molecular and cellular level. The studies proposed in this application combine cutting-edge functional genomics and single cell transcriptomics with novel animal and cellular models of early brain development to identify regulatory networks of genes and pathways associated with autism risk at unprecedented cellular resolution, which will provide new-found insight into the biological underpinnings of ASD pathology to inform the development of novel, targeted therapeutics.",Mapping Regulatory Networks of Autism Risk at Cellular Resolution during Neurodevelopment,9431483,K08MH115164,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affinity', 'Alpha Cell', 'Animal Model', 'Architecture', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavioral Symptoms', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Availability', 'Biological Models', 'Biological Response Modifier Therapy', 'Biology', 'Biotin', 'Brain', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Child', 'Child Psychiatry', 'Chromatin', 'Collaborations', 'Congenital Disorders', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Education', 'Embryo', 'Employment', 'Engineering', 'Etiology', 'Evolution', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knockout Mice', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Ligands', 'Ligase', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Pathology', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Proteins', 'Psychiatrist', 'Public Health', 'RNA', 'Reporter', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Signal Pathway', 'Site', 'Statistical Models', 'Symptoms', 'Systems Analysis', 'Systems Biology', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training Programs', 'Variant', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'biochip', 'career', 'career development', 'cell type', 'chromatin immunoprecipitation', 'differential expression', 'disorder risk', 'fetal', 'functional genomics', 'genetic risk factor', 'genome-wide', 'helicase', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning network', 'mathematical model', 'neocortical', 'nerve stem cell', 'neurobehavioral disorder', 'neurodevelopment', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'risk variant', 'skills', 'small molecule', 'social communication', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic development', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NIMH,YALE UNIVERSITY,K08,2017,154085,0.1625271812192626
"Development of a Commercial Platform for Discovery and Validation of Key Microbial Metabolites in CNS Disorders ABSTRACT  Despite a wealth of continued funding and ever emerging advancements in diagnostic and therapeutic technologies, the burden of central nervous system (CNS) disorders remains substantial. The cost of Substance Use Disorder (SUD) alone is estimated at > $181 billion (2002). The findings of numerous efforts tasked with identifying risk factors and causative agents of SUD suggest that vulnerability to dependence is a complex phenotype influenced by both genetics and environmental factors. Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) also appears to be largely impacted by both genetic and environmental factors, more specifically the gut microbiome.  Recent studies have demonstrated that autism and SUD share common neural networks and molecular signaling pathways. Several of the gene-products associated with the ASD phenotype (e.g., synaptic cell adhesion molecules in the striatum and basal ganglia) affect synaptic transmission between neurons, which has also been implicated in the addiction and reward system. In addition, adults afflicted with high functioning autism exhibit greater susceptibility to drug dependence. We hypothesize that advancing the current state of knowledge regarding ASD, with particular regard to the attributes shared with drug addiction, will inspire the conceptualization and development of novel therapeutic interventions to correct common elements of striatal dysfunction.  Testing this hypothesis will require a validated turn-key platform enabling customers the ability to ship clinical fecal samples from affected and unaffected subjects and receive a list of metabolites mediated by microbiome functions and a pre-clinical (in vivo) data package deciphering the phenotypic modulation of the CNS disease. With the funding received through this award, we will design, develop, and commercialize a robust CNS-microbiome-interplay (CMI) platform-based service that will enable (i) elucidation of novel microbiome-mediated targets in CNS diseases, including metabolites, proteins and peptides, (ii) pre-clinical data collection in standardized animal models, quantifying the influence of microbial bioactive molecules, and (iii) application across a wide range of therapeutic areas, such as SUD and ASD. The CMI platform-based service offering will allow medical and pharmaceutical pharma customers (i.e., our target market) to rapidly define diagnostic and therapeutic targets from clinical samples and deduce pre-clinical efficacy estimates sans investment in venture capital or complex infrastructure. Project Narrative The major problem confronting medical and pharmaceutical R&D companies is the difficulty involved with building and maintaining an infrastructure amenable to extensive “omics” enterprises. Second Genome will serve the academic and pharmaceutical R&D community by offering a validated turn-key platform enabling customers the ability to ship clinical fecal samples from affected and unaffected subjects and receive back, as a product: (1) a list of metabolites mediated by microbiome functions and (2) a pre-clinical (in vivo) data package demonstrating phenotypic modulation of Central Nervous System disorders.

"Subnetwork-based Quantitative Imaging Biomarkers for Therapy Assessment in Autism Project Summary Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a developmental disorder characterized by impairment of social interaction and communication, as well as repetitive behaviors, with severity ranging from mild to signiﬁcantly disabling. The prevalence in the United States is rising (currently about 1 in 68 children) and the associated costs are great. In our most recent previous efforts on this project, we have initiated development of a graph-based, Bayesian neuroimage analysis framework and have used it to characterize brain pathology in ASD and identify abnormal functional subnetworks from groupwise data. Key results demonstrated clear differences in task- based functional brain networks between ASD and typically developing control (TDC) groups associated with the perception of biological motion. While our efforts (and those of others) are important for characterizing ASD, advances in the characterization of response to therapy with imaging are crucial for improved understanding, and ultimately personalization, of these therapies. Thus, we propose to put forth a bold new direction: to further develop our analysis methodology and study these task-based subnetworks, now with the goal of characterizing individuals in terms of their predicted response to treatment. We will focus on Pivotal Response Treatment (PRT), an intensive behavioral therapy for children with ASD that improves social communication skills. We ﬁrst propose to fully develop our uniﬁed Bayesian framework to detect both hyper- and hypo-synchronous functional subnetworks within whole-brain, groupwise, task-based fMRI data on a large training dataset of ASD and TDC subjects. We will identify dense subgraphs (communities) that exhibit group differences in functional synchrony between ASD and TDC groups. The groupwise subnetworks will then be mapped to single subject, task-based fMRI data acquired from a cohort of ASD subjects treated with PRT. For each subject, imaging biomarkers based on activation signal strength and functional connectivity will be derived for regions within each hyper- and hypo- synchronous subnetwork at both baseline and after 16 weeks of therapy. Using a random forest regression strategy, we will use a combination of biomarkers from the baseline data to predict response to PRT (using change in Social Responsiveness Scale, 2nd Edition as the primary clinical outcome measure). In addition, we will use a combination of biomarkers from baseline and 16 weeks to predict treatment persistence at 32 weeks. We will compare the prediction capability of our new approach using task-based fMRI to a set of biomarkers with regions identiﬁed from groupwise analysis of resting state fMRI (rsfMRI) networks found from the same training subjects noted above using an alternative state-of-the-art method. We will also develop methods to examine potential metabolic alterations in networks using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) of GABA and glutamate (the major excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters) to explore possible biochemical differences associated with ASD, changes in response to PRT and the use of this information as additional imaging biomarkers. Project Narrative Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a difﬁcult and growing problem. The goal of this project is to develop sensi- tive and quantitative imaging and image analysis methodology for the study of ASD aimed at measuring brain pathology and using it to characterize and predict response to therapy. This work will advance our understanding of this disorder and its treatment and ultimately inform and guide personalized therapies.",Subnetwork-based Quantitative Imaging Biomarkers for Therapy Assessment in Autism,9329484,R01NS035193,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Aminobutyric Acids', 'Anatomy', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Pathology', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Derivation procedure', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Exhibits', 'Female', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic', 'Glutamates', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Judgment', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Methodological Studies', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Motion', 'Motion Perception', 'Motivation', 'Nature', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Prevalence', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Interaction', 'Standardization', 'Subgroup', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Visuospatial', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'biomarker development', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cohort', 'cost', 'developmental disease', 'evidence base', 'expectation', 'forest', 'gamma-Aminobutyric Acid', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'information processing', 'inhibitory neuron', 'member', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'patient biomarkers', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'predicting response', 'quantitative imaging', 'repetitive behavior', 'response', 'skills', 'social', 'social communication', 'theories', 'treatment response']",NINDS,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,371982,0.20130347040012014
"Early Identification of ASD: Translating Eye Tracking into Practice DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Currently, parent report screening tools (e.g., M-CHAT, CSBS) are the only standardized screening options available to pediatricians for the early detection of autism. As demonstrated in our previous work (the 1-Year Well-Baby Check-Up Approach, Pierce et al., 2011), such screens have valuable strengths, but also weaknesses, including the impact of parent characteristics on how they rate their child's behavior and high false positive rates. Autism is a disorder that has its roots in abnormal early brain development, yet early identification rests largely in the hands of parent report measures, rather than in the domain of more objective, quantifiable behavior. To move beyond parent report as the only early screening choice, novel procedures for screening must be researched.  During our last grant cycle we developed a novel eye-tracking test, the Geometric Preference Test for Autism (GeoPref Test). This simple one-minute test shows dynamic, colorful geometric moving patterns on half of a computer monitor and colorful active people on the other half. Of >440 toddlers tested using standard eye tracking technology, almost every toddler who fixated at high rates on the geometric patterns was ASD, and not typical or developmentally delayed. Thus, our laboratory experiments demonstrated exceptionally high, 99%, specificity of the GeoPref Test for detecting ASD. A low false positive rate is essential in a screening tool because false positives overload the system and create anxiety. Equally important in this heterogeneous disorder, the 1-min test identified 37% of all ASD toddlers. This is a larger percentage than any other early genetic, proteomic, neuroimaging or neurobehavioral screen, and it is fast, easy, and highly ASD specific.  Aim 1 will identify methods to integrate ASD specific test into clinical practice as a 2nd tier screen for babies who fail a routine 1st tier pencil and paper screen (i.e., the CSBS). Results will greatly improve the accuracy of early detection and speed referral of babies for diagnostic and treatment services. Using a portable eye tracker, 39 pediatricians will give the GeoPref Test in their office to toddlers who fail the CSBS who will in turn be referred to our Center for blinded diagnosis. This will be the first translation of an eye tracking finding on ASD into real-world clinical practice. In an effort to fully understand the clinical phenotype of ASD toddlers that ""fail"" the GeoPref Test, Aim 2 will use novel experimental tests, such as a test of exploration, as well as standardized tests such as the Mullen, to identify clinical profiles tha distinguish these toddlers from others with an ASD. Although the GeoPref Test identifies a large subgroup of 37% of all ASD toddlers, equally fast, and accurate tests are needed to identify the remaining ASD toddlers. Aim 3 proposes to develop new eye tracking tests, specifically novel social orienting and motherese paradigms, to detect these toddlers. Random forest classification algorithms will identify eye gaze signatures that best identify subgroups of ASD toddlers. All toddlers will receive a final blinded diagnosis at 30-36 months. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  In order to move beyond paper-and-pencil parent reports as the only option for early autism screening, novel techniques must be researched. Here, for the first time, this grant will translate an eye tracking test which was found to be highly accurate in detecting ASD - the GeoPref Test - out of the laboratory and into pediatric offices. Moreover, additional novel eye tracking tests will be developed and relationships between how a toddler performs on a given eye tracking test will be examined in relation to various clinical measures such as how a toddler explores their environment; understanding the clinical-eye tracking relationships is central to discovering the many unique subgroups that likely make up the overall ASD phenotype.",Early Identification of ASD: Translating Eye Tracking into Practice,9297357,R01MH080134,"['Algorithms', 'Anxiety', 'Attention', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavior', 'Blinded', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Child Behavior', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Development', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Environment', 'Eye', 'Family', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Head circumference', 'Heterogeneity', 'Infant', 'Laboratories', 'Language Tests', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Music', 'Paper', 'Parents', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Plant Roots', 'Probability', 'Proteomics', 'ROC Curve', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Screening procedure', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Social Behavior', 'Specificity', 'Speech', 'Speed', 'Standardization', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Work', 'base', 'checkup examination', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical practice', 'computer monitor', 'forest', 'gaze', 'improved', 'innovation', 'laboratory experiment', 'neurobehavioral', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'pediatrician', 'portability', 'preference', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'satisfaction', 'screening', 'social', 'sound', 'tool']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2017,370333,0.18802527643393763

"fcMRI in Infants at High Risk for Autism DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This ESI / New Investigator clinician-scientist brings an expert team to test the altered brain functional connectivity hypothesis of autism during infancy. We will conduct graph-theory-based network analyses on functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging (fcMRI) data acquired in high-risk infants who are currently being studied in the multi-site, NIH-funded Autism Center of Excellence (ACE) study R01 HD055741: A Longitudinal MRI Study of Infants at Risk for Autism - Joseph Piven: PI. We will prospectively study diverging developmental trajectories for functional networks of brain regions in infants who do and do not develop an Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD), during a suspected period of altered brain growth in autism, and prior to symptom expression. All four ACE data collection sites and their existing Data Coordination Center will participate. These efforts will provide longitudinal fcMRI data (scans at 6, 12, and 24 months old) in up to 664 high-risk and control infants (~15% of the 544 high-risk infants will develop an ASD). All four ACE data collection sites are already (as of May, 2010) - in advance of any dedicated funding, to ensure enough fcMRI data - acquiring fcMRI data on their subjects. Interfacing with the high-risk infant ACE structural imaging study and its supplements will allow us to build on existing infrastructure, save effort and cost, standardize collections, and merge databases. It also provides the potential for future genetic-functional imaging associations. Our fcMRI approach considers the problem of autism from the perspective of alterations in the behavior of brain-wide networks and changes in strengths of functional connectivity between and within rigorously defined sub-networks of brain regions. We believe this approach is more fruitful than those which consider smaller numbers of brain regions. We will additionally use a novel cortical functional areal parcellation routine (that Co-I Steve Petersen et al. have developed) to enhance the sensitivity of the infant fcMRI data analyses. Unique insights may come from comparing our network-based fcMRI analyses to the structural MRI, diffusion tensor imaging, and extensive phenotypic data generated by the existing ACE study (fcMRI acquired in the same infants). Once diagnoses are assigned in the ACE study, we will use a machine learning, multivariate pattern classification approach (Support Vector Machine: SVM) to explore the possibility of developing a diagnostic classifier for ASD. The eventual goal would be to train an SVM to predict which infants will and will not develop ASD, based on network properties of their fcMRI data, prior to the expression of symptoms. If successful, our proposed program of research could inform the future development of pre- symptomatic diagnostic tests for ASD, increase our knowledge about the neurobiology of autism, and provide methods for studying functional brain changes in response to interventions. These approaches could be adapted for the study of other neurodevelopmental and early-onset psychiatric disorders. The proposed work is relevant to public health because autism is one of the most devastating psychiatric disorders of childhood, and disorders spanning the broader spectrum affect approximately 1/100 individuals. We propose to test the brain functional connectivity hypothesis of autism with functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging (fcMRI) in infants who are at high risk for autism. If successful, we may contribute to the eventual development of pre-symptomatic diagnostic tests for autism that will improve early identification, which is critical for enhancing outcome in affected individuals. More broadly, our proposed studies will also increase our knowledge about autism in ways that will complement future genetic, screening, and intervention studies.",fcMRI in Infants at High Risk for Autism,9002864,R01MH093510,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Symptoms', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain region', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Coordinating Center', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Early identification', 'Ensure', 'Etiology', 'Euclidean Space', 'Fiber', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Screening', 'Goals', 'Group Meetings', 'Growth', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Length', 'Life', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Network-based', 'Neurobiology', 'Normal Range', 'Outcome', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pattern', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Scientist', 'Seeds', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sensory', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'autistic children', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'case control', 'cost', 'early onset', 'gaze', 'graph theory', 'high risk', 'high risk infant', 'improved', 'infancy', 'insight', 'interest', 'joint attention', 'novel', 'patient population', 'phenotypic data', 'programs', 'repetitive behavior', 'response', 'social', 'tool']",NIMH,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,440666,0.13007170201703844
"Characterizing mechanistic heterogeneity across ADHD and Autism DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Progress in establishing the etiology of psychiatric illness is limited by the absence of objective biological measures able to detect and discriminate between disorders. This problem is particularly important in developmental disorders, where early identification could eventually assist in prevention of lifelong impairments. The two earlies onsets, most common and costly developmental disorders in child psychiatry are attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and Autism spectrum disorders (ASD). A recent 2011 study, surveying the years 1997-2008, has now verified that 1 in 6 children have a developmental disability, a 17% increase over the past decade driven largely by increases in ASD and ADHD. These developments highlight the need for innovative approaches to address the underlying cause of these disorders. It is likely that the clinical heterogeneity and the imprecise nature of their nosological distinctions represent fundamentally confounding factors limiting a better understanding of their etiology, prevention, and treatment.  Interestingly, an emerging observation regarding brain imaging in ASD and ADHD is that they often have the same atypical functional brain signatures. However, because these two syndromes are almost exclusively studied separately, it is difficult to determine atypical brain function that is common compared to what is distinct for each disorder. If we are to improve our understanding regarding the underlying etiology of these disorders, it will be necessary to study these populations simultaneously. With that said, simply comparing groups of children based on their DSM diagnosis is unlikely to suffice. The behavioral and biological heterogeneity within each syndrome further complicates the meaning of any given group difference found in brain imaging. Thus, progress in our understanding requires not only examining these disorders in the same studies, but also identifying how brain signatures relate to distinct behavioral components (i.e., endophenotypes) that span the syndromes.  Under this context, and consistent with NIMH's new strategic plan, Strategy 1.4 (also see RDoC), the current proposal aims to use resting state functional connectivity MRI (rs-fcMRI) and structural connectivity (DTI) to identify brain signatures that correspond to fundamental behavioral components (executive, facial recognition, and affect recognition) found in ADHD and/or ASD. We also aim to develop integrated, multimodal sub-classifications (i.e. neurotypes) or ""biosignatures"" of these disorders with computational tools that include Graph Theory and support vector machine (SVM) based pattern classification. The potential impact of the proposed mechanistic categorization on future functional, genetic, treatment, and other translational studies of ADHD and ASD are substantial. The proposed study uses relatively new and advanced imaging techniques (i.e. resting-state functional connectivity MRI, and diffusion tensor imaging), along with computational tools (i.e. Graph theory and pattern classification) to identify atypical brain physiology that is unique and shared across ADHD and Autism. The work will also advance new approaches and methods to classify these disorders based on specific behavioral and neurobiological measures. The result from this study will advance our knowledge regarding the neurobiological underpinnings of ADHD and Autism, and assist in the improved characterization of homogeneous subtypes of future genetic, functional, and therapeutic investigations.",Characterizing mechanistic heterogeneity across ADHD and Autism,9069097,R01MH096773,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Ants', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Bilateral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Child', 'Child Psychiatry', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Corpus Callosum', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Developmental Disabilities', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Early identification', 'Etiology', 'Face', 'Fusiform gyrus', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Heterogeneity', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impairment', 'Impulsivity', 'Inferior', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Nature', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Output', 'Parietal', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physiology', 'Prevention', 'Psychometrics', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Speed', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Structure of superior temporal sulcus', 'Surveys', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'Work', 'Youth', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'biological heterogeneity', 'biosignature', 'computerized tools', 'developmental disease', 'early onset', 'endophenotype', 'executive function', 'graph theory', 'improved', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'innovation', 'novel strategies', 'response', 'study population', 'translational study']",NIMH,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,465839,0.1433526346983921
"Infant Vocal Communication: Typical Development and Autism Risk ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Research is now tracking early infant vocal communication using all-day recordings evaluated with human coding and in limited cases with automated analysis at very large scales. Results reveal unexpected features of development, illustrating foundations of language. Much of this work conducted at the University of Memphis (UM) is founded in an infrastructural theory of language development that has produced notable successes by supplying a widely-used stage model of vocal development and by providing the basis for determining clinically useful markers, especially associated with the onset and consolidation of canonical babbling (CB), a key foundation for spoken language. The UM empirical work within the infrastructural framework, based primarily on human-coding of longitudinal all-day recordings, has also begun to produce a new account of vocal foundations and vocal interaction both in the 1st months after full-term birth and in infants born prematurely by >2 months and still in the hospital. This work points toward possible indicators of risk for disorders in the first months of life. Further development of the new account holds promise for illuminating the development of vocal language and supplying predictors for conditions such as autism spectrum disorders (ASD).  The proposed research will expand the UM effort to much larger scale and address prediction of language development and of ASD through an ASD sibling study. The work will combine forces between the UM and Emory University's Marcus Autism Center (MAC), which both independently and through its Autism Center of Excellence (ACE) Program Project from NIH, is in the process of collecting a massive set of longitudinal all-day recordings of infants 1) showing typical development (TD), 2) at risk for ASD because they have an older sibling with ASD, and 3) at risk for language delay (LD) due to low socioeconomic status (SES). The MAC/ACE research includes analysis of the recordings with automated acoustic methods, but does not include funding for human coding of the massive recording set. Extensive human coding is in fact crucial for the ACE project, because without it, there is insufficient gold-standard data in terms of which to advance the accuracy and relevance of automated methods for developmental prediction and for detection of developmental communication disorders. Furthermore, many aspects of vocal patterning and interaction are as yet simply not accessible by automated means-human coding is the only workable option. The proposed research will combine efforts of UM and MAC, with 1) MAC supplying longitudinal all-day recordings across the 1st year of life to UM from the 3 groups, 2) UM performing coding and human-assisted acoustic analysis on representatively sampled segments from the recordings, and 3) both sites working together to predict infant outcomes at 24 months based on the human coding/analysis and based on the automated analysis that will result from supervised machine learning made possible by the human coding/analysis. The work targets improving prediction of language development and early identification of ASD.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This work will provide scientific foundations on vocal development and language in three groups of children, including ASD siblings, infants of low SES, and controls (low risk). The work will lay new foundations for automated large-scale monitoring of infant vocalizations.            ",Infant Vocal Communication: Typical Development and Autism Risk,9016694,R01DC015108,"['Accounting', 'Acoustics', 'Address', 'Age', 'Age-Months', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Caregivers', 'Centers of Research Excellence', 'Child', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Developmental Communication Disorders', 'Early identification', 'Faculty', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Gold', 'Home environment', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Infant', 'Language', 'Language Delays', 'Language Development', 'Life', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Assessment', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pattern', 'Premature Infant', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Siblings', 'Social Development', 'Socialization', 'Staging', 'Term Birth', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Work', 'Workplace', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'disorder risk', 'hearing impairment', 'improved', 'infant monitoring', 'infant outcome', 'insight', 'longitudinal database', 'low socioeconomic status', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'social', 'success', 'symptomatology', 'theories', 'vocal learning', 'vocalization']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF MEMPHIS,R01,2016,565736,0.08742604602894255
"Developing an Automated Emotion Training System ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Problems with nonverbal social interaction are characteristic of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Such problems include impaired ability to detect as well as express emotions, termed facial emotion recognition (FER) and emotion expression (EE), respectively. Computer-based, automated training systems to target these mechanisms hold tremendous promise for moving the field of interventions for ASD forward. We propose to develop a highly transportable, low-cost, and user-friendly technotherapy system that targets both FER and EE. This system [Facial Emotion Expression Training: FEET] will be entirely non-invasive and game- like, to make it appealing to the target population - children with ASD. This new system will be technologically sophisticated as it uses 3D sensors, allows for free movement of the user, and automatically adjusts stimuli presentation based on real-time feedback from the user (the child). Additionally, we are integrating best practices in the field of ASD intervention research, in that the system is individualized and delivery of stimuli will be scaffolded, based on the responses (accuracy) of the user. In this two-year study, we will first refine the computational system used by the system to maximize accurate computer emotion detection with children. We will then examine usability, feasibility, and assessment validity of th new system using a two-group study comprised of children with ASD (n=20) and children without ASD (n=20). This is not a treatment evaluation study, but rather a proof of principle study, the goal of which is to optimize the technology that will be used in intervention. The penultimate goal of this line of research is to develop an innovative treatment approach that targets core processes that underlie manifest social deficits in children with ASD. Such an approach has transdiagnostic appeal as poor FER/EE is not specific to ASD; it is commonly found in children with ADHD for example. This research is also necessary to establish viability of the system before proceeding to efficacy evaluation, which will be the next step. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Problems with recognition and accurate interpretation of others' emotions as well as appropriate expression of one's own emotions are hallmark characteristics of people with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Computerized intervention may be useful in training these skills, as such training can be scaffolded, easily personalized to the needs of the individual child, and delivered in the comfort of one's own home thereby making it highly accessible and low-cost. We will develop a novel, interactive computerized system that will address emotion recognition and expression and evaluate usability of the system in children with and without ASD, in preparation for future clinical evaluation of this system as an intervention.",Developing an Automated Emotion Training System,9041646,R03HD081070,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Anger', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavior', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communication', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computers', 'Coupled', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Evaluation Studies', 'Exhibits', 'Expressed Emotion', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Feedback', 'Fright', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Happiness', 'Health', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Learning Skill', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Nonverbal Communication', 'Participant', 'Physiological', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Robot', 'Sampling', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Environment', 'Social Interaction', 'Socialization', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Target Populations', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'animation', 'anxious', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'computerized', 'cost', 'efficacy evaluation', 'emotional experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interactive therapy', 'interest', 'meetings', 'novel', 'peer', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'sensor', 'showing emotion', 'skills', 'skills training', 'social', 'usability', 'user-friendly']",NICHD,VIRGINIA POLYTECHNIC INST AND ST UNIV,R03,2016,73045,0.15566204694921593
"Phenotypic Characterization of Gene Disrupting Mutations in ASD DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a genetically and phenotypically heterogeneous disorder. Efforts to identifying subtypes based on the behavioral and neural phenotypes have been unsuccessful, and the rarity of specific genetic events renders subtyping at the CNV or exonic mutation level challenging and exceedingly resource-intensive. However, exploring the impact of gene disruptions in common pathways holds promise for elucidating phenotypic subtypes and clarifying genotype-phenotype relations in ASD. Most importantly, the identification of pathway-based subtypes will advance translational goals of selecting interventions, defining treatment targets, and predicting outcomes. The current project aims to investigate the behavioral and neural phenotype, obtained through electroencephalography (EEG), in pre-identified individuals with ASD with gene mutations in the beta-catenin pathway. This project addresses the critical need to understand the pathogenesis of ASD by elucidating the relationship between ASD risk genes, brain function and behavior and the need to address the wide heterogeneity in ASD by careful subtype identification. We will include 60 participants with ASD with gene mutations in the beta-catenin pathway, 60 participants with ASD with gene disruptions falling in other pathways, and 60 participants with ASD without any identified CNVs or gene disrupting mutations along with 30 typical individuals. Given the role of beta-catenin in neuronal adhesion, synapse formation, and in the transcription of target genes linked to cell growth, differentiation, and migration, as well as preliminary evidence of behavioral disruptions in learning and memory, evidence of dysfunction of beta-catenin may be observed at both the behavioral and neurophysiological level. Electrophysiological measures will allow us to specifically address the brain systems related to learning and memory as well as those related to the core features of autism. This research holds promise for discovery of gene-brain-behavior relationships, attained through integration of genotypic, EEG, and behavioral data.

"HARE: Action Recognition System for Behavioral Assessment Training, Data-sharing, and Early Markers Detection for Autism Spectrum Disorders. ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Early detection of autism leads to earlier treatment, which is proven to have a major impact on outcomes. In spite of recent advances in early Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) detection, the average age of diagnosis in the US is still around five. ASD diagnosis is currently performed via behavioral assessment, which requires highly specialized training, is not widely available in rural areas, and may be applied inconsistently. The need for specialized training for the administration of behavioral assessment and the effort involved in individual assessments preclude large scale deployment of these diagnostic methods in clinics and pediatricians' offices as well as large scale population studies. The Infant Brain Imaging Study (IBIS) is an early detection study at the University of Washington Autism Center which assesses behavioral and brain development in infants at high familial risk for ASD. Behavioral assessments include specialized observations of gross motor function, an area of development that is uniquely highlighted in the first year of life. This study along with others, highlight atypical motor development as the first step in the emergence of autism-related symptoms. Analyzing behavioral video data in order to assess/score individual subjects is a process that is time-intensive, subjective, and requires extensive training to attain reliability. We will build a Human Action Recognition Engine (HARE) that leverages computer vision tools to automatically extract, quantify and classify known motor actions - from video datasets - adding a significantly more efficient and standardized method to augment the current diagnostic standard of care. In this Phase I proposal, we will: 1. Develop the HARE prototype: automatic segmentation of subject of interest; determination of 3D orientation; extraction of features that are used in classification of actions from a predefined set defined in the IBIS behavioral assessment battery; 2. Leverage the intermediate outputs of the AR engine in establishing techniques to detect and de-identify faces of multiple, closely-interacting human subjects in video toward further processing and data sharing; 3. Explore early markers to classify subjects, based on actions detected, into ASD and non-ASD groups and evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of the classification engine. This Phase I effort will pave the way forthe creation of an action-annotated video repository from HARE's action recognition output. The repository will provide a rich source of highly-accessible data toward training and further research discoveries. Finally, the HARE system can systematically identify new, previously unidentified motor actions that may relate to increased risk for later developmental difficulties, particularly ASD. These novel early risk markers - in combination with existing assessments - would allow reliable, earlier identification of ASD. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to build an action-annotated video repository that will aid objective behavioral assessment of infants at risk for Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) and serve as a valuable training tool.

"Quantitative Measurements of Cortical Excitability in Neurodevelopmental Disorder ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), are characterized by abnormalities in baseline cortical excitability that are believed to be caused by an abnormal, system-wide balance between excitation and inhibition. Mounting evidence has linked baseline cortical excitability to abnormalities in the sensory systems. as manifested by both over- and hypo- reactivity to sensory stimuli and by the high prevalence of epileptiform EEG activity in the majority of neurodevelopmental disorders including ASD and ADHD. Sensory systems rely on a set of well-characterized network of mechanisms whose functioning directly depends on a precise balancing of excitation and inhibition. The aim of this investigation is to use sensory evoked responses as a means to quantitatively assess baseline cortical excitability in two common neurodevelopmental disorders, ASD and ADHD. These measurements will be made via Steady-State Visual and Auditory Evoked Potentials. Patterns sensory responses measured electrophysiologically will be compared to patterns of behavioral hyper/hyposensitivity measured via a well- characterized parental questionnaire and examiner-administered performance evaluations. These measurements will be obtained from 40 children with ASD, 40 children with ADHD and 40 matched controls. The immediate goal of the project is to determine whether specific patterns of sensory evoked potentials are associated with behavioral indices of disturbed sensory processing. The long-term goal of this proposal is to develop sensitive and objective measures of cortical excitability for use in classifying neurodevelopmental disorders. An ability to detect and quantify underlying alterations in cortical excitability in infancy and ealy childhood would be of significant value in the diagnosis, classification and treatment management of common neurodevelopmental disorders. The present proposal is a fundamental step toward the achievement of this purpose and this approach is consistent with the NIMH Strategic Plan for the development of new ways of classifying psychopathology based on dimensions of observable behavior and neurobiological measures.

"Brain Systems Underlying Episodic Memory for Social Stimuli in Childhood Autism DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is an application for an NIH Pathway to Independence PI Award (K99/R00), entitled ""Brain systems underlying episodic memory for social stimuli in childhood autism"". The overall goal of the proposed research is to understand the neural basis of aberrant episodic memory for social stimuli in children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). ASD is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by life-long deficits in social interactions. Impaired episodic memory for events of social relevance has also been commonly seen in individuals with ASD and such impairments can be highly detrimental to successful social interactions and the formation of long-term social relationships. Understanding aberrant episodic memory, particularly as it pertains to social stimuli, has the potential to provie new insights into the nature and etiology of the disorder. The candidate will use state-of-the-art functional and diffusion tensor brain imaging in conjunction with novel memory paradigms and multivariate methods to compare the neural correlates of episodic memory for social and nonsocial stimuli in children with ASD and typically developing children matched on age, gender and IQ. Memory encoding, retrieval and consolidation processes will be examined. The Specific Aims are: (1) To investigate atypical brain systems underlying episodic memory encoding and retrieval for social stimuli in children with ASD (K99 phase); (2) To investigate atypical brain connectivity underlying episodic memory encoding and retrieval in children with ASD (K99 and R00 phases); (3) To investigate atypical brain systems and connectivity underlying episodic memory consolidation (i.e., long-term retention of memories for social stimuli after several days) in children with ASD, and to determine which memory processes and brain measures are the most reliable predictors of clinical and neuropsychological assessments of memory functioning and social deficits in children with ASD (R00 phase). Findings from this research will advance our understanding of the brain basis of episodic memory dysfunction and its contribution to social deficits in ASD. This knowledge will inform early intervention and remedial education in children with ASD. The candidate will undergo a rigorous education, training, and career development plan in the K99 phase to increase expertise in clinical aspects of ASD research, and multivariate pattern classification analysis of functional brain imaging data in conjunction with structural diffusion tensor imaging. The candidate will be mentored and trained by leading experts in clinical psychology, psychiatry, developmental and cognitive neuroscience, and will gain critical experience in clinical assessments necessary for successfully working with children with ASD. This knowledge and skills during the K99 phase will enable the candidate to become an independent investigator and accomplish the follow-up innovative studies in the R00 phase. Accomplishing the proposed research in the two phases will allow the candidate to launch a rigorous research program by bridging clinical and cognitive neuroscience, and autism research, leading to a competitive NIH R01 grant. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) affect 1 in 88 children and are characterized by life-long deficits in social communication, making the disorder an urgent public health concern. Impaired episodic memory for socially relevant information is commonly seen in individuals with ASD, and such impairments can be highly detrimental to successful social interactions and the formation of long-term social relationships. Understanding the cognitive and brain mechanisms underlying impaired episodic memory for social stimuli in children with ASD will inform early intervention and remediation, eventually leading to improved long-term outcomes and quality of life for these children.",Brain Systems Underlying Episodic Memory for Social Stimuli in Childhood Autism,9014567,K99MH105601,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Area', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Award', 'Base of the Brain', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cereals', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Psychology', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Episodic memory', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Face', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Memory', 'Memory impairment', 'Mentors', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurosciences', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Psychiatry', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Remedial Teaching', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrieval', 'Sensory', 'Social Functioning', 'Social Interaction', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Training', 'Training and Education', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visuospatial', 'Work', 'aged', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'behavioral study', 'bridge program', 'career development', 'clinical predictors', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cognitive system', 'early onset', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'fusiform face area', 'improved', 'information processing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'memory consolidation', 'memory encoding', 'memory process', 'memory retention', 'memory retrieval', 'neocortical', 'neural correlate', 'neuropsychological', 'novel', 'relating to nervous system', 'remediation', 'skills', 'social', 'social communication', 'white matter']",NIMH,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K99,2016,123112,0.14454250951295405
"Neurophenotypic Trajectories and Behavioral Outcomes in Autism Spectrum Disorder ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has a common set of diagnostic features that nonetheless vary substantially in severity in different individuals. There are also many co-morbid features ranging from developmental delay to epilepsy to gastrointestinal disturbances that further complicate the phenotypes of ASD. To discover and integrate multilevel phenotypic information that would allow definition of biological subtypes and potentially predict and facilitate optimal outcomes, the MIND Institute initiated the Autism Phenome Project (APP) in 2006. To date, behavioral, medical, immunological and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data have been acquired on 279 children (189 ASD, 90 typically developing controls - TD) at 2-3.5 years of age. Of these, 210 (134 ASD, 76 TD) have received a second MRI scan one year later and thus far 142 (83 ASD, 59 TD) have received a third scan at 5-6.5 years of age. This program of research has identified a number of neurophenotypes of ASD related to abnormal amygdala growth and abnormal brain enlargement. But, do these brain differences really matter? An overarching goal of the proposed research is to determine whether identified neural phenotypes persist into middle childhood and are associated with the quality and severity of core and co-morbid behavioral impairments. A unifying hypothesis is that different morphometric patterns will be associated with clinical features and with the quality of behavioral outcome. We are particularly interested in whether there are different patterns of brain organization that may predict optimal behavioral outcomes in ASD. Using recently developed behavioral modification procedures that yield high quality MRI images from children at all severity levels of ASD, we propose to obtain an additional MRI time point and conduct extensive behavioral assessment of children enrolled in the APP when they reach 9-11 years of age. Based on previous return rates, we estimate that 195 children will participate. We will also recruit 100 new subjects into the APP program. This research would allow an unprecedented exploration of the relationship between brain development, behavioral abnormalities, and cognitive and functional outcome in children transitioning from early to middle childhood. We propose: 1. To evaluate brain and behavioral consequences of three patterns of early amygdala growth; 2. To evaluate brain and behavioral consequences of abnormal brain enlargement in early childhood; and 3. To identify a pattern of brain organization that is associated with optimal behavioral outcome. These projects are consistent with Objectives 1 and 2 of the NIMH Strategic plan and address the 2009 IACC Strategic Plan crosscutting themes of Heterogeneity and Lifespan Perspective. They also contribute to the still unmet research opportunity for ""Multi-disciplinary, longitudinal, biobehavioral studies of children, youths, and adults beginning during infancy that characterize neurodevelopmental and medical developmental trajectories across the multiple axes of ASD phenotype..."". An important goal is to identify children who will need additional or specialized help to achieve the highest quality of life. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: By studying nearly 300 children in the MIND Institute's Autism Phenome Project on three occasions from 3 to 6 years of age, we have discovered that children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have various altered patterns of brain development. The current application seeks funding to bring the children back for another visit when they are 9-11 years old to see if certain patterns of brain development are useful in predicting which children have more serious symptoms of ASD, have higher levels of cognitive and emotional problems or, conversely, have optimal behavioral outcomes. One important goal is to find those children who will need additional or specialized help in order to achieve the highest quality of life.",Neurophenotypic Trajectories and Behavioral Outcomes in Autism Spectrum Disorder,9032537,R01MH103371,"['11 year old', '6 year old', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age-Years', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anxiety', 'Atlases', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Back', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Body Size', 'Brain', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Emotional', 'Enrollment', 'Epilepsy', 'Fright', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Literature', 'Longevity', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Medical', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Mutation', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Procedures', 'Quality of life', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Risk Factors', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Visit', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'behavioral impairment', 'behavioral outcome', 'biobehavior', 'brain overgrowth', 'brain size', 'cognitive function', 'disability', 'disorder risk', 'early childhood', 'functional outcomes', 'gastrointestinal', 'infancy', 'interest', 'middle childhood', 'phenome', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'social', 'social communication']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R01,2016,670458,0.20038987505392467
"Neural Correlates of Biological Motion Perception in Children with ASD ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mentored Career Development Award for Frederick Shic, Ph.D. This application will support my development as a scientist, giving me the tools necessary to advance as an independent investigator. For the last 9 years, I have been invested in understanding the early visual social-cognitive processes of infants and toddlers with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). I have developed new technologies and new approaches for analyzing eye-tracking data, drawing heavily on my experiences as a software developer and engineer. I have conducted several studies of atypical visual social cognition in ASD, charting early developmental trajectories of the disorder and offering new perspectives on the nature of information processing atypicalities in ASD. I bring a unique toolset and perspective to the field of autism research. I am currently building a lab centered on developing new, consumer- ready technologies that translate theoretical mechanisms of change and laboratory findings into clinically- meaningful tools for individuals with ASD. At the moment, the development of new technologies for helping children with ASD is progressing incredibly rapidly. Countless software applications, tools, and techniques have been proposed, and the breadth and pace of these new developments is breathtaking. My goal is to ground these new developments in an approach that leverages a rich understanding of developmental theory, brain development, and behavior. Although I have experience studying behavior, I will benefit from more directed and concerted instruction; to become an expert in developmental theory and methods for the study of brain development, I will need a specific, comprehensive program of guided education as well as hands-on learning opportunities. Combining an understanding of developmental cognitive neuroscience with technology development will result in a more theoretically complete picture of the processes of change and will accelerate methods for developing and refining new technologies. This approach will make me an extremely unique investigator in the field of autism research, allowing me to use my talents and abilities to discover more about the fundamental nature of atypical developmental processes in ASD and to develop new technologies to effect positive change in individuals affected by the disorder. To this end, I am seeking to deepen and broaden my understanding of 3 fields: (a) developmental cognitive neuroscience and neuroimaging; (b) clinical/behavioral aspects of the developmental psychopathology of autism; and (c) statistical methods for combining and modeling complex data streams. In a keystone research experience, I propose to combine my expertise in eye tracking with functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), a neuroimaging technique applicable to individuals with ASD from infancy to adulthood and which targets the same underlying dynamic processes as the standard-of-field neuroimaging technique, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). In my proposal, I will examine neural correlates of emotional biological motion processing in toddlers and children with ASD (N = 30) as compared to typically developing (TD; N = 30) and developmentally delayed (DD; N = 20) toddlers and children. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This longitudinal study uses functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and eye tracking to examine atypical neural and behavioral responses in toddlers and young children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) presented with point light displays of emotional biological motion. This study will deepen our understanding of the fundamental nature of deficits in ASD by highlighting deficits in basic social-emotional information processing, and may lead to the discovery of new markers for the disorder and new methodologies for parsing the vast behavioral and clinical heterogeneity of ASD.",Neural Correlates of Biological Motion Perception in Children with ASD,9056598,K01MH104739,"['3 year old', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age-Months', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Arousal', 'Attention', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Developmental Process', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Education', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Eye', 'Face', 'Fractals', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Fusiform gyrus', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Instruction', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratory Finding', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Motion Perception', 'Movement', 'Nature', 'Near-Infrared Spectroscopy', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Perception', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stream', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Structure of superior temporal sulcus', 'System', 'Talents', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Toddler', 'Translating', 'Visual', 'Work', 'animation', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'behavioral outcome', 'behavioral response', 'behavioral study', 'biobehavior', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cognitive process', 'cohort', 'collaborative environment', 'computer science', 'data mining', 'design', 'disorder control', 'emotional stimulus', 'experience', 'gaze', 'infancy', 'information processing', 'neural circuit', 'neural correlate', 'neurobehavioral', 'neuroimaging', 'new technology', 'novel marker', 'novel strategies', 'outcome prediction', 'preference', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'social', 'social cognition', 'spatiotemporal', 'technology development', 'theories', 'tool']",NIMH,YALE UNIVERSITY,K01,2016,59410,0.21198989608965432
"Biomarkers of Developmental Trajectories and Treatment in ASD     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This is a renewal application for the UCLA Autism Center of Excellence. The primary focus of the UCLA ACE renewal is to understand the relationship between aberrant brain development and core deficits in autism by identifying mechanisms relating genes to brain structure/function and brain to behavior, and to develop effective interventions based on basic experimental and clinical research findings that will change outcomes in autism. In five interdependent projects and cores, our center builds on our expertise in autism genetics, multimodal brain imaging, early detection and analysis of core autism features, and experience in implementing randomized control trials of novel interventions that target these core symptoms. In this renewal application, projects focus on defining longitudinal trajectories of brain and behavioral development in infants with multiple risks for autism (Proj I); infants and toddlers with early signs of autism (Project II), nonverbal school age children with autism (Proj III), and higher functioning children/ adolescents (Project IV), using a shared set of imaging, neurophysiological and neurobehavioral biomarkers, as well as genetic risk and expression analysis (Proj V) in longitudinal studies. This center is focused on understanding both early and later trajectories of emerging and developing functional connectivity and behavioral change in relation to variation in autism phenotypes, defining how genetic risks mediate both imaging and behavioral phenotypes, and altering trajectories through two separate treatments focused on core deficits in ASD, one targeted developing joint attention and social orientation in infants, and one focused on improving language nonverbal children with augmentative pharmacological intervention. Four cores support the scientific goals: an Administrative Core, facilitating scientific progress and providing data management/statistics support; a Diagnostic and Phenotyping Core; a Neuroimaging/Neurophysiology core, and a Research Education and Outreach core. The UCLA ACE benefits from our years of working together as a team. We present a highly integrated center with multiple collaborations across levels of analysis to further a strongly translational research strategy aimed at changing outcomes in children with autism spectrum disorders.        RELEVANCE: This is a renewal application for the UCLA Autism Center of Excellence.

"Subnetwork-based Quantitative Imaging Biomarkers for Therapy Assessment in Autism Project Summary Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a developmental disorder characterized by impairment of social interaction and communication, as well as repetitive behaviors, with severity ranging from mild to signiﬁcantly disabling. The prevalence in the United States is rising (currently about 1 in 68 children) and the associated costs are great. In our most recent previous efforts on this project, we have initiated development of a graph-based, Bayesian neuroimage analysis framework and have used it to characterize brain pathology in ASD and identify abnormal functional subnetworks from groupwise data. Key results demonstrated clear differences in task- based functional brain networks between ASD and typically developing control (TDC) groups associated with the perception of biological motion. While our efforts (and those of others) are important for characterizing ASD, advances in the characterization of response to therapy with imaging are crucial for improved understanding, and ultimately personalization, of these therapies. Thus, we propose to put forth a bold new direction: to further develop our analysis methodology and study these task-based subnetworks, now with the goal of characterizing individuals in terms of their predicted response to treatment. We will focus on Pivotal Response Treatment (PRT), an intensive behavioral therapy for children with ASD that improves social communication skills. We ﬁrst propose to fully develop our uniﬁed Bayesian framework to detect both hyper- and hypo-synchronous functional subnetworks within whole-brain, groupwise, task-based fMRI data on a large training dataset of ASD and TDC subjects. We will identify dense subgraphs (communities) that exhibit group differences in functional synchrony between ASD and TDC groups. The groupwise subnetworks will then be mapped to single subject, task-based fMRI data acquired from a cohort of ASD subjects treated with PRT. For each subject, imaging biomarkers based on activation signal strength and functional connectivity will be derived for regions within each hyper- and hypo- synchronous subnetwork at both baseline and after 16 weeks of therapy. Using a random forest regression strategy, we will use a combination of biomarkers from the baseline data to predict response to PRT (using change in Social Responsiveness Scale, 2nd Edition as the primary clinical outcome measure). In addition, we will use a combination of biomarkers from baseline and 16 weeks to predict treatment persistence at 32 weeks. We will compare the prediction capability of our new approach using task-based fMRI to a set of biomarkers with regions identiﬁed from groupwise analysis of resting state fMRI (rsfMRI) networks found from the same training subjects noted above using an alternative state-of-the-art method. We will also develop methods to examine potential metabolic alterations in networks using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) of GABA and glutamate (the major excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters) to explore possible biochemical differences associated with ASD, changes in response to PRT and the use of this information as additional imaging biomarkers. Project Narrative Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a difﬁcult and growing problem. The goal of this project is to develop sensi- tive and quantitative imaging and image analysis methodology for the study of ASD aimed at measuring brain pathology and using it to characterize and predict response to therapy. This work will advance our understanding of this disorder and its treatment and ultimately inform and guide personalized therapies.",Subnetwork-based Quantitative Imaging Biomarkers for Therapy Assessment in Autism,9237585,R01NS035193,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Aminobutyric Acids', 'Autacoids', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Pathology', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Community Networks', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Derivation procedure', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Exhibits', 'Female', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic', 'Glutamates', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Judgment', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Motion', 'Motion Perception', 'Motivation', 'Nature', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Interaction', 'Subgroup', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Visuospatial', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'biomarker development', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cohort', 'cost', 'developmental disease', 'evidence base', 'expectation', 'forest', 'gamma-Aminobutyric Acid', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'information processing', 'inhibitory neuron', 'member', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'patient biomarkers', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'predicting response', 'quantitative imaging', 'repetitive behavior', 'response', 'skills', 'social', 'social communication', 'theories', 'treatment response']",NINDS,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,388857,0.20130347040012014
"Early Identification of ASD: Translating Eye Tracking into Practice DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Currently, parent report screening tools (e.g., M-CHAT, CSBS) are the only standardized screening options available to pediatricians for the early detection of autism. As demonstrated in our previous work (the 1-Year Well-Baby Check-Up Approach, Pierce et al., 2011), such screens have valuable strengths, but also weaknesses, including the impact of parent characteristics on how they rate their child's behavior and high false positive rates. Autism is a disorder that has its roots in abnormal early brain development, yet early identification rests largely in the hands of parent report measures, rather than in the domain of more objective, quantifiable behavior. To move beyond parent report as the only early screening choice, novel procedures for screening must be researched.  During our last grant cycle we developed a novel eye-tracking test, the Geometric Preference Test for Autism (GeoPref Test). This simple one-minute test shows dynamic, colorful geometric moving patterns on half of a computer monitor and colorful active people on the other half. Of >440 toddlers tested using standard eye tracking technology, almost every toddler who fixated at high rates on the geometric patterns was ASD, and not typical or developmentally delayed. Thus, our laboratory experiments demonstrated exceptionally high, 99%, specificity of the GeoPref Test for detecting ASD. A low false positive rate is essential in a screening tool because false positives overload the system and create anxiety. Equally important in this heterogeneous disorder, the 1-min test identified 37% of all ASD toddlers. This is a larger percentage than any other early genetic, proteomic, neuroimaging or neurobehavioral screen, and it is fast, easy, and highly ASD specific.  Aim 1 will identify methods to integrate ASD specific test into clinical practice as a 2nd tier screen for babies who fail a routine 1st tier pencil and paper screen (i.e., the CSBS). Results will greatly improve the accuracy of early detection and speed referral of babies for diagnostic and treatment services. Using a portable eye tracker, 39 pediatricians will give the GeoPref Test in their office to toddlers who fail the CSBS who will in turn be referred to our Center for blinded diagnosis. This will be the first translation of an eye tracking finding on ASD into real-world clinical practice. In an effort to fully understand the clinical phenotype of ASD toddlers that ""fail"" the GeoPref Test, Aim 2 will use novel experimental tests, such as a test of exploration, as well as standardized tests such as the Mullen, to identify clinical profiles tha distinguish these toddlers from others with an ASD. Although the GeoPref Test identifies a large subgroup of 37% of all ASD toddlers, equally fast, and accurate tests are needed to identify the remaining ASD toddlers. Aim 3 proposes to develop new eye tracking tests, specifically novel social orienting and motherese paradigms, to detect these toddlers. Random forest classification algorithms will identify eye gaze signatures that best identify subgroups of ASD toddlers. All toddlers will receive a final blinded diagnosis at 30-36 months. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  In order to move beyond paper-and-pencil parent reports as the only option for early autism screening, novel techniques must be researched. Here, for the first time, this grant will translate an eye tracking test which was found to be highly accurate in detecting ASD - the GeoPref Test - out of the laboratory and into pediatric offices. Moreover, additional novel eye tracking tests will be developed and relationships between how a toddler performs on a given eye tracking test will be examined in relation to various clinical measures such as how a toddler explores their environment; understanding the clinical-eye tracking relationships is central to discovering the many unique subgroups that likely make up the overall ASD phenotype.",Early Identification of ASD: Translating Eye Tracking into Practice,9095902,R01MH080134,"['Algorithms', 'Anxiety', 'Attention', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavior', 'Blinded', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Child Behavior', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Environment', 'Eye', 'Family', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Head circumference', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Infant', 'Laboratories', 'Language Tests', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Paper', 'Parents', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Plant Roots', 'Probability', 'Proteomics', 'ROC Curve', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Social Behavior', 'Specificity', 'Speech', 'Speed', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Work', 'base', 'checkup examination', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical practice', 'computer monitor', 'forest', 'gaze', 'improved', 'innovation', 'laboratory experiment', 'neurobehavioral', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'pediatrician', 'preference', 'response', 'satisfaction', 'screening', 'social', 'sound', 'tool']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2016,372175,0.18802527643393763

"fcMRI in Infants at High Risk for Autism DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This ESI / New Investigator clinician-scientist brings an expert team to test the altered brain functional connectivity hypothesis of autism during infancy. We will conduct graph-theory-based network analyses on functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging (fcMRI) data acquired in high-risk infants who are currently being studied in the multi-site, NIH-funded Autism Center of Excellence (ACE) study R01 HD055741: A Longitudinal MRI Study of Infants at Risk for Autism - Joseph Piven: PI. We will prospectively study diverging developmental trajectories for functional networks of brain regions in infants who do and do not develop an Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD), during a suspected period of altered brain growth in autism, and prior to symptom expression. All four ACE data collection sites and their existing Data Coordination Center will participate. These efforts will provide longitudinal fcMRI data (scans at 6, 12, and 24 months old) in up to 664 high-risk and control infants (~15% of the 544 high-risk infants will develop an ASD). All four ACE data collection sites are already (as of May, 2010) - in advance of any dedicated funding, to ensure enough fcMRI data - acquiring fcMRI data on their subjects. Interfacing with the high-risk infant ACE structural imaging study and its supplements will allow us to build on existing infrastructure, save effort and cost, standardize collections, and merge databases. It also provides the potential for future genetic-functional imaging associations. Our fcMRI approach considers the problem of autism from the perspective of alterations in the behavior of brain-wide networks and changes in strengths of functional connectivity between and within rigorously defined sub-networks of brain regions. We believe this approach is more fruitful than those which consider smaller numbers of brain regions. We will additionally use a novel cortical functional areal parcellation routine (that Co-I Steve Petersen et al. have developed) to enhance the sensitivity of the infant fcMRI data analyses. Unique insights may come from comparing our network-based fcMRI analyses to the structural MRI, diffusion tensor imaging, and extensive phenotypic data generated by the existing ACE study (fcMRI acquired in the same infants). Once diagnoses are assigned in the ACE study, we will use a machine learning, multivariate pattern classification approach (Support Vector Machine: SVM) to explore the possibility of developing a diagnostic classifier for ASD. The eventual goal would be to train an SVM to predict which infants will and will not develop ASD, based on network properties of their fcMRI data, prior to the expression of symptoms. If successful, our proposed program of research could inform the future development of pre- symptomatic diagnostic tests for ASD, increase our knowledge about the neurobiology of autism, and provide methods for studying functional brain changes in response to interventions. These approaches could be adapted for the study of other neurodevelopmental and early-onset psychiatric disorders. The proposed work is relevant to public health because autism is one of the most devastating psychiatric disorders of childhood, and disorders spanning the broader spectrum affect approximately 1/100 individuals. We propose to test the brain functional connectivity hypothesis of autism with functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging (fcMRI) in infants who are at high risk for autism. If successful, we may contribute to the eventual development of pre-symptomatic diagnostic tests for autism that will improve early identification, which is critical for enhancing outcome in affected individuals. More broadly, our proposed studies will also increase our knowledge about autism in ways that will complement future genetic, screening, and intervention studies.",fcMRI in Infants at High Risk for Autism,8804285,R01MH093510,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Symptoms', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain region', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Coordinating Center', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Early identification', 'Ensure', 'Etiology', 'Euclidean Space', 'Fiber', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Screening', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Group Meetings', 'Growth', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Length', 'Life', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Network-based', 'Neurobiology', 'Normal Range', 'Outcome', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pattern', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Scientist', 'Seeds', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sensory', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'autistic children', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'case control', 'cost', 'early onset', 'gaze', 'high risk', 'high risk infant', 'improved', 'infancy', 'insight', 'interest', 'joint attention', 'novel', 'patient population', 'programs', 'response', 'social', 'theories', 'tool']",NIMH,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,439808,0.13007170201703844
"Characterizing mechanistic heterogeneity across ADHD and Autism DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Progress in establishing the etiology of psychiatric illness is limited by the absence of objective biological measures able to detect and discriminate between disorders. This problem is particularly important in developmental disorders, where early identification could eventually assist in prevention of lifelong impairments. The two earlies onsets, most common and costly developmental disorders in child psychiatry are attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and Autism spectrum disorders (ASD). A recent 2011 study, surveying the years 1997-2008, has now verified that 1 in 6 children have a developmental disability, a 17% increase over the past decade driven largely by increases in ASD and ADHD. These developments highlight the need for innovative approaches to address the underlying cause of these disorders. It is likely that the clinical heterogeneity and the imprecise nature of their nosological distinctions represent fundamentally confounding factors limiting a better understanding of their etiology, prevention, and treatment.  Interestingly, an emerging observation regarding brain imaging in ASD and ADHD is that they often have the same atypical functional brain signatures. However, because these two syndromes are almost exclusively studied separately, it is difficult to determine atypical brain function that is common compared to what is distinct for each disorder. If we are to improve our understanding regarding the underlying etiology of these disorders, it will be necessary to study these populations simultaneously. With that said, simply comparing groups of children based on their DSM diagnosis is unlikely to suffice. The behavioral and biological heterogeneity within each syndrome further complicates the meaning of any given group difference found in brain imaging. Thus, progress in our understanding requires not only examining these disorders in the same studies, but also identifying how brain signatures relate to distinct behavioral components (i.e., endophenotypes) that span the syndromes.  Under this context, and consistent with NIMH's new strategic plan, Strategy 1.4 (also see RDoC), the current proposal aims to use resting state functional connectivity MRI (rs-fcMRI) and structural connectivity (DTI) to identify brain signatures that correspond to fundamental behavioral components (executive, facial recognition, and affect recognition) found in ADHD and/or ASD. We also aim to develop integrated, multimodal sub-classifications (i.e. neurotypes) or ""biosignatures"" of these disorders with computational tools that include Graph Theory and support vector machine (SVM) based pattern classification. The potential impact of the proposed mechanistic categorization on future functional, genetic, treatment, and other translational studies of ADHD and ASD are substantial. The proposed study uses relatively new and advanced imaging techniques (i.e. resting-state functional connectivity MRI, and diffusion tensor imaging), along with computational tools (i.e. Graph theory and pattern classification) to identify atypical brain physiology that is unique and shared across ADHD and Autism. The work will also advance new approaches and methods to classify these disorders based on specific behavioral and neurobiological measures. The result from this study will advance our knowledge regarding the neurobiological underpinnings of ADHD and Autism, and assist in the improved characterization of homogeneous subtypes of future genetic, functional, and therapeutic investigations.",Characterizing mechanistic heterogeneity across ADHD and Autism,8852186,R01MH096773,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Ants', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Bilateral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Child', 'Child Psychiatry', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Corpus Callosum', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Developmental Disabilities', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Early identification', 'Etiology', 'Face', 'Fusiform gyrus', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Graph', 'Heterogeneity', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impairment', 'Impulsivity', 'Inferior', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Nature', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Output', 'Parietal', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physiology', 'Population Study', 'Prevention', 'Psychometrics', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Speed', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Structure of superior temporal sulcus', 'Surveys', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'Work', 'Youth', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'biosignature', 'computerized tools', 'developmental disease', 'early onset', 'endophenotype', 'executive function', 'improved', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'innovation', 'novel strategies', 'response', 'theories', 'translational study']",NIMH,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,709255,0.1433526346983921
"Developing an Automated Emotion Training System ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Problems with nonverbal social interaction are characteristic of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Such problems include impaired ability to detect as well as express emotions, termed facial emotion recognition (FER) and emotion expression (EE), respectively. Computer-based, automated training systems to target these mechanisms hold tremendous promise for moving the field of interventions for ASD forward. We propose to develop a highly transportable, low-cost, and user-friendly technotherapy system that targets both FER and EE. This system [Facial Emotion Expression Training: FEET] will be entirely non-invasive and game- like, to make it appealing to the target population - children with ASD. This new system will be technologically sophisticated as it uses 3D sensors, allows for free movement of the user, and automatically adjusts stimuli presentation based on real-time feedback from the user (the child). Additionally, we are integrating best practices in the field of ASD intervention research, in that the system is individualized and delivery of stimuli will be scaffolded, based on the responses (accuracy) of the user. In this two-year study, we will first refine the computational system used by the system to maximize accurate computer emotion detection with children. We will then examine usability, feasibility, and assessment validity of th new system using a two-group study comprised of children with ASD (n=20) and children without ASD (n=20). This is not a treatment evaluation study, but rather a proof of principle study, the goal of which is to optimize the technology that will be used in intervention. The penultimate goal of this line of research is to develop an innovative treatment approach that targets core processes that underlie manifest social deficits in children with ASD. Such an approach has transdiagnostic appeal as poor FER/EE is not specific to ASD; it is commonly found in children with ADHD for example. This research is also necessary to establish viability of the system before proceeding to efficacy evaluation, which will be the next step.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Problems with recognition and accurate interpretation of others' emotions as well as appropriate expression of one's own emotions are hallmark characteristics of people with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Computerized intervention may be useful in training these skills, as such training can be scaffolded, easily personalized to the needs of the individual child, and delivered in the comfort of one's own home thereby making it highly accessible and low-cost. We will develop a novel, interactive computerized system that will address emotion recognition and expression and evaluate usability of the system in children with and without ASD, in preparation for future clinical evaluation of this system as an intervention.            ",Developing an Automated Emotion Training System,8889799,R03HD081070,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Anger', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavior', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communication', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computers', 'Coupled', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Evaluation Studies', 'Exhibits', 'Expressed Emotion', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Feedback', 'Fright', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Happiness', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Nonverbal Communication', 'Participant', 'Physiological', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Robot', 'Sampling', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Environment', 'Social Interaction', 'Socialization', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Target Populations', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'animation', 'anxious', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'computerized', 'cost', 'efficacy evaluation', 'emotional experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interactive therapy', 'interest', 'meetings', 'novel', 'peer', 'public health relevance', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'sensor', 'showing emotion', 'skills', 'skills training', 'social', 'usability', 'user-friendly']",NICHD,VIRGINIA POLYTECHNIC INST AND ST UNIV,R03,2015,74163,0.15566204694921593
"Neural Predictors of Language Function After Intervention in Children with Autism DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) are a phenotypically heterogeneous group of neurodevelopmental disorders being diagnosed at growing rates in toddlers and young children, with prevalence estimates of 1%. Many children have limited expressive language at the time of diagnosis, and only 50% make significant gains in communication, even with intensive interventions. Unfortunately, intervention studies in ASD have struggled to reliably predict language gain, and, importantly, to differentiate pre-verbal from non-verbal children. One major limitation is the reliance on standardized behavioral assessments, which only capture overt behaviors. Innovative methodology is needed to better characterize the neural correlates of cognitive and perceptual domains important for language acquisition and to apply these methods to inform intervention studies. Such knowledge will allow us to design and apply more effective, targeted interventions for children with ASD based on baseline phenotypes. This study proposes to apply electrophysiological measures to better characterize the neural correlates of two cognitive domains essential for language acquisition: joint attention and statistical learning, along with resting state EEG power, in young children with ASD prior to entry into an intensive behavioral intervention and then after completion of the intervention, in order to determine if specific electrophysiological profiles can predict language acquisition and gain. Combined with the activities outlined in the training plan, this research proposal represents a timely effort to apply translational methods to behavioral intervention studies in order to enrich the conventional predictors of outcome in ASD. The principle unifying this study is that a better understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying the behavioral and cognitive deficits in ASD will inform predictors of treatment response, which, in turn, will facilitate the development of more targeted interventions for these children. This study is in line with objective 1 (strategy 1.3) and objective 3 (strategy 3.1) of the NIMH strategic plan. Specifically, to (1) ""identify and integrate biological markers (biomarkers) and behavioral indicators associated with mental disorders,"" and to (2) ""further develop innovative interventions and designs for intervention studies."" Language impairment is very common in children with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD), with 50% remaining non-verbal even with intensive treatments. Clinicians struggle to predict which children will actually make gains in language at the time of a child's diagnosis, largely because of the limitations of standardized testing to characterize these children. This study proposes to couple behavioral testing with advanced electrophysiology to predict language outcomes after treatment in children with ASD. This study has the potential to improve our ability to predict language outcomes which, in turn, will allow clinicians to make more informed treatment recommendations and to provide more detailed prognostic information to patients and their families.",Neural Predictors of Language Function After Intervention in Children with Autism,8841825,K23MH094517,"['Aftercare', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Child', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Communication', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Day Care', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Family', 'Goals', 'Impairment', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Movement', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Prevalence', 'Publishing', 'Recommendation', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research Proposals', 'Rest', 'Strategic Planning', 'Subgroup', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Training', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'behavior test', 'cooking', 'design', 'developmental disease', 'early childhood', 'improved', 'innovation', 'investigator training', 'joint attention', 'neural correlate', 'neurobehavioral disorder', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'therapy design', 'treatment response']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,K23,2015,181319,0.08178873937628933
"Phenotypic Characterization of Gene Disrupting Mutations in ASD DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a genetically and phenotypically heterogeneous disorder. Efforts to identifying subtypes based on the behavioral and neural phenotypes have been unsuccessful, and the rarity of specific genetic events renders subtyping at the CNV or exonic mutation level challenging and exceedingly resource-intensive. However, exploring the impact of gene disruptions in common pathways holds promise for elucidating phenotypic subtypes and clarifying genotype-phenotype relations in ASD. Most importantly, the identification of pathway-based subtypes will advance translational goals of selecting interventions, defining treatment targets, and predicting outcomes. The current project aims to investigate the behavioral and neural phenotype, obtained through electroencephalography (EEG), in pre-identified individuals with ASD with gene mutations in the beta-catenin pathway. This project addresses the critical need to understand the pathogenesis of ASD by elucidating the relationship between ASD risk genes, brain function and behavior and the need to address the wide heterogeneity in ASD by careful subtype identification. We will include 60 participants with ASD with gene mutations in the beta-catenin pathway, 60 participants with ASD with gene disruptions falling in other pathways, and 60 participants with ASD without any identified CNVs or gene disrupting mutations along with 30 typical individuals. Given the role of beta-catenin in neuronal adhesion, synapse formation, and in the transcription of target genes linked to cell growth, differentiation, and migration, as well as preliminary evidence of behavioral disruptions in learning and memory, evidence of dysfunction of beta-catenin may be observed at both the behavioral and neurophysiological level. Electrophysiological measures will allow us to specifically address the brain systems related to learning and memory as well as those related to the core features of autism. This research holds promise for discovery of gene-brain-behavior relationships, attained through integration of genotypic, EEG, and behavioral data. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a genetically and phenotypically heterogeneous disorder.

"Brain Systems Underlying Episodic Memory for Social Stimuli in Childhood Autism     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is an application for an NIH Pathway to Independence PI Award (K99/R00), entitled ""Brain systems underlying episodic memory for social stimuli in childhood autism"". The overall goal of the proposed research is to understand the neural basis of aberrant episodic memory for social stimuli in children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). ASD is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by life-long deficits in social interactions. Impaired episodic memory for events of social relevance has also been commonly seen in individuals with ASD and such impairments can be highly detrimental to successful social interactions and the formation of long-term social relationships. Understanding aberrant episodic memory, particularly as it pertains to social stimuli, has the potential to provie new insights into the nature and etiology of the disorder. The candidate will use state-of-the-art functional and diffusion tensor brain imaging in conjunction with novel memory paradigms and multivariate methods to compare the neural correlates of episodic memory for social and nonsocial stimuli in children with ASD and typically developing children matched on age, gender and IQ. Memory encoding, retrieval and consolidation processes will be examined. The Specific Aims are: (1) To investigate atypical brain systems underlying episodic memory encoding and retrieval for social stimuli in children with ASD (K99 phase); (2) To investigate atypical brain connectivity underlying episodic memory encoding and retrieval in children with ASD (K99 and R00 phases); (3) To investigate atypical brain systems and connectivity underlying episodic memory consolidation (i.e., long-term retention of memories for social stimuli after several days) in children with ASD, and to determine which memory processes and brain measures are the most reliable predictors of clinical and neuropsychological assessments of memory functioning and social deficits in children with ASD (R00 phase). Findings from this research will advance our understanding of the brain basis of episodic memory dysfunction and its contribution to social deficits in ASD. This knowledge will inform early intervention and remedial education in children with ASD. The candidate will undergo a rigorous education, training, and career development plan in the K99 phase to increase expertise in clinical aspects of ASD research, and multivariate pattern classification analysis of functional brain imaging data in conjunction with structural diffusion tensor imaging. The candidate will be mentored and trained by leading experts in clinical psychology, psychiatry, developmental and cognitive neuroscience, and will gain critical experience in clinical assessments necessary for successfully working with children with ASD. This knowledge and skills during the K99 phase will enable the candidate to become an independent investigator and accomplish the follow-up innovative studies in the R00 phase. Accomplishing the proposed research in the two phases will allow the candidate to launch a rigorous research program by bridging clinical and cognitive neuroscience, and autism research, leading to a competitive NIH R01 grant.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) affect 1 in 88 children and are characterized by life-long deficits in social communication, making the disorder an urgent public health concern. Impaired episodic memory for socially relevant information is commonly seen in individuals with ASD, and such impairments can be highly detrimental to successful social interactions and the formation of long-term social relationships. Understanding the cognitive and brain mechanisms underlying impaired episodic memory for social stimuli in children with ASD will inform early intervention and remediation, eventually leading to improved long-term outcomes and quality of life for these children.                ",Brain Systems Underlying Episodic Memory for Social Stimuli in Childhood Autism,8805345,K99MH105601,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Area', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Award', 'Base of the Brain', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cereals', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Psychology', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Episodic memory', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Face', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Memory', 'Memory impairment', 'Mentors', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurosciences', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Psychiatry', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Relative (related person)', 'Remedial Teaching', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrieval', 'Sensory', 'Social Functioning', 'Social Interaction', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Training', 'Training and Education', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visuospatial', 'Work', 'aged', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'behavioral study', 'career development', 'clinical predictors', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cognitive system', 'early onset', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'fusiform face area', 'improved', 'information processing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'memory consolidation', 'memory encoding', 'memory process', 'memory retention', 'memory retrieval', 'neocortical', 'neural correlate', 'neuropsychological', 'novel', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'remediation', 'skills', 'social', 'social communication', 'white matter']",NIMH,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K99,2015,126252,0.14454250951295405
"Action Recognition System for Behavioral Assessment Training, Data-sharing, and Early Markers Detection for Autism Spectrum Disorders ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Early detection of autism leads to earlier treatment, which is proven to have a major impact on outcomes. In spite of recent advances in early Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) detection, the average age of diagnosis in the US is still around five. ASD diagnosis is currently performed via behavioral assessment, which requires highly specialized training, is not widely available in rural areas, and may be applied inconsistently. The need for specialized training for the administration of behavioral assessment and the effort involved in individual assessments preclude large scale deployment of these diagnostic methods in clinics and pediatricians' offices as well as large scale population studies. The Infant Brain Imaging Study (IBIS) is an early detection study at the University of Washington Autism Center which assesses behavioral and brain development in infants at high familial risk for ASD. Behavioral assessments include specialized observations of gross motor function, an area of development that is uniquely highlighted in the first year of life. This study along with others, highlight atypical motor development as the first step in the emergence of autism-related symptoms. Analyzing behavioral video data in order to assess/score individual subjects is a process that is time-intensive, subjective, and requires extensive training to attain reliability. We will build a Human Action Recognition Engine (HARE) that leverages computer vision tools to automatically extract, quantify and classify known motor actions - from video datasets - adding a significantly more efficient and standardized method to augment the current diagnostic standard of care. In this Phase I proposal, we will: 1. Develop the HARE prototype: automatic segmentation of subject of interest; determination of 3D orientation; extraction of features that are used in classification of actions from a predefined set defined in the IBIS behavioral assessment battery; 2. Leverage the intermediate outputs of the AR engine in establishing techniques to detect and de-identify faces of multiple, closely-interacting human subjects in video toward further processing and data sharing; 3. Explore early markers to classify subjects, based on actions detected, into ASD and non-ASD groups and evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of the classification engine. This Phase I effort will pave the way forthe creation of an action-annotated video repository from HARE's action recognition output. The repository will provide a rich source of highly-accessible data toward training and further research discoveries. Finally, the HARE system can systematically identify new, previously unidentified motor actions that may relate to increased risk for later developmental difficulties, particularly ASD. These novel early risk markers - in combination with existing assessments - would allow reliable, earlier identification of ASD.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to build an action-annotated video repository that will aid objective behavioral assessment of infants at risk for Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) and serve as a valuable training tool. We offer a methodology that can systematically reveal salient early motor markers that can result in efficacious screening of high risk infants.            ","Action Recognition System for Behavioral Assessment Training, Data-sharing, and Early Markers Detection for Autism Spectrum Disorders",8980858,R43MH107063,"['Age', 'Age-Months', 'Alberta province', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Beds', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer-Assisted Image Analysis', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Early treatment', 'Face', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Phase', 'Physiology', 'Population Study', 'Process', 'Reaction Time', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Marker', 'Savings', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Services', 'Siblings', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'commercialization', 'computerized data processing', 'cost effective', 'data sharing', 'design', 'high risk infant', 'human subject', 'improved', 'infancy', 'interest', 'neurobehavioral', 'novel', 'pediatrician', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'repository', 'rural area', 'screening', 'social communication', 'standard of care', 'tool']",NIMH,"BSOLUTIONS, INC.",R43,2015,360563,0.17324959879578092
"Quantitative Measurements of Cortical Excitability in Neurodevelopmental Disorder ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), are characterized by abnormalities in baseline cortical excitability that are believed to be caused by an abnormal, system-wide balance between excitation and inhibition. Mounting evidence has linked baseline cortical excitability to abnormalities in the sensory systems. as manifested by both over- and hypo- reactivity to sensory stimuli and by the high prevalence of epileptiform EEG activity in the majority of neurodevelopmental disorders including ASD and ADHD. Sensory systems rely on a set of well-characterized network of mechanisms whose functioning directly depends on a precise balancing of excitation and inhibition. The aim of this investigation is to use sensory evoked responses as a means to quantitatively assess baseline cortical excitability in two common neurodevelopmental disorders, ASD and ADHD. These measurements will be made via Steady-State Visual and Auditory Evoked Potentials. Patterns sensory responses measured electrophysiologically will be compared to patterns of behavioral hyper/hyposensitivity measured via a well- characterized parental questionnaire and examiner-administered performance evaluations. These measurements will be obtained from 40 children with ASD, 40 children with ADHD and 40 matched controls. The immediate goal of the project is to determine whether specific patterns of sensory evoked potentials are associated with behavioral indices of disturbed sensory processing. The long-term goal of this proposal is to develop sensitive and objective measures of cortical excitability for use in classifying neurodevelopmental disorders. An ability to detect and quantify underlying alterations in cortical excitability in infancy and ealy childhood would be of significant value in the diagnosis, classification and treatment management of common neurodevelopmental disorders. The present proposal is a fundamental step toward the achievement of this purpose and this approach is consistent with the NIMH Strategic Plan for the development of new ways of classifying psychopathology based on dimensions of observable behavior and neurobiological measures.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research aims at applying Steady-State Visual and Auditory Evoked Potentials to examine patterns of abnormal sensory processing in children with autism spectrum disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.

"Neurophenotypic Trajectories and Behavioral Outcomes in Autism Spectrum Disorder ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has a common set of diagnostic features that nonetheless vary substantially in severity in different individuals. There are also many co-morbid features ranging from developmental delay to epilepsy to gastrointestinal disturbances that further complicate the phenotypes of ASD. To discover and integrate multilevel phenotypic information that would allow definition of biological subtypes and potentially predict and facilitate optimal outcomes, the MIND Institute initiated the Autism Phenome Project (APP) in 2006. To date, behavioral, medical, immunological and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data have been acquired on 279 children (189 ASD, 90 typically developing controls - TD) at 2-3.5 years of age. Of these, 210 (134 ASD, 76 TD) have received a second MRI scan one year later and thus far 142 (83 ASD, 59 TD) have received a third scan at 5-6.5 years of age. This program of research has identified a number of neurophenotypes of ASD related to abnormal amygdala growth and abnormal brain enlargement. But, do these brain differences really matter? An overarching goal of the proposed research is to determine whether identified neural phenotypes persist into middle childhood and are associated with the quality and severity of core and co-morbid behavioral impairments. A unifying hypothesis is that different morphometric patterns will be associated with clinical features and with the quality of behavioral outcome. We are particularly interested in whether there are different patterns of brain organization that may predict optimal behavioral outcomes in ASD. Using recently developed behavioral modification procedures that yield high quality MRI images from children at all severity levels of ASD, we propose to obtain an additional MRI time point and conduct extensive behavioral assessment of children enrolled in the APP when they reach 9-11 years of age. Based on previous return rates, we estimate that 195 children will participate. We will also recruit 100 new subjects into the APP program. This research would allow an unprecedented exploration of the relationship between brain development, behavioral abnormalities, and cognitive and functional outcome in children transitioning from early to middle childhood. We propose: 1. To evaluate brain and behavioral consequences of three patterns of early amygdala growth; 2. To evaluate brain and behavioral consequences of abnormal brain enlargement in early childhood; and 3. To identify a pattern of brain organization that is associated with optimal behavioral outcome. These projects are consistent with Objectives 1 and 2 of the NIMH Strategic plan and address the 2009 IACC Strategic Plan crosscutting themes of Heterogeneity and Lifespan Perspective. They also contribute to the still unmet research opportunity for ""Multi-disciplinary, longitudinal, biobehavioral studies of children, youths, and adults beginning during infancy that characterize neurodevelopmental and medical developmental trajectories across the multiple axes of ASD phenotype..."". An important goal is to identify children who will need additional or specialized help to achieve the highest quality of life.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: By studying nearly 300 children in the MIND Institute's Autism Phenome Project on three occasions from 3 to 6 years of age, we have discovered that children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have various altered patterns of brain development. The current application seeks funding to bring the children back for another visit when they are 9-11 years old to see if certain patterns of brain development are useful in predicting which children have more serious symptoms of ASD, have higher levels of cognitive and emotional problems or, conversely, have optimal behavioral outcomes. One important goal is to find those children who will need additional or specialized help in order to achieve the highest quality of life.            ",Neurophenotypic Trajectories and Behavioral Outcomes in Autism Spectrum Disorder,8888079,R01MH103371,"['11 year old', '6 year old', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age-Years', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anxiety', 'Atlases', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Back', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Body Size', 'Brain', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Emotional', 'Enrollment', 'Epilepsy', 'Fright', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Literature', 'Longevity', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Medical', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Mutation', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Procedures', 'Quality of life', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Risk Factors', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Visit', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'behavioral impairment', 'behavioral outcome', 'biobehavior', 'brain size', 'cognitive function', 'disability', 'disorder risk', 'early childhood', 'functional outcomes', 'gastrointestinal', 'infancy', 'interest', 'phenome', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'social', 'social communication']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R01,2015,770599,0.20038987505392467
"Neural Correlates of Biological Motion Perception in Children with ASD ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mentored Career Development Award for Frederick Shic, Ph.D. This application will support my development as a scientist, giving me the tools necessary to advance as an independent investigator. For the last 9 years, I have been invested in understanding the early visual social-cognitive processes of infants and toddlers with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). I have developed new technologies and new approaches for analyzing eye-tracking data, drawing heavily on my experiences as a software developer and engineer. I have conducted several studies of atypical visual social cognition in ASD, charting early developmental trajectories of the disorder and offering new perspectives on the nature of information processing atypicalities in ASD. I bring a unique toolset and perspective to the field of autism research. I am currently building a lab centered on developing new, consumer- ready technologies that translate theoretical mechanisms of change and laboratory findings into clinically- meaningful tools for individuals with ASD. At the moment, the development of new technologies for helping children with ASD is progressing incredibly rapidly. Countless software applications, tools, and techniques have been proposed, and the breadth and pace of these new developments is breathtaking. My goal is to ground these new developments in an approach that leverages a rich understanding of developmental theory, brain development, and behavior. Although I have experience studying behavior, I will benefit from more directed and concerted instruction; to become an expert in developmental theory and methods for the study of brain development, I will need a specific, comprehensive program of guided education as well as hands-on learning opportunities. Combining an understanding of developmental cognitive neuroscience with technology development will result in a more theoretically complete picture of the processes of change and will accelerate methods for developing and refining new technologies. This approach will make me an extremely unique investigator in the field of autism research, allowing me to use my talents and abilities to discover more about the fundamental nature of atypical developmental processes in ASD and to develop new technologies to effect positive change in individuals affected by the disorder. To this end, I am seeking to deepen and broaden my understanding of 3 fields: (a) developmental cognitive neuroscience and neuroimaging; (b) clinical/behavioral aspects of the developmental psychopathology of autism; and (c) statistical methods for combining and modeling complex data streams. In a keystone research experience, I propose to combine my expertise in eye tracking with functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), a neuroimaging technique applicable to individuals with ASD from infancy to adulthood and which targets the same underlying dynamic processes as the standard-of-field neuroimaging technique, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). In my proposal, I will examine neural correlates of emotional biological motion processing in toddlers and children with ASD (N = 30) as compared to typically developing (TD; N = 30) and developmentally delayed (DD; N = 20) toddlers and children.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This longitudinal study uses functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and eye tracking to examine atypical neural and behavioral responses in toddlers and young children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) presented with point light displays of emotional biological motion. This study will deepen our understanding of the fundamental nature of deficits in ASD by highlighting deficits in basic social-emotional information processing, and may lead to the discovery of new markers for the disorder and new methodologies for parsing the vast behavioral and clinical heterogeneity of ASD.            ",Neural Correlates of Biological Motion Perception in Children with ASD,8891837,K01MH104739,"['3 year old', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age-Months', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Arousal', 'Attention', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Developmental Process', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Education', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Eye', 'Face', 'Fractals', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Fusiform gyrus', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Instruction', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratory Finding', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Motion Perception', 'Movement', 'Nature', 'Near-Infrared Spectroscopy', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Perception', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stream', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Structure of superior temporal sulcus', 'System', 'Talents', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Toddler', 'Translating', 'Visual', 'Work', 'animation', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'behavioral outcome', 'behavioral response', 'behavioral study', 'biobehavior', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cognitive process', 'cohort', 'collaborative environment', 'computer science', 'data mining', 'design', 'disorder control', 'emotional stimulus', 'experience', 'gaze', 'infancy', 'information processing', 'neural circuit', 'neural correlate', 'neurobehavioral', 'neuroimaging', 'new technology', 'novel marker', 'novel strategies', 'preference', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'social', 'social cognition', 'spatiotemporal', 'technology development', 'theories', 'tool']",NIMH,YALE UNIVERSITY,K01,2015,177012,0.21198989608965432
"Biomarkers of Developmental Trajectories and Treatment in ASD     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This is a renewal application for the UCLA Autism Center of Excellence. The primary focus of the UCLA ACE renewal is to understand the relationship between aberrant brain development and core deficits in autism by identifying mechanisms relating genes to brain structure/function and brain to behavior, and to develop effective interventions based on basic experimental and clinical research findings that will change outcomes in autism. In five interdependent projects and cores, our center builds on our expertise in autism genetics, multimodal brain imaging, early detection and analysis of core autism features, and experience in implementing randomized control trials of novel interventions that target these core symptoms. In this renewal application, projects focus on defining longitudinal trajectories of brain and behavioral development in infants with multiple risks for autism (Proj I); infants and toddlers with early signs of autism (Project II), nonverbal school age children with autism (Proj III), and higher functioning children/ adolescents (Project IV), using a shared set of imaging, neurophysiological and neurobehavioral biomarkers, as well as genetic risk and expression analysis (Proj V) in longitudinal studies. This center is focused on understanding both early and later trajectories of emerging and developing functional connectivity and behavioral change in relation to variation in autism phenotypes, defining how genetic risks mediate both imaging and behavioral phenotypes, and altering trajectories through two separate treatments focused on core deficits in ASD, one targeted developing joint attention and social orientation in infants, and one focused on improving language nonverbal children with augmentative pharmacological intervention. Four cores support the scientific goals: an Administrative Core, facilitating scientific progress and providing data management/statistics support; a Diagnostic and Phenotyping Core; a Neuroimaging/Neurophysiology core, and a Research Education and Outreach core. The UCLA ACE benefits from our years of working together as a team. We present a highly integrated center with multiple collaborations across levels of analysis to further a strongly translational research strategy aimed at changing outcomes in children with autism spectrum disorders.        RELEVANCE: This is a renewal application for the UCLA Autism Center of Excellence.

"Early Identification of ASD: Translating Eye Tracking into Practice DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Currently, parent report screening tools (e.g., M-CHAT, CSBS) are the only standardized screening options available to pediatricians for the early detection of autism. As demonstrated in our previous work (the 1-Year Well-Baby Check-Up Approach, Pierce et al., 2011), such screens have valuable strengths, but also weaknesses, including the impact of parent characteristics on how they rate their child's behavior and high false positive rates. Autism is a disorder that has its roots in abnormal early brain development, yet early identification rests largely in the hands of parent report measures, rather than in the domain of more objective, quantifiable behavior. To move beyond parent report as the only early screening choice, novel procedures for screening must be researched.  During our last grant cycle we developed a novel eye-tracking test, the Geometric Preference Test for Autism (GeoPref Test). This simple one-minute test shows dynamic, colorful geometric moving patterns on half of a computer monitor and colorful active people on the other half. Of >440 toddlers tested using standard eye tracking technology, almost every toddler who fixated at high rates on the geometric patterns was ASD, and not typical or developmentally delayed. Thus, our laboratory experiments demonstrated exceptionally high, 99%, specificity of the GeoPref Test for detecting ASD. A low false positive rate is essential in a screening tool because false positives overload the system and create anxiety. Equally important in this heterogeneous disorder, the 1-min test identified 37% of all ASD toddlers. This is a larger percentage than any other early genetic, proteomic, neuroimaging or neurobehavioral screen, and it is fast, easy, and highly ASD specific.  Aim 1 will identify methods to integrate ASD specific test into clinical practice as a 2nd tier screen for babies who fail a routine 1st tier pencil and paper screen (i.e., the CSBS). Results will greatly improve the accuracy of early detection and speed referral of babies for diagnostic and treatment services. Using a portable eye tracker, 39 pediatricians will give the GeoPref Test in their office to toddlers who fail the CSBS who will in turn be referred to our Center for blinded diagnosis. This will be the first translation of an eye tracking finding on ASD into real-world clinical practice. In an effort to fully understand the clinical phenotype of ASD toddlers that ""fail"" the GeoPref Test, Aim 2 will use novel experimental tests, such as a test of exploration, as well as standardized tests such as the Mullen, to identify clinical profiles tha distinguish these toddlers from others with an ASD. Although the GeoPref Test identifies a large subgroup of 37% of all ASD toddlers, equally fast, and accurate tests are needed to identify the remaining ASD toddlers. Aim 3 proposes to develop new eye tracking tests, specifically novel social orienting and motherese paradigms, to detect these toddlers. Random forest classification algorithms will identify eye gaze signatures that best identify subgroups of ASD toddlers. All toddlers will receive a final blinded diagnosis at 30-36 months. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  In order to move beyond paper-and-pencil parent reports as the only option for early autism screening, novel techniques must be researched. Here, for the first time, this grant will translate an eye tracking test which was found to be highly accurate in detecting ASD - the GeoPref Test - out of the laboratory and into pediatric offices. Moreover, additional novel eye tracking tests will be developed and relationships between how a toddler performs on a given eye tracking test will be examined in relation to various clinical measures such as how a toddler explores their environment; understanding the clinical-eye tracking relationships is central to discovering the many unique subgroups that likely make up the overall ASD phenotype.",Early Identification of ASD: Translating Eye Tracking into Practice,8852183,R01MH080134,"['Algorithms', 'Anxiety', 'Attention', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavior', 'Blinded', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Child Behavior', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Environment', 'Eye', 'Family', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Head circumference', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Infant', 'Laboratories', 'Language Tests', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Paper', 'Parents', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Plant Roots', 'Probability', 'Proteomics', 'ROC Curve', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Social Behavior', 'Specificity', 'Speech', 'Speed', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Work', 'base', 'checkup examination', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical practice', 'computer monitor', 'forest', 'gaze', 'improved', 'innovation', 'neurobehavioral', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'pediatrician', 'preference', 'research study', 'response', 'satisfaction', 'screening', 'social', 'sound', 'tool']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2015,373818,0.18802527643393763
"Clinical algorithm for identifying adult autism     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This R34 application seeks support to refine and test a clinical algorithm for identifying autism spectrum disorders (ASD) in adults receiving outpatient psychiatric care. Evidence suggests that adults with ASD are overrepresented and underdiagnosed among individuals receiving psychiatric care. Adults with ASD may be medicated for disorders they do not have with medications that are not effective for treating ASD. They also may benefit from ASD-specific interventions that they do not get because of inaccurate diagnosis. ASD diagnostic tools are lengthy, most are validated only in children, and they require considerable training to administer correctly. Therefore they are not feasible for use with adults in community mental health settings. To develop a screening strategy appropriate for this setting, we will build upon our prior work in inpatient settings by partnering with Horizon House, a large community mental health organization in Pennsylvania, to identify adults with ASD in their care. We then will refine and validate our algorithm for identifying ASD in adults presenting for psychiatric treatment. Our goal is to use items readily available to clinicians, in combination with a brief screening tool, to accurately identify ASD in adults in community mental health settings, which would then lead to further diagnostic assessment. The specific aims of the proposed study are to: 1) Estimate the prevalence of undiagnosed ASD in community outpatient  settings~ 2) Compare clinical characteristics,  treatment and assigned diagnoses of adults with ASD with those of adults with other psychiatric disorders~ and  3) Develop and test a brief tool for community mental health practice to screen for ASD in adults. To determine cases of ASD, Horizon House staff will complete the SRS and the Autism Spectrum Disorders in Adults Screening Questionnaire (a shorter instrument used in similar studies) for adult clients with whom they have in-person contact during a 6-month period (n H 2000). Researchers then will conduct, on a  sample  of 450 subjects stratified by SRS score: 1) chart reviews to extract information  using  a  checklist comprising the characteristics found to discriminate between adults with ASD and other psychiatric disorders in prior studies (developmental history, neurological problems, substance use and criminal activity~ Appendix B)~ 2) structured clinical interviews using the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule, Module 4, and the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM Disorders~ and 3) family interviews, using the Social Communication Questionnaire, semi-structured questions about early development, and the modified Family Interview for Genetic Studies. Case conferences will be conducted for all subjects to make a final determination of ASD. Once case status is determined, subjects with and without ASD will be compared on all variables using receiver operating characteristic curves and decision tree analyses to determine the most parsimonious creening strategies. If successful, the proposed study will provide the first US estimates of ASD in an outpatient population and will greatly enhance community clinicians' ability to identify adults with ASD.             PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This R34 application seeks support to refine and test a clinical algorithm for identifying autism spectrum disorders (ASD) in adults receiving outpatient psychiatric care.

"fcMRI in Infants at High Risk for Autism    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This ESI / New Investigator clinician-scientist brings an expert team to test the altered brain functional connectivity hypothesis of autism during infancy. We will conduct graph-theory-based network analyses on functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging (fcMRI) data acquired in high-risk infants who are currently being studied in the multi-site, NIH-funded Autism Center of Excellence (ACE) study R01 HD055741: A Longitudinal MRI Study of Infants at Risk for Autism - Joseph Piven: PI. We will prospectively study diverging developmental trajectories for functional networks of brain regions in infants who do and do not develop an Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD), during a suspected period of altered brain growth in autism, and prior to symptom expression. All four ACE data collection sites and their existing Data Coordination Center will participate. These efforts will provide longitudinal fcMRI data (scans at 6, 12, and 24 months old) in up to 664 high-risk and control infants (~15% of the 544 high-risk infants will develop an ASD). All four ACE data collection sites are already (as of May, 2010) - in advance of any dedicated funding, to ensure enough fcMRI data - acquiring fcMRI data on their subjects. Interfacing with the high-risk infant ACE structural imaging study and its supplements will allow us to build on existing infrastructure, save effort and cost, standardize collections, and merge databases. It also provides the potential for future genetic-functional imaging associations. Our fcMRI approach considers the problem of autism from the perspective of alterations in the behavior of brain-wide networks and changes in strengths of functional connectivity between and within rigorously defined sub-networks of brain regions. We believe this approach is more fruitful than those which consider smaller numbers of brain regions. We will additionally use a novel cortical functional areal parcellation routine (that Co-I Steve Petersen et al. have developed) to enhance the sensitivity of the infant fcMRI data analyses. Unique insights may come from comparing our network-based fcMRI analyses to the structural MRI, diffusion tensor imaging, and extensive phenotypic data generated by the existing ACE study (fcMRI acquired in the same infants). Once diagnoses are assigned in the ACE study, we will use a machine learning, multivariate pattern classification approach (Support Vector Machine: SVM) to explore the possibility of developing a diagnostic classifier for ASD. The eventual goal would be to train an SVM to predict which infants will and will not develop ASD, based on network properties of their fcMRI data, prior to the expression of symptoms. If successful, our proposed program of research could inform the future development of pre- symptomatic diagnostic tests for ASD, increase our knowledge about the neurobiology of autism, and provide methods for studying functional brain changes in response to interventions. These approaches could be adapted for the study of other neurodevelopmental and early-onset psychiatric disorders.        The proposed work is relevant to public health because autism is one of the most devastating psychiatric disorders of childhood, and disorders spanning the broader spectrum affect approximately 1/100 individuals. We propose to test the brain functional connectivity hypothesis of autism with functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging (fcMRI) in infants who are at high risk for autism. If successful, we may contribute to the eventual development of pre-symptomatic diagnostic tests for autism that will improve early identification, which is critical for enhancing outcome in affected individuals. More broadly, our proposed studies will also increase our knowledge about autism in ways that will complement future genetic, screening, and intervention studies.

"Characterizing mechanistic heterogeneity across ADHD and Autism     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Progress in establishing the etiology of psychiatric illness is limited by the absence of objective biological measures able to detect and discriminate between disorders. This problem is particularly important in developmental disorders, where early identification could eventually assist in prevention of lifelong impairments. The two earlies onsets, most common and costly developmental disorders in child psychiatry are attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and Autism spectrum disorders (ASD). A recent 2011 study, surveying the years 1997-2008, has now verified that 1 in 6 children have a developmental disability, a 17% increase over the past decade driven largely by increases in ASD and ADHD. These developments highlight the need for innovative approaches to address the underlying cause of these disorders. It is likely that the clinical heterogeneity and the imprecise nature of their nosological distinctions represent fundamentally confounding factors limiting a better understanding of their etiology, prevention, and treatment.  Interestingly, an emerging observation regarding brain imaging in ASD and ADHD is that they often have the same atypical functional brain signatures. However, because these two syndromes are almost exclusively studied separately, it is difficult to determine atypical brain function that is common compared to what is distinct for each disorder. If we are to improve our understanding regarding the underlying etiology of these disorders, it will be necessary to study these populations simultaneously. With that said, simply comparing groups of children based on their DSM diagnosis is unlikely to suffice. The behavioral and biological heterogeneity within each syndrome further complicates the meaning of any given group difference found in brain imaging. Thus, progress in our understanding requires not only examining these disorders in the same studies, but also identifying how brain signatures relate to distinct behavioral components (i.e., endophenotypes) that span the syndromes.  Under this context, and consistent with NIMH's new strategic plan, Strategy 1.4 (also see RDoC), the current proposal aims to use resting state functional connectivity MRI (rs-fcMRI) and structural connectivity (DTI) to identify brain signatures that correspond to fundamental behavioral components (executive, facial recognition, and affect recognition) found in ADHD and/or ASD. We also aim to develop integrated, multimodal sub-classifications (i.e. neurotypes) or ""biosignatures"" of these disorders with computational tools that include Graph Theory and support vector machine (SVM) based pattern classification. The potential impact of the proposed mechanistic categorization on future functional, genetic, treatment, and other translational studies of ADHD and ASD are substantial.          The proposed study uses relatively new and advanced imaging techniques (i.e. resting-state functional connectivity MRI, and diffusion tensor imaging), along with computational tools (i.e. Graph theory and pattern classification) to identify atypical brain physiology that is unique and shared across ADHD and Autism.

"Characterizing mechanistic heterogeneity across ADHD and Autism DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Progress in establishing the etiology of psychiatric illness is limited by the absence of objective biological measures able to detect and discriminate between disorders. This problem is particularly important in developmental disorders, where early identification could eventually assist in prevention of lifelong impairments. The two earlies onsets, most common and costly developmental disorders in child psychiatry are attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and Autism spectrum disorders (ASD). A recent 2011 study, surveying the years 1997-2008, has now verified that 1 in 6 children have a developmental disability, a 17% increase over the past decade driven largely by increases in ASD and ADHD. These developments highlight the need for innovative approaches to address the underlying cause of these disorders. It is likely that the clinical heterogeneity and the imprecise nature of their nosological distinctions represent fundamentally confounding factors limiting a better understanding of their etiology, prevention, and treatment.  Interestingly, an emerging observation regarding brain imaging in ASD and ADHD is that they often have the same atypical functional brain signatures. However, because these two syndromes are almost exclusively studied separately, it is difficult to determine atypical brain function that is common compared to what is distinct for each disorder. If we are to improve our understanding regarding the underlying etiology of these disorders, it will be necessary to study these populations simultaneously. With that said, simply comparing groups of children based on their DSM diagnosis is unlikely to suffice. The behavioral and biological heterogeneity within each syndrome further complicates the meaning of any given group difference found in brain imaging. Thus, progress in our understanding requires not only examining these disorders in the same studies, but also identifying how brain signatures relate to distinct behavioral components (i.e., endophenotypes) that span the syndromes.  Under this context, and consistent with NIMH's new strategic plan, Strategy 1.4 (also see RDoC), the current proposal aims to use resting state functional connectivity MRI (rs-fcMRI) and structural connectivity (DTI) to identify brain signatures that correspond to fundamental behavioral components (executive, facial recognition, and affect recognition) found in ADHD and/or ASD. We also aim to develop integrated, multimodal sub-classifications (i.e. neurotypes) or ""biosignatures"" of these disorders with computational tools that include Graph Theory and support vector machine (SVM) based pattern classification. The potential impact of the proposed mechanistic categorization on future functional, genetic, treatment, and other translational studies of ADHD and ASD are substantial. The proposed study uses relatively new and advanced imaging techniques (i.e. resting-state functional connectivity MRI, and diffusion tensor imaging), along with computational tools (i.e. Graph theory and pattern classification) to identify atypical brain physiology that is unique and shared across ADHD and Autism. The work will also advance new approaches and methods to classify these disorders based on specific behavioral and neurobiological measures. The result from this study will advance our knowledge regarding the neurobiological underpinnings of ADHD and Autism, and assist in the improved characterization of homogeneous subtypes of future genetic, functional, and therapeutic investigations.",Characterizing mechanistic heterogeneity across ADHD and Autism,8895177,R01MH096773,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Ants', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Bilateral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Child', 'Child Psychiatry', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Corpus Callosum', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Developmental Disabilities', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Early identification', 'Etiology', 'Face', 'Fusiform gyrus', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Graph', 'Heterogeneity', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impairment', 'Impulsivity', 'Inferior', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Nature', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Output', 'Parietal', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physiology', 'Population Study', 'Prevention', 'Psychometrics', 'Rest', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Speed', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Structure of superior temporal sulcus', 'Surveys', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'Work', 'Youth', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'biosignature', 'computerized tools', 'developmental disease', 'early onset', 'endophenotype', 'executive function', 'improved', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'innovation', 'novel strategies', 'response', 'theories', 'translational study']",NIMH,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2014,140305,0.1433526346983921
"Quantifiable markers of ASD via multivariate MEG-DTI combination     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Research  in  ASD  has  aimed  at  identifying  brain  level  endophenotypes  or  univariate  biomarkers  associated  with  the  different  subtypes  of  ASD  using  different  imaging  modalities.    DTI-based  studies  have provided insights into pathology-induced and neuro-developmental changes in white matter (WM)  architecture  and  structural  connectivity  for  ASD,  and  the  neurobiological  basis  for  neuronal  deficits  associated  with  ASD.  Specific  symptoms  such  as  LI  are  also  being  investigated  via  MEG  derived  temporal signatures based on evoked neuromagnetic activity during speech perception, processing and  cognition. Encouraged by the fact that DTI and MEG studies have individually been able to characterize  different aspects of ASD and some of its related symptoms like LI, in this proposal we aim at combining  the  MEG-based  temporal  signatures  with  the  DTI-based  structural  connectivity  signatures  to  create  a  multi-parametric  spatio temporal  signature  of  ASD  using  pattern  classification.  Creating  joint  multivariate signatures for an ASD population is rendered challenging by high heterogeneity imposed  by disease and development~ manifest as various subtle subtypes possibly associated with differential  neuronal deficits and the presence of datasets with missing modalities due to the inability of the subject  in completing both diffusion and electrophysiology protocols. In this proposal, we aim to address these  challenges, by creating quantifiable multi-parametric spatio-temporal markers of autism learnt from the  underlying pathology patterns of the population, by combining the MEG-based temporal signatures with  the DTI-based structural connectivity signatures using pattern classifiers created on an ASD population  with LI. We identify spatio-temporally compatible DTI- MEG features (aim 1) and create various multi- parametric pattern classifiers that will quantify ASD pathology by learning the population heterogeneity  despite partially missing data (aim 2). Via the application in aim 3, to an ASD population with LI as one  of  the  sources  of  heterogeneity,  we  will  have  created  classifiers  that  will  elucidate  he  importance  of  combination  diffusion  and  MEG  information,  identify  the  regional  and  connectivity  combinations  that  best  characterize  ASD,  and  provide  abnormality  scores  associated  with  each  subject  that  can  aid  in  quantifying  the  likelihood  of  impairment,  thereby  enriching  diagnosis  decisions.  The  classifiers  that  embrace  population  heterogeneity  and  missing  data  will  be  generic  and  flexible  in  applicability  to  any  population, as these can be easily retrained with new MEG and DTI features, and will aid future studies  that wish to incorporate spatio-temporal information.             PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This  project  aims  at  developing  multivariate  spatio-temporal  imaging  signatures  that  will  produce  quantitative markers of Autism Spectrum Disorder by integrating spatial features from diffusion tensor  imaging  (DTI)  and  temporal  features  from  MEG  (Magnetoencephalography).  These  markers  will  provide an abnormality score for each subject by learning the underlying pattern of pathology which  can be used as an additional measure to quantify pathology thereby aiding in diagnosis, prognosis,   and  identify  modalities  and  regional  brain  patterns  that  best  contribute  to  the  understanding  of  the disorder.              ",Quantifiable markers of ASD via multivariate MEG-DTI combination,8679003,R21MH098010,"['Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anisotropy', 'Architecture', 'Atlases', 'Auditory', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Beds', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Future', 'Generic Drugs', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetoencephalography', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Nodal', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Sample Size', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Simulate', 'Social Interaction', 'Source', 'Speech Perception', 'Stimulus', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamencephalon', 'Time', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'design', 'developmental disease', 'endophenotype', 'flexibility', 'imaging modality', 'insight', 'morphometry', 'neuropsychiatry', 'neuropsychological', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'prognostic', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensor', 'vector', 'white matter']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R21,2014,202233,0.16337589772929217
"Neural Predictors of Language Function After Intervention in Children with Autism    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) are a phenotypically heterogeneous group of neurodevelopmental disorders being diagnosed at growing rates in toddlers and young children, with prevalence estimates of 1%. Many children have limited expressive language at the time of diagnosis, and only 50% make significant gains in communication, even with intensive interventions. Unfortunately, intervention studies in ASD have struggled to reliably predict language gain, and, importantly, to differentiate pre-verbal from non-verbal children. One major limitation is the reliance on standardized behavioral assessments, which only capture overt behaviors. Innovative methodology is needed to better characterize the neural correlates of cognitive and perceptual domains important for language acquisition and to apply these methods to inform intervention studies. Such knowledge will allow us to design and apply more effective, targeted interventions for children with ASD based on baseline phenotypes. This study proposes to apply electrophysiological measures to better characterize the neural correlates of two cognitive domains essential for language acquisition: joint attention and statistical learning, along with resting state EEG power, in young children with ASD prior to entry into an intensive behavioral intervention and then after completion of the intervention, in order to determine if specific electrophysiological profiles can predict language acquisition and gain. Combined with the activities outlined in the training plan, this research proposal represents a timely effort to apply translational methods to behavioral intervention studies in order to enrich the conventional predictors of outcome in ASD. The principle unifying this study is that a better understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying the behavioral and cognitive deficits in ASD will inform predictors of treatment response, which, in turn, will facilitate the development of more targeted interventions for these children. This study is in line with objective 1 (strategy 1.3) and objective 3 (strategy 3.1) of the NIMH strategic plan. Specifically, to (1) ""identify and integrate biological markers (biomarkers) and behavioral indicators associated with mental disorders,"" and to (2) ""further develop innovative interventions and designs for intervention studies."" !        Language impairment is very common in children with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD), with 50% remaining non-verbal even with intensive treatments. Clinicians struggle to predict which children will actually make gains in language at the time of a child's diagnosis, largely because of the limitations of standardized testing to characterize these children. This study proposes to couple behavioral testing with advanced electrophysiology to predict language outcomes after treatment in children with ASD. This study has the potential to improve our ability to predict language outcomes which, in turn, will allow clinicians to make more informed treatment recommendations and to provide more detailed prognostic information to patients and their families.

"Phenotypic Characterization of Gene Disrupting Mutations in ASD     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a genetically and phenotypically heterogeneous disorder. Efforts to identifying subtypes based on the behavioral and neural phenotypes have been unsuccessful, and the rarity of specific genetic events renders subtyping at the CNV or exonic mutation level challenging and exceedingly resource-intensive. However, exploring the impact of gene disruptions in common pathways holds promise for elucidating phenotypic subtypes and clarifying genotype-phenotype relations in ASD. Most importantly, the identification of pathway-based subtypes will advance translational goals of selecting interventions, defining treatment targets, and predicting outcomes. The current project aims to investigate the behavioral and neural phenotype, obtained through electroencephalography (EEG), in pre-identified individuals with ASD with gene mutations in the beta-catenin pathway. This project addresses the critical need to understand the pathogenesis of ASD by elucidating the relationship between ASD risk genes, brain function and behavior and the need to address the wide heterogeneity in ASD by careful subtype identification. We will include 60 participants with ASD with gene mutations in the beta-catenin pathway, 60 participants with ASD with gene disruptions falling in other pathways, and 60 participants with ASD without any identified CNVs or gene disrupting mutations along with 30 typical individuals. Given the role of beta-catenin in neuronal adhesion, synapse formation, and in the transcription of target genes linked to cell growth, differentiation, and migration, as well as preliminary evidence of behavioral disruptions in learning and memory, evidence of dysfunction of beta-catenin may be observed at both the behavioral and neurophysiological level. Electrophysiological measures will allow us to specifically address the brain systems related to learning and memory as well as those related to the core features of autism. This research holds promise for discovery of gene-brain-behavior relationships, attained through integration of genotypic, EEG, and behavioral data.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a genetically and phenotypically heterogeneous disorder.

"Biomarkers of Developmental Trajectories and Treatment in ASD     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This is a renewal application for the UCLA Autism Center of Excellence. The primary focus of the UCLA ACE renewal is to understand the relationship between aberrant brain development and core deficits in autism by identifying mechanisms relating genes to brain structure/function and brain to behavior, and to develop effective interventions based on basic experimental and clinical research findings that will change outcomes in autism. In five interdependent projects and cores, our center builds on our expertise in autism genetics, multimodal brain imaging, early detection and analysis of core autism features, and experience in implementing randomized control trials of novel interventions that target these core symptoms. In this renewal application, projects focus on defining longitudinal trajectories of brain and behavioral development in infants with multiple risks for autism (Proj I); infants and toddlers with early signs of autism (Project II), nonverbal school age children with autism (Proj III), and higher functioning children/ adolescents (Project IV), using a shared set of imaging, neurophysiological and neurobehavioral biomarkers, as well as genetic risk and expression analysis (Proj V) in longitudinal studies. This center is focused on understanding both early and later trajectories of emerging and developing functional connectivity and behavioral change in relation to variation in autism phenotypes, defining how genetic risks mediate both imaging and behavioral phenotypes, and altering trajectories through two separate treatments focused on core deficits in ASD, one targeted developing joint attention and social orientation in infants, and one focused on improving language nonverbal children with augmentative pharmacological intervention. Four cores support the scientific goals: an Administrative Core, facilitating scientific progress and providing data management/statistics support; a Diagnostic and Phenotyping Core; a Neuroimaging/Neurophysiology core, and a Research Education and Outreach core. The UCLA ACE benefits from our years of working together as a team.

"Early Identification of ASD: Translating Eye Tracking into Practice     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Currently, parent report screening tools (e.g., M-CHAT, CSBS) are the only standardized screening options available to pediatricians for the early detection of autism. As demonstrated in our previous work (the 1-Year Well-Baby Check-Up Approach, Pierce et al., 2011), such screens have valuable strengths, but also weaknesses, including the impact of parent characteristics on how they rate their child's behavior and high false positive rates. Autism is a disorder that has its roots in abnormal early brain development, yet early identification rests largely in the hands of parent report measures, rather than in the domain of more objective, quantifiable behavior. To move beyond parent report as the only early screening choice, novel procedures for screening must be researched.  During our last grant cycle we developed a novel eye-tracking test, the Geometric Preference Test for Autism (GeoPref Test). This simple one-minute test shows dynamic, colorful geometric moving patterns on half of a computer monitor and colorful active people on the other half. Of >440 toddlers tested using standard eye tracking technology, almost every toddler who fixated at high rates on the geometric patterns was ASD, and not typical or developmentally delayed. Thus, our laboratory experiments demonstrated exceptionally high, 99%, specificity of the GeoPref Test for detecting ASD. A low false positive rate is essential in a screening tool because false positives overload the system and create anxiety. Equally important in this heterogeneous disorder, the 1-min test identified 37% of all ASD toddlers. This is a larger percentage than any other early genetic, proteomic, neuroimaging or neurobehavioral screen, and it is fast, easy, and highly ASD specific.  Aim 1 will identify methods to integrate ASD specific test into clinical practice as a 2nd tier screen for babies who fail a routine 1st tier pencil and paper screen (i.e., the CSBS). Results will greatly improve the accuracy of early detection and speed referral of babies for diagnostic and treatment services. Using a portable eye tracker, 39 pediatricians will give the GeoPref Test in their office to toddlers who fail the CSBS who will in turn be referred to our Center for blinded diagnosis. This will be the first translation of an eye tracking finding on ASD into real-world clinical practice. In an effort to fully understand the clinical phenotype of ASD toddlers that ""fail"" the GeoPref Test, Aim 2 will use novel experimental tests, such as a test of exploration, as well as standardized tests such as the Mullen, to identify clinical profiles tha distinguish these toddlers from others with an ASD. Although the GeoPref Test identifies a large subgroup of 37% of all ASD toddlers, equally fast, and accurate tests are needed to identify the remaining ASD toddlers. Aim 3 proposes to develop new eye tracking tests, specifically novel social orienting and motherese paradigms, to detect these toddlers. Random forest classification algorithms will identify eye gaze signatures that best identify subgroups of ASD toddlers. All toddlers will receive a final blinded diagnosis at 30-36 months.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  In order to move beyond paper-and-pencil parent reports as the only option for early autism screening, novel techniques must be researched. Here, for the first time, this grant will translate an eye tracking test which was found to be highly accurate in detecting ASD - the GeoPref Test - out of the laboratory and into pediatric offices. Moreover, additional novel eye tracking tests will be developed and relationships between how a toddler performs on a given eye tracking test will be examined in relation to various clinical measures such as how a toddler explores their environment; understanding the clinical-eye tracking relationships is central to discovering the many unique subgroups that likely make up the overall ASD phenotype.",Early Identification of ASD: Translating Eye Tracking into Practice,8723296,R01MH080134,"['Algorithms', 'Anxiety', 'Attention', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavior', 'Blinded', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Child Behavior', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Environment', 'Eye', 'Family', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Head circumference', 'Heterogeneity', 'Infant', 'Laboratories', 'Language Tests', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Paper', 'Parents', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Plant Roots', 'Probability', 'Proteomics', 'ROC Curve', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Social Behavior', 'Specificity', 'Speech', 'Speed', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Work', 'base', 'checkup examination', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical practice', 'computer monitor', 'forest', 'gaze', 'improved', 'innovation', 'neurobehavioral', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'pediatrician', 'preference', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'response', 'satisfaction', 'screening', 'social', 'sound', 'tool']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2014,375283,0.18802527643393763
"Clinical algorithm for identifying adult autism     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This R34 application seeks support to refine and test a clinical algorithm for identifying autism spectrum disorders (ASD) in adults receiving outpatient psychiatric care. Evidence suggests that adults with ASD are overrepresented and underdiagnosed among individuals receiving psychiatric care. Adults with ASD may be medicated for disorders they do not have with medications that are not effective for treating ASD. They also may benefit from ASD-specific interventions that they do not get because of inaccurate diagnosis. ASD diagnostic tools are lengthy, most are validated only in children, and they require considerable training to administer correctly. Therefore they are not feasible for use with adults in community mental health settings. To develop a screening strategy appropriate for this setting, we will build upon our prior work in inpatient settings by partnering with Horizon House, a large community mental health organization in Pennsylvania, to identify adults with ASD in their care. We then will refine and validate our algorithm for identifying ASD in adults presenting for psychiatric treatment. Our goal is to use items readily available to clinicians, in combination with a brief screening tool, to accurately identify ASD in adults in community mental health settings, which would then lead to further diagnostic assessment. The specific aims of the proposed study are to: 1) Estimate the prevalence of undiagnosed ASD in community outpatient  settings~ 2) Compare clinical characteristics,  treatment and assigned diagnoses of adults with ASD with those of adults with other psychiatric disorders~ and  3) Develop and test a brief tool for community mental health practice to screen for ASD in adults. To determine cases of ASD, Horizon House staff will complete the SRS and the Autism Spectrum Disorders in Adults Screening Questionnaire (a shorter instrument used in similar studies) for adult clients with whom they have in-person contact during a 6-month period (n H 2000). Researchers then will conduct, on a  sample  of 450 subjects stratified by SRS score: 1) chart reviews to extract information  using  a  checklist comprising the characteristics found to discriminate between adults with ASD and other psychiatric disorders in prior studies (developmental history, neurological problems, substance use and criminal activity~ Appendix B)~ 2) structured clinical interviews using the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule, Module 4, and the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM Disorders~ and 3) family interviews, using the Social Communication Questionnaire, semi-structured questions about early development, and the modified Family Interview for Genetic Studies. Case conferences will be conducted for all subjects to make a final determination of ASD. Once case status is determined, subjects with and without ASD will be compared on all variables using receiver operating characteristic curves and decision tree analyses to determine the most parsimonious creening strategies. If successful, the proposed study will provide the first US estimates of ASD in an outpatient population and will greatly enhance community clinicians' ability to identify adults with ASD.             PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This R34 application seeks support to refine and test a clinical algorithm for identifying autism spectrum disorders (ASD) in adults receiving outpatient psychiatric care.

"fcMRI in Infants at High Risk for Autism    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This ESI / New Investigator clinician-scientist brings an expert team to test the altered brain functional connectivity hypothesis of autism during infancy. We will conduct graph-theory-based network analyses on functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging (fcMRI) data acquired in high-risk infants who are currently being studied in the multi-site, NIH-funded Autism Center of Excellence (ACE) study R01 HD055741: A Longitudinal MRI Study of Infants at Risk for Autism - Joseph Piven: PI. We will prospectively study diverging developmental trajectories for functional networks of brain regions in infants who do and do not develop an Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD), during a suspected period of altered brain growth in autism, and prior to symptom expression. All four ACE data collection sites and their existing Data Coordination Center will participate. These efforts will provide longitudinal fcMRI data (scans at 6, 12, and 24 months old) in up to 664 high-risk and control infants (~15% of the 544 high-risk infants will develop an ASD). All four ACE data collection sites are already (as of May, 2010) - in advance of any dedicated funding, to ensure enough fcMRI data - acquiring fcMRI data on their subjects. Interfacing with the high-risk infant ACE structural imaging study and its supplements will allow us to build on existing infrastructure, save effort and cost, standardize collections, and merge databases. It also provides the potential for future genetic-functional imaging associations. Our fcMRI approach considers the problem of autism from the perspective of alterations in the behavior of brain-wide networks and changes in strengths of functional connectivity between and within rigorously defined sub-networks of brain regions. We believe this approach is more fruitful than those which consider smaller numbers of brain regions. We will additionally use a novel cortical functional areal parcellation routine (that Co-I Steve Petersen et al. have developed) to enhance the sensitivity of the infant fcMRI data analyses. Unique insights may come from comparing our network-based fcMRI analyses to the structural MRI, diffusion tensor imaging, and extensive phenotypic data generated by the existing ACE study (fcMRI acquired in the same infants). Once diagnoses are assigned in the ACE study, we will use a machine learning, multivariate pattern classification approach (Support Vector Machine: SVM) to explore the possibility of developing a diagnostic classifier for ASD. The eventual goal would be to train an SVM to predict which infants will and will not develop ASD, based on network properties of their fcMRI data, prior to the expression of symptoms. If successful, our proposed program of research could inform the future development of pre- symptomatic diagnostic tests for ASD, increase our knowledge about the neurobiology of autism, and provide methods for studying functional brain changes in response to interventions. These approaches could be adapted for the study of other neurodevelopmental and early-onset psychiatric disorders.        The proposed work is relevant to public health because autism is one of the most devastating psychiatric disorders of childhood, and disorders spanning the broader spectrum affect approximately 1/100 individuals. We propose to test the brain functional connectivity hypothesis of autism with functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging (fcMRI) in infants who are at high risk for autism. If successful, we may contribute to the eventual development of pre-symptomatic diagnostic tests for autism that will improve early identification, which is critical for enhancing outcome in affected individuals. More broadly, our proposed studies will also increase our knowledge about autism in ways that will complement future genetic, screening, and intervention studies.

"Characterizing mechanistic heterogeneity across ADHD and Autism     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Progress in establishing the etiology of psychiatric illness is limited by the absence of objective biological measures able to detect and discriminate between disorders. This problem is particularly important in developmental disorders, where early identification could eventually assist in prevention of lifelong impairments. The two earlies onsets, most common and costly developmental disorders in child psychiatry are attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and Autism spectrum disorders (ASD). A recent 2011 study, surveying the years 1997-2008, has now verified that 1 in 6 children have a developmental disability, a 17% increase over the past decade driven largely by increases in ASD and ADHD. These developments highlight the need for innovative approaches to address the underlying cause of these disorders. It is likely that the clinical heterogeneity and the imprecise nature of their nosological distinctions represent fundamentally confounding factors limiting a better understanding of their etiology, prevention, and treatment.  Interestingly, an emerging observation regarding brain imaging in ASD and ADHD is that they often have the same atypical functional brain signatures. However, because these two syndromes are almost exclusively studied separately, it is difficult to determine atypical brain function that is common compared to what is distinct for each disorder. If we are to improve our understanding regarding the underlying etiology of these disorders, it will be necessary to study these populations simultaneously. With that said, simply comparing groups of children based on their DSM diagnosis is unlikely to suffice. The behavioral and biological heterogeneity within each syndrome further complicates the meaning of any given group difference found in brain imaging. Thus, progress in our understanding requires not only examining these disorders in the same studies, but also identifying how brain signatures relate to distinct behavioral components (i.e., endophenotypes) that span the syndromes.  Under this context, and consistent with NIMH's new strategic plan, Strategy 1.4 (also see RDoC), the current proposal aims to use resting state functional connectivity MRI (rs-fcMRI) and structural connectivity (DTI) to identify brain signatures that correspond to fundamental behavioral components (executive, facial recognition, and affect recognition) found in ADHD and/or ASD. We also aim to develop integrated, multimodal sub-classifications (i.e. neurotypes) or ""biosignatures"" of these disorders with computational tools that include Graph Theory and support vector machine (SVM) based pattern classification. The potential impact of the proposed mechanistic categorization on future functional, genetic, treatment, and other translational studies of ADHD and ASD are substantial.          The proposed study uses relatively new and advanced imaging techniques (i.e. resting-state functional connectivity MRI, and diffusion tensor imaging), along with computational tools (i.e. Graph theory and pattern classification) to identify atypical brain physiology that is unique and shared across ADHD and Autism. The work will also advance new approaches and methods to classify these disorders based on specific behavioral and neurobiological measures. The result from this study will advance our knowledge regarding the neurobiological underpinnings of ADHD and Autism, and assist in the improved characterization of homogeneous subtypes of future genetic, functional, and therapeutic investigations.

"EEG Complexity Trajectory as an Early Biomarker for Autism    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): EEG Complexity as a Biomarker for Autism Spectrum Disorder Risk Personnel William Bosl (PI) Instructor, Children's Hospital Informatics Program (ChIP) Charles Nelson (collaborator) Professor, Harvard and Division of Developmental Medicine at CHB Helen Tager-Flusberg (consultant) Professor, Boston University Department of Psychology Abstract Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are complex, heritable disorders that have highly variable long-term outcomes. Research suggests that complex mental disorders such as autism are associated with abnormal brain connectivity that may vary between different regions and different scales [1]. In the autistic brain, high local connectivity and low long-range connectivity may develop concurrently due to problems with synapse pruning or formation [1, 2]. Estimation of changes in neural connectivity might be an effective diagnostic biomarker for abnormal connectivity development that leads to ASD behaviors. The electrical signals produced by neural networks contain information about the network structure [3-5]. Nonlinear signal processing algorithms [6, 7] can be used to compute features from the time series produced by the network to characterize the dynamics of a complex system such as the brain. Our hypothesis is that multiscale entropy (MSE) is one measure of signal complexity that will reveal distinct, measurable differences between normally developing brains and those that will eventually be diagnosed with an ASD. Machine learning algorithms will be used to classify infants into one of three groups using MSE values: controls (CON), high risk based on having an older sibling with autism, but does not develop autism (HRN) and high risk and develops autism (HRA). Rather than mapping to these three risk groups, MSE values will be mapped to a severity score based on Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) or equivalent assessments given to all infants in the study. Preliminary data using MSE to measure signal complexity shows a clear difference between normal controls and a group of infants at high risk for developing ASD based on family history (Bosl, et al., 2011). The change was particularly striking between 9 and 12 months of age when critical cognitive milestones are expected in normal infants. In the proposed study, we will also attempt to make predictions of outcome using MSE growth trajectories, with feature vectors composed of all values up to a specified age: 6-9, 6-12, 6-18 and 6-24 months. We hypothesize that the growth trajectories may be more informative than measures at one given age. To establish a baseline for comparison of predictions based on MSE, a similar prediction calculation using machine learning algorithms will be done with all available assessment scores, including ADOS, SCQ, Mullen and physiological measures such as head circumference. Even if a diagnosis of autism is not possible from assessment scores at one age before 18 months, it may be that the trajectory of assessment scores has predictive value. In all prediction computations, an estimate will be made of which variables contribute the most information to the prediction (whether EEG channels or assessment scores). Finally, correlations between MSE values and assessment scores will be determined in order to judge whether MSE measurements are proxies for assessment scores, or contribute complementary information, or neither. Early diagnosis and therapy are known to significantly improve the long-term prognosis of ASD patients. This project has the potential to enable early diagnosis of ASD, within the first year of life, and assess severity. If successful, this will also enable a new class of therapies aimed at averting the development of autistic brain functional tendencies before they are fully formed. The novel methodology developed here, using complex systems methods to extract signal features and machine learning to map MSE values, traditional scores and physical measurements to autism severity estimates, may be widely applicable as an approach for identifying quantitative biomarkers of other mental disorders. This may have particular value in resource poor regions where few professionals are available for complete behavioral assessments. PHS 398/2590 (Rev. 11/07) Page Continuation Format Page        Autism spectrum disorders are a complex and heterogeneous set of disorders that affect the developmental trajectory in several key behavioral domains including social, cognitive and language. The underlying brain dysfunction that results in the behavioral characteristics is not well understood. Because the proposed grant will leverage data from existing grants, it is uniquely positioned to explore novel diagnostic methods in a longitudinal study in a much shorter time than would normally be required. To our knowledge, our preliminary results are the first demonstration of the use of an information-theoretic value derived from EEG data, the multiscale entropy, as a biomarker for infants at risk for a complex neurodevelopmental disorder. The novel methodology developed here, using complex systems methods to extract signal features and the use of machine learning to discover patterns in signal features may not only enable early diagnosis of autism, but also provide a means of monitoring the effectiveness of early interventions.

"Quantifiable markers of ASD via multivariate MEG-DTI combination     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Research  in  ASD  has  aimed  at  identifying  brain  level  endophenotypes  or  univariate  biomarkers  associated  with  the  different  subtypes  of  ASD  using  different  imaging  modalities.    DTI-based  studies  have provided insights into pathology-induced and neuro-developmental changes in white matter (WM)  architecture  and  structural  connectivity  for  ASD,  and  the  neurobiological  basis  for  neuronal  deficits  associated  with  ASD.  Specific  symptoms  such  as  LI  are  also  being  investigated  via  MEG  derived  temporal signatures based on evoked neuromagnetic activity during speech perception, processing and  cognition. Encouraged by the fact that DTI and MEG studies have individually been able to characterize  different aspects of ASD and some of its related symptoms like LI, in this proposal we aim at combining  the  MEG-based  temporal  signatures  with  the  DTI-based  structural  connectivity  signatures  to  create  a  multi-parametric  spatio temporal  signature  of  ASD  using  pattern  classification.  Creating  joint  multivariate signatures for an ASD population is rendered challenging by high heterogeneity imposed  by disease and development~ manifest as various subtle subtypes possibly associated with differential  neuronal deficits and the presence of datasets with missing modalities due to the inability of the subject  in completing both diffusion and electrophysiology protocols. In this proposal, we aim to address these  challenges, by creating quantifiable multi-parametric spatio-temporal markers of autism learnt from the  underlying pathology patterns of the population, by combining the MEG-based temporal signatures with  the DTI-based structural connectivity signatures using pattern classifiers created on an ASD population  with LI. We identify spatio-temporally compatible DTI- MEG features (aim 1) and create various multi- parametric pattern classifiers that will quantify ASD pathology by learning the population heterogeneity  despite partially missing data (aim 2). Via the application in aim 3, to an ASD population with LI as one  of  the  sources  of  heterogeneity,  we  will  have  created  classifiers  that  will  elucidate  he  importance  of  combination  diffusion  and  MEG  information,  identify  the  regional  and  connectivity  combinations  that  best  characterize  ASD,  and  provide  abnormality  scores  associated  with  each  subject  that  can  aid  in  quantifying  the  likelihood  of  impairment,  thereby  enriching  diagnosis  decisions.  The  classifiers  that  embrace  population  heterogeneity  and  missing  data  will  be  generic  and  flexible  in  applicability  to  any  population, as these can be easily retrained with new MEG and DTI features, and will aid future studies  that wish to incorporate spatio-temporal information.             PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This  project  aims  at  developing  multivariate  spatio-temporal  imaging  signatures  that  will  produce  quantitative markers of Autism Spectrum Disorder by integrating spatial features from diffusion tensor  imaging  (DTI)  and  temporal  features  from  MEG  (Magnetoencephalography).  These  markers  will  provide an abnormality score for each subject by learning the underlying pattern of pathology which  can be used as an additional measure to quantify pathology thereby aiding in diagnosis, prognosis,   and  identify  modalities  and  regional  brain  patterns  that  best  contribute  to  the  understanding  of  the disorder.              ",Quantifiable markers of ASD via multivariate MEG-DTI combination,8517891,R21MH098010,"['Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anisotropy', 'Architecture', 'Atlases', 'Auditory', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Beds', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Future', 'Generic Drugs', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetoencephalography', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Nodal', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Sample Size', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Simulate', 'Social Interaction', 'Source', 'Speech Perception', 'Stimulus', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamencephalon', 'Time', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'design', 'developmental disease', 'endophenotype', 'flexibility', 'imaging modality', 'insight', 'morphometry', 'neuropsychiatry', 'neuropsychological', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'prognostic', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensor', 'vector', 'white matter']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R21,2013,257169,0.16337589772929217
"Neural Predictors of Language Function After Intervention in Children with Autism    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) are a phenotypically heterogeneous group of neurodevelopmental disorders being diagnosed at growing rates in toddlers and young children, with prevalence estimates of 1%. Many children have limited expressive language at the time of diagnosis, and only 50% make significant gains in communication, even with intensive interventions. Unfortunately, intervention studies in ASD have struggled to reliably predict language gain, and, importantly, to differentiate pre-verbal from non-verbal children. One major limitation is the reliance on standardized behavioral assessments, which only capture overt behaviors. Innovative methodology is needed to better characterize the neural correlates of cognitive and perceptual domains important for language acquisition and to apply these methods to inform intervention studies. Such knowledge will allow us to design and apply more effective, targeted interventions for children with ASD based on baseline phenotypes. This study proposes to apply electrophysiological measures to better characterize the neural correlates of two cognitive domains essential for language acquisition: joint attention and statistical learning, along with resting state EEG power, in young children with ASD prior to entry into an intensive behavioral intervention and then after completion of the intervention, in order to determine if specific electrophysiological profiles can predict language acquisition and gain. Combined with the activities outlined in the training plan, this research proposal represents a timely effort to apply translational methods to behavioral intervention studies in order to enrich the conventional predictors of outcome in ASD. The principle unifying this study is that a better understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying the behavioral and cognitive deficits in ASD will inform predictors of treatment response, which, in turn, will facilitate the development of more targeted interventions for these children. This study is in line with objective 1 (strategy 1.3) and objective 3 (strategy 3.1) of the NIMH strategic plan. Specifically, to (1) ""identify and integrate biological markers (biomarkers) and behavioral indicators associated with mental disorders,"" and to (2) ""further develop innovative interventions and designs for intervention studies."" !        Language impairment is very common in children with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD), with 50% remaining non-verbal even with intensive treatments. Clinicians struggle to predict which children will actually make gains in language at the time of a child's diagnosis, largely because of the limitations of standardized testing to characterize these children. This study proposes to couple behavioral testing with advanced electrophysiology to predict language outcomes after treatment in children with ASD. This study has the potential to improve our ability to predict language outcomes which, in turn, will allow clinicians to make more informed treatment recommendations and to provide more detailed prognostic information to patients and their families.

"Biomarkers of Developmental Trajectories and Treatment in ASD     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This is a renewal application for the UCLA Autism Center of Excellence. The primary focus of the UCLA ACE renewal is to understand the relationship between aberrant brain development and core deficits in autism by identifying mechanisms relating genes to brain structure/function and brain to behavior, and to develop effective interventions based on basic experimental and clinical research findings that will change outcomes in autism. In five interdependent projects and cores, our center builds on our expertise in autism genetics, multimodal brain imaging, early detection and analysis of core autism features, and experience in implementing randomized control trials of novel interventions that target these core symptoms. In this renewal application, projects focus on defining longitudinal trajectories of brain and behavioral development in infants with multiple risks for autism (Proj I); infants and toddlers with early signs of autism (Project II), nonverbal school age children with autism (Proj III), and higher functioning children/ adolescents (Project IV), using a shared set of imaging, neurophysiological and neurobehavioral biomarkers, as well as genetic risk and expression analysis (Proj V) in longitudinal studies. This center is focused on understanding both early and later trajectories of emerging and developing functional connectivity and behavioral change in relation to variation in autism phenotypes, defining how genetic risks mediate both imaging and behavioral phenotypes, and altering trajectories through two separate treatments focused on core deficits in ASD, one targeted developing joint attention and social orientation in infants, and one focused on improving language nonverbal children with augmentative pharmacological intervention. Four cores support the scientific goals: an Administrative Core, facilitating scientific progress and providing data management/statistics support; a Diagnostic and Phenotyping Core; a Neuroimaging/Neurophysiology core, and a Research Education and Outreach core. The UCLA ACE benefits from our years of working together as a team.

"Early Identification of ASD: Translating Eye Tracking into Practice     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Currently, parent report screening tools (e.g., M-CHAT, CSBS) are the only standardized screening options available to pediatricians for the early detection of autism. As demonstrated in our previous work (the 1-Year Well-Baby Check-Up Approach, Pierce et al., 2011), such screens have valuable strengths, but also weaknesses, including the impact of parent characteristics on how they rate their child's behavior and high false positive rates. Autism is a disorder that has its roots in abnormal early brain development, yet early identification rests largely in the hands of parent report measures, rather than in the domain of more objective, quantifiable behavior. To move beyond parent report as the only early screening choice, novel procedures for screening must be researched.  During our last grant cycle we developed a novel eye-tracking test, the Geometric Preference Test for Autism (GeoPref Test). This simple one-minute test shows dynamic, colorful geometric moving patterns on half of a computer monitor and colorful active people on the other half. Of >440 toddlers tested using standard eye tracking technology, almost every toddler who fixated at high rates on the geometric patterns was ASD, and not typical or developmentally delayed. Thus, our laboratory experiments demonstrated exceptionally high, 99%, specificity of the GeoPref Test for detecting ASD. A low false positive rate is essential in a screening tool because false positives overload the system and create anxiety. Equally important in this heterogeneous disorder, the 1-min test identified 37% of all ASD toddlers. This is a larger percentage than any other early genetic, proteomic, neuroimaging or neurobehavioral screen, and it is fast, easy, and highly ASD specific.  Aim 1 will identify methods to integrate ASD specific test into clinical practice as a 2nd tier screen for babies who fail a routine 1st tier pencil and paper screen (i.e., the CSBS). Results will greatly improve the accuracy of early detection and speed referral of babies for diagnostic and treatment services. Using a portable eye tracker, 39 pediatricians will give the GeoPref Test in their office to toddlers who fail the CSBS who will in turn be referred to our Center for blinded diagnosis. This will be the first translation of an eye tracking finding on ASD into real-world clinical practice. In an effort to fully understand the clinical phenotype of ASD toddlers that ""fail"" the GeoPref Test, Aim 2 will use novel experimental tests, such as a test of exploration, as well as standardized tests such as the Mullen, to identify clinical profiles tha distinguish these toddlers from others with an ASD. Although the GeoPref Test identifies a large subgroup of 37% of all ASD toddlers, equally fast, and accurate tests are needed to identify the remaining ASD toddlers. Aim 3 proposes to develop new eye tracking tests, specifically novel social orienting and motherese paradigms, to detect these toddlers. Random forest classification algorithms will identify eye gaze signatures that best identify subgroups of ASD toddlers. All toddlers will receive a final blinded diagnosis at 30-36 months.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  In order to move beyond paper-and-pencil parent reports as the only option for early autism screening, novel techniques must be researched. Here, for the first time, this grant will translate an eye tracking test which was found to be highly accurate in detecting ASD - the GeoPref Test - out of the laboratory and into pediatric offices. Moreover, additional novel eye tracking tests will be developed and relationships between how a toddler performs on a given eye tracking test will be examined in relation to various clinical measures such as how a toddler explores their environment; understanding the clinical-eye tracking relationships is central to discovering the many unique subgroups that likely make up the overall ASD phenotype.            ",Early Identification of ASD: Translating Eye Tracking into Practice,8579445,R01MH080134,"['Algorithms', 'Anxiety', 'Attention', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavior', 'Blinded', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Child Behavior', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Environment', 'Eye', 'Family', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Head circumference', 'Heterogeneity', 'Infant', 'Laboratories', 'Language Tests', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Paper', 'Parents', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Plant Roots', 'Probability', 'Proteomics', 'ROC Curve', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Social Behavior', 'Specificity', 'Speech', 'Speed', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Work', 'base', 'checkup examination', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical practice', 'computer monitor', 'forest', 'gaze', 'improved', 'innovation', 'neurobehavioral', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'pediatrician', 'preference', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'response', 'satisfaction', 'screening', 'social', 'sound', 'tool']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2013,387500,0.18802527643393763
"Clinical algorithm for identifying adult autism     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This R34 application seeks support to refine and test a clinical algorithm for identifying autism spectrum disorders (ASD) in adults receiving outpatient psychiatric care. Evidence suggests that adults with ASD are overrepresented and underdiagnosed among individuals receiving psychiatric care. Adults with ASD may be medicated for disorders they do not have with medications that are not effective for treating ASD. They also may benefit from ASD-specific interventions that they do not get because of inaccurate diagnosis. ASD diagnostic tools are lengthy, most are validated only in children, and they require considerable training to administer correctly. Therefore they are not feasible for use with adults in community mental health settings. To develop a screening strategy appropriate for this setting, we will build upon our prior work in inpatient settings by partnering with Horizon House, a large community mental health organization in Pennsylvania, to identify adults with ASD in their care. We then will refine and validate our algorithm for identifying ASD in adults presenting for psychiatric treatment. Our goal is to use items readily available to clinicians, in combination with a brief screening tool, to accurately identify ASD in adults in community mental health settings, which would then lead to further diagnostic assessment. The specific aims of the proposed study are to: 1) Estimate the prevalence of undiagnosed ASD in community outpatient  settings~ 2) Compare clinical characteristics,  treatment and assigned diagnoses of adults with ASD with those of adults with other psychiatric disorders~ and  3) Develop and test a brief tool for community mental health practice to screen for ASD in adults. To determine cases of ASD, Horizon House staff will complete the SRS and the Autism Spectrum Disorders in Adults Screening Questionnaire (a shorter instrument used in similar studies) for adult clients with whom they have in-person contact during a 6-month period (n H 2000). Researchers then will conduct, on a  sample  of 450 subjects stratified by SRS score: 1) chart reviews to extract information  using  a  checklist comprising the characteristics found to discriminate between adults with ASD and other psychiatric disorders in prior studies (developmental history, neurological problems, substance use and criminal activity~ Appendix B)~ 2) structured clinical interviews using the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule, Module 4, and the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM Disorders~ and 3) family interviews, using the Social Communication Questionnaire, semi-structured questions about early development, and the modified Family Interview for Genetic Studies. Case conferences will be conducted for all subjects to make a final determination of ASD. Once case status is determined, subjects with and without ASD will be compared on all variables using receiver operating characteristic curves and decision tree analyses to determine the most parsimonious creening strategies. If successful, the proposed study will provide the first US estimates of ASD in an outpatient population and will greatly enhance community clinicians' ability to identify adults with ASD.             PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This R34 application seeks support to refine and test a clinical algorithm for identifying autism spectrum disorders (ASD) in adults receiving outpatient psychiatric care.

"Software to Enrich the Noun Lexicons and Lexical Learning of Children with Autism     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of this project is to develop and field-test prototype software for a research-based vocabulary development program featuring a combined lexical-cognitive approach to noun acquisition. The target population for the curriculum will be 3-8 year old children with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD), as well as a broad range of other children with language disorders, with language function in the range of 2-5 years. The curriculum will use a core noun vocabulary in training activities de- signed to address four interrelated goals: (a) train a basic noun vocabulary using both fast and slow mapping strategies; (b) enrich the semantic features of lexical entries by associating them with functional and/or descriptive information; (c) enhance lexical organization by using the core vocabulary in a series of categorization activities; and (d) expand paradigmatic schemas with training that associates basic level nouns with paradigmatically associated concepts. A subset of the curriculum was developed in Phase I and used in iterative testing with subjects in the target populations. It was found that even low language functioning children with ASD were able to use the prototype materials as intended and acquire or demonstrate knowledge of fast mapping, the vocabulary items, their categories, and their semantic associations. In Phase II the knowledge gained in Phase I will be used to improve and expand the curriculum into a prototype that covers 220 Target Nouns (110 associated pairs) with at least 10 superordinate noun categories. The prototype will include a unique integrated expert curriculum control system that includes probe tests to establish appropriate entry points into the curriculum, and will provide highly individualized and efficient language instruction in appropriate activities with proper instructional support. The prototype will be used in a 12-week field test in a public school distrit to evaluate its effectiveness when used by children with ASD and language impairments under natural conditions. Dependent measures will include pre- and post-intervention measures of receptive and expressive language status.          Impaired language is recognized as one of the hallmarks of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Despite extensive incidental exposure to language, many children with ASD have a markedly limited vocabulary and are clearly in need of formal remediation. The goal of this project is to develop a curriculum and prototype software for a research-based vocabulary development program featuring a combined lexical-cognitive approach to noun acquisition. The curriculum will focus on helping children to develop the learning processes necessary for efficient lexical acquisition and organization, and on laying the groundwork for a rich and semantically well organized conceptual framework. This will provide a cost effective means to promote early language and cognitive development in children with ASD as well as a broad range of other children with language disorders.

"fcMRI in Infants at High Risk for Autism    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This ESI / New Investigator clinician-scientist brings an expert team to test the altered brain functional connectivity hypothesis of autism during infancy. We will conduct graph-theory-based network analyses on functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging (fcMRI) data acquired in high-risk infants who are currently being studied in the multi-site, NIH-funded Autism Center of Excellence (ACE) study R01 HD055741: A Longitudinal MRI Study of Infants at Risk for Autism - Joseph Piven: PI. We will prospectively study diverging developmental trajectories for functional networks of brain regions in infants who do and do not develop an Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD), during a suspected period of altered brain growth in autism, and prior to symptom expression. All four ACE data collection sites and their existing Data Coordination Center will participate. These efforts will provide longitudinal fcMRI data (scans at 6, 12, and 24 months old) in up to 664 high-risk and control infants (~15% of the 544 high-risk infants will develop an ASD). All four ACE data collection sites are already (as of May, 2010) - in advance of any dedicated funding, to ensure enough fcMRI data - acquiring fcMRI data on their subjects. Interfacing with the high-risk infant ACE structural imaging study and its supplements will allow us to build on existing infrastructure, save effort and cost, standardize collections, and merge databases. It also provides the potential for future genetic-functional imaging associations. Our fcMRI approach considers the problem of autism from the perspective of alterations in the behavior of brain-wide networks and changes in strengths of functional connectivity between and within rigorously defined sub-networks of brain regions. We believe this approach is more fruitful than those which consider smaller numbers of brain regions. We will additionally use a novel cortical functional areal parcellation routine (that Co-I Steve Petersen et al. have developed) to enhance the sensitivity of the infant fcMRI data analyses. Unique insights may come from comparing our network-based fcMRI analyses to the structural MRI, diffusion tensor imaging, and extensive phenotypic data generated by the existing ACE study (fcMRI acquired in the same infants). Once diagnoses are assigned in the ACE study, we will use a machine learning, multivariate pattern classification approach (Support Vector Machine: SVM) to explore the possibility of developing a diagnostic classifier for ASD. The eventual goal would be to train an SVM to predict which infants will and will not develop ASD, based on network properties of their fcMRI data, prior to the expression of symptoms. If successful, our proposed program of research could inform the future development of pre- symptomatic diagnostic tests for ASD, increase our knowledge about the neurobiology of autism, and provide methods for studying functional brain changes in response to interventions. These approaches could be adapted for the study of other neurodevelopmental and early-onset psychiatric disorders.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed work is relevant to public health because autism is one of the most devastating psychiatric disorders of childhood, and disorders spanning the broader spectrum affect approximately 1/100 individuals. We propose to test the brain functional connectivity hypothesis of autism with functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging (fcMRI) in infants who are at high risk for autism. If successful, we may contribute to the eventual development of pre-symptomatic diagnostic tests for autism that will improve early identification, which is critical for enhancing outcome in affected individuals. More broadly, our proposed studies will also increase our knowledge about autism in ways that will complement future genetic, screening, and intervention studies.           The proposed work is relevant to public health because autism is one of the most devastating psychiatric disorders of childhood, and disorders spanning the broader spectrum affect approximately 1/100 individuals.

"EEG Complexity Trajectory as an Early Biomarker for Autism    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): EEG Complexity as a Biomarker for Autism Spectrum Disorder Risk Personnel William Bosl (PI) Instructor, Children's Hospital Informatics Program (ChIP) Charles Nelson (collaborator) Professor, Harvard and Division of Developmental Medicine at CHB Helen Tager-Flusberg (consultant) Professor, Boston University Department of Psychology Abstract Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are complex, heritable disorders that have highly variable long-term outcomes. Research suggests that complex mental disorders such as autism are associated with abnormal brain connectivity that may vary between different regions and different scales [1]. In the autistic brain, high local connectivity and low long-range connectivity may develop concurrently due to problems with synapse pruning or formation [1, 2]. Estimation of changes in neural connectivity might be an effective diagnostic biomarker for abnormal connectivity development that leads to ASD behaviors. The electrical signals produced by neural networks contain information about the network structure [3-5]. Nonlinear signal processing algorithms [6, 7] can be used to compute features from the time series produced by the network to characterize the dynamics of a complex system such as the brain. Our hypothesis is that multiscale entropy (MSE) is one measure of signal complexity that will reveal distinct, measurable differences between normally developing brains and those that will eventually be diagnosed with an ASD. Machine learning algorithms will be used to classify infants into one of three groups using MSE values: controls (CON), high risk based on having an older sibling with autism, but does not develop autism (HRN) and high risk and develops autism (HRA). Rather than mapping to these three risk groups, MSE values will be mapped to a severity score based on Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) or equivalent assessments given to all infants in the study. Preliminary data using MSE to measure signal complexity shows a clear difference between normal controls and a group of infants at high risk for developing ASD based on family history (Bosl, et al., 2011). The change was particularly striking between 9 and 12 months of age when critical cognitive milestones are expected in normal infants. In the proposed study, we will also attempt to make predictions of outcome using MSE growth trajectories, with feature vectors composed of all values up to a specified age: 6-9, 6-12, 6-18 and 6-24 months. We hypothesize that the growth trajectories may be more informative than measures at one given age. To establish a baseline for comparison of predictions based on MSE, a similar prediction calculation using machine learning algorithms will be done with all available assessment scores, including ADOS, SCQ, Mullen and physiological measures such as head circumference. Even if a diagnosis of autism is not possible from assessment scores at one age before 18 months, it may be that the trajectory of assessment scores has predictive value. In all prediction computations, an estimate will be made of which variables contribute the most information to the prediction (whether EEG channels or assessment scores). Finally, correlations between MSE values and assessment scores will be determined in order to judge whether MSE measurements are proxies for assessment scores, or contribute complementary information, or neither. Early diagnosis and therapy are known to significantly improve the long-term prognosis of ASD patients. This project has the potential to enable early diagnosis of ASD, within the first year of life, and assess severity. If successful, this will also enable a new class of therapies aimed at averting the development of autistic brain functional tendencies before they are fully formed. The novel methodology developed here, using complex systems methods to extract signal features and machine learning to map MSE values, traditional scores and physical measurements to autism severity estimates, may be widely applicable as an approach for identifying quantitative biomarkers of other mental disorders. This may have particular value in resource poor regions where few professionals are available for complete behavioral assessments.

"Characterizing mechanistic heterogeneity across ADHD and Autism     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Progress in establishing the etiology of psychiatric illness is limited by the absence of objective biological measures able to detect and discriminate between disorders. This problem is particularly important in developmental disorders, where early identification could eventually assist in prevention of lifelong impairments. The two earlies onsets, most common and costly developmental disorders in child psychiatry are attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and Autism spectrum disorders (ASD). A recent 2011 study, surveying the years 1997-2008, has now verified that 1 in 6 children have a developmental disability, a 17% increase over the past decade driven largely by increases in ASD and ADHD. These developments highlight the need for innovative approaches to address the underlying cause of these disorders. It is likely that the clinical heterogeneity and the imprecise nature of their nosological distinctions represent fundamentally confounding factors limiting a better understanding of their etiology, prevention, and treatment.  Interestingly, an emerging observation regarding brain imaging in ASD and ADHD is that they often have the same atypical functional brain signatures. However, because these two syndromes are almost exclusively studied separately, it is difficult to determine atypical brain function that is common compared to what is distinct for each disorder. If we are to improve our understanding regarding the underlying etiology of these disorders, it will be necessary to study these populations simultaneously. With that said, simply comparing groups of children based on their DSM diagnosis is unlikely to suffice. The behavioral and biological heterogeneity within each syndrome further complicates the meaning of any given group difference found in brain imaging. Thus, progress in our understanding requires not only examining these disorders in the same studies, but also identifying how brain signatures relate to distinct behavioral components (i.e., endophenotypes) that span the syndromes.  Under this context, and consistent with NIMH's new strategic plan, Strategy 1.4 (also see RDoC), the current proposal aims to use resting state functional connectivity MRI (rs-fcMRI) and structural connectivity (DTI) to identify brain signatures that correspond to fundamental behavioral components (executive, facial recognition, and affect recognition) found in ADHD and/or ASD. We also aim to develop integrated, multimodal sub-classifications (i.e. neurotypes) or ""biosignatures"" of these disorders with computational tools that include Graph Theory and support vector machine (SVM) based pattern classification. The potential impact of the proposed mechanistic categorization on future functional, genetic, treatment, and other translational studies of ADHD and ASD are substantial.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed study uses relatively new and advanced imaging techniques (i.e. resting-state functional connectivity MRI, and diffusion tensor imaging), along with computational tools (i.e. Graph theory and pattern classification) to identify atypical brain physiology that is unique and shared across ADHD and Autism. The work will also advance new approaches and methods to classify these disorders based on specific behavioral and neurobiological measures. The result from this study will advance our knowledge regarding the neurobiological underpinnings of ADHD and Autism, and assist in the improved characterization of homogeneous subtypes of future genetic, functional, and therapeutic investigations.              The proposed study uses relatively new and advanced imaging techniques (i.e. resting-state functional connectivity MRI, and diffusion tensor imaging), along with computational tools (i.e. Graph theory and pattern classification) to identify atypical brain physiology that is unique and shared across ADHD and Autism.

"Statistical Word Learning and Non-Social Visual Attention in Children with Autism     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) have difficulty learning words, which negatively impacts their functional independence and quality of life. Unfortunately, relatively little is known about the learning mechanisms that underlie these deficits, which has important theoretical and clinical implications. This study will address this gap in knowledge by examining the impact of statistical learning and non-social visual attention on word learning in children with ASD. Implicit eye-gaze methods will be the primary methodology because they capture real-time information about learning and attention. Because of their limited task demands, these methods are appropriate for children with a range of abilities. Many studies have focused exclusively on high-functioning children with ASD, thus limiting research and clinical implications for the broader population. The use of eye-gaze methodology in this study facilitates the inclusion of children with a broad range of language and attentional abilities.  Statistical learning (i.e., sensitivity to linguistic regularities) is a roust language-learning mechanism in typical development, but almost nothing is known about statistical learning in autism. Specific Aim 1 (Study 1) investigates a form of statistical learnin known as cross-situational word learning, which supports word learning in ambiguous contexts. Because children with ASD have difficulty using social cues to determine word meanings and thus experience many ambiguous learning situations, it is vital to characterize their cross-situational word-learning abilities. It is hypothesized that the ASD group will have impaired cross-situational learning abilities but that considerable variability will emerge. Specific Aim 2 will characterize this variability by examining two prerequisite skills--the ability to recognize recurring visual stimuli across contexts (Study 2a) and the ability to form a label-object association (Study 2b). A significant relationship between prerequisite skills and cross-situational learning is anticipated in the ASD group.  It is well known that children with ASD demonstrate atypical social attention (e.g., joint attention), but many children also demonstrate impairments in non-social visual attention. Specifically, many children with ASD show atypical attentional orienting (e.g., prolonged disengagement of attention) that may impact their ability to use cross-situational learning mechanisms. Specific Aim 3 (Study 3) will investigate the relationship between cross-situational learning and an established, independent visual orienting task. Study 4 will be an exploratory study that examines the relationship between visual orienting during the training phase of the cross-situational learning task (Study 1), and learning outcomes. This study is based on recent work with typically developing infants. Visual orienting, specifically disengagement, is expected to predict cross-situational learning in children with ASD in Studies 3 and 4.  Findings from this study will inform theories of ASD and language acquisition, and may have clinical implications for maximizing the effectiveness of existing treatment paradigms and designing new intervention programs to facilitate language acquisition in children with ASD.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this research is to understand the mechanisms that underlie word-learning deficits in children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD).

"Neural Predictors of Language Function After Intervention in Children with Autism    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) are a phenotypically heterogeneous group of neurodevelopmental disorders being diagnosed at growing rates in toddlers and young children, with prevalence estimates of 1%. Many children have limited expressive language at the time of diagnosis, and only 50% make significant gains in communication, even with intensive interventions. Unfortunately, intervention studies in ASD have struggled to reliably predict language gain, and, importantly, to differentiate pre-verbal from non-verbal children. One major limitation is the reliance on standardized behavioral assessments, which only capture overt behaviors. Innovative methodology is needed to better characterize the neural correlates of cognitive and perceptual domains important for language acquisition and to apply these methods to inform intervention studies. Such knowledge will allow us to design and apply more effective, targeted interventions for children with ASD based on baseline phenotypes. This study proposes to apply electrophysiological measures to better characterize the neural correlates of two cognitive domains essential for language acquisition: joint attention and statistical learning, along with resting state EEG power, in young children with ASD prior to entry into an intensive behavioral intervention and then after completion of the intervention, in order to determine if specific electrophysiological profiles can predict language acquisition and gain. Combined with the activities outlined in the training plan, this research proposal represents a timely effort to apply translational methods to behavioral intervention studies in order to enrich the conventional predictors of outcome in ASD. The principle unifying this study is that a better understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying the behavioral and cognitive deficits in ASD will inform predictors of treatment response, which, in turn, will facilitate the development of more targeted interventions for these children.

"Software to Enrich the Noun Lexicons and Lexical Learning of Children with Autism     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of this project is to develop and field-test prototype software for a research-based vocabulary development program featuring a combined lexical-cognitive approach to noun acquisition. The target population for the curriculum will be 3-8 year old children with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD), as well as a broad range of other children with language disorders, with language function in the range of 2-5 years. The curriculum will use a core noun vocabulary in training activities de- signed to address four interrelated goals: (a) train a basic noun vocabulary using both fast and slow mapping strategies; (b) enrich the semantic features of lexical entries by associating them with functional and/or descriptive information; (c) enhance lexical organization by using the core vocabulary in a series of categorization activities; and (d) expand paradigmatic schemas with training that associates basic level nouns with paradigmatically associated concepts. A subset of the curriculum was developed in Phase I and used in iterative testing with subjects in the target populations. It was found that even low language functioning children with ASD were able to use the prototype materials as intended and acquire or demonstrate knowledge of fast mapping, the vocabulary items, their categories, and their semantic associations. In Phase II the knowledge gained in Phase I will be used to improve and expand the curriculum into a prototype that covers 220 Target Nouns (110 associated pairs) with at least 10 superordinate noun categories. The prototype will include a unique integrated expert curriculum control system that includes probe tests to establish appropriate entry points into the curriculum, and will provide highly individualized and efficient language instruction in appropriate activities with proper instructional support. The prototype will be used in a 12-week field test in a public school distrit to evaluate its effectiveness when used by children with ASD and language impairments under natural conditions. Dependent measures will include pre- and post-intervention measures of receptive and expressive language status.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Impaired language is recognized as one of the hallmarks of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Despite extensive incidental exposure to language, many children with ASD have a markedly limited vocabulary and are clearly in need of formal remediation. The goal of this project is to develop a curriculum and prototype software for a research-based vocabulary development program featuring a combined lexical-cognitive approach to noun acquisition. The curriculum will focus on helping children to develop the learning processes necessary for efficient lexical acquisition and organization, and on laying the groundwork for a rich and semantically well organized conceptual framework. This will provide a cost effective means to promote early language and cognitive development in children with ASD as well as a broad range of other children with language disorders.              Impaired language is recognized as one of the hallmarks of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD).

Children with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) are impaired in their ability to produce and perceive dynamic facial expressions (Adolphs, Sears, and Piven, 2001). Advanced computer vision technologies can now be leveraged in the investigation of issues such as the facial expression recognition and production deficits common to children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Not only can these technologies assist in quantifying these deficits, but they can also be used as part of interventions aimed at reducing deficit severity. In this project, automated facial expression recognition will be employed for the development of training exercises for facial expression production in children with ASD. Previous research by Tanaka and Schultz developed the Let's Face It! intervention tool shown to effectively improve the face processing abilities of children with ASD. Let's Face It! focused on perception but not production. Bartlett and Movellan have developed the Computer Expression Recognition Toolbox (CERT), a computer vision system which measures 37 facial expression dimensions in real-time. This project brings together these two research groups in order to develop a computer assisted intervention system to enhance the social communication skills of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). The computer vision tool enables novel interventions that focus on facial expression production. Intervention games will be developed to provide automated feedback on facial expressions produced by children with ASD in an engaging and cost- effective manner. In addition to improving production skills, practice with facial expression production may also improve perception skills by linking motor production with perception. The intervention exercises developed here will include closed-loop sensorimotor expression training in which subjects both see and produce facial expressions, and then view the effects of their facial expressions in the games. This project will also characterize facial expression production of children with ASD in a battery of assessment tasks, including automated facial expression measurement with CERT. Upon completion, this project will contribute to our understanding of facial expression production in children with ASD, provide a new intervention tool for facial expression production, and provide data on the efficacy of the intervention.

"Therapeutic Robot to Teach Social Skills to Primary School Children with ASD    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Project Summary/Abstract: This project is part of a long-term effort to reduce the burdens and disability associated with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). The majority of adults and adolescents who have an ASD diagnosis do not have mental retardation, and are notable for their language abilities, which in many cases appear intact. Nevertheless, these individuals fail to achieve vocational success consonant with their intellectual level, and may be unable to form friendships and relationships outside their family. The specific aim of the project is to develop a training simulation to improve these individuals' ability to participate in social conversation. Equipped with basic conversational skills, individuals with ASD may gain more opportunities to interact and improve the quality of their relationships. The applicant is using technology it originally developed to create training simulations for specialized social interactions (e.g., for an interviewer to detect suicide risk in a soldier). The training simulation is based on a complex model of the simulated character's shifting emotional state in response to the history of the conversation, the user's most recent response, and an element of chance. The simulation includes a database of hundreds of video clips performed by a professional actor, and a large set of responses available for the user to speak or select by mouse click. The system offers help features, with straightforward explanations of the simulated character's reactions, and guidance with response choice; an on-screen coach who provides overt signals in response to the appropriateness of the user's response choice; playback options, so that the user can review parts or all of an interaction; and game features: points for success and cheering for improved scores and ultimately achieving the game's objective, agreement of the simulated character to another meeting with the user. The simulation content will be developed by the applicant's skilled script-writers with input from an autism researcher from Catholic University, then reviewed prior to video by three research and clinical specialists in ASD and a gentleman who himself has ASD, prior to videotaping. Usability field-testing will be conducted with 10 members of the target population. Data representing their use of the simulation and its features will be automatically logged, and they will respond to a debriefing questionnaire. Any modifications indicated will be incorporated into the more extensive simulation to be proposed for Phase II funding. Project Narrative: This project will adapt a therapeutic toy robot, CosmoBot, in order to engage children with severe social delays associated with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in activities to promote development of social skills. The toy robot will be equipped with sets of game programs from which therapists can choose. Therapists in 2 locations will test the therapeutic toy and its social games with 10 primary-school-aged children who have these impairments, in order to evaluate how easy the system is to use, how much it appeals to the children, and whether it has positive effects on children's social skills.          n/a",Therapeutic Robot to Teach Social Skills to Primary School Children with ASD,7172787,R43HD054407,"['artificial intelligence', 'autism', 'behavior modification', 'behavior test', 'behavioral /social science research tag', 'bioengineering /biomedical engineering', 'child psychology', 'clinical research', 'communication', 'computer simulation', 'educational resource design /development', 'face expression', 'field study', 'human subject', 'human therapy evaluation', 'interactive multimedia', 'interpersonal relations', 'middle childhood (6-11)', 'questionnaires', 'robotics', 'social behavior', 'social integration', 'videotape /videodisc']",NICHD,"ANTHROTRONIX, INC.",R43,2006,122809,0.13100593991495002
"Novel computer vision-based assessment of infant-caregiver synchrony as an early level II screening tool for autism PROJECT SUMMARY This R21 addresses a critical need for accurate and scalable screening tools able to detect autism spectrum disorder (ASD) within the first year of life. This project will pilot an innovative digital phenotyping screening method, which uses computer vision and machine learning to measure synchrony within simple infant-caregiver interactions. Synchrony refers to the tendency for infants to spontaneously and dynamically coordinate their behaviors with their caregivers in time. This critical and early-emerging developmental process may provide unique and precise information about an infant’s risk for ASD, while also offering a lens for understanding early social interaction differences at the core of ASD. Significance: This project represents a paradigm shift in ASD screening, moving beyond behavior rating scales toward methods that are better suited to capture the subtle early indicators of ASD. Caregiver rating scales lack the granularity and objectivity necessary for detecting signs of ASD that emerge slowly and subtly throughout the first year. Approach: The interdisciplinary study team will leverage cutting-edge technology to objectively and granularly measure synchrony within 5-minute, play-based infant-caregiver interactions. Markerless computer vision will be used to quantify facial movements, captured unobtrusively with small, bidirectional cameras. The dyadic synchrony among infants’ and caregivers’ facial movements will then be calculated throughout the interaction, as part of an automated machine learning pipeline. Preliminary Data: We evaluated this approach in young adults with and without ASD during brief conversational interactions with research staff members. In a machine learning analysis pipeline, synchrony features classified diagnosis with 91% accuracy - significantly better than expert clinicians assessing the same videos. The same set of synchrony features significantly predicted symptom severity in the ASD group, suggesting that this method is effective for both diagnostic classification and dimensional prediction of individual differences. Importantly, the pipeline also classified diagnosis in children with similarly high accuracy, demonstrating the reproducibility of results across age groups. Aims. This project extends these computer vision-based methods to infants, with the overarching goal of evaluating their utility as a Level II screener for ASD. Aim 1 will evaluate the concurrent validity of our computational measures of interactional synchrony by evaluating their relationships with an established clinician-administered assessment of early ASD markers. Aim 2 will assess the utility of our interactional synchrony measure as a Level II screening tool at 12 months, by testing its ability to predict future ASD diagnosis with high specificity. Impact: This R21 will provide initial validation for a novel, computer vision- based screener for ASD in infancy. By targeting the dynamics of natural infant-caregiver interactions, this method has the potential to identify very early signs of disrupted social development, even before classic ASD symptoms emerge. Moreover, this quick interaction-based screener would fit easily into the context of routine pediatric care, holding promise as a Level II screener deployable within a universal screening framework. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project tests a new method of screening for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in infancy, leveraging computer vision and machine learning to develop a screening tool that detects alterations in the dynamic social coordination between infants and caregivers during brief, play-based interactions. There are currently no screening tools capable of reliably detecting ASD in the first year of life, and in particular, no tools based on direct measurement of behavior that can be feasibly deployed in primary care. This project addresses this critical public health challenge by examining an objective, granular, and scalable Level II screener, which has potential to lower the average age of diagnosis by identifying very early signs of disrupted social development, even before classic ASD symptoms emerge.",Novel computer vision-based assessment of infant-caregiver synchrony as an early level II screening tool for autism,10023938,R21HD102078,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Age-Months', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Developmental Process', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Face', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Infant', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Life', 'Low Prevalence', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Parents', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Predictive Value', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Screening procedure', 'Severities', 'Social Development', 'Social Interaction', 'Specificity', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'age group', 'analysis pipeline', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'behavior rating scale', 'computational pipelines', 'digital', 'early screening', 'high risk', 'high risk infant', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'lens', 'machine learning method', 'member', 'novel', 'primary care setting', 'screening', 'social', 'support vector machine', 'temporal measurement', 'tool', 'young adult']",NICHD,CHILDREN'S HOSP OF PHILADELPHIA,R21,2020,220000,0.19415339579817795
"Novel video-based approaches for detection of autism risk in the first year of life Signs of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) emerge in the first year of life in many children, but diagnosis is typically made much later, at an average age of 4 years in the United States. Early intervention is highly effective for young children with ASD, but is typically reserved for children with a formal diagnosis, making accurate identification as early as possible imperative. A screening tool that could identify ASD risk during infancy offers the opportunity for intervention before the full set of symptoms is present. In this application, we propose two novel video-based methods of detecting ASD in the first year of life. First, we will validate a recently developed instrument, the Video-referenced Infant Rating System for Autism (VIRSA), in a general community sample of infants. The VIRSA is a brief web-based instrument that utilizes video depictions rather than written descriptions of behavior to detect signs of ASD. It leverages thousands of hours of already collected and hand-coded video obtained through previous NIH funding. Videos demonstrating a continuum of behaviors and developmental competence are presented to parents, who identify the ones most representative of their child. Through previous funding, we have established that the VIRSA has good psychometric properties when used by parents with previous experience of ASD (i.e., have an older affected child) and demonstrated that it is able to distinguish infants developing ASD in the first year of life. In Aim 1, we will examine the measure’s use by parents who are naïve to ASD, with no family history of the disorder. In Aim 2, we propose another innovative method of utilizing video for ASD detection. Machine learning is an application of artificial intelligence in which computer programs “learn” and adjust themselves in response to training data to which they are exposed, improving performance and generalization to novel data without being explicitly programmed. We propose to use the videos from the VIRSA, previously demonstrated in our initial validation study to be sensitive to early signs of ASD, as training inputs to develop machine-learning algorithms for automatic detection of ASD-related behaviors. The huge video archive available for this project, with hand- coded time-stamped behavioral tags, is a highly valuable resource for machine learning. Aim 2 will lay the foundation for future attempts to develop video-based mobile applications for ASD recognition, which require validated classifiers that can recognize behavioral events central to early detection of ASD. The ultimate goal of the two aims of the proposed project is to develop low-cost, low-burden measures that capitalize on new technologies, including mobile platforms, video, and machine learning methods, to detect ASD risk in infancy. Such measures would have significant public health applications, including screening large community-based samples and longitudinally tracking development in pediatric settings to identify children requiring evaluation. Identification of ASD in infancy would afford treatment at an optimal age, when the brain is most malleable, which could lessen disability and possibly prevent the emergence of later-appearing symptoms. PROJECT NARRATIVE Symptoms of autism spectrum disorder emerge in infancy, yet the average age of diagnosis in the United States is still 4 years. In this application, we propose to develop two novel video-based methods of detecting risk for ASD in the first year of life, harnessing new technologies and automated approaches that pose low burden to families. These methods have potential to improve access to care and reduce the time lag between symptom emergence and diagnosis.",Novel video-based approaches for detection of autism risk in the first year of life,10011854,R01MH121344,"['4 year old', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Age-Months', 'Algorithms', 'Archives', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Competence', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Early treatment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Facial Expression', 'Family history of', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Hour', 'Improve Access', 'Infant', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Lifestyle-related condition', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Online Systems', 'Parents', 'Performance', 'Property', 'Psychometrics', 'Public Health Applications Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Secure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'autistic children', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'computer program', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'disability', 'disease classification', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'family burden', 'gaze', 'high risk', 'improved', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'instrument', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'mobile application', 'mobile computing', 'new technology', 'novel', 'prevent', 'recruit', 'response', 'screening', 'validation studies', 'vocalization']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R01,2020,710922,0.2195489857886023
"Predicting Autism and Social Functioning from Computer Vision Analyses of Motor Synchrony During Dyadic Interactions PROJECT SUMMARY Our innovative and fully automated approach to the analysis of social behavior addresses the pressing need for precise and scalable measurements of the autism spectrum disorder (ASD) phenotype. Using computer vision and machine learning methods, we have created a novel, quantitative method for fine-grained analysis of social interactions. Our approach directly measures interpersonal motor synchrony, a construct which we use as a lens for understanding the social interaction differences that are at the core of ASD. Significance: Genomics and neuroimaging methods continuously evolve, providing deeper insights into the biology of ASD. However, methods for measuring the outward manifestations of ASD have not changed substantially in decades. ASD is fundamentally a disorder of social interaction, but current clinical tools do not directly measure observable social interactions. Instead, they summarize global impressions of these interactions via informant report questionnaires or observational coding schemes that typically lack the behavioral granularity needed to robustly measure individual differences and changes across time (e.g., treatment related change). Inter-rater agreement on questionnaires is typically modest, while the alternative “deep phenotyping” by expert clinicians is a time- consuming and often cost-prohibitive burden to studies, especially when large samples are required (e.g., in genomics research). Approach: To resolve these problems, our team created a novel computational framework that leverages advances in markerless video motion capture, computer vision, and machine learning to directly capture dyadic social interactions. This allows us to capture all behaviors observable by expert clinicians but with exquisite digital precision and objectivity. Preliminary Data: We developed a fully automatic quantitative assessment of interpersonal social behavior focused on features of dyadic facial motor synchrony. When applied to videos of brief conversations between confederates and young adults with or without ASD, our assessment predicted diagnostic status with 91% accuracy – significantly better than highly trained clinical experts assessing the same video recordings. The set of predictive social motor synchrony features that we identified also correlated significantly with symptom severity in the ASD group, suggesting that it can be used for both diagnostic classification and evaluating individual differences (vital for advancing precision medicine goals). Importantly, our findings were reproducible across samples: the same features identified in our adult analysis also predicted diagnosis in a child sample with high accuracy. Aims. In Aim 1, we will test the specificity of our computer vision approach by expanding comparisons to include a mixed psychiatric disorder group; Aim 2 will test dyadic synchrony in other body movements, and Aim 3 will define associations between interpersonal motor synchrony and dimensional aspects of social communication that span diagnostic categories. Impact: Our approach is designed for fast and rigorous assessment of social communication, providing a scalable solution to diagnosing ASD diagnosis and measuring individual variability, within a transdiagnostic, precision medicine framework. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project tests a new technique for measuring social communication problems in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Using markerless motion capture, computer vision, and machine learning, we will measure humans’ natural tendency to coordinate their behavior with a conversational partner. The results of this project will impact public health by making it easier to reliably diagnose ASD, providing access to precise phenotypic information for genotypic studies, and by providing the theoretical and empirical foundation for an objective way to determine whether some treatments work better than others.",Predicting Autism and Social Functioning from Computer Vision Analyses of Motor Synchrony During Dyadic Interactions,9842013,R01MH118327,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Agreement', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biologic Development', 'Biology', 'Categories', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Face', 'Foundations', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Individual Differences', 'Limb structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Schools', 'Severities', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Functioning', 'Social Interaction', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Models', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Video Recording', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'autistic children', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'computer framework', 'computerized', 'cost', 'design', 'digital', 'dyadic interaction', 'experimental study', 'impression', 'individual variation', 'informant', 'innovation', 'insight', 'lens', 'machine learning method', 'natural language', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'skills', 'social', 'social communication', 'social deficits', 'tool', 'wearable sensor technology', 'young adult']",NIMH,CHILDREN'S HOSP OF PHILADELPHIA,R01,2020,774965,0.12342732495458734
"Identification of outcome-based sub-populations using deep phenotyping and precision functional mapping across ADHD and ASD Project Summary  Two of the earliest onset, most common, and costly neurodevelopmental disorders in child psychiatry are Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and Autism spectrum disorders (ASD). The clinical heterogeneity and the imprecise nature of their nosological distinctions represents a fundamentally confounding factor limiting a better understanding of their etiology, prevention, and treatment. In short, simple design assumptions regarding `homogeneity in samples' in typical and atypical populations may explain the frequently very small effect sizes in psychopathology research. Clinically, these same assumptions may account for why treatments often have weak or unpredictable effects.  Recent developments in the computational sciences, have enabled the implementation of models sufficiently complex to address the aforementioned situation regarding subpopulations; however, very few tie the outputs to the specific outcome or questions being asked by the investigator. Under the parent grant, we developed and published a novel hybrid supervised/unsupervised machine learning method to characterize biologically relevant heterogeneity in ADHD and/or ASD – the Functional Random Forest (FRF). The hybrid FRF combines machine learning and graph theoretic analyses in order to identify population subtypes related to the clinically most important outcomes (in the case, of this proposal, negative valence symptoms) trans- diagnostically (ASD, ADHD, TD).  Despite developing the FRF, subtyping results using functional MRI (fMRI) signals have lagged behind the subtyping of behavioral profiles. In addition, they have yet to become sufficiently sensitive and specific, for rapid translation into clinical practice. Fortunately, parallel advances in functional neuroimaging, allow for precision functional mapping of individuals, and can be synergistically combined with the FRF to greatly boost our ability to subtype and characterize individual patients from fMRI data. Here we combine the FRF with precision mapping to reveal common variants and individual specificity in global brain organization. The proposed individual-specific precision mapping moves beyond group averaging approaches, which are obscuring important inter-individual differences related to distinct pathophysiologies underlying negative valence across diagnoses (ADHD, ASD, TD).  Thus, the current proposal aims to apply FRF algorithms to trans-diagnostic (TD, ASD, ADHD) behavioral and precision functional mapping RSFC data to identify distinct sub-populations across ASD, ADHD, and TD that relate to negative valence symptom dimensions. Project Narrative The proposed study uses novel, advanced imaging techniques (i.e. individual-specific Precision Functional Mapping of resting state functional connectivity MRI), along with new computational tools (i.e. Functional Random Forest) to identify atypical brain physiologies related to negative valence symptoms in trans- diagnostic fashion across ADHD, Autism and typical development. This work will utilize new methods to identify brain biomarkers related to important outcomes of interest (i.e. negative valence symptoms) independent of diagnostic category. The findings from this study will advance our knowledge of the neurobiological underpinnings of negative valence symptomatology, ADHD and Autism, and assist in the improved characterization of homogeneous subtypes for future genetic, functional, and therapeutic investigations.",Identification of outcome-based sub-populations using deep phenotyping and precision functional mapping across ADHD and ASD,9971165,R01MH096773,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anger', 'Anxiety', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Child', 'Child Psychiatry', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computational Science', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Etiology', 'Fright', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Graph', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hybrids', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Myelin', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nature', 'Negative Valence', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pediatrics', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Procedures', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Retinal blind spot', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Youth', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'behavioral study', 'brain behavior', 'clinical care', 'clinical heterogeneity', 'clinical practice', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive development', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'design', 'disorder subtype', 'gray matter', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'network architecture', 'neuroimaging', 'next generation', 'novel', 'parent grant', 'pediatric patients', 'personalized diagnostics', 'random forest', 'symptomatology', 'treatment stratification', 'treatment trial', 'unsupervised learning']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2020,1177059,0.12588059483988875
"Data-driven map of the postsynaptic density to decipher autism pathogenesis PROJECT SUMMARY Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are a group of complex neurodevelopmental diseases that lead to enormous social, emotional, and economic impact. Decades of research have demonstrated the strong genetic contribution to the disease etiology. Many of the high-confidence autism genes are localized to the postsynaptic density (PSD), which is a complex protein-dense structure typically located in the dendritic spine of excitatory synapses. It is comprised of a diverse panel of proteins including master scaffolds, neurotransmitter receptors, and cytoskeleton regulators. Even though studies have shown that disruption of the PSD is a central mechanism of autism, it remains unclear how these genes aggregate in protein pathways and disrupt synaptic function. To better understand the molecular mechanisms of disease in the synapse, the proposed study will construct a comprehensive data-driven model of the PSD to decipher critical pathways in autism and prioritize novel disease candidates. In Aim 1, a random forest model will be trained to predict novel PSD genes, which will be validated through in vitro experiments. The machine learning model will integrate a broad spectrum of different data types to identify PSD genes based on their biological properties such as expression profile, protein structure, and others. The predicted PSD genes will be validated through immunocytochemistry and Western blot analysis in human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)- derived neurons. Aim 2 will organize the identified PSD network into a hierarchical ontology to enable pathway analysis of disease genes. Logistic regression and gene enrichment analysis will be applied to the novel PSD hierarchy to determine key pathways in autism pathogenesis. Aim 3 will leverage the PSD ontology to predict the protein neighbors most likely to be disrupted by ASD genes. To validate the predictions, CRISPR/Cas9 DNA editing system will be used to delete high-confidence ASD genes in hiPSC-derived neurons; quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and biochemical analysis will be completed to characterize the predicted protein neighbors. Collectively, these aims will reveal the critical synaptic pathways in ASD pathogenesis and provide an integrative map for how seemingly disparate disease genes can lead to the same disease phenotypes. These multidisciplinary studies will be the first of their kind in the synapse and will enable the development of novel therapeutic strategies for ASD. The proposed studies will be completed in Dr. Trey Ideker’s lab at UCSD, which is equipped with state-of-the-art instruments to enable the computational and experimental work described. The proposed training plan focuses on gaining expertise in integrative studies, bioinformatics, neuroscience, mentorship, leadership, and communication. Completion of these aims will provide significant experience in all five domains, and facilitate the transition to academic independence. PROJECT NARRATIVE Even though many genes associated with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) have been localized to the postsynaptic density (PSD), the exact molecular mechanisms involved in pathogenesis remain unclear. To address this, the proposed study will construct a data-driven map of the PSD that hierarchically organizes genes into functional pathways. By applying an integrative approach of machine learning and experimental validation, the study will identify novel disease genes and key synaptic mechanisms in ASD.",Data-driven map of the postsynaptic density to decipher autism pathogenesis,10068068,F32MH124408,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Architecture', 'Biochemical', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Child', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'Critical Pathways', 'Cytoskeletal Proteins', 'Cytoskeleton', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Dendritic Spines', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Emotional', 'Enzymes', 'Etiology', 'Excitatory Synapse', 'Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Location', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurotransmitter Receptor', 'Ontology', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Receptor Signaling', 'Research', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Stains', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Training', 'Update', 'Western Blotting', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'cost', 'density', 'disease phenotype', 'economic impact', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'immunocytochemistry', 'in silico', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'insight', 'instrument', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'large scale data', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple data types', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'postsynaptic', 'postsynaptic density protein', 'presynaptic density protein 95', 'protein complex', 'protein expression', 'protein protein interaction', 'protein structure', 'random forest', 'scaffold', 'social', 'supervised learning', 'synaptic function', 'therapy development', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'validation studies']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",F32,2020,69306,0.09806958046849805
"Digitizing Human Vocal Interaction to Understand and Diagnose Autism Abstract This proposal tackles an urgent need for sensitive clinical outcome measures of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) by developing an objective, digital, multi-modal social communication metric using computational linguistics (e.g., acoustic features, turn-taking rates, word frequency metrics). Our automatic speech recognition and natural language analytics approach is designed to fix known weaknesses in traditional measurements by providing granular information in less time, with built-in scalability for characterizing very large samples. Since ASD is defined by observables, it is ripe for an automated approach to digitizing behavior (e.g., words, sounds, facial expressions, motor behaviors). This proposal piggybacks on a recently funded R01 that uses computer vision and machine learning to characterize nonverbal motor synchrony in teens with either ASD or another disorder in a brief social conversation (MH118327, PI: Schultz). Vocal components of the conversation are not studied in MH118327; thus, the richness of the verbal domain is left untapped. We hypothesize that automatically derived spoken language markers will significantly predict group and individual differences in social communication skill, and – when fused with nonverbal features – will lead to better prediction than either modality alone. Together, these two projects represent a rare chance to study all observable social signals emitted during social interaction in the same diverse sample of participants. If funded, this project will be the first to use short conversations and multi-modal data fusion to predict social communication skill and diagnostic group in a large, clinically diverse sample of individuals with ASD and other disorders. Our pilot studies showed that a relatively small set of vocal features from a six-minute interaction predicts diagnosis (ASD vs. typical development [TD]) with 84% accuracy. These machine learning analyses also predicted social communication skill dimensionally, providing a granular metric of individual differences. Combining this approach with nonverbal metrics (R01MH118327) using decision level data fusion resulted in significantly better ASD vs. TD prediction – 91% accuracy. These pilot results are promising, but several gaps remain. In Aim 1 of this proposal, we assess the specificity of our vocal social communication approach by including a non-ASD psychiatric control group in our machine learning classification models, in addition to ASD and TD groups (N=250/group). In Aim 2, we clinically validate our transdiagnostic dimensional metric in a large, diverse sample of participants. In Aim 3, we test whether novel, sophisticated multi-modal fusion methods that combine vocal and nonverbal social communication features result in improved individual and group prediction. This proposal lays critical groundwork for an automated, precision medicine approach to studying, diagnosing, and caring for individuals with ASD and other mental health conditions. Suc- cessful completion of this project will transform how we quantify human behavior for a broad array of applications that demand efficient, scalable, and reliable measurement (e.g., genetic association studies, clinical trials and standard clinical care), thus meeting multiple strategic priorities set by NIMH and NIDCD. Project Narrative At the most basic level, social communication boils down to what you say and what you do while interacting with other people. Problems with social communication affect individuals with ASD throughout their lives, but expensive and time-consuming measurement tools have hindered the development of effective treatments for this core challenge. In this proposal, we aim to improve clinical characterization and diagnostic decision- making in ASD and other psychiatric conditions by digitizing human vocal interaction and using advanced machine learning techniques to fuse audio-video signals into an autism-specific algorithm, thus laying the groundwork for future precision medicine efforts and advancing the state of public health.",Digitizing Human Vocal Interaction to Understand and Diagnose Autism,9866358,R01DC018289,"['Acoustics', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical Trials', 'Companions', 'Complex', 'Computational Linguistics', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Consumption', 'Control Groups', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Furuncles', 'Future', 'Genetic study', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Language', 'Left', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders', 'Outcome Measure', 'Output', 'Participant', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Public Health', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Interaction', 'Specificity', 'Stream', 'Techniques', 'Teenagers', 'Testing', 'Time', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'automated speech recognition', 'clinical care', 'cognitive process', 'data fusion', 'design', 'digital', 'dyadic interaction', 'effective therapy', 'genetic association', 'improved', 'learning classifier', 'meetings', 'motor behavior', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'natural language', 'novel', 'precision medicine', 'skills', 'social', 'social communication', 'social deficits', 'sound', 'tool', 'trait']",NIDCD,CHILDREN'S HOSP OF PHILADELPHIA,R01,2020,589454,0.1293485438290736
"Scalable Computational Platform For Active Closed-Loop Behavioral Coding in Autism Spectrum Disorder SCALABLE COMPUTATIONAL PLATFORM FOR ACTIVE CLOSED-LOOP BEHAVIORAL CODING IN  AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER ABSTRACT Despite significant recent advances in molecular genetics and neuroscience, behavioral ratings based on clinical observations are still the gold standard for screening, diagnosing, and assessing outcomes in neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Such behavioral ratings are subjective, require significant clinician expertise and training, typically do not capture data from the children in their natural environments, and are not scalable for large population screening, low-income communities, or longitudinal monitoring. The development of scalable digital approaches to standardized objective behavioral assessment is thus a significant unmet need in ASD, here addressed via machine learning and computer vision with the goal of providing scalable methods for assessing existing biomarkers, from eye tracking to movement and posture patterns, and tools for novel discovery. Our long-term goal is to develop validated scalable tools for the automatic behavioral analysis of neurodevelopmental disorders. The proposed computational project leverages results and big data derived from our previous studies (N=1,864 participants) and our recently funded NIH Autism Center of Excellence (ACE) award (N=7,436 participants). The ACE project will allow us to develop and validate our tools on several thousand toddlers recruited in Duke pediatric primary care and followed longitudinally for whom gold-standard diagnoses of ASD, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), developmental and language delay and extensive electronic health record (EHR) data will be available; and in a case control study of 224 age-matched groups of young children with ASD, ADHD, and typical development from whom gold-standard diagnostic, extensive phenotypic, Tobii eye- tracking, and EEG will be collected. This project aims to develop novel computational methods using these datasets, from sensing in scalable fashion behaviors such as attention and gaze (Aim 1) and motor/posture (Aim 2), to their multimodal integration (Aim 3). A unique aspect of our computational approach is the closed- loop integration of stimuli design for actively eliciting behavioral symptoms, use of consumer-grade sensors, and automatic behavioral analysis. This contrasts with the current approach of independently selecting stimuli and using expensive lab-based professional grade sensors with off-the-shelf algorithms to capture behavioral biomarkers expected from the stimuli. Our approach involves active elicitation of behavior which is also different from commonly used digital approaches that involve gathering large datasets from passive sensing, such as actigraphy monitoring of spontaneous behavior at home. Our framework results in active closed-loop sensing, where participants are engaged in short and developmentally appropriate activities on ubiquitous devices, while the sensors in the same device capture information for the automatic and quantitative analysis of behavioral biomarkers. This scalable, objective, and standardized way of stimulating, sensing, and analyzing allows the collection of large behavioral datasets for machine learning. SCALABLE COMPUTATIONAL PLATFORM FOR ACTIVE CLOSED-LOOP BEHAVIORAL CODING IN  AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER NARRATIVE Neurodevelopmental disorders such as Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder affect 15% of children, most of them lacking the appropriate access to behavioral assessments for screening, diagnosis, or treatment to help them reach their full potential. To address this challenge, we are developing integrated, objective, and scalable computational tools for digital behavioral phenotyping that are based on computer vision and machine learning. The project brings together expertise in clinical and behavioral science with computer science and engineering to develop improved computational methods for scalable quantitative tools for behavioral assessment that will ultimately increase knowledge and access to screening, diagnosis, and treatment for ASD and other neurodevelopmental disorders.",Scalable Computational Platform For Active Closed-Loop Behavioral Coding in Autism Spectrum Disorder,9984541,R01MH120093,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavior monitoring', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Behavioral Symptoms', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cephalometry', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Funding', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hand', 'Home environment', 'Knowledge', 'Language Delays', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Matched Group', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Periodicity', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Posture', 'Primary Health Care', 'Questionnaires', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Stimulus', 'Symptoms', 'Tablets', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'actigraphy', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'autistic children', 'base', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'computational platform', 'computer design', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'data integration', 'design', 'developmental disease', 'diagnosis standard', 'digital', 'gaze', 'improved', 'large datasets', 'machine learning algorithm', 'motor behavior', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'preference', 'recruit', 'screening', 'sensor', 'social', 'tool', 'visual tracking']",NIMH,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,387808,0.12656611160615594
"Harmonization for multisite Connectomics: parsing heterogeneity and creating markers in ASD Diffusion MRI (dMRI) provides a superior characterization of white matter and connectivity compared to other MRI modalities, and is routinely included in studies of disorders with atypical brain connectivity like autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The field could benefit tremendously from combining studies, to have comprehensive representation of the underlying heterogeneity in connectivity-based disorders. This is rendered challenging by dMRI being very sensitive to acquisition parameters, needing sophisticated statistical harmonization tools due to the complicated effect of scanner related changes. This also calls for a robust automated quality control (QC) protocol prior to data harmonization. Thus, in this proposal, we will develop tools to facilitate integration of dMRI data across studies. In Aim 1, we will develop and validate a deep learning based tool for automating QC for dMRI data that will identify different data artifacts (caused by multiple sources like scanner, coil, scan parameters, motion etc), and the appropriate action that needs to be taken (like motion and eddy correction). In Aim 2, we will develop a suite of tools for harmonizing dMRI measures to remove acquisition differences. The effectiveness of our proposed tools will be demonstrated by harmonizing ~1500 datasets (ages 6-32 years) from 11 ASD studies. These large harmonized datasets create the need for a subject-wise characterization of the sample and for diagnostic markers that harness the imaging heterogeneity of the larger harmonized sample. To address this new need, we will develop additional connectomic analysis tools, that will be adapted to ASD to create the CHARM (Connectomic Heterogeneity in Autism Research through Multi-site dMRI harmonization) suite comprising of a generalizable biomarker of ASD, as well as a dimensional connectomic coordinate system. In Aim 3, we will characterize each subject using a connectivity phenotype, cluster the integrated ASD sample based on this connectivity-phenotype, define a classifier for each cluster; and create a connectivity-based ensemble biomarker of ASD, called the CHARM-marker, combining these cluster-specific classifier decisions. Finally, in Aim 4, we will create a subject-wise characterization of ASD by designing a multi-dimensional connectomic coordinate system using metric learning, to quantify the dissimilarity of each subject from the harmonized healthy controls. We will elucidate the link of these CHARM-coordinates to ASD constructs, by correlating core ASD symptoms with the CHARM coordinates in the harmonized/combined sample. This will enable the ASD community to associate informative connectomic dimensions with each subject, facilitating subject-wise longitudinal assessment, paving the way for precision medicine. Such a group- based and subject-wise characterization of ASD could not have been possible without data integration. Additionally, the neuroimaging community will have new dMRI harmonization and connectomic analysis tools enabling the integration of studies for a more comprehensive connectomic investigation of existing data. It will pave the way for such studies in other connectivity-related disorders that affect mental health. Project narrative The project aims at developing an automated quality assessment protocol and statistical harmonization tools for diffusion MRI data, that will enable the integration of data collected with different acquisition protocols. We will also create connectomic tools that will enable disorder- specific and patient-specific analysis of the harmonized data. Using these methods, we will combine several studies in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and create a biomarker that capitalizes on the underlying imaging heterogeneity in the data, as well as place each ASD subject in a connectomic coordinate system, that will pave the way for precision medicine.",Harmonization for multisite Connectomics: parsing heterogeneity and creating markers in ASD,9927671,R01MH117807,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Anisotropy', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavioral Genetics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diffuse', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Mood Disorders', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Quality Control', 'Research', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Site', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'data harmonization', 'data integration', 'deep learning', 'design', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'indexing', 'large datasets', 'neuroimaging', 'precision medicine', 'preservation', 'repetitive behavior', 'sex', 'social', 'success', 'tool', 'white matter']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2020,760273,0.1898366160609229
"Protecting the privacy of the child through facial identity removal in recorded behavioral observation sessions PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) benefit from specialized services throughout their lifespan. Eligibility for these services is determined by behavioral assessments and clinical observation. In an effort to make the assessment process faster, more reliable, and more accessible, there have been decades of research on the identification of markers that provide insight into ASD. For example, gaze following, eye contact, and gaze aversion are all cues relevant to the assessment of autism. Observations through behavioral assessments, especially in clinical research settings, are often videotaped for purposes such as repeat viewing, record keeping, training, and assessing the longitudinal impact of intervention. However, these videos are often also the basis for explorations of nuances and behavioral signals that may lead to researchers to even stronger and more reliable marker signals to the benefit of the clinical decision-making process. More recently, advances in computational methods such as computer vision techniques have begun to provide new avenues into the discovery and identification of novel behavioral markers associated with ASD. The tuning and training of these techniques relies on the availability of annotated video data for discovery. However, though assessment video datasets are uniquely valuable for these research purposes, it is difficult to share them because of privacy considerations. As a result, the current practice is to tightly control access to video sessions. This study proposes the development of privacy mechanisms for video observation sessions, specifically focusing on mechanisms that protect the facial identity of the child under observation while retaining gaze-based information critical for diagnostic assessments. Our approach is to implement known privacy mechanisms from the third-person video surveillance literature as well as novel mechanisms based on algorithms developed for non-photorealistic rendering and deep neural network based facial transfer that are applicable to this domain. We will evaluate these mechanisms on the extent of anonymization provided and the impact they have on behavioral assessment. The output of this research will be a characterization of known and novel privacy mechanisms with respect to utility for anonymization and behavioral observation. It is our goal that this study create technology to facilitate privacy enabled video data sharing, thus accelerating computational and behavioral research for ASD. Private videos can also be used to create training materials for behavioral analysts, thus increasing the breadth of content they can review in their training, allowing for faster training, enabling remote/online training, and creating opportunities for remote consultation in clinical practice. PROJECT NARRATIVE This study creates methods to protect facial identity of children in videos of recorded behavioral observation sessions. Testing these methods on videos from 50 children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), we will characterize well-established and novel video privacy mechanisms along two dimensions: (1) the extent to which they protect facial identity; and (2) the extent to which they retain the information needed for behavioral observations in the context of ASD assessment.",Protecting the privacy of the child through facial identity removal in recorded behavioral observation sessions,10042998,R21MH123997,"['Address', 'Administrator', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Attitude', 'Authorization documentation', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Research', 'Benchmarking', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Discovery', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Effectiveness', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Equilibrium', 'Excision', 'Eye', 'Face', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health Care Costs', 'Image', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Longevity', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Nature', 'Network-based', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Privacy', 'Privatization', 'Process', 'Process Assessment', 'Remote Consultation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Sharing', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Services', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin', 'Source', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Technics', 'Video Recording', 'Videotape', 'Voice', 'Work', 'autism diagnostic observation schedule', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'autistic children', 'base', 'behavior observation', 'biomarker identification', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinical practice', 'data sharing', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'facial recognition algorithm', 'facial recognition software', 'falls', 'gaze', 'health care delivery', 'heterogenous data', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'multimodal data', 'neural network', 'novel', 'patient privacy', 'preservation', 'psychologic', 'two-dimensional', 'usability']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,R21,2020,416152,0.0987491383724564
"Impact of Multisensory Function on Symptomatology in Young Children with ASD Project Summary/Abstract Atypical responses to sensory stimuli are highly prevalent in autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Somatosensory sensitivities in particular occur prominently and with high frequency in the disorder. While core symptomatology is comprised of both sensory dysfunctions and sociocommunicative deficits, the impact of aberrant somatosensory and multisensory processing on sociocommunication abilities remains unknown. It is not well-understood how sensory discrimination anomalies predict later sociocommunicative impairment, or which manifestations of sensory abnormalities result in more severe outcomes. Thus, the objective of this proposal is to investigate the behavioral and neural patterns underlying somatosensory and multisensory discrimination abnormalities longitudinally in young children with ASD compared to TD peers at 4-5 years and 6-7 years of age and identify potential patterns of developmental causality between sensory and sociocommunicative impairments. We theorize that behavioral dysfunction and disruptions in functional and structural connectivity between neural systems in ASD interfere with normative development. Within this theoretical framework, we make three key predictions regarding sensory processing in ASD: (1) Behavioral manifestations of sensory discrimination anomalies in ASD will be objectively observable and quantifiable; (2) functional and structural connectivity patterns within and between sensory and multisensory networks will be atypical; and (3) these atypical network connections will be linked to behavioral manifestations of sensory abnormalities, and combined will predict later sociocommunicative impairments. To examine these hypotheses, we propose a longitudinal and multimodal approach, including behavioral measures, task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), resting state functional connectivity MRI (fcMRI), diffusion weighted imaging (DWI), and neuropsychological indices, along with machine- learning methods, which will be able to reveal distinct patterns within and across modalities, and pinpoint patterns that may most heavily impact autism symptomatology in young children. The distinct strengths of this proposal lie in the application of quantitative behavioral measures to examine sensory discrimination thresholds in young developmental populations, in combination with the use of advanced neuroimaging tools to measure functional activity and (functional and structural) network connectivity between multiple brain systems and the implementation of machine-learning predictive approaches.  The proposed training plan incorporates analytic approaches to multimodal neuroimaging and machine-learning, as well as training in neuropsychological evaluation and assessment, which are essential to the applicant's research goals of investigating sensory abnormalities in, and atypical development of, the brain and behavior. This career development award will permit her to develop new expertise necessary for successful completion of the proposed research, while building upon her extensive experience of multisensory development and functional neuroimaging in young children. The Psychology Department at San Diego State University, together with the carefully selected mentorship team, will create an exceptional training environment to further her long-term career goal to become a successful, independent autism researcher in the field of developmental cognitive neuroscience with a focus on sensorimotor processing. Project Narrative The proposed research investigation seeks to examine the impact of somatosensory and multisensory abnormalities on sociocommunication deficits in young children with autism longitudinally. Training over the duration of the career development award will emphasize analytic approaches to multimodal neuroimaging and machine-learning, as well as training in neuropsychological assessment, which will provide the PI with expertise necessary for investigating the links between behavioral and neural mechanisms underlying the heterogeneity of sensory manifestations and autism symptomatology. As the increasing prevalence of autism renders it a serious public health issue, findings from the proposed research will have implications for early detection and intervention directed toward sensory processing.",Impact of Multisensory Function on Symptomatology in Young Children with ASD,9936240,K01MH113819,"['7 year old', 'Age', 'Anisotropy', 'Applications Grants', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Mechanisms', 'Brain', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Development', 'Diffuse', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mentorship', 'Modality', 'Neuropsychology', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Psychology', 'Psychophysics', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Sensory', 'Sensory Manifestations', 'Severities', 'Social Interaction', 'Stereotyping', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'TEP1 gene', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'autistic children', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'behavioral impairment', 'brain behavior', 'career', 'cognitive development', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'comparative', 'developmental psychology', 'experience', 'falls', 'haptics', 'imaging modality', 'indexing', 'machine learning method', 'multidisciplinary', 'multimodality', 'multisensory', 'neural patterning', 'neurobehavioral', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'peer', 'relating to nervous system', 'repetitive behavior', 'response', 'sensory cortex', 'sensory discrimination', 'sensory input', 'sensory integration', 'sensory stimulus', 'somatosensory', 'support network', 'symptomatology', 'tool']",NIMH,SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY,K01,2020,195916,0.12300383321881453
"Subnetwork-based Quantitative Imaging Biomarkers for Therapy Assessment in Autism Project Summary Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a developmental disorder characterized by impairment of social interaction and communication, as well as repetitive behaviors, with severity ranging from mild to signiﬁcantly disabling. The prevalence in the United States is rising (currently about 1 in 68 children) and the associated costs are great. In our most recent previous efforts on this project, we have initiated development of a graph-based, Bayesian neuroimage analysis framework and have used it to characterize brain pathology in ASD and identify abnormal functional subnetworks from groupwise data. Key results demonstrated clear differences in task- based functional brain networks between ASD and typically developing control (TDC) groups associated with the perception of biological motion. While our efforts (and those of others) are important for characterizing ASD, advances in the characterization of response to therapy with imaging are crucial for improved understanding, and ultimately personalization, of these therapies. Thus, we propose to put forth a bold new direction: to further develop our analysis methodology and study these task-based subnetworks, now with the goal of characterizing individuals in terms of their predicted response to treatment. We will focus on Pivotal Response Treatment (PRT), an intensive behavioral therapy for children with ASD that improves social communication skills. We ﬁrst propose to fully develop our uniﬁed Bayesian framework to detect both hyper- and hypo-synchronous functional subnetworks within whole-brain, groupwise, task-based fMRI data on a large training dataset of ASD and TDC subjects. We will identify dense subgraphs (communities) that exhibit group differences in functional synchrony between ASD and TDC groups. The groupwise subnetworks will then be mapped to single subject, task-based fMRI data acquired from a cohort of ASD subjects treated with PRT. For each subject, imaging biomarkers based on activation signal strength and functional connectivity will be derived for regions within each hyper- and hypo- synchronous subnetwork at both baseline and after 16 weeks of therapy. Using a random forest regression strategy, we will use a combination of biomarkers from the baseline data to predict response to PRT (using change in Social Responsiveness Scale, 2nd Edition as the primary clinical outcome measure). In addition, we will use a combination of biomarkers from baseline and 16 weeks to predict treatment persistence at 32 weeks. We will compare the prediction capability of our new approach using task-based fMRI to a set of biomarkers with regions identiﬁed from groupwise analysis of resting state fMRI (rsfMRI) networks found from the same training subjects noted above using an alternative state-of-the-art method. We will also develop methods to examine potential metabolic alterations in networks using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) of GABA and glutamate (the major excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters) to explore possible biochemical differences associated with ASD, changes in response to PRT and the use of this information as additional imaging biomarkers. Project Narrative Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a difﬁcult and growing problem. The goal of this project is to develop sensi- tive and quantitative imaging and image analysis methodology for the study of ASD aimed at measuring brain pathology and using it to characterize and predict response to therapy.

"Data-driven multidimensional modeling of nonverbal communication in typical and atypical development ABSTRACT This proposal will develop innovative technology for data-driven, multimodal characterization of nonverbal communication (NVC) in typical and atypical development. Prior research has provided qualitative descriptions of the development of children's use of gaze and gesture to regulate social interactions, but there are no objective, automated tools for measuring NVC behaviors, nor computational models to explain their coordination and timing in social interactions. This proposal will apply advanced probabilistic modeling techniques from machine learning and data mining to a rich corpus of children's behavior, including automated measures of children's posture, head pose, gaze direction, arm movements, and hand configurations derived from color and depth cameras and accelerometers. By automatically learning probabilistic latent variable models from movement data, we will obtain compact, data-driven descriptions of NVC and its coordination in children with autism, children with developmental delays without autism, and typically developing children (Aim 1). We will validate our models by demonstrating their ability to predict children's behavior, including diagnostic group and one-year language outcomes (Aim 2). We will test whether novel NVC patterns can be uncovered with bottom-up clustering of motor movement data (Aim 3). We predict our models will have greater explanatory and predictive power compared to current measures of NVC, which are typically human-coded behaviors that are descriptive, but rely on a-priori definitions of higher level behaviors. The models we develop will capture the fine-grained structure, coordination, and timing of NVC behaviors during social interactions, and thus allow us to characterize these behaviors with an unprecedented level of detail. Because interventions for young children with ASD target NVC skills, our automated measurement tools will provide clinicians with powerful new tools to assess the extent to which these treatments are efficacious. In addition, automated tools for dense measurement of fine-grained changes in NVC would enable clinicians to assess profiles of strengths and weaknesses for purposes of treatment planning, to dynamically tailor treatment to clients' changing abilities, and ultimately to accurately capture whether treatment is working. Finally, the measurement capabilities will provide researchers with a novel, cost-effective approach to analyze video recordings, at a scale that is not currently feasible due to a reliance on human coding.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) affects 1 in 68 children in the US. This project is focused on developing automated tools to characterize behaviors considered to be core, early emerging markers of autism, and that represent common treatment targets in this group. This has clear implications for identifying those at risk for autism and for ongoing clinical care.",Data-driven multidimensional modeling of nonverbal communication in typical and atypical development,9929027,R01MH114999,"['Accelerometer', 'Affect', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Child', 'Child Behavior', 'Child Development', 'Client', 'Code', 'Color', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Development', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Diagnostic', 'Face', 'Future', 'Gestures', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Hand', 'Head', 'Human', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Nonverbal Communication', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Posture', 'Production', 'Property', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Series', 'Social Interaction', 'Statistical Models', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Video Recording', 'Visit', 'Wrist', 'arm movement', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'autistic children', 'base', 'clinical care', 'common treatment', 'communication behavior', 'cost effective', 'data mining', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'gaze', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'innovative technologies', 'joint attention', 'language outcome', 'machine learning method', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'sensor', 'skills', 'social communication', 'tool', 'treatment planning']",NIMH,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2020,341605,0.07336187884981064
"Neurocomputational mechanisms of proactive social behavior deficits in autism spectrum disorder Project Summary Social interaction deficits are at the crux of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and contribute to significant functional impairment, including poorer relationship quality and low employment rates in individuals with ASD. Despite an enormous amount of research dollars invested and thousands of research papers published on the topic, we remain far from understanding the basic neural computations underlying social processes in ASD. In the current proposal, we posit that this information gap is due in part to the rarity with which computational model- based analyses are used in ASD neuroimaging research. Additionally, most studies use passive paradigms (e.g. face perception) rather than examining brain functioning while participants engage in ecologically-relevant, interactive social tasks more akin to the type of interactions with which people with ASD struggle in their daily lives. This proposal takes an innovative computational psychiatry approach to understanding aberrant neural computations of social interactions in ASD, using high-resolution (7T) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and virtual reality-like tasks that test individuals’ abilities to proactively and dynamically engage in simulated social interactions. In particular, we focus on the ability of individuals with ASD to: 1) discriminate and track levels of closeness and power when navigating social interactions in a choose-your-own-adventure style interactive paradigm, and 2) understand and adapt to social norms and exert control over social others in the context of a proactive social exchange paradigm. We use novel computational models to examine the neural computations and connectivity underlying proactive social behavior, focusing on brain regions (e.g., hippocampus) that have been understudied in the context of social deficits in ASD. Finally, we use machine learning approaches to explore ASD heterogeneity along dimensions of dynamic and proactive social interactions and apply these indices to make clinically-meaningful predictions. We hypothesize that: 1) hippocampal tracking of social space will be less robust in ASD as compared to neurotypical controls and will correlate with social symptoms; 2) ASD individuals will show slower norm adaptation rate, greater aversion to norm violation, and reduced social controllability, accompanied by reduced neural encoding of social values in anterior insula and ventral striatum; and 3) these parameters will help identify subtypes of ASD and predict ASD- relevant outcomes (e.g. social skills, adaptive social functioning, quality of life). We expect that findings from this project will break new ground and fill critical knowledge gaps regarding the neurobiology of ASD. In particular, we expect our findings will greatly enhance understanding of the neural and computational mechanisms underlying deficits in proactive social behavior in ASD and will allow us to identify distinct, neurobiologically- driven clusters. In so doing, the results of this project could offer new tools by which to subtype the ASD phenotype and provide novel insights into treatment targets. Project Narrative Despite social deficits being core features of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and contributing to relationship difficulties and low employment rates, their neurobiological underpinnings are poorly understood. The goal of this study is to gain new knowledge about the brain mechanisms underlying social deficits in autism using computational modeling, novel brain imaging tools, and interactive experimental tasks that simulate dynamic social interactions. In contributing to our understanding of the brain basis of ASD, this study may unveil new directions for intervention.",Neurocomputational mechanisms of proactive social behavior deficits in autism spectrum disorder,10130086,R01MH122611,"['Affect', 'Anterior', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Caregivers', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Employment', 'Environment', 'Face', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hippocampal Formation', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Inferior', 'Insula of Reil', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Participant', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Psychiatry', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Adjustment', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Controls', 'Social Environment', 'Social Functioning', 'Social Interaction', 'Social Processes', 'Social Values', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'United States', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'cingulate cortex', 'computational neuroscience', 'computer framework', 'cost', 'disorder control', 'effective intervention', 'face perception', 'functional disability', 'functional outcomes', 'geometric structure', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'rapid growth', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'social', 'social communication', 'social deficits', 'social learning', 'social neuroscience', 'social norm', 'social relationships', 'social skills', 'social space', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'unsupervised learning', 'vector', 'virtual', 'virtual reality']",NIMH,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2020,788061,0.152599250100754
"Harnessing Electronic Health Records to Identify Participants and to Study Health Outcomes in Transition-Age Youth and Adults with Autism Spectrum Disorder The health care needs of individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are complex and multifaceted, with access to quality care a major challenge. Co-occurring physical and mental health conditions are highly prevalent in transition-age youth (TAY) and adults with ASD. Treating these conditions represents an important avenue for improving quality of life in this population. Provider-based training programs, such as Project Extension for Community Health Care Outcomes (Project ECHO), has been shown to increase provider knowledge self-efficacy, although their impact on health care outcomes and health care utilization in TAY/adults with ASD is understudied. The overarching goal of this K18 application is to provide training in health services research related to TAY/adults with ASD, specifically focused on harnessing data from electronic health records (EHR) to study health outcomes in future interventional studies. These skills are preparatory to designing and carrying out a rigorous future trial of Project ECHO is TAY/adults with ASD. In the K18, I will use deidentified datasets at Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC) and Kaiser-Permanente Northern California (KPNC). My research specific aims are (1) Determine the utility of applying novel algorithms for identifying and characterizing cases of TAY/adults with ASD within the VUMC deidentified EHR and (2) Analyze how common physical and mental health conditions and measures of health care utilization change with increasing age in in an existing longitudinal cohort of TAY/adults with ASD within the KPNC EHR. My training goals are (1) Learn how to use pragmatic tools, such as natural language processing and phecodes, to identify TAY/adults with ASD and co-occurring conditions and (2) Learn how to analyze longitudinal health data. I will obtain this training through mentorship provided by Dr. Lisa Croen of KPNC and Drs. Jeffrey Neul and Lea Davis of VUMC as I conduct my research project. Formal coursework in Bioinformatics and Epidemiology, along with Responsible Conduct of Research, will enhance my practical experience. The environment provided by VUMC and KPNC is ideal for this training, given the expertise of both institutions in cutting-edge EHR-related research. The project is innovative given the proposed use of novel tools for identification and characterization of TAY/adults with ASD, and the proposed analysis of longitudinal EHR data related to health conditions and health care utilization. PROJECT NARRATIVE Increased prevalence of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is accompanied by a rising tide of adolescents with ASD who are entering adulthood and have complex healthcare needs Testing the effectiveness of provider training models to care for transition age youth (TAY) and adults with ASD requires skills in (1) identification and characterization of TAY/adults with ASD, and (2) analysis of longitudinal data on health conditions and health care utilization.

"A Longitudinal MRI Study Characterizing Very Early Brain Development in Infants with Down Syndrome Longitudinal MRI Characterization of Very Early Brain Development  in Infants with Down Syndrome Project Summary/Abstract Down syndrome (DS), the most common genetic cause of intellectual disability, is associated with varying degrees of cognitive and behavioral impairments. Pharmacologic therapies and genetic modulators are emerging which, if administered early in conjunction with traditional therapies, show promise for improving developmental outcomes in children with DS. However, the stark absence of early neurodevelopment knowledge in DS hampers these efforts. The main goal of this proposal is to develop biomarkers as future targets for specific therapies based on careful characterization of early aberrant neurodevelopmental patterns. This study will be a combined effort with WU as the coordinating center and six other research groups: UNC, UW, CHOP, MNI, NYU, and University of Minnesota. These groups comprise the ACE-IBIS (Autism Center of Excellence Infant Brain Imaging Study) network, a well-established and experienced group that has been productively collaborating for 8 years on MRI imaging and behavioral characterization of infants at high risk for autism, healthy typical infants (TYP), and infants with Fragile X. The aims of this proposal are: 1) Define the longitudinal characteristics of early brain development in infants (3 to 24 months) with DS in comparison to TYP infants and infants with other developmental disabilities (ASD and Fragile X) using three different types of neuroimaging (MRI, DTI, rsfMRI); 2) Develop predictive models for developmental outcomes in infants with DS based on longitudinal structural or functional MRI characteristics; and 3) Characterize brain-behavior correlates with coordinated multimodal imaging in infancy characterizing the interrelationship between longitudinal network imaging parameters and cognitive, behavioral and neurodevelopmental outcomes using sophisticated multivariate support vector machine (SVM) analytic strategies. 120 infants with DS and 40 TYP control infants will be followed longitudinally from 3 to 24 months. MRI scans will be obtained during natural sleep and a series of well-validated developmental and behavioral assessments will be completed at each visit. This project will be the first to define the nature and timing of alterations in brain development in infants with DS. The proposed project addresses several key research recommendations from the “NICHD 2014-The NIH Research Plan on Down Syndrome.” The study aims match the recommendation for the quantitative characterization based on imaging of early brain development and the relationship of cognitive, behavioral and social development to early aberrant neurodevelopment in DS. This project will also address recommendations for investigation of comorbid ASD in DS, which could be as high as 5-10%. The IBIS network is uniquely qualified to examine early neurodevelopmental patterns, utilizing the ASD, TYP and FraX infant data sets to better characterize and examine specificity of DS early developmental patterns including ASD qualities and impairments in social development. It is clear that quantification of neurodevelopmental trajectories in infants with DS will be critical to identification of personalized intervention strategies and to assess the efficacy of early life, targeted, highly novel and mechanistically specific DS interventions. Project Narrative Down's syndrome (DS), the most common genetic cause of intellectual disability, is associated with a wide range of cognitive and behavioral impairments. Through the use of cutting edge MRI technology that allows us to look at the shape, function, and connections within the brain, we will be able to study and better understand early brain development in infants with DS. Working toward the goal to be able to assess the impact of specific early intervention therapies that are most helpful in improving the developmental outcomes of children with DS. This study mirrors and expands on the study designs and techniques that were developed to study infants with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), Fragile X, and typically developing infants, and will allow us to further our understanding of maturation patterns of infant brains that we can apply to DS, ASD, Fragile X, and other disabilities.",A Longitudinal MRI Study Characterizing Very Early Brain Development in Infants with Down Syndrome,9998993,R01HD088125,"['Address', 'Age', 'Age-Months', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Attention', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cerebellum', 'Cerebrum', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Developmental Disabilities', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion', 'Down Syndrome', 'Early Intervention', 'Evaluation', 'Fragile X Syndrome', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Intellectual functioning disability', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Life', 'Life Expectancy', 'Live Birth', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Minnesota', 'Motor', 'Motor Skills', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Myelin', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Nature', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacology', 'Pregnancy', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Rest', 'Sedation procedure', 'Sensory', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Sleep', 'Social Development', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Thick', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Visit', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'behavioral impairment', 'brain behavior', 'cognitive development', 'comorbidity', 'congenital heart disorder', 'data acquisition', 'developmental disease', 'disability', 'experience', 'functional disability', 'gastrointestinal', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'infancy', 'malformation', 'morphometry', 'multimodality', 'neural circuit', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'personalized intervention', 'predictive modeling', 'preservation', 'recruit', 'skills', 'support vector machine', 'targeted treatment', 'traditional therapy', 'visual tracking', 'white matter']",NICHD,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,2368051,0.09102282565521008
"Investigating quantitative signatures of autism in toddlers PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) are complex disorders manifested by qualitatively atypical social communication skills and an aberrant behavioral repertoire that vary in severity across individuals. We lack neurobiologically-grounded predictors of autism in the general population. Our studies seek to fill this critical gap in our knowledge about neurobiologically-grounded quantitative signatures that precede manifestations of ASD in toddlers recruited from the general population. We aim to (i) apply advanced computational analytic techniques to formally chart the emergence of atypical developmental trajectories, and (ii) uncover and validate neurobiologically-grounded, clinically meaningful subtypes predictive of future risk for atypical development, revolutionizing brain imaging in young children. In our previous work we have discovered that head movements during functional MRI provide an abundant source of useful movement data whose statistical features are linked to clinical and cognitive outcomes in children and adults diagnosed with ASD. Our recent studies have revealed that quantitative signatures of atypical learning trajectories can be detected as early as 1-2 months in infants at high familial risk for developing ASD. Atypical functioning of the sensorimotor system has deleterious functional consequences across diverse domains of learning and development and may contribute to ASD manifestations, in toddlers screened prospectively in the general population. Using data from the NIH-funded National Database for Autism Research (NDAR) we will test whether atypical movement variability during MRI scans during the 2nd year of life in N=212 toddlers from the general population is predictive of ASD or non-ASD outcomes (vs. typical development, TD) ascertained during the 3rd year. We will rigorously quantify key kinematic parameters during MRI scans acquired in toddlers ages 12-24 months according to different conditions, including sleeping or resting, while language is presented to sleeping toddlers, and also during a socially-orienting scan. We hypothesize that deleterious, context-incongruent signatures during the 2nd year of life in toddlers will be related subsequently to greater ASD manifestations at 36-48 months. Machine learning algorithms will be used to classify ASD, non-ASD, and TD toddlers. The overall goal of these studies is to illuminate the neurobiological basis of sensorimotor variability in toddlers from the general population and to establish that sensorimotor signatures are part and parcel of the child’s future ASD diagnosis, a finding which will have profound, transformative implications for neuroimaging methods in young children. This knowledge will provide new, early mechanistic insights into the basis of such associations recently established in children, adolescents, and adults with and without ASD, as well as in human infants, and advance Research Priorities of the NIMH. PROJECT NARRATIVE Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) are complex neurodevelopmental disorders manifested by atypical social communication and behavioral repertoire. The current studies aim to reveal how sensorimotor impairments may underlie, contribute, and regulate the neurobiology of this condition in toddlers recruited from the general population during the 2nd year of life and who were assessed for ASD vs. non-ASD outcomes during the 3rd year of life. Features of the neurobiologically grounded subtypes of ASD developed as part of this proposal will be used in future studies to predict diagnosis of neurodevelopmental disorders, in children with low-functioning form of ASD, those at risk for developing ASD, and those children with related disorders of neurodevelopment.",Investigating quantitative signatures of autism in toddlers,9866342,R01MH121605,"['3 year old', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Behavioral', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Equilibrium', 'Esthesia', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gaussian model', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Head Movements', 'Hearing', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Motor', 'Motor Activity', 'Movement', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Perception', 'Probability', 'Research', 'Research Priority', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Sensorimotor functions', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Siblings', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'cognitive development', 'cohort', 'design', 'functional MRI scan', 'insight', 'kinematics', 'machine learning algorithm', 'male', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'predictive signature', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'sensorimotor system', 'sex', 'skills', 'social', 'social communication', 'sound']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY TEACHERS COLLEGE,R01,2020,366973,0.23922614988066404
"Neural Mechanisms and Developmental Trajectories of ASD and ADHD Project Summary/Abstract Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are common neurodevelopmental disorders which exhibit enormous variability in their developmental trajectories. ASD and ADHD also frequently co-occur, such that ASD is associated with elevated ADHD symptoms and vice versa. Notably, such co-occurring ASD and ADHD symptoms are associated with greater impairment, as well as reduced treatment responsiveness. However, the convergent and divergent neural underpinnings of ASD and ADHD remain poorly understood, impeding the personalization of current treatments and the development of more targeted ones. Furthermore, it is not yet possible to predict how an individual’s symptoms will change over development. Yet, such predictions could be advantageous for treatment planning. The current project will improve our understanding of the shared and distinct neural mechanisms underlying ASD and ADHD, as well as our ability to predict how an individual’s symptoms may evolve over time. Specifically, this study will use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to investigate the functional and structural properties of the brain in ASD and ADHD by comparing the following groups: ASD, ADHD, comorbid ASD+ADHD, and neurotypical controls. Analyses will be completed in both a lifespan sample (ages 5-65; N>2,700) and a pediatric sample (ages 9-10; N>4,900). Functional connectivity will be calculated from resting-state functional MRI scans, structural connectivity from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) scans, and structural morphometry measures from T1-weighted structural MRI scans. This multimodal neuroimaging data will also be used with baseline symptom severity to predict trajectories of ASD, ADHD, and internalizing (e.g., anxious, depressive) symptoms between late childhood (ages 9-11) and early adolescence (ages 11-13) in a longitudinal sample (N>700). Ridge regression analyses conducted within each diagnostic group will reveal whether such brain-based information significantly improves predictive ability compared to symptom severity alone. These analyses will be conducted both within groups defined by traditional diagnostic categories and within transdiagnostic brain-based subgroups to determine the potential utility of such subgroups in increasing predictive accuracy; these subtypes will be created using similarity network fusion on subjects’ multimodal neuroimaging data, followed by spectral clustering. As a whole, this project will allow the applicant to receive extensive training in cutting-edge neuroimaging methods, machine learning approaches (ridge regression and spectral clustering), and conducting translational research. Most importantly, findings from this research will improve our understanding of the shared and distinct mechanisms of ASD and ADHD, which may ultimately lead to more tailored treatments. Furthermore, the proposed research may significantly improve our ability to predict how an individual’s symptoms will change over time. This could have a direct impact on individual treatment planning, as well as the design and implementation of future treatment studies. Project Narrative Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) commonly co-occur and exhibit extraordinarily heterogenous developmental trajectories. This project will improve our understanding of the shared and distinct neural mechanisms of ASD and ADHD, as well as how such brain-based information may improve our ability to predict longitudinal symptom trajectories. This will benefit public health by contributing to the development of more personalized treatments for these disorders, in addition to allowing for improved treatment planning.",Neural Mechanisms and Developmental Trajectories of ASD and ADHD,10066250,F32MH122057,"['11 year old', '13 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Age', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Base of the Brain', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Child Behavior Checklist', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Corpus Callosum', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Exhibits', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Impairment', 'Impulsive Behavior', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Inferior', 'Lead', 'Longevity', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Property', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Regression Analysis', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Social Network', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Work', 'Youth', 'anxious', 'associated symptom', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'autistic', 'base', 'cognitive development', 'comorbidity', 'course development', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'diffusion anisotropy', 'early adolescence', 'functional MRI scan', 'improved', 'inattention', 'individualized medicine', 'machine learning algorithm', 'morphometry', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'neuropsychiatric symptom', 'personalized medicine', 'relating to nervous system', 'social', 'social cognition', 'symptomatology', 'therapy development', 'trait', 'treatment planning', 'white matter']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,F32,2020,67254,0.1697342745419447
"1/2-Testing the impact of early screening on the long-term outcomes of children with ASD Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) impacts almost 2% of children born today, yet very little is known regarding how to positively alter the outcomes of affected children. On the one hand, many, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, believe that early universal screening at well baby check‐ups is an important step towards a positive outcome because it can lead to early treatment. In contrast, the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recently failed to endorse early universal ASD screening, noting that the benefits of doing so are poorly understood. What is needed to inform the debate is to examine the outcomes of a large cohort of children detected very early via universal screening at well‐baby checks, and to compare them to children who did not participate in an early detection program. Here we propose to do just that: We will examine the school age outcomes (age 6‐10 years) of an unprecedented sample size of 242 children with ASD detected very early in San Diego and Phoenix (i.e., “west coast cohort”) through our Get SET Early program, which involved screening with the CSBS at well baby check‐ ups (mean age 17.7 months, range 12‐24 months), and immediate referral for comprehensive evaluation and treatment if warranted. They will then be compared to a cohort of 242 ASD community children matched on age, gender, race, ethnicity, and SES who did not participate in our early detection program (Total N = 484). Given the rarity and uniqueness of our cohort, we plan to characterize outcomes not only on traditional measures of cognition, social behavior, etc., but also on outcome on school achievement (e.g., fully mainstreamed and/or lost their diagnosis) and family functioning (do families experience less stress?). Since the national mean age of ASD diagnosis is around 4 years, we expect that children in the community cohort will have later ages of diagnosis and poorer outcomes than those identified early via the Get SET Early program. With scientific rigor and reproducibility in mind, we will proactively test the replication of findings in an independent cohort (N=103) of toddlers screened in Boston, Philadelphia, and New Haven (i.e., “east coast cohort”) through Project Early and a matched community cohort from the same region (Total N=120). Our specific aims are: AIM 1a: we will identify clinically meaningful outcome subtypes of ASD in our west coast cohort using unbiased network clustering approaches. AIM 1b: with this unique longitudinal cohort, we will examine changes in symptom profile, IQ and adaptive functioning between toddler and school ages. AIM 1c: we will evaluate program impact by comparing the outcomes children in our early‐detected to the community cohort. AIM 1d: we will examine how well findings are replicated in our East coast sample. AIM 2: using complimentary regression and machine learning techniques, with our total sample collapsed across both west and east coast cohorts (N=602), we will test our model that earlier age at identification and treatment leads to improved outcomes. To examine other factors relating to a good outcome, moderating variables such as SES and level of treatment participation will also be included in our models. AIM 3: since state context (e.g., policies, guidelines) could also play a role in outcomes, in we plan to collect key state‐level information to place our findings in context. ASD impacts almost 2% of children, yet factors that positively alter outcomes are uncertain and sharply-debated by the American Academy of Pediatrics that believes early universal screening at well baby check-ups is an important step towards better outcomes, and the United States Preventative Services Task Force that recently failed to endorse early universal screening for ASD. To objectively resolve this impasse, innovative biostatistical and machine learning methods will be used to compare the long-term clinical, educational and family outcomes of two separate cohorts of children initially detected as ASD between ages 12-24 months via universal screening at well-baby checks to outcomes of children with ASD who did not participate in an early detection program.

"Objective, MRI biomarkers for pre-symptomatic detection of autism spectrum disorder at 6 months old: commercial software development and optimization Project Summary Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a broad diagnosis for a disorder characterized by symptoms affecting repetitive behavior, social communication, and cognitive ability. 1 in 68 children in the US is affected with ASD (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2017) and the likelihood that a child will be affected with ASD is 10 times higher if they have a sibling with ASD. Traditionally, diagnosis occurs most frequently between age 3 to 6 and severe ASD can be diagnosed as early as 18 months. The infant brain is most plastic and susceptible to intervention in the first year of life. As such, there exists an infant population that is either diagnosed too late to receive a more-effective intervention or with a false negative diagnosis, or both. Thus, earlier prediction of the development of ASD can deliver improved likelihood of favorable outcomes. This Fast-Track proposal seeks to develop, standardize, and commercialize software methods and algorithms for neurobehavioral disorder prediction, creating objective biomarkers in a space dominated by subjective neurobehavioral testing and providing a software as a medical device that is a single, integrated, easy-to-use solution for MRI processing, analysis, and syndrome prediction. To create a Minimum Viable Product (MVP), we will: pull existing, academically vetted methods and software into a commercial design control process (Phase I, SA1); verify the integrated, full-stack solution on a set of IBIS Network data sets stored in the National Database for Autism Research (NDAR) and evaluate potential sources of classification error (Phase I, SA2); and conduct an Alpha release to IBIS Network sites for user interface and human factors feedback (Phase I, SA3).We will build the MVP into a commercially viable product as we: expand the utility of the pipeline to accommodate data sets not acquired at IBIS Network sites, optimize manual Quality Control (QC) workflows through semi-automated user interface design, integrate cortical surface area, cortical volume, functional connectivity, and other measurements into a common user interface and workflow, migrate image processing, machine learning, and database infrastructure to cloud-based tools that can scale on-demand, and iterate on the user experience given Alpha feedback (Phase II, SA1); evaluate synthetic data designed to approximate results from multiple MRI scanner types and signal to noise ratio conditions to ensure broad applicability of the software in clinical settings; expand the utility of the machine learning feature analysis and classification to include additional features and evaluate non-binary feature spaces, conduct latent variable analysis to identify one or more scale metrics for ASD prediction; and vet the new metrics through a thorough review of IBIS Network data and comparison with Alpha release results (Phase III, SA2); and develop a data report for clinical use and patient education, conduct a Beta release test across IBIS Network sites and at least one non-IBIS Network site; and perform formal software verification and validation to prepare for broader distribution of the software platform (Phase III, SA3). Narrative MRI technology is rapidly advancing our understanding of how the brain develops in the presence of neurobehavioral disorders like Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). This Fast-Track proposal seeks to develop, standardize, and commercialize software methods and algorithms for ASD prediction using structural and functional MRI data acquired on infants, creating objective biomarkers in a space dominated by subjective neurobehavioral testing and providing a software as a medical device that is a single, integrated, easy-to-use solution for MRI processing, analysis, and prediction of syndrome development. This technology will provide first-of-its kind, objective, brain-based biomarkers that will enable development of effective, early interventions and improve the standard of care for infants at high risk of developing ASD.","Objective, MRI biomarkers for pre-symptomatic detection of autism spectrum disorder at 6 months old: commercial software development and optimization",9797688,R44MH118763,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Age-Months', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Base of the Brain', 'Biological Markers', 'Blinded', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Ensure', 'Feedback', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Human', 'Infant', 'Infant Care', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Medical Device', 'Methods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patient Education', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Process', 'Quality Control', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Scanning', 'Siblings', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Software Tools', 'Software Validation', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Technology', 'TensorFlow', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'brain morphology', 'clinical application', 'clinically relevant', 'cloud based', 'cognitive ability', 'commercialization', 'computerized data processing', 'data standards', 'design', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'high risk', 'image processing', 'improved', 'instrument', 'magnetic resonance imaging biomarker', 'neurobehavioral disorder', 'neurobehavioral test', 'patient variability', 'repetitive behavior', 'social communication', 'software development', 'standard of care', 'tool', 'verification and validation']",NIMH,"PRIMENEURO, INC.",R44,2020,1081815,0.1629137995071655
"Testing the Bottom-Up vs Top-Down Imbalance Hypothesis of ASD ABSTRACT / PROJECT SUMMARY  Functional connectivity in the brains of individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) has emerged as an important marker of neural abnormalities associated with the disorder. However, despite hundreds of studies on the topic, the specific nature of functional connectivity abnormalities that characterize the disorder remains unresolved and no unifying framework has emerged to describe it. Constructing a consistent model of the functional connectivity abnormalities that underlie ASD is absolutely essential for advancing our understanding of the neural etiology of the disorder. While the commonly accepted model is one where long- range functional connectivity is decreased in ASD while local functional connectivity is increased, many studies have shown increased or normal long-range functional connectivity in ASD and the evidence supporting the hypothesis that local functional connectivity is increased remains scant and indirect.  To date, the vast majority of studies of functional connectivity in ASD have been carried out using fMRI, a technique that relies on the hemodynamic response and thus has a temporal resolution of <1Hz. It is well known, however, that functional connectivity is usually mediated by much faster frequency bands, commonly divided into five fundamental frequency bands: delta (1-2 Hz), theta (3-7 Hz), alpha (8-12 Hz), beta (13-30 Hz), and gamma (31-80 Hz). There is also recent evidence that these frequency bands mediate functional connectivity with preferred directionality. Based on our own preliminary data and current studies, we propose to test the hypothesis that ASD is characterized by increased long-range bottom-up (feedforward) functional connectivity, alongside decreased long-range top-down (feedback ) functional connectivity, and that the gamma and beta frequency bands, respectively, mediate these functional connectivity abnormalities.  Here, we propose to test our hypothesis by obtaining MEG (magnetoencephalography) data from two spatial attention paradigms, visual and auditory, optimized for assessing bottom-up versus top-down functional connectivity, in 50 TD and 60 ASD individuals, ages 14-17. Specifically, we propose the following aims: (1) Test the hypothesis that bottom-up functional connectivity is abnormally increased in ASD in the auditory and visual domains, and this is manifested primarily in the gamma frequency band. (2) Test the hypothesis that top- down functional connectivity is abnormally reduced in ASD in the auditory and visual domains, and this is manifested primarily in the beta frequency band. (3) Test the hypothesis that neurophysiological functional connectivity measures derived using MEG will be predictive of ASD severity, diagnosis, and behavioral features, using robust correlations, canonical correlations, and machine learning techniques. We expect that the results of this study will lead to a substantially more detailed, comprehensive, and mechanistically motivated framework for the wide range of functional connectivity abnormalities observed in ASD. Project Narrative (Relevance to Public Health) The proposed research will elucidate the neurophysiological underpinnings of specific functional connectivity abnormalities in autism spectrum disorders (ASD) with an unprecendent level of detail. It will advance the field by elucidating specific abnormalities, and potentially reconciling over prior disparate results. The outcomes of this study could potentially contribute to treatments designs, and give a neurophysiological picture of connectivity abnormalities detailed enough to advance the field of animal models for ASD.",Testing the Bottom-Up vs Top-Down Imbalance Hypothesis of ASD,9960583,R01MH117998,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Age', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Attention', 'Auditory', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Etiology', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Generations', 'Grouping', 'Individual', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetoencephalography', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Nature', 'Outcome Study', 'Plant Roots', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Sensory', 'Severities', 'Social Interaction', 'Specificity', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Visual', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'hemodynamics', 'millisecond', 'neurophysiology', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'somatosensory', 'temporal measurement', 'therapy design']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2020,796501,0.1189532694055935
"Gene-brain-environment interactions as determinants of typical and atypical developmental trajectories Project Summary Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a heritable neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by heterogeneous genetic etiology and behavioral symptomatology. While recent genetics research suggests that the cumulative effects of many single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on many genes confer increased risk of ASD, very little is known about how additive genetic risk impacts brain function and structure. My dissertation work leverages variation at the genetic, neural, and behavioral levels by investigating how cumulative genetic risk for ASD on a gene implicated in social behavior across species – the oxytocin receptor gene (OXTR) – impacts network-level activity and connectivity in brain regions critical for social reward processing, and how risk-allele dosage relates to individual differences in ASD symptomatology. Results of my first dissertation study have shown that OXTR risk-allele dosage modulates resting-state connectivity of the reward network in both youth with ASD and typically developing (TD) youth, although in different ways. In youth with ASD, greater OXTR risk is associated with reduced connectivity between nodes of the reward circuit and greater symptom severity. Conversely, in TD youth, greater OXTR risk-allele dosage is associated with greater connectivity between the reward network and frontal brain regions involved in mentalizing and this, in turn, is associated with better social functioning (Hernandez et al., 2016a). These findings in TD youth suggest a compensatory neural mechanism in the face of increased genetic risk for ASD, and raise further questions about the role of other genetic (i.e., epistatic) and environmental/experiential variables in steering development along typical vs. atypical trajectories. My ongoing dissertation study examines the moderating effects of diagnosis and gender on the relationship between OXTR risk-allele dosage and neural processing of social rewards using functional neuroimaging (fMRI). While I have gained strong expertise in connectivity-based neuroimaging, genetics, and the neurobiology of ASD, my last dissertation project will provide additional training in analysis of task-related fMRI data and assessment of changes in task-based functional connectivity (i.e., training in psychophysiological interaction analyses). My dissertation work thus far highlights how little is known about the mechanisms by which individuals with the same genetic risk for mental illness have different outcomes (i.e., affected vs. resilient). As a post-doctoral researcher, I aim to gain additional training in the assessment of environmental and experiential variables that affect neurodevelopmental outcomes, as well as in advanced data-analytic approaches to model multilevel interactions between gene-brain-environment measures (e.g., statistical analysis of longitudinal data, machine learning algorithms, imaging-genetics of genome-wide data) with the ultimate goal of combining these data to better predict risk for mental illness and inform interventions. These aims are in line with the NIH Blueprint for NIMH, NICHD, and NINDS, as they seek to elucidate the neurobiological mechanisms underlying complex human behavior and neurodevelopmental disorders. Project Narrative The proposed dissertation research examines how cumulative genetic risk for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) on a gene implicated in social behavior across species – the oxytocin receptor gene (OXTR) – impacts brain activity and connectivity in youth with and without ASD, as well as how risk-allele dosage relates to individual differences in ASD symptomatology and social functioning. Future postdoctoral research will investigate how genetic, environmental, and experiential factors impact neurodevelopmental trajectories with a focus on adolescence, a period during which many psychiatric disorders emerge. A better understanding of how complex gene-brain-environment interactions confer vulnerability or resilience to mental illness may lead to earlier diagnosis, more efficacious treatment, and improved outcome.",Gene-brain-environment interactions as determinants of typical and atypical developmental trajectories,10006102,K00MH119663,"['Adolescence', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Animals', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Childhood', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Exposure to', 'Female', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Research', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genetic study', 'Goals', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Neural Pathways', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Other Genetics', 'Outcome', 'Oxytocin', 'Oxytocin Receptor', 'Pattern', 'Penetrance', 'Persons', 'Play', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychophysiology', 'Receptor Gene', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Functioning', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Youth', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'biobehavior', 'brain behavior', 'career', 'dosage', 'endophenotype', 'frontal lobe', 'gender difference', 'gene environment interaction', 'genetic variant', 'genome-wide', 'imaging genetics', 'improved outcome', 'longitudinal analysis', 'machine learning algorithm', 'male', 'multilevel analysis', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'outcome forecast', 'psychologic', 'relating to nervous system', 'resilience', 'reward circuitry', 'reward processing', 'risk variant', 'sex', 'skills', 'social', 'symptomatology', 'task analysis']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,K00,2020,86880,0.1567633591512041
"Gait and communication growth in typical development and autism spectrum disorder Project Summary Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) affects approximately 1 in 59 children in the United States1 and incurs substantial public health burden over the lifespan2. Although one of the strongest predictors of later independence for individuals with ASD is early language ability3,4, the mechanisms underlying disrupted language development in ASD are not well understood. Recent research indicates that the transition from crawling to walking represents a sensitive period for language development, during which infants with ASD exhibit atypical trajectories of language growth. For typically-developing (TD) infants, walk onset is closely linked with a sudden increase in infants’ rate of language acquisition5–8 and dramatic changes in how infants perceive and interact with their environment. Emerging evidence indicates that infants with ASD do not exhibit the same “spurt” in language development following walk onset as their TD peers5, but reasons for this difference are not yet known. We propose that gait control, the ability to effectively regulate and coordinate the rhythmic movements needed for walking, is a fundamental mechanism supporting language growth following walk onset that is impaired in infants with ASD. Poor gait control may impede language acquisition after walk onset by making it difficult for children to access the increased communicative learning opportunities that walking affords, including seeing more faces9 and having hands free to gesture10 and share objects with others11,12. Regions of the brain known to support gait and postural control exhibit atypical structure and function in individuals with ASD13,14, and older children and adults with ASD exhibit poorer gait control15–17, indicating that gait control may be fundamentally disrupted in ASD. However, no studies to date have prospectively assessed early gait control in infants with ASD. The goal of the proposed research is to investigate gait control as a potential mechanism linking ASD to change in the rate of language growth after walk onset. This study will test whether gait control 4 weeks after walk onset (measured by a pressure- sensitive gait mat) predicts change in the rate of language growth following walk onset in infants at high and low familial risk for ASD (Aim 1). Next, we will examine whether ASD symptoms at 24 months are associated with gait control after walk onset (Aim 2). Finally, the proposed study will also explore whether innovative computer vision technology can provide an infant gait assessment tool that is more scalable to settings outside the lab than current gold-standard pressure-sensitive gait mats (Aim 3). This study will be the first to explicitly test the relationships between gait control, language development, and ASD symptoms. In so doing, it will yield a deeper understanding of the link between early motor and language development during this sensitive period, with the potential to identify possible targets for early intervention to promote improved language outcomes in infants with ASD. Taken together, this project and the accompanying training plan will prepare the applicant for a research career investigating the early motor and social communication development in ASD. Project Narrative Learning to walk is associated with a significant increase in the rate of language development for typically- developing infants, but not for infants who go on to receive a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). While the reasons for this difference remain unclear, previous research indicates that children and adults with ASD are impaired in their ability to control the gross motor movements involved in walking, which may impede their ability to take advantage of the increased communicative learning opportunities that walking affords. By (1) prospectively testing the relationship between early gait control, language development, and ASD symptoms, and (2) developing a scalable computer vision tool for the automatic assessment of infant gait, the proposed study will investigate gait control as a potential mechanism contributing to disrupted language growth in ASD and make it possible to identify and study early gait impairment on an unprecedented scale.",Gait and communication growth in typical development and autism spectrum disorder,9989998,F31MH123033,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Assessment tool', 'Brain region', 'Calendar', 'Child', 'Child Language', 'Chiroptera', 'Chronology', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Comprehension', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Early Intervention', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Funding', 'Gait', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Hand', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Life', 'Linear Models', 'Link', 'Locomotion', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Musculoskeletal Equilibrium', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Periodicity', 'Production', 'Public Health', 'Regression Analysis', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Vocabulary', 'Walking', 'Width', 'autism diagnostic observation schedule', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'autistic children', 'career', 'dimensional analysis', 'disorder risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'language onset', 'language outcome', 'peer', 'pressure', 'prospective', 'prospective test', 'recruit', 'skills', 'social communication', 'tool']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,F31,2020,45520,0.1189709204020568
"Adapting Biomarker Assays for Individuals with Autism and Intellectual Disability Project Summary/Abstract The field of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) research lacks objective, sensitive quantifications of symptomatology with sufficient evidence to justify use as biomarkers in clinical trials. In the current proposal we investigate two promising markers, neural response to faces, measured by electroencephalogram (EEG), and visual attention to faces, measured by eye-tracking (ET). Published work and our preliminary data indicate that these measures: reflect clinically meaningful differences in the core symptoms of ASD, both by discriminating groups with ASD from those with typical development (TD) and by correlating with symptomatology in individuals with ASD; have strong test-retest reliability; demonstrate sensitivity to change in clinical status, both in the context of pharmacological and behavioral intervention; are collected by objective, automated tools not vulnerable to issues associated with inter-rater or inter-operator reliability; are minimally invasive and highly tolerable and therefore applicable across a wide range of ages and functional levels, with acceptable burden for participants and families; are collected using economical and accessible technologies that are scalable for large multisite studies with potential utility in the near term. Despite the promise of these biomarkers, their appropriateness in individuals with ASD and intellectual disability (ASD+ID) is poorly understood. In this application, we propose a novel integration of technologies and an innovative experimental approach to investigate these promising biomarkers in this critically understudied population. We leverage two complementary lines of research developed by the PIs: Dr. McPartland's Autism Biomarkers Consortium for Clinical Trials (ABC-CT), a multisite study collecting large samples of highly reliable EEG and ET data in children with ASD, and Dr. Naples' suite of gaze- and behaviorally-contingent technologies permitting concurrent collection of ET and EEG data in individuals with severe ID. The proposed work will incorporate robust ABC-CT experiments into an innovative experimental approach to study 30 6-11 year old children with ASD+ID and a matched sample of 30 individuals with ID without ASD. We test the hypotheses that individuals with ASD+ID will display longer latency of the N170 event-related potential (ERP) to human faces and reduced proportion of looking time to human faces in static social scenes relative to individuals with ID without ASD and that face N170 and visual attention to faces will correlate with clinician and caregiver ratings of social- communicative function. This innovative project uses a suite of contingent technologies to acclimate participants to the testing environment and apparatus, to attenuate motion, to permit real time feedback on data quality to prioritize stimulus delivery, and to support post-processing of motion artifact using computer vision derived motion estimates. By adapting robust markers for administration to individuals with ASD and ID, this application holds promise for development of biomarkers viable in an understudied but critically important segment of the autism spectrum.

"Care Improving Cognition for ADolescents on the Autism Spectrum (CICADAS) PROJECT SUMMARY The goal of the current project is to elaborate upon, reconstruct and advance to pivotal trial readiness CICADAS (Care Improving Cognition for ADolescents on the Autism Spectrum)—a clinician-assisted, closed-loop technology, mobile application for adolescents with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Via ten mobile assessments CICADAS will capture data on sensory processing abnormalities and associated cognitive deficits. These data will populate a machine learning algorithm that will tailor the delivery of ten neuroplasticity-based social cognitive training (NB-SCT) exercises targeting sensory processing abnormalities. This individualized assessment and treatment approach is posited to induce adaptive long-term learning about social-emotional events, thus maximizing the impact and generalizability of psychological Evidence Based Treatments targeting social skills and relational strategies, including PEERS (Program for the Education and Enrichment of Relationship Skills). In particular, we posit that CICADAS-induced enhancement of processing and cognition will facilitate the application of PEERS skills in the environment of adolescents with ASD, thus improving their real- world functioning. In this project, we will build upon promising results obtained from two studies in anxiety and psychosis, leverage pilot data collected in adolescents with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), and accumulate preliminary evidence for CICADAS to function as 1) a stand-alone treatment; 2) a primer for PEERS; 3) an enhancer for PEERS. In Specific Aim 1, we will finalize development, ensuring that assessment data correctly populate the closed- loop algorithm and correctly guide the delivery of individualized NB-SCT. Next, we will involve three adolescents with ASD and two PEERS clinicians in three focus groups that will be organized to refine CICADAS. Once decisions regarding app design are made, the three adolescents will be involved in a 2-week trial run to verify that CICADAS is detecting and improving sensory processing abnormalities and cognitive deficits. At the end of this test run, each stakeholder will be asked to rate enjoyment, ease of use, product quality, and perceived usefulness. Finally, we will submit these data from the trial run to our consultant to confirm that CICADAS is suitable for evaluation in the feasibility trial. In Specific Aim 2, we will conduct a three-arm randomized crossover trial with 48 adolescents with ASD to document the acceptability of CICADAS and evaluate its potential as a stand-alone treatment, as a primer for PEERS, or as a treatment enhancer of PEERS. At the completion of this project we will have usability data sufficient to support an efficacy trial in Phase II designed to establish medical claims. At the completion of Phase II, we will be able to complete the FDA regulatory pathway and have the opportunity to improve the lives of people suffering from this condition.

"Infant Vocalizations as Early Markers of Autism Spectrum Disorder Abstract The goal of this R03 is to characterize longitudinal vocal development in infants and toddlers at risk for ASD and use these metrics to predict subsequent diagnosis and dimensional social/language abilities. There is a critical need for reliable markers of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) that can be used to detect the condition in infancy and hasten the onset of early intervention services. Preliminary data from our team indicates that infant vocalization features distinguish groups beginning in the first year of life, and account for significant variance in later diagnostic status and social/language phenotype. For example, we found that infants later diagnosed with ASD produce fewer speech-like vocalizations, fewer vocalizations directed toward others, more crying, and altered vocalization acoustics. However, the longitudinal development of these early-emerging differences has not been completely described, and while they hold promise as early markers, their ability to predict individual clinical outcomes has not been directly tested in a large sample. Therefore, the power of these early vocalization differences to improve clinical detection has not been fully harnessed. To address this gap, we leverage a large existing dataset collected through the Infant Brain Imaging Study (IBIS; NICHD R01HD055741, PI: Dr. Joseph Piven). In this successful longitudinal multi-site study, infants at high and low familial risk for ASD completed video-recorded behavioral assessments at 6, 12, and 24 months of age, as well as neuroimaging at the same time points. Our research plan includes annotating infant vocalizations produced during these interactions using an expanded version of a coding scheme we have already developed, manualized, and trained annotators to reliably implement, and measuring the acoustic properties of each annotated vocalization. In Aim 1, we will use mixed models to analyze developmental group differences in vocalization features, determining which qualities distinguish groups and when. In Aim 2, we will use machine learning to test whether vocalization features produced during the first year of life can accurately predict diagnostic and social/language outcomes at age 2. This work will provide evidence of the clinical utility of infant vocalizations as pre-diagnostic behavioral biomarkers, setting the stage for subsequent studies of the relationship between early vocal behavior and brain development (measured using previously collected neuroimaging data from the same participants). The  Project Narrative This R03 proposal tackles a persistent public health challenge – detecting autism spectrum disorder (ASD) during infancy – by identifying characteristics of infant vocalizations that predict whether a given child will develop the condition. To achieve this goal, we use computational linguistics and machine learning to analyze existing audio/video recordings from a large longitudinal cohort of infants at high and low risk for autism. This work has high public health relevance because it aims to identify markers that improve early identification of ASD, which is essential for initiating early intervention services and improving long-term functional outcomes.",Infant Vocalizations as Early Markers of Autism Spectrum Disorder,9894787,R03DC017944,"['2 year old', 'Acoustics', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Age-Months', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Computational Linguistics', 'Crying', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Distress', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Funding', 'Genetic Risk', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Infant', 'Infrastructure', 'Language', 'Laughter', 'Letters', 'Life', 'Linguistics', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Speech', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Training', 'United States', 'Video Recording', 'Videotape', 'Visit', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'biobehavior', 'clinically relevant', 'early onset', 'functional outcomes', 'high risk', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'improved functioning', 'indexing', 'infancy', 'language outcome', 'neuroimaging', 'peer', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'service intervention', 'social', 'success', 'vocalization']",NIDCD,CHILDREN'S HOSP OF PHILADELPHIA,R03,2020,88000,0.14050002485335158
"Infant Vocal Communication: Typical Development and Autism Risk ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Research is now tracking early infant vocal communication using all-day recordings evaluated with human coding and in limited cases with automated analysis at very large scales. Results reveal unexpected features of development, illustrating foundations of language. Much of this work conducted at the University of Memphis (UM) is founded in an infrastructural theory of language development that has produced notable successes by supplying a widely-used stage model of vocal development and by providing the basis for determining clinically useful markers, especially associated with the onset and consolidation of canonical babbling (CB), a key foundation for spoken language. The UM empirical work within the infrastructural framework, based primarily on human-coding of longitudinal all-day recordings, has also begun to produce a new account of vocal foundations and vocal interaction both in the 1st months after full-term birth and in infants born prematurely by >2 months and still in the hospital. This work points toward possible indicators of risk for disorders in the first months of life. Further development of the new account holds promise for illuminating the development of vocal language and supplying predictors for conditions such as autism spectrum disorders (ASD).  The proposed research will expand the UM effort to much larger scale and address prediction of language development and of ASD through an ASD sibling study. The work will combine forces between the UM and Emory University's Marcus Autism Center (MAC), which both independently and through its Autism Center of Excellence (ACE) Program Project from NIH, is in the process of collecting a massive set of longitudinal all-day recordings of infants 1) showing typical development (TD), 2) at risk for ASD because they have an older sibling with ASD, and 3) at risk for language delay (LD) due to low socioeconomic status (SES). The MAC/ACE research includes analysis of the recordings with automated acoustic methods, but does not include funding for human coding of the massive recording set. Extensive human coding is in fact crucial for the ACE project, because without it, there is insufficient gold-standard data in terms of which to advance the accuracy and relevance of automated methods for developmental prediction and for detection of developmental communication disorders. Furthermore, many aspects of vocal patterning and interaction are as yet simply not accessible by automated means-human coding is the only workable option. The proposed research will combine efforts of UM and MAC, with 1) MAC supplying longitudinal all-day recordings across the 1st year of life to UM from the 3 groups, 2) UM performing coding and human-assisted acoustic analysis on representatively sampled segments from the recordings, and 3) both sites working together to predict infant outcomes at 24 months based on the human coding/analysis and based on the automated analysis that will result from supervised machine learning made possible by the human coding/analysis. The work targets improving prediction of language development and early identification of ASD. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This work will provide scientific foundations on vocal development and language in three groups of children, including ASD siblings, infants of low SES, and controls (low risk). The work will lay new foundations for automated large-scale monitoring of infant vocalizations.",Infant Vocal Communication: Typical Development and Autism Risk,9820723,R01DC015108,"['Acoustics', 'Address', 'Age', 'Age-Months', 'Caregivers', 'Centers of Research Excellence', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Developmental Communication Disorders', 'Early identification', 'Faculty', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Gold', 'Home environment', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Infant', 'Infrastructure', 'Language', 'Language Delays', 'Language Development', 'Life', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders', 'Outcome Assessment', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pattern', 'Periodicity', 'Premature Infant', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Siblings', 'Site', 'Social Development', 'Socialization', 'Term Birth', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'data standards', 'disorder risk', 'hearing impairment', 'human model', 'improved', 'infant monitoring', 'infant outcome', 'insight', 'language outcome', 'longitudinal database', 'low socioeconomic status', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'social', 'success', 'supervised learning', 'symptomatology', 'theories', 'vocal learning', 'vocalization']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF MEMPHIS,R01,2020,504913,0.08742604602894255
"Co-occurring ADHD in young children with ASD: Precursors, detection, neural signatures, and early treatment ABSTRACT – Co-occurring ADHD in young children with ASD: Precursors, detection, neural signatures, and  early treatment Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) occurs in ~40-60% of individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and substantially contributes to poorer clinical outcomes. Yet, very little research has focused on the overlap of ASD and ADHD during early childhood. Thus, little is known about how these two conditions co- emerge early in life. Given the high prevalence and clinical impact of the comorbidity of ASD and ADHD, the overall goal of the Duke Autism Center of Excellence is to characterize how co-occurring ADHD influences early screening, neural signatures, developmental trajectories, and response to early treatment of young children with ASD. Project 1 will characterize risk factors for and emergence of co-occurring ADHD symptoms in young children at risk for ASD and examine how these symptoms influence early detection and progression of ASD. This project will clarify why children who have co-occurring ADHD are diagnosed at a much later age and inform more effective early detection strategies. Following a large sample of toddlers receiving routine care in Duke pediatric primary clinics (N = ~ 2800 patients/year), Project 1 will prospectively identify children at risk for ASD and collect data on risk factors, ADHD, and developmental outcomes. Project 2 will elucidate shared and distinct neural signatures and attention-related biomarkers related to ASD and ADHD, examine the functional impact of co-occurring ADHD in young children with ASD, and identify precursor characteristics during infancy that are predictive of later emergence of comorbid ASD and ADHD. This project will characterize children with ASD alone, ASD+ADHD, ADHD alone, and typically-developing children, using state-of-the-art methods, including neurophysiology, eye-tracking, movement-tracking, and computer vision analysis. Project 3 will evaluate a novel early intervention model personalized for young children with ASD+ADHD that pharmacologically addresses ADHD symptoms prior to initiating early behavioral intervention, and identify changes in behavioral and neurophysiological activity that may underlie response to treatment. This project will accomplish these goals by evaluating whether stimulant treatment (Adzenys-XR-ODT) augments the efficacy of a parent-delivered behavioral intervention based on the Early Start Denver Model. This project will examine whether changes in outcome are correlated with improvements in social attention, measured via eye-tracking biomarkers, and social engagement during parent-child interaction. This project will also examine neurophysiological changes underlying improvements in behavior. These projects will be supported by four cores: Administrative Core, Recruitment and Assessment Core, Data Management and Analysis Core, and Dissemination and Outreach Core. Functioning as a whole, the Duke Autism Center of Excellence will offer the most comprehensive understanding to date of the impact of ADHD on young children with ASD, providing important information that will allow for biologically informed and personalized methods for early detection and treatment that could mitigate the negative impact of co-occurring ADHD on individuals with ASD.   PROJECT NARRATIVE - Co-occurring ADHD in young children with ASD: Precursors, detection, neural signatures, and early treatment Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) affects 1 in 68 individuals in the U.S. and has an annual estimated cost of $126 billion. In ~40-60% of people with ASD, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) also occurs and is associated with later ASD diagnosis, delayed access to intervention, and substantially poorer clinical outcomes. To fill a critical gap in knowledge, the Duke Autism Center of Excellence will provide a comprehensive understanding of the impact of ADHD on young children with ASD, including work that will enable improved early detection and treatment that could mitigate the negative impact of ADHD symptoms and improve quality of life for people with ASD.","Co-occurring ADHD in young children with ASD: Precursors, detection, neural signatures, and early treatment",9985153,P50HD093074,"['Acceleration', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Age-Months', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Attentional deficit', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Education', 'Engineering', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Etiology', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Services Research', 'Heterogeneity', 'High Prevalence', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Link', 'Measures', 'Medical History', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Parent-Child Relations', 'Parents', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Social Interaction', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Source', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Temperament', 'Testing', 'Toddler', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'autistic children', 'base', 'care outcomes', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'cost estimate', 'data management', 'developmental psychology', 'early childhood', 'early screening', 'effective therapy', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'inattention', 'individual response', 'infancy', 'model development', 'neuromechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'outreach', 'personalized medicine', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'routine care', 'screening', 'social', 'social attention', 'social engagement', 'social learning', 'statistics', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'visual tracking']",NICHD,DUKE UNIVERSITY,P50,2020,100000,0.20892554627600682
"Novel Approaches to Infant Screening for ASD in Pediatric Primary Care ABSTRACT – Novel Approaches to Infant Screening for ASD in Pediatric Primary Care  The overall goal of this project is to develop and validate novel tools to identify risk for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in infants 6-12 months of age in a pediatric primary care setting. Research has confirmed that ASD is associated with changes in brain and behavior that are evident during infancy, and proof-of-concept studies suggest that early intervention during the infant period can improve early brain function and developmental outcomes. Moreover, early universal autism screening has been shown to reduce existing disparities based on socioeconomic status (SES) and ethnicity/race in access to early diagnosis and treatment. This project leverages ongoing work that is currently funded as part of the Duke NIH Autism Center of Excellence (ACE) Award (NICHD P50 HD093074; Dawson, Center Director), which is evaluating a novel digital phenotyping tool for early ASD risk assessment in toddler-age children in a pediatric primary care setting. Our novel screening tool, SenseToKnow, is based on active closed-loop sensing, where children are shown brief, developmentally-appropriate, dynamic stimuli on a smart tablet or smartphone, while the sensors in the same device capture information for automatic, objective quantification of several behavioral risk markers, based on patterns of attention, orienting, affect, vocalizations, and motor behavior. The proposed research will 1) evaluate a novel infant version of the app, SenseToKnow-Infant, in a large population of infants in the context of routine pediatric care, and 2) examine the utility of a multi- modal approach to risk assessment that combines information from SenseToKnow-I with information from infant and maternal electronic health records (EHRs).

"The Psychiatric Cell Map Initiative: Connecting Genomics, Subcellular Networks, and Higher Order Phenotypes SUMMARY The global burden of mental illness, including autism spectrum disorders (ASD), intellectual disability, epilepsy, Tourette disorder, schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, is enormous, whether measured in health care expenditures, lost productivity, or personal suffering. Unfortunately, there is a striking lack of insight into the underlying molecular biology of these syndromes. However, recent advances in gene discovery are setting the stage for a transformation in the understanding of these psychiatric disorders. Understanding pathobiology and developing novel treatments is becoming increasingly dependent on knowledge of biological networks of multiple types, including physical interactions among proteins and synthetic­lethal and epistatic interactions among genes. Here we seek support for a new effort, the Psychiatric Cell Map Initiative (PCMI, www.pcmi.ucsf.edu), aimed at comprehensively understanding these complex interactions in psychiatric disorders and how they differ between diseased and healthy states. While we will focus on ASD in this proposal, this work will establish a paradigm to investigate other psychiatric disorders in future work. The PCMI is a multi­campus initiative of the University of California, involving UC San Francisco, UC San Diego and UC Berkeley, which leverages genomics, proteomics, high­throughput sequencing, advanced network mapping, computational analysis, and research platforms developed by multiple PCMI investigators over the past decade. Thus primed, these platforms will be tuned to efficiently generate, assemble, and analyze molecular networks linked to ASD, in relevant cell types, with a view towards pathway and network­based personalized therapy. Specifically, over the next five years the PCMI will seek to catalyze major phase transitions in ASD research and therapy by (1) Comprehensively mapping the networks of physical interactions among proteins linked to ASD, revealing the protein complexes and higher­order molecular units underlying ASD in multiple cell types of the human brain; (2) Mapping the parallel networks of synthetic­lethal and epistatic interactions among ASD genes using CRISPR­based approaches; (3) Establishing the robust computational methodology, end­user software, and databases for assembly and use of ASD cell network maps in both basic and clinical modalities; (4) Translating molecular insights into an understanding of higher order phenotypes; (5) Building a critical mass of leading investigators focused on psychiatric disorders worldwide to expand PCMI into a global coordinated partnership; and (6) Training the current and next­generation of scientists in Network Biology and its applications to research focused on psychiatric disorders. NARRATIVE Although the past few years have ushered in much success in identifying the genes linked to autism spectrum disorders (ASD), we need to move beyond simply cataloguing component genes in order to gain a mechanistic and actionable understanding of ASD and other psychiatric disorders. More specifically, it is critical to understand the many interactions between these genes and the proteins they encode, and how these complex networks are connected to the underlying pathobiology of ASD. To address this challenge, the Psychiatric Cell Map Initiative (PCMI, www.pcmi.ucsf.edu) will apply systematic approaches to comprehensively map the molecular networks that underlie ASD and translate them to higher order biological insights, which will form a key resource for precision medicine.","The Psychiatric Cell Map Initiative: Connecting Genomics, Subcellular Networks, and Higher Order Phenotypes",9967099,U01MH115747,"['ASCL1 gene', 'Address', 'Architecture', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'CRISPR interference', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'California', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coupled', 'Cryoelectron Microscopy', 'DNA sequencing', 'DNA-Protein Interaction', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Engineering', 'Epilepsy', 'Eukaryotic Cell', 'Future', 'Gene Combinations', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Screening', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Gilles de la Tourette syndrome', 'Goals', 'Health Expenditures', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Intellectual functioning disability', 'Knowledge', 'Libraries', 'Ligands', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Microscopy', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Mutation', 'Network-based', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Ontology', 'Organism', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phase Transition', 'Phenotype', 'Point Mutation', 'Productivity', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'San Francisco', 'Schizophrenia', 'Scientist', 'Slice', 'Structure', 'Syndrome', 'Tadpoles', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Xenopus', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'automated image analysis', 'base', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'cell type', 'deep neural network', 'excitatory neuron', 'experimental study', 'gene discovery', 'in vivo', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'inhibitory neuron', 'insight', 'interest', 'link protein', 'molecular phenotype', 'multidisciplinary', 'neural network', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'next generation', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'protein complex', 'protein structure', 'rare variant', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'small molecule', 'success', 'transcriptome']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",U01,2020,3628784,0.14335073703788526
"Cerebellar connectivity and error-based learning in infants at risk for autism Project Summary Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a heterogeneous disorder diagnosed on the basis of social impairment and restricted, repetitive behaviors 7. To combat these behavioral liabilities, effective interventions are needed. Early interventions appear particularly promising given evidence that engaging in therapies by 18-24 months improves outcomes for individuals with ASD 8–11. However, prospective research in infants at high risk for ASD has shown that the defining behavioral features of ASD are not present during the first year of life 12. Thus, very early intervention will rely on the identification of reliable presymptomatic biomarkers. In service of this objective, we propose to interrogate cerebellar functional connectivity and error-based learning (EBL) impairment as developmentally-linked neural and physiological presymptomatic biomarkers, respectively, of ASD. Converging evidence from multiple areas of research indicates a role for the cerebellum in ASD 13–15, a role for the cerebellum in EBL 16–18, and a role for EBL in ASD 19,20. However, the directionality and timing of early developmental relationships among these constructs remains poorly understood. This is a notable gap in the literature, given that ASD is a neurodevelopmental disorder with defining behavioral features that emerge and consolidate across the first 12 and 36 months of life 21. To test the hypothesis that cerebellar connectivity and EBL contribute to the development of ASD, it is necessary to study infants prior to ASD diagnosis. To this end, we propose to analyze previously-collected resting-state functional connectivity (fcMRI) and eye-tracking (EBL) data from the Infant Brain Imaging Study (IBIS), a multisite study of brain and behavioral development in infants at high and low risk for ASD. Specifically, we will evaluate cerebellar connectivity and EBL impairment as longitudinal predictors of ASD diagnosis and severity, as well as dimensionally-measured ASD-associated behaviors. Consistent with prior research 22, we will operationalize EBL as saccadic error (i.e., the frequency, magnitude, and variability of eye movements that fall short of their intended targets). We hypothesize that infant cerebellar connectivity (Aim 1) and EBL impairment (Aim 2) will predict later ASD diagnosis and severity. Further, consistent with “cascade” models of brain-behavior development 23, we hypothesize that infant cerebellar connectivity will influence infant EBL, with implications for ASD outcomes (Aim 3). Findings to support our hypotheses would identify cerebellar functional connectivity and EBL impairment as presymptomatic biomarkers for ASD, facilitating early diagnosis in ASD and helping to pave the way for randomized control trials of presymptomatic interventions. Ultimately, my long-term career goal is to become an independent academic researcher investigating the neural, physiological, and psychological factors that contribute to the development of ASD. This proposal entails trainings in infant neuroimaging and eye-tracking from leading experts in both fields, including sponsor John Pruett and co-sponsor Jed Elison. It will serve as the perfect capstone to my graduate studies, and I intend for it to launch the next stage in my research career. Project Narrative The defining behavioral features of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are not present during the first year of life and, therefore, very early intervention—which is argued to improve outcomes for individuals with ASD—will rely on the identification of reliable presymptomatic biomarkers. Using whole-brain approaches, our group recently identified two neural biomarkers that predict ASD diagnosis with high positive predictive value (PPV > 80%). We will examine the mechanistic bases for these findings by testing whether abnormal infant cerebellar connectivity (a specific neural biomarker) and cerebellar-dependent learning (a related physiological biomarker) predict later ASD outcomes, with implications for the development of targeted presymptomatic interventions.",Cerebellar connectivity and error-based learning in infants at risk for autism,9987929,F31MH120918,"['Algorithms', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Categories', 'Cerebellum', 'Cerebrum', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Expectancy', 'Eye Movements', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Linear Regressions', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Outcome', 'Physiological', 'Predictive Value', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Psychological Factors', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Validation', 'autism diagnostic observation schedule', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'behavioral impairment', 'behavioral outcome', 'brain behavior', 'career', 'classification algorithm', 'combat', 'control trial', 'cost', 'early screening', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'falls', 'high risk', 'high risk infant', 'imaging study', 'improved outcome', 'infancy', 'joint attention', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'predictive marker', 'prospective', 'relating to nervous system', 'repetitive behavior', 'screening', 'social', 'standard of care', 'support vector machine', 'visual tracking']",NIMH,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,F31,2020,36300,0.24517844522421275
"Novel Computational Analysis of Prosody in ASD and the Broad Autism Phenotype Abstract  Pragmatic (i.e., social) language impairments are a core feature of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), and differences have also been observed more subtly in the Broad Autism Phenotype (BAP; a cluster of subclinical features related to ASD, which are believed to reflect genetic liability in clinically unaffected relatives). Prosody is a central component of pragmatics, which includes aspects of speech and language that modulate and enhance meaning at grammatical, pragmatic, and affective levels including stress and intonation, which are conveyed by changes in fundamental frequency, intensity, and rate. Atypical prosody in ASD has been identified as the most prominent feature that immediately identifies an individual with ASD as “odd” compared to typically developing peers, causing significant obstacles to social interaction and integration1-3. More subtle differences in prosody have also been observed among parents of individuals with ASD, and may serve as a key marker of ASD genetic risk, measurable in affected and unaffected individuals. Because speech samples may be easily obtained, identification of key prosodic profiles in ASD and profiles reflecting genetic liability to ASD, could have widespread implication as a biomarker for detection of ASD risk, and as a tool for assessment and interventions focused on this clinically significant feature of ASD. Limitations in current work pose significant barriers to the objective and efficient characterization of prosody, where current methods typically rely on subjective perceptual ratings which, though clinically valid, are difficult to obtain and apply objectively in treatment contexts, and are unfeasible for application with large samples. Moreover, without extensive training, perceptual rating methods are not adequately sensitive for capturing important variation and heterogeneity in ASD prosodic profiles, or identifying the often quite subtle yet biologically meaningful prosodic differences that may be observed in clinically unaffected relatives. These factors together impose substantial barriers to reproducibility, limit scalability, and render prosodic characterization unfeasible for use by clinicians. This project attempts to address these challenges by applying sophisticated computational modeling of extensive existing speech and language samples collected through a larger companion project (R01DC010191, PI: Losh), to characterize prosodic profiles in ASD and in parents. In Preliminary Data, we demonstrate evidence of distinct prosodic profiles of individuals with ASD and parents, along with relationships to broader pragmatic language abilities and neural processing of speech sounds in ASD and parents, supporting the goals of this project to apply sophisticated computational tools to speech data obtained across multiple contexts in order to 1) identify prosodic profiles that characterize ASD and the BAP in parents, and 2) examine how prosodic profiles relate to broader clinical-behavioral phenotypes, and aggregate within families, potentially contributing phenotypic signatures of clinically and etiologically more homogeneous subgroups. Project Narrative Difficulty with the social use of language, including impairments in the rhythmic and intonational features of language used to convey intention and emotions that are essential for establishing connections with social partners, is a hallmark of ASD. Subtle differences in these language features have been observed among clinically unaffected relatives as well, and might serve as subclinical markers of genetic risk to ASD. This project aims to provide clinically and biologically meaningful measures of such language differences, using state-of-the- art computational modeling of social language characteristics in ASD, to inform clinical assessment, treatment, and biological studies of ASD.",Novel Computational Analysis of Prosody in ASD and the Broad Autism Phenotype,9958980,R03DC018644,"['Acoustics', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Assessment tool', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Companions', 'Computational Linguistics', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic', 'Emotions', 'Etiology', 'Family', 'Family Study', 'Frequencies', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Risk', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intention', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Language', 'Language Disorders', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Performance', 'Periodicity', 'Phenotype', 'Property', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Social Interaction', 'Speech', 'Speech Sound', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'brain behavior', 'clinically significant', 'computerized tools', 'disorder risk', 'endophenotype', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'indexing', 'language impairment', 'novel', 'peer', 'predictive marker', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'skills', 'social', 'speech processing', 'symptomatology', 'tool', 'trait']",NIDCD,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,R03,2020,74383,0.18677918132758498
"A Big Data Approach Toward the Development of a New Quantitative Measure of Restricted and Repetitive Behaviors Project Summary Restricted and repetitive behaviors (RRB) are a core feature of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and also occur across a range of other neurodevelopmental disorders. RRB present a major barrier to learning and adaptation, interfere with family functioning and present a source of considerable stress for parents. Despite their clinical significance, underlying mechanisms behind this complex behavioral domain are poorly understood and effective, targeted, individually tailored treatment options are currently lacking. One of the major barriers to moving the RRB research agenda forward has been the lack of clarity around the structure and conceptualization of RRB and the limitations of the currently available measures, particularly in terms of their (i) inability to comprehensively capture the full range of RRB and (ii) lack of sensitivity to treatment-related change. Therefore, the overarching aim of this project is to develop a parent report measure for comprehensive and quantitative RRB assessment applicable across clinical populations and across the life- span and useful in both etiological- and treatment-related research. In order to achieve this goal, we will first conduct advanced statistical analyses of multiple, large, high-quality datasets containing a range of currently available measures in order to achieve fine-grained differentiation between distinct RRB domains (Specific Aim 1) and to identify domains not adequately captured by the current measures (Specific Aim 2). The implementation of this initial phase of the project will ensure that robustness and generalizability of the factor structures for each individual measure across age, developmental level, gender, and diagnostic status, is established and that generalizable core RRB structure across the currently available RRB instruments is identified. Neither of these two different aspects have been comprehensively addressed before. Robust derived RRB factor structure, together with the identification of potential RRB domains that might be under- represented and not adequately depicted by the current instruments, together with the systematic review of the literature will inform the development of items of the new scale to capture the full range of RRB. The pilot version of the new scale will be psychometrically evaluated online within a large sample of children and adolescents with ASD (Specific Aim 3). This project will lay the foundation for future investigations aimed at further refinement of the newly developed informant-based scale and the development of a clinician interview and objective instrument, as well as their validation across ASD ansd neurodevelopmental disorders, and the testing of their utility as a clinical outcome measure. Project Narrative Restricted and repetitive behaviors (RRB), a core feature of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), present a major barrier to learning and adaptation, and a source of stress and management challenges for families. In addition to utilizing existing large datasets to clarify the structure of RRB and develop comprehensive RRB taxonomy, this project will utilize the information gained from the innovative secondary data analysis to develop and pilot a newly developed comprehensive and sensitive RRB scale. This project will pave the way for new studies that will aim to further validate the new measure, explore its sensitivity to change and utility as an outcome in clinical trials and inform the development of new clinical observation and objective measurement tools.",A Big Data Approach Toward the Development of a New Quantitative Measure of Restricted and Repetitive Behaviors,9874787,R21MH121876,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Companions', 'Complex', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Ensure', 'Equation', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Factor Analysis', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lasso', 'Learning', 'Linear Regressions', 'Literature', 'Longevity', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Parents', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Property', 'Psychometrics', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Review Literature', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Sensory', 'Series', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Taxonomy', 'Testing', 'Update', 'Validation', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'autistic children', 'base', 'behavioral construct', 'clinically significant', 'compulsion', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'informant', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'interest', 'large datasets', 'learning strategy', 'motor behavior', 'programs', 'repetitive behavior', 'social', 'stress management', 'supervised learning', 'systematic review', 'tool', 'trait']",NIMH,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R21,2020,236550,0.09399447433559563
"Parsing early emerging heterogeneity related to autism spectrum disorder A major impediment to early identification and intervention for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is our limited understanding of how different children present signs as toddlers, including what risk symptoms coincide across multiple dimensions to predict outcome. Our objectives are to quantify behavioral and brain connectivity based subtypes of risk that model the variability of ASD symptom expression in a community sample of toddlers. We will then test the predictive validity of this approach in the same cohort of children at three years of age in order to identify risk profiles that differentially predict later cognitive, behavioral, and clinical features. First, we will implement two unsupervised data-driven computational approaches in a community sample of 3000 children between 18-24 months old in order to characterize clusters of risk profiles. We hypothesize that each approach will identify a proportion of high-risk individuals consistent with epidemiological estimates of ASD and associated developmental disabilities (e.g., language or global DD). Based on our preliminary data, we anticipate that ~300 children will be identified by these data-driven risk-profiling methods. We also hypothesize that distinct patterns of structural and functional connectivity will distinguish groups of at-risk children and that these groups will differ from low-risk children. All children will be scanned with the same brain imaging sequences and procedures implemented in the Baby Connectome Project and will be compared to data from 100 low-risk children from that project. Our neuroimaging sample of 300 children will be reassessed at age three with direct clinical assessment using gold-standard diagnostic instruments as well as parent report. This will allow us to validate the risk profiling approach implemented at 18-24 months, to compare with a current screening approach, and to refine the risk profiling approach with supervised training of prediction algorithms that incorporates behavioral/clinical outcome data. We expect this method for risk stratification/subtyping to better model the heterogeneity inherent to the early at-risk and resilient phenotypes, which will subsequently improve early identification/diagnosis efforts. These outcomes will have translational impact because improved methods for early identification in ASD are necessary for the successful development of efficacious, personalized early interventions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Symptoms of autism present differently in toddlers, which makes it difficult to identify children at risk during their first two years of life. Our goal is to measure variation in behavior and brain functioning in this age that may predict differing clinical outcomes. Identifying different subtypes of risk will later help us develop individually-optimized clinical recommendations for children with autism and related disorders.",Parsing early emerging heterogeneity related to autism spectrum disorder,9881344,R01MH115046,"['3 year old', 'Age', 'Age-Months', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Categories', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Developmental Disabilities', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Life', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Procedures', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Stratification', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Toddler', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'autistic children', 'base', 'case control', 'case-based', 'clinically actionable', 'cohort', 'communication behavior', 'connectome', 'design', 'early screening', 'follow up assessment', 'high risk', 'improved', 'instrument', 'learning algorithm', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'outcome prediction', 'population based', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive test', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'repetitive behavior', 'screening', 'social communication', 'symptomatology', 'translational impact', 'unsupervised learning']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2020,782692,0.12052505508014136
"Using complex video stimuli to elucidate atypical brain functioning in ASD ABSTRACT A major gap in our understanding of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is in knowing how the brain functions during conditions that approximate the complex processing demands of the real world. Instead, almost everything we know about brain functioning in ASD comes from reductionist studies that often use highly simpliﬁed stimuli and isolated task demands, or even from studies that lack a stimulus or task altogether, as in the case of resting-state functional connectivity. Yet, successful processing “in the wild” (i.e., in the real world) relies on the simultaneous engagement and seamless integration of multiple brain regions, brain networks, and cognitive processes. Understanding how these neural systems behave and interact during real-time processing of complex and dynamic stimuli, therefore, is critical for understanding how real-world behavior and cognition emerge from brain activity, and this remains a major gap in our understanding of ASD. The purpose of the current proposal is to ﬁll this gap, by using complex video stimuli that sample broadly from the natural world and engage multiple diverse perceptual and cognitive systems simultaneously, thus evoking activity across the entire brain at once. From this data, rich high-dimensional measures can be generated and used in combination with multivariate analytic methods ideally-suited to detect idiosyncratic and heterogeneous patterns of neural responding, which can then be related back to phenotypic variability across individuals. Our proposed studies will take place over 5 years and include 4 speciﬁc aims. In the ﬁrst two aims, we will identify neural systems most affected in ASD during the presentation of a complex video stimulus, parse the heterogeneity at the neural level using data-driven approaches and relate it back to heterogeneity at the behavioral level, and explore the stimulus dimensions (social and non-social alike, both sampled broadly) that underlie these neural abnormalities. In a third aim, we will examine video-evoked functional connectivity both within and across brain networks, comparing this directly against resting-state connectivity, and examining both modes of functional connectivity across various timescales (including dynamic coupling). A ﬁnal exploratory aim will assess the short-term and long-term stability of these measures, as well as their sensitivity in tracking change following experimental perturbation—important characteristics for potential biomarkers and/or predictor and outcome measures for use in intervention studies. Altogether, this work will provide new insight into brain activity and brain connectivity during conditions that more closely reﬂect processing demands of the natural world, help to link individual differences in brain functioning with individual differences in behavior (i.e., heterogeneity), and assess whether these neural measures may be viable candidates as biomarkers for use in future studies. This proposal addresses the Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee's Strategic Plan (2013 Update) that includes comprehensive examination of the neural circuitry in individuals with ASD across the lifespan, including throughout adulthood, as well as a focus on heterogeneity. PROJECT NARRATIVE Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is an alarmingly common neurodevelopmental disorder that affects approximately 1% of the population, making it a major public health concern. This proposal will provide novel insight into the neurobiological basis of ASD by assessing brain functioning during conditions that more closely approximate the complex processing demands of the real world.",Using complex video stimuli to elucidate atypical brain functioning in ASD,9841460,R01MH110630,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Arousal', 'Attention', 'Auditory', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Dimensions', 'Exhibits', 'Eye', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Future', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Movement', 'Nature', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Public Health', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Social Interaction', 'Speech', 'Stimulus', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Update', 'Visual', 'Voice', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'candidate marker', 'cognitive process', 'cognitive system', 'comparative', 'expectation', 'high dimensionality', 'insight', 'movie', 'multidimensional data', 'neural circuit', 'neural patterning', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'potential biomarker', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'social', 'sound', 'stimulus processing']",NIMH,INDIANA UNIVERSITY BLOOMINGTON,R01,2020,426957,0.12837979363310192
"Temporal connectomics for infant brain: neurodevelopment modulated by pathology Abstract Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a highly heritable neurodevelopmental disorder affecting more than 1% of children (and almost 2% of boys), with those born in a high risk (HR) family with a child diagnosed with ASD having a ~20 fold greater risk than the general population. Although it can only be reliably diagnosed after the second year of life, ASD originates from a neurodevelopmental mechanism, with symptoms emerging as early as 6 months of age. Prospective large-scale longitudinal neuroimaging studies like the Infant Brain Imaging Study (IBIS), of those born into a high-risk (HR) family, are extremely valuable as they facilitate discovery of the earliest manifestations of ASD. The overarching goal of this proposal is a comprehensive comparative longitudinal analysis of brain organization of high- and low-risk populations, by using IBIS diffusion MRI (dMRI) data collected at 3 time points in the first 2 years of life, to elucidate the earliest manifestations of ASD and disorder trajectory. In addition, we aim to create a biomarker of ASD risk from brain connectivity features and their developmental trajectories, and to understand the brain bases of familial risk (independent of ASD). dMRI provides an insight into the structural organization of the brain represented as a connectome. “Miswiring” of the structural connectome can manifest as neuro-immaturity of WM and changes in network structures, that is, subnetworks (collection of strongly inter-connected regions associated with a distinct communication pattern), and the communication backbone (overall architecture of communication between subnetworks). Both connectivity and WM quality can be compromised in ASD compared to controls, suggesting a “miswired” connectome. Studying ASD related early developmental changes in connectivity requires design of novel analysis methods based on “longitudinal” connectomic features that are 4D features that incorporate their temporal evolution over development, culminating in the creation of novel imaging-based biomarkers. In Aim 1, we will create a new method of extracting longitudinal fiber tracts to identify and analyze differences between the developmental tract trajectories in LR-, HR- and HR+ subjects using geometry and quality features derived from the fiber bundles, to identify differences in neuro-immaturity. In aim 2, we will design novel methods to extract longitudinal network structures like structurally-cohesive and functionally-defined subnetworks and the global communication backbone, and investigate developmental differences modulated by familial risk and gender. Finally, in Aim 3 we will use the tract and network features extracted from Aims 1 and 2 to develop imaging based markers that will assist with early ASD prediction, identifying siblings who could gain from an early therapeutic intervention and provide an index of development in the form of brain connectivity “maturational age” to help characterize developmental delays and brain patterns corresponding to the same. The longitudinal analysis methods developed in the proposal will be generalizable to other clinical populations that can gain from longitudinal analysis spanning several time points. Project narrative The project aims at comprehensive comparative analysis of diffusion-based structural connectivity in high- and low-risk populations, to elucidate the earliest manifestation of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). This will require the design of novel sophisticated longitudinal analysis methods based on longitudinal tracts and network structures that inherently incorporate the temporal evolution over development. Finally, using the developmental trajectories of these features, we aim to create imaging-based biomarkers of familial risk, development and predictive of ASD prior to the age of diagnosis.",Temporal connectomics for infant brain: neurodevelopment modulated by pathology,9848443,R01HD089390,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Age-Months', 'Anisotropy', 'Architecture', 'Attenuated', 'Base of the Brain', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Child', 'Chronology', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Evolution', 'Family', 'Fiber', 'Funding', 'Gender', 'General Population', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Heritability', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Length', 'Life', 'Longitudinal prospective study', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Sex Differences', 'Siblings', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vertebral column', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'boys', 'cohesion', 'comparative', 'connectome', 'design', 'disorder risk', 'high risk', 'high risk infant', 'high risk population', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging study', 'indexing', 'insight', 'longitudinal analysis', 'machine learning method', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'organizational structure', 'predictive marker', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'social communication', 'spatiotemporal', 'white matter']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2020,571164,0.18772250047562347
"Sex-Specific Brain and Behavioral Predictors of Cognitive Aging in Middle-Aged Adults with Autism Spectrum Disorder Project Summary/Abstract Research Project Long-Term Objective: The long-term objective of this research is to describe the cognitive challenges associated with aging in adults with ASD to inform interventions and care plans. Aim 1: Identify the combination of sex-specific functional and structural brain measures in adults with ASD that (a) best describe age-related cognitive changes compared to matched-NT controls and (b) predict age-related cognitive decline. Methods: We will use multi-modal partial least squared analysis to elucidate information linkage between complementary neuroimaging data sets. Research Design: We will analyze both cross-sectional data of young-adult (n=100) vs. middle-aged (n=120) ASD and NT groups, and longitudinal data of middle-aged adults in two year increments (n=120 participants; 360 data sets). Men and women will be similarly represented in groups (M:F ratio, 1.0 : 0.7). Aim 2: Identify the combination of behavioral measures in adults with ASD that best predict age-related cognitive decline. Methods: We will use multi-task learning to determine the linkage between complementary behavioral data sets. Research Design: We will analyze cross-sectional and longitudinal data from Aim 1 ASD participants. Health Relatedness: These aims will have a substantial positive impact on health care quality and costs in the ASD community by vertically advancing our understanding of the unique cognitive and brain aging process, and laying the groundwork for delivering effective, precision medicine care to the growing and vulnerable population of older adults with ASD. Candidate Career Goals: Dr. Braden's long-term goal is to become a leading researcher in the neurobiology of aging in ASD through a multi-disciplinary program from basic science to translational treatment. Her short-term goals are to: 1) comprehensively describe age-related cognitive and brain changes in adults with ASD, and 2) identify targets for behavioral and neurobiological interventions and care plans tailored to specific cognitive needs of older adults with ASD.

"Mapping Regulatory Networks of Autism Risk at Cellular Resolution during Neurodevelopment Project Summary  Dr. Muhle is a practicing child psychiatrist with a strong track record of developing molecular and genetic tools to elucidate the mechanism of disease. The long-term goal of this career development award is to identify regulatory networks underlying autism spectrum disorder (ASD) through the integration of state-of-the- art functional genomics, single cell transcriptomics, and systems biology analyses with precision-engineered models of early brain development. She initiated this project during her time in the Adult and Child Psychiatry Research Training Program at the Yale Child Study Center, with the mentorship of James Noonan, Ph.D. and co-mentorship of Matthew State, M.D., Ph.D. With the guidance of Dr. Noonan, a world-wide leader in using functional genomics to understand development and evolution, and the support of Dr. State, an undisputed pioneer and leader in ASD genetics, Dr. Muhle developed expertise in regulatory genomics and the genetic architecture of ASD. Her career goal is to become an independent investigator, examining the role of the ASD risk gene Chromodomain Helicase DNA-binding Protein 8 (CHD8) in the development of ASD.  Her research goal is to determine the role of CHD8 and the impact of its loss on regulatory networks. Our hypothesis is that CHD8 regulates ASD risk-associated networks in specific cell-types that become dysregulated when CHD8 expression is altered. To address these questions, she successfully generated a Chd8 constitutive knockout mouse and an Avi-tagged Chd8 mouse that she will use to identify Chd8-regulated networks in specific cell-types at high cellular resolution. She also proposes a high-throughput small molecule screen to explore potential upstream developmental signaling pathways that effect CHD8-regulated expression networks. The following independent specific aims will address our hypothesis: 1) Determine cell-type specific expression changes due to Chd8 haploinsufficiency in the developing cortex. 2) Map Chd8-bound cell-type specific regulatory networks at high resolution in the cortex. 3) Identify bioactive modulators of CHD8 expression networks via high-throughput reporter assay. Our rationale is that by studying CHD8, a key regulatory molecule that targets other ASD risk genes, we will expand our knowledge of other ASD risk genes and identify CHD8-targeted regulatory networks in particular cell-types to further define the biology of ASD.  With the continued mentorship of Dr. Noonan and co-mentorship of Marina Picciotto, M.D., an expert in animal models of neurobehavioral disorders, with collaboration of Thomas Fernandez, M.D., a child psychiatrist with expertise in systems analyses of genetic risk factors, and Smita Krishnaswamy, Ph.D., a computational biologist on the cutting-edge of statistical and mathematical modeling, Dr. Muhle will develop the experimental and analytical skills necessary to fully utilize the model systems she has developed. Together with the resources of the Yale Child Study Center and her career development goals, she will attain her career goal to illuminate basic biological mechanisms underlying brain development and risk for ASD. Project narrative Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a highly prevalent congenital disorder most often characterized by life-long impairments in social communication that create significant obstacles to education, employment and formation of relationships. There is a significant public health need for therapeutics that target the core symptoms of ASD, but despite recent foundational advances in understanding genetic contributors to ASD etiology there is a gap in our understanding of how the diverse etiologies of ASD converge into common pathways on a molecular and cellular level. The studies proposed in this application combine cutting-edge functional genomics and single cell transcriptomics with novel animal and cellular models of early brain development to identify regulatory networks of genes and pathways associated with autism risk at unprecedented cellular resolution, which will provide new-found insight into the biological underpinnings of ASD pathology to inform the development of novel, targeted therapeutics.",Mapping Regulatory Networks of Autism Risk at Cellular Resolution during Neurodevelopment,10006848,K08MH115164,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affinity', 'Animal Model', 'Behavioral Symptoms', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Availability', 'Biological Models', 'Biological Response Modifier Therapy', 'Biology', 'Biotin', 'Brain', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Child', 'Child Psychiatry', 'Collaborations', 'Congenital Disorders', 'Cre driver', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Education', 'Embryo', 'Employment', 'Engineering', 'Etiology', 'Evolution', 'Exposure to', 'Expression Profiling', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knockout Mice', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Ligands', 'Ligase', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Pathology', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Proteins', 'Psychiatrist', 'Public Health', 'RNA', 'Reporter', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Signal Pathway', 'Site', 'Statistical Models', 'Symptoms', 'Systems Analysis', 'Systems Biology', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training Programs', 'Variant', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'biochip', 'career', 'career development', 'cell type', 'chromatin immunoprecipitation', 'chromatin remodeling', 'differential expression', 'disorder risk', 'fetal', 'functional genomics', 'genetic architecture', 'genetic risk factor', 'genome-wide', 'helicase', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning network', 'mathematical model', 'neocortical', 'nerve stem cell', 'neurobehavioral disorder', 'neurodevelopment', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'risk variant', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'skills', 'small molecule', 'social communication', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic development', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,K08,2020,154085,0.1625271812192626
"Development of a Commercial Platform for Discovery and Validation of Key Microbial Metabolites in CNS Disorders Despite a wealth of continued funding and ever emerging advancements in diagnostic and therapeutic technologies, the burden of central nervous system (CNS) disorders remains substantial. The cost of Substance Use Disorder (SUD) alone is estimated at > $181 billion (2002). The findings of numerous efforts tasked with identifying risk factors and causative agents of SUD suggest that vulnerability to dependence is a complex phenotype influenced by both genetics and environmental factors. Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) also appears to be largely impacted by both genetic and environmental factors, more specifically the gut microbiome. Recent studies have demonstrated that autism and SUD share common neural networks and molecular signaling pathways. Several of the gene-products associated with the ASD phenotype (e.g., synaptic cell adhesion molecules in the striatum and basal ganglia) affect synaptic transmission between neurons, which has also been implicated in the addiction and reward system. In addition, adults afflicted with high functioning autism exhibit greater susceptibility to drug dependence. We hypothesize that advancing the current state of knowledge regarding ASD, with particular regard to the attributes shared with drug addiction, will inspire the conceptualization and development of novel therapeutic interventions to correct common elements of striatal dysfunction. Testing this hypothesis will require a validated turn-key platform enabling customers the ability to ship clinical fecal samples from affected and unaffected subjects and receive a list of metabolites mediated by microbiome functions and a pre-clinical (in vivo) data package deciphering the phenotypic modulation of the CNS disease. With the funding received through this award, we will design, develop, and commercialize a robust CNS-microbiome-interplay (CMI) platform-based service that will enable (i) elucidation of novel microbiome-mediated targets in CNS diseases, including metabolites, proteins and peptides, (ii) pre-clinical data collection in standardized animal models, quantifying the influence of microbial bioactive molecules, and (iii) application across a wide range of therapeutic areas, such as SUD and ASD. The CMI platform-based service offering will allow medical and pharmaceutical pharma customers (i.e., our target market) to rapidly define diagnostic and therapeutic targets from clinical samples and deduce pre-clinical efficacy estimates sans investment in venture capital or complex infrastructure. The major problem confronting medical and pharmaceutical R&D companies is the difficulty involved with building and maintaining an infrastructure amenable to extensive “omics” enterprises. Second Genome will serve the academic and pharmaceutical R&D community by offering a validated turn-key platform enabling customers the ability to ship clinical fecal samples from affected and unaffected subjects and receive back, as a product: (1) a list of metabolites mediated by microbiome functions and (2) a pre-clinical (in vivo) data package demonstrating phenotypic modulation of Central Nervous System disorders.
