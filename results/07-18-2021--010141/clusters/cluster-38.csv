"Device to Measure Pain using Facial Expression Recognition Integrated with Patient PAINReportIt® Tablet Abstract Our goal is to develop a product that will objectively measure pain using computer vision and machine learning technologies together with tablet-based self-reported pain data from patients for research or clinical purposes. Our device will be low-cost because it will consist of one or two cameras to record the video and a computer to analyze the video in almost real-time. The software of the device will be portable to ordinary personal computers and tablets, and it will be able to simultaneously control multiple cameras that capture facial pain expression, which is an important modality for detecting pain, especially when the patient's verbal ability to communicate is impaired. Non-verbal facial pain behaviors provide important cues to estimate the level of pain and self-reported tablet-based pain data discriminate the type of pain (nociceptive, neuropathic). Used together, these two data sources could contribute to appropriate use of opioids. Facial muscle-based action units (AUs), which are defined by the Facial Action Coding System (FACS), have been widely studied and are highly reliable as a method for detecting facial expressions including valid detection of pain. Unfortunately, use of FACS is time-consuming making its clinical use prohibitive. An automated system for capturing facial images and detecting pain-related AUs, as proposed here, would be highly beneficial for efficient and practical pain monitoring. Preliminary work based on a unique video dataset captured by MPI Wilkie led to a highly promising method to detect AUs related to facial pain expression. Building on our existing research, we will enhance the performance of the automated method to detect pain-related AUs and then integrate this information with patients' self-reported pain data to objectively measure pain intensity. We will develop an almost real- time AU detection system under clinical settings using a deep learning based facial video analysis software. The likelihood scores for the presence of different AUs in the video together with the patient-reported data will be fed to a second machine learning module, which will then estimate the existence and the intensity of pain in an automated manner. The software will have the option of human verification. We will estimate the accuracy of the proposed system by extensive tests on two existing facial pain image datasets in the Phase I of this SBIR project. One of these datasets is the Wilkie video dataset, which has patient-reported data together with the ground truth scores from certified human FACS coders. We envision that when we move on to Phase II activities, eNursing llc will create a device that will be ready for testing in a suitable population to show data suitable for FDA approval. Narrative Automated detection of pain from facial expressions and patient reported data can greatly benefit patient care efficiency and provide practical pain monitoring in a variety of clinical settings. We will develop and test an advanced video analysis and machine learning based system to objectively measure pain for research and clinical purposes. This new tool has the potential to help rectify the poor pain outcomes that still plague Americans with opioid addiction, cancer and other health conditions in many health care settings.",Device to Measure Pain using Facial Expression Recognition Integrated with Patient PAINReportIt® Tablet,9608544,R43DA046973,"['Acute Pain', 'American', 'Analgesics', 'Clinical', 'Clip', 'Code', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Consumption', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Environment', 'Eye', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Facial Expression Recognition', 'Facial Muscles', 'Facial Pain', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Injury', 'Label', 'Learning Module', 'Lighting', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Nerve Tissue', 'Neuropathy', 'Nociception', 'Opiate Addiction', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Pain Measurement', 'Pain Research', 'Pain intensity', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Personal Computers', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Plague', 'Population', 'Process', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Running', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'chronic pain', 'clinically relevant', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'health care settings', 'improved', 'new technology', 'opioid epidemic', 'pain behavior', 'pain outcome', 'pain patient', 'pain signal', 'painful neuropathy', 'portability', 'prototype', 'societal costs', 'tool']",NIDA,"ENURSING, LLC.",R43,2019,149997,0.2544557901095719
"Advancing Knowledge Discovery for Postoperative Pain Management ABSTRACT Surgery is common and appropriate postoperative pain management is critical as poor management can impair recovery and lead to adverse events, including prolonged opioid use and transition to chronic pain. Literature suggests significant disparities exist with regard to pain management and its quality-of-life impacts, particularly among vulnerable populations (e.g. depressed, obese and diabetics). However, there lacks risk stratification tools to identify individuals at high risk for these disparate pain outcomes. Although pain scores are routinely collected in electronic health records (EHRs), shared algorithms to utilize them for care improvement are limited. To advance the efficient and effective use of the abundant amount of electronic data now available, a common data model (CDM) is necessary: standardized structures, terminologies, and rules to represent EHR data. Using a CMD for postoperative pain research would facilitate timely evidence generation across multiple populations and settings, which can provide critical evidence to stakeholders and move the field away from pain treatment for the ‘average’ patient to pain treatment for an individual. In this grant, we propose an innovative approach to advance the systematic analysis of postoperative pain across populations. Our approach will leverage the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) CDM to develop tools that use standardize data formats and naming conventions; OMOP has over 140 collaborating sites gloablly. We will further utilize analytical tools developed by Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) on this CDM to facilitate disseminate across the research community. Our approach will develop scalable, open source risk stratification tools for adverse pain outcomes across diverse populations. We will accomplish this work in three aims. First, we will develop clinical phenotypes to identify and extract key discriminating features necessary to assess postoperative pain using EHRs. Next, we will develop pain risk stratification models using machine learning, including deep learning, methods and tools based on phenotypes developed in Aim 1. Finally, we will validate our models externally at the VA and disseminate our work through open source libraries and public websites. This project will deliver validated risk-stratification tools derived from real world evidence to identify patients at high risk for adverse pain outcomes following surgery, which can potentially reduce prescribed opioids circulating in the community– a key to curbing the opioid epidemic. NARRATIVE Surgery is common and appropriate postoperative pain management is critical, as poor management can impair recovery, lead to increased morbidity and decreased quality of life; yet, there are significant disparities with regard to pain and its management, particularly in vulnerable populations. The proposed research will develop evidence needed to identify patients at high risk for adverse postoperative pain outcomes. Models will be developed at a tertiary academic health center, validated at the Veterans Health Administration and disseminated to the community via a publicly available website, common data model and open source libraries.",Advancing Knowledge Discovery for Postoperative Pain Management,9740899,R01LM013362,"['Absence of pain sensation', 'Adjuvant', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Anesthesia procedures', 'Caring', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Community Hospitals', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Deposition', 'Depressed mood', 'Economics', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'General Population', 'Generations', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Infrastructure', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Names', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Obesity', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Pain Research', 'Pain management', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Postoperative Pain', 'Quality of life', 'Records', 'Recovery', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Veterans', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'chronic pain', 'clinical phenotype', 'cohort', 'data format', 'data modeling', 'deep learning', 'depressed patient', 'diabetic', 'effective therapy', 'electronic data', 'fundamental research', 'health administration', 'health care settings', 'health data', 'high risk', 'improved', 'informatics\xa0tool', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'model development', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'open source', 'opiate tolerance', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid use', 'pain outcome', 'pain score', 'population based', 'prescription opioid', 'random forest', 'risk sharing', 'social', 'symposium', 'tool', 'tool development', 'web site']",NLM,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,668723,0.26870069602612534
"Technology Research Site for Advanced, Faster Quantitative Imaging for BACPAC PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Disorders of the spine have a tremendous impact on society; both physically through the morbidity of afflicted individuals, and financially, through lost productivity and increased health care costs. Despite the significance of this problem, the etiology of symptoms is diverse and unclear in many patients, and there are few reliable methods by which to prospectively determine the appropriate course of patient care and to objectively evaluate the effectiveness of various interventions. Challenges contributing to this major healthcare dilemma include numerous sources of back pain, difficulty in visualization of responsible tissues using any single imaging technique and difficulty in the localization of pain and contributing molecular processes. Magnetic Resonance imaging (MR) has been used to characterize disc, muscle, nerves and Positron Emission Tomography (PET) has been used to study bone turnover, and facet disease in subjects with lower back pain.  The research and tool development proposed in this UH2/UH3 takes the critical next step in the clinical translation of faster, quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MR) of patients with lower back pain. New optimized techniques and patient studies are required to investigate its clinical potential for quantitatively characterizing the tissues implicated in lower back pain, and objective evaluation of pain. Our proposed multidisciplinary Technology Research Site (Tech Site) of the NIH Back Pain Consortium (BACPAC) will develop Phase IV TTMs (Research and Development for Technology Optimization) to leverage two key technical advancements – development of machine learning based faster MR acquisition methods, and machine learning for image segmentation and extraction of objective disease related features from images. We will develop, validate, and deploy end-to-end deep learning-based technologies (TTMs) for accelerated image reconstruction, tissue segmentation, detection of spinal degeneration, to facilitate automated, robust assessment of structure-function relationships between spine characteristics, neurocognitive pain response, and patient reported outcomes. To accomplish this important project, we have assembled a highly-experienced multidisciplinary research team combining extensive expertise MR bioengineering, advanced MRI data analysis, radiology, neuroscience, neurosurgery, orthopedic surgery, multi-dimensional analytics and have existing research agreements with industry. The research facilities and environment include the clinical and research infrastructure required for successful completion of the proposed translational project. The team has disseminated tools before to academia, worked closely with industry and are motivated to totally work with BACPAC as the plans of the consortium evolve. PROJECT NARRATIVE The successful outcome of the proposed project will result in the development and translation into the clinical setting of new methods to enable greatly improved imaging of lower back pain in human subjects. While this project focuses on lower back pain, these new imaging techniques could ultimately benefit the clinical management of other musculoskeletal pain.","Technology Research Site for Advanced, Faster Quantitative Imaging for BACPAC",9897929,UH2AR076724,"['Academia', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Adult', 'Aftercare', 'Agreement', 'Anatomy', 'Back Pain', 'Base of the Brain', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Brain', 'Cartilage', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Chronic low back pain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Exercise Therapy', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Gold', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Intervertebral disc structure', 'Knee', 'Knee Osteoarthritis', 'Laboratories', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Low Back Pain', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Meniscus structure of joint', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphology', 'Muscle', 'Musculoskeletal', 'Musculoskeletal Pain', 'Nerve', 'Nerve Block', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurosciences', 'Orthopedic Surgery procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pain', 'Pain management', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Spinal', 'Spinal Diseases', 'Staging', 'Stenosis', 'Structure', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translations', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Vendor', 'Vertebral column', 'Work', 'autoencoder', 'base', 'bone turnover', 'clinical imaging', 'clinical infrastructure', 'clinical translation', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'data space', 'deep learning', 'disability', 'domain mapping', 'experience', 'feature detection', 'gray matter', 'hands-on learning', 'human subject', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging Segmentation', 'improved', 'intervertebral disk degeneration', 'multi-task learning', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurosurgery', 'novel', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'quantitative imaging', 'reconstruction', 'research and development', 'research facility', 'response', 'scoliosis', 'synaptic function', 'task analysis', 'technology research and development', 'tool', 'tool development']",NIAMS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",UH2,2019,513742,0.18321159704031098
"Autonomous Pain Recognition in Non-Verbal and Critically Ill Patients The under-assessment of pain response is one of the primary barriers to the adequate treatment of pain in critically ill patients, and is associated with many negative outcomes. Nonetheless, many ICU patients are unable to self-report their pain intensity. Currently, behavioral pain scales are used to assess pain in nonverbal patients. Unfortunately, these scales require repetitive manual administration by overburdened nurses, and show variability in pain intensity ratings by nurses. Furthermore, manual pain assessment tools cannot monitor pain continuously and autonomously. The PIs’ long-term goal is to specify pain intensity in an autonomous and precise manner. The overall objective of this application is to build the foundation of an autonomous, clinically- available pain assessment system by developing and validating pain recognition algorithms in a fully uncontrolled ICU setting. The central hypothesis is we can autonomously assess facial pain expressions and patient activity. The rationale is that autonomous pain quantification can reduce nurse workload and can enable real-time pain monitoring. Contextualization of pain with respect to patient function can also lead to improved functional and clinical outcomes. The overall objective will be achieved by pursuing two specific aims. (1) Developing and validating a pervasive sensing system in two 24-beds ICUs (ICU) to determine if deep learning algorithms can accurately assess pain facial expressions from image data, when compared to existing assessment tools. (2) Developing and validating algorithms for pain contextualization using autonomous activity recognition. The approach is innovative, because it departs from status quo by autonomously assessing pain and functional status in the ICU. The proposed research is significant since it will address several key problems and barriers in critical care, including manual repetitive ICU assessments and lack of granular and continuous pain and function measures. Ultimately, the results are expected to improve patient outcomes and decrease hospitalization costs, as well as lifelong complications. The proposed research is relevant to public health because it can result in enhanced critical care workflow, ultimately improving patient outcomes and decreasing hospitalization costs. The proposed research is relevant to NIBIB mission to improve health by leading the development of biomedical technologies, as the proposed research develops advanced computational methods and uses sensing technologies to automatically assess patient pain and function.",Autonomous Pain Recognition in Non-Verbal and Critically Ill Patients,9652119,R21EB027344,"['Acute Pain', 'Address', 'Agitation', 'Algorithms', 'Assessment tool', 'Beds', 'Behavioral', 'Biomedical Technology', 'Care given by nurses', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Color', 'Complement', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Conscious', 'Critical Care', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Environmental air flow', 'Equipment', 'Facial Expression', 'Facial Pain', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hospital Costs', 'Image', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering', 'Nurses', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Pain Assessment Tool', 'Pain Measurement', 'Pain intensity', 'Pain management', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prospective Studies', 'Public Health', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'To specify', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Workload', 'base', 'chronic pain', 'deep learning algorithm', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'functional status', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mortality risk', 'pain patient', 'recruit', 'response', 'sensor', 'sensor technology']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,R21,2019,215635,0.3322055082402795
"CPS: Cyber-physically assistive clothing to reduce societal incident of low back pain  The objective of this proposal is to address core scientific challenges related to sensing, actuation and control of cyber-physically assistive clothing (CPAC). CPAC is a kind of Human-in-the-loop Cyber-Physical System (HCPS), in which actuated clothing is coordinated in unison with human body movement to enhance safety and health. We propose addressing key HCPS challenges within the context of using CPAC to reduce societal incidence of low back pain, by preventing lumbar (spine) overloading and overuse injuries. Low back pain is targeted because it is one of the leading causes of physical disability and missed work. High and/or repetitive forces on lumbar muscles and discs can occur during daily tasks, and are known to be major risk factors that can lead to back pain and injury. The long-term vision is to create smart clothing that can monitor lumbar loading, train safe movement patterns, and directly assist wearers to reduce the musculoskeletal forces that cause pain and injury. This proposed transformation of clothing is similar to how wristwatches have transformed from timepieces into health monitors; however, CPAC is even more exciting because it combines the form-factor of clothing with the assistance benefits of an exoskeleton to reduce biological tissue loading for a broad range of individuals, occupations and tasks. Thrust 1 will adapt machine learning techniques in order to monitor lumbar loading and detect excessive spine forces via portable, wearable sensors, such that timely feedback/intervention can be provided. This thrust will result in the creation of a publicly shared data set that contains synchronized, multimodal (lab-based and wearable) sensor data collected from >500 actions per subject, the largest such corpus for machine learning in this domain. Thrust 2 will model the dynamics of cyber, physical and human components of CPAC in order to develop optimal control and learning strategies. Thrust 3 will integrate sensors, fusion algorithms and portable actuation into a complete wearable prototype. A human subject experiment will be performed to objectively evaluate the function of CPAC. At the focus of this proposal is the human body; monitored, analyzed and assisted by multidisciplinary CPS technologies. The project integrates expertise in biomechanics, machine learning, sensor fusion, soft robotics, wearable assistive technology, and clinical management of low back pain to transform clothing from materials that cover the body into wearable systems that can track and protect low back health. The key scientific HCPS challenges that need to be overcome, and which are addressed in this proposed research, in order to realize the broad societal benefits of CPAC are: (1) real-time sensing and assistive control of the HCPS and its co-adaptation to different subjects and diverse environments, (2) system design and verification ensuring safe operation and that no harm is done to human subjects through unanticipated feedback, (3) selection and placement of low cost sensors aiding affordable and realistic manufacturing of CPAC, (4) integration of wearable sensors and actuators into a reliable and effective HCPS. CPAC has the potential for broad societal impact given the high prevalence of low back pain. CPAC provides a unique and potentially paradigm-shifting opportunity because it combines the assistive benefits of an exoskeleton with the lightweight and unobtrusive form-factor of everyday clothing. CPAC is expected to (1) fit seamlessly into daily life, (2) connect individuals with health info to empower them to modify their physical activity, (3) generate public health data to inform evidence-based clinical and workplace practices, (4) augment lifting biomechanics to reduce lumbar loading, (5) reduce incidence of low back pain, and costs due to health care and missed work.",CPS: Cyber-physically assistive clothing to reduce societal incident of low back pain ,9791175,R01EB028105,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Back', 'Back Injuries', 'Back Pain', 'Biological', 'Biomechanics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clothing', 'Cumulative Trauma Disorders', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Feedback', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'High Prevalence', 'Human', 'Human body', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Lifting', 'Low Back Pain', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Musculoskeletal', 'Occupations', 'Pain', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Physically Handicapped', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Robotics', 'Safety', 'Self-Help Devices', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Vertebral column', 'Vision', 'Work', 'Workplace', 'base', 'cost', 'cyber physical', 'data sharing', 'design', 'evidence base', 'exoskeleton', 'experimental study', 'health data', 'human subject', 'human-in-the-loop', 'learning strategy', 'light weight', 'multidisciplinary', 'multimodality', 'operation', 'portability', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'sensor', 'wearable device']",NIBIB,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,311593,0.12871907517386968
"Data Center for Acute to Chronic Pain Biosignatures Understanding the mechanisms underlying the transition to chronic pain is a key to mitigating the dual epidemics of chronic pain and opioid use in the U.S. In response to RFA-RM-18-031, and as part of the NIH Common Fund Acute to Chronic Pain Signatures (A2CPS) Program, we will establish a Data Integration and Resource Center (DIRC) to integrate imaging, physiology, -omics, behavioral, and clinical data to develop biosignatures for the transition to chronic pain. The Center will be based in the Department of Biostatistics at JHU, a nexus for a wide range of collaborators with expertise in (1) advanced data science and machine learning, (2) neuroimaging, (3) genomics and related -omics, (4) wearable computing and smartphone-based behavioral assessment, (5) systems-level predictive biosignatures, (6) software engineering and high-performance computing, and (7) world-renowned pain researchers from JHU and other institutions.

"SPRINT: Signature for Pain Recovery IN Teens PROJECT SUMMARY Up to 5% of adolescents (~3.5 million in the US alone) suffer from high impact chronic musculoskeletal (MSK) pain, affecting all life domains and posing a significant economic burden. Current treatments for chronic MSK pain are suboptimal and have been tied to the opioid crisis. Only ~50% of adolescents with chronic MSK pain who present for multidisciplinary pain treatment recover, as measured by clinical endpoints of pain severity and functional disability. Discovery of robust markers of the recovery vs. persistence of pain and disability is essential to develop more resourceful and patient-specific treatment strategies and to conceive novel approaches that benefit patients who are refractory. Given that chronic pain is a biopsychosocial process, the discovery and validation of a prognostic and robust signature for pain recovery vs. persistence requires measurements across multiple dimensions in the same patient cohort in combination with a suitable ‘big data’ computational analysis pipeline for the extraction of reliable and cross-validated results from a multilayered and complex dataset. We are well positioned to execute the study aims with: (1) A highly skilled and experienced team of scientists and clinicians from Stanford University, University of Toronto/Hospital for Sick Children, and Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center; (2) A standardized specimen collection, processing, storage, and distribution system, leveraging Stanford Biobank’s platform, BioCatalyst, to aggregate the sample inventory with clinical annotations for an accessible, virtual biobank, within the Signature of Pain Recovery IN Teens (SPRINT) Biobank and Analysis Core (SBAC); (3) Cutting-edge preliminary data implicating novel candidates for neuroimaging, immune, quantitative sensory, and psychological markers for discovery; and (4) Expertise in machine learning approaches to extract reliable and prognostic bio-signatures from a large and complex data set. We expect that the results from this project will facilitate risk stratification in patients with chronic MSK, a more resourceful selection of patients who are likely to respond for undergoing current multidisciplinary pain treatment approaches, and new insight into biological and behavioral processes that may be exploited to develop novel strategies profiting those who are refractory. For the R61/Discovery Phase Aim individuals will be thoroughly characterized via biological (i.e. brain structure and function, immune, sensory profiles), psychological state, and clinical endpoint (i.e., pain intensity, disability) data. Unbiased machine learning algorithms will identify a multivariate model comprised of the most prognostic biological, psychological, and clinical endpoints. The model will classify adolescents with and without resolving chronic MSK pain after a state-of-the art multidisciplinary pain treatment intervention. R33/Validation Phase Aim will validate the biological signature derived in the R61 study. This signature will be useful for a range of adolescent-based clinical trials in which identification of the highest risk individuals is necessary, providing a clinically actionable intervention algorithm.

"IMPACT-Instrument to Measure Pain and Assess Correlation to Treatment. Create a smartphone pupillometry to objectively determine the presence of acute pain, evaluate opioid as the treatment for pain. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT While patient self-report of pain is currently the gold standard of pain measurement, accurate self-reports of pain may not be feasible in critically ill patients who are sedated and intubated, unconscious patients, or patients who are unable to verbally communicate their pain. Current research has shown that pupillary dilation (PD) is a reliable indicator of acute pain, and that measurement of pupil size changes may be useful in determining the intensity of pain experienced as well as the efficacy of an analgesia. There is also research demonstrating the value of pupillary unrest under ambient light (PUAL) as an objective marker of sensitivity to opioids, and the use of facial expression analysis to detect pain. IMPACT proposes pupillometry with a proprietary algorithm to measure both PD and PUAL, and facial expression analysis using computer vision. Through IMPACT, Benten proposes to provide clinicians with a device that helps them objectively determine the presence or absence of pain, assess opioid efficacy, and assist in deciding whether opioids should be the treatment of choice for a patient. The utimate goal of IMPACT is to revolutionize measurement and management of pain. The novel approach of measuring PD, PUAL, and facial expressions will help eliminate subjectivity in the diagnosis of pain, and avoid over-administration of opioids or administration of opioids to patients who are not suitable candidates for opioid treatment. IMPACT will demonstrate the feasibility of using pupil size changes and facial expressions to guide the diagnosis and treatment of pain, and compare results obtained to pain scores reported by patients on the NRS, to assess accuracy of pain measurement and effectiveness in pain alleviation. IMPACT will be designed and developed to serve the needs of patients who experience severe pain, and provide them with pain relief, through objection clinical decision-making. The aims of IMPACT are as follows: 1) Phase I Specific Aims: Develop IMPACT prototype and conduct a validity test with 25  subjects, to demonstrate the efficacy and validity of IMPACT versus a commercial  pupilometer, and 2) Conduct a feasibility pilot test of IMPACT with 20 patients in the post-anesthesia care unit  (PACU) of Christiana Care Health System (CCHS), to demonstrate the feasibility of IMPACT  in determining pain and assessing opioid efficacy. The short-term impact will be an improvement in pain detection, and more objective clinical decision making regarding opioid administration. The long-term impact will be a decrease in the misuse of opioid medication, and the facilitation of objective measurement of symptoms in clinical settings. PROJECT NARRATIVE Instrument to Measure Pain and Assess Correlation to Treatment (IMPACT) will develop an innovative, mobile application to record reliable biomarkers and surrogate markers for acute pain and opioid analgesic efficacy. IMPACT will enable clinicians to better diagnose and manage pain, through the measurement of pupillary dilation (PD) to pain, pupillary unrest under ambient light (PUAL), and facial expressions. IMPACT is designed to address the needs of patients who are in severe pain and may be unable to communicate their pain effectively. This makes it difficult for clinicians to determine the pain experienced accurately and administer analgesics that provide adequate pain relief, while also avoiding over-prescription of opioids and further contributing to the opioid crisis. Usage of IMPACT will help clinicians supplement patient reports of pain with objective measures of pain and opioid analgesic efficacy such as PD, PUAL, and facial expressions.","IMPACT-Instrument to Measure Pain and Assess Correlation to Treatment.

"Discovery of the Biomarker Signature for Neuropathic Corneal Pain PROJECT ABSTRACT Neuropathic corneal pain (NCP) is an ocular type of neuropathic pain. It causes patients to have severe discomfort and a severely compromised quality of life (QoL). The lack of signs observed by standard examination has resulted in misdiagnosis as dry eye disease (DED) resulting in an inefficient use of healthcare funds. The identification of a diagnostic biomarker for NCP and development of a detection method would allow adequate and timely treatment, improve patients’ QoL, and decrease the health care system’s financial burden. An optical biopsy can be performed using laser in vivo confocal microscopy (IVCM), which allows for visualization of subbasal corneal nerves at a quasi-histological level. Preliminary data has shown that IVCM identified microneuromas (a bulb at the end of a severed nerve caused by build-up of molecular constituents) are present in NCP, but not DED, patients. We propose to validate microneuromas as a novel biomarker for NCP. In Aim 1 we will use our database of over 2,000 DED/NCP subjects and over 500,000 IVCM images to confirm that the presence of microneuromas is an appropriate biomarker for NCP by comparing the sensitivity and specificity of identification of NCP patients via microneuromas to other IVCM parameters. Three observers will each grade images twice for this confirmed biomarker to assess inter- and intra-observer precision, and descriptive statistics of the IVCM datasets will allow for determination of the minimum number of images necessary for high precision of microneuroma detection. Aim 2 will provide biological validation of microneuromas. Both the intensity of ocular pain and the compromise to QoL caused by ocular pain as assessed by the Ocular Pain Assessment Survey (OPAS) will be compared between those with microneuromas and those without. Further, the change in ocular pain/discomfort in response to instillation of hyperosmolar saline into the eyes will be compared between those with microneuromas and those without. In Aim 3 we will develop a validated artificial intelligence (AI) program for automated identification of microneuromas to allow rapid and wide-scale adoption by clinicians. Accuracy of the program will be determined by evaluating the agreement of the AI program’s assessment of IVCM images with the assessment of 2 observers. A similar assessment of accuracy will be assessed using images obtained from an independent site so that inter-site precision can be evaluated. The AI program will also be assessed for its specificity and sensitivity in NCP identification. Aim 4 will establish the clinical utility of microneuromas observed by IVCM as a biomarker for NCP in a prospective, multi-center study. The biomarker’s precision, reference intervals, and harmonization of performance between sites as well as the sensitivity and specificity of NCP diagnosis will be determined using this prospective cohort. Next, the microneuroma findings will be correlated with the OPAS and hyperosmolar functional tests for biological validation. Finally, the AI program’s ability to provide a diagnosis of NCP will be tested using the IVCM images from this study. PROJECT NARRATIVE Recent studies have suggested that over $3.84 billion is spent annually in the US to treat dry eye disease, but only 37.3% of them reported being satisfied with their treatment. Recent evidence suggests that many of these patients have a condition called neuropathic corneal pain, which causes severe compromise to patients’ quality of life. However, there is currently no practical means of objectively diagnosing patients with neuropathic corneal pain. Validating a biomarker and developing a clinical method of properly diagnosing these patients should result in timely treatment and higher treatment success rates and therefore improved patient lives and a reduced financial burden on the healthcare system.",Discovery of the Biomarker Signature for Neuropathic Corneal Pain,9829699,R61NS113341,"['Adoption', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Testing', 'Biopsy', 'Cell Density', 'Cellular Morphology', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cohort Studies', 'Computer software', 'Cornea', 'Corneal pain', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Drops', 'Ensure', 'Expert Systems', 'Eye', 'Eye diseases', 'Fiber', 'Financial Hardship', 'Funding', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Histologic', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Immune', 'Individual', 'International', 'Lasers', 'Lesion', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Nerve', 'Nerve Plexus', 'Neuropathy', 'Optical Biopsy', 'Pain', 'Pain Measurement', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Polyneuropathy', 'Prospective cohort', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Saline', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Skin', 'Societies', 'Specificity', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Topical application', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Vision', 'artificial neural network', 'biomarker discovery', 'candidate marker', 'clinical research site', 'deep neural network', 'density', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'eye dryness', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'microscopic imaging', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'ocular pain', 'pain patient', 'pain symptom', 'painful neuropathy', 'programs', 'prospective', 'reflectance confocal microscopy', 'response', 'sex', 'software development', 'somatosensory', 'statistics', 'success', 'suicidal', 'validation studies']",NINDS,TUFTS MEDICAL CENTER,R61,2019,2120854,0.15018688228118435
"Development of a Medical Device Utilizing an EEG-Based Algorithm for the Objective Quantification of Pain Project Summary / Abstract Chronic pain affects over 100 million Americans representing a major public health imperative. Objective biomarkers of pathology exist for several diseases, and their development is one of the great advances of modern allopathic medicine; however, objective assessment of pain has lagged far behind. Currently, there are no objectively verifiable and clinically useful means to identify or quantify the presence or severity of pain. The current standard of care relies on patient self-report, such as the visual analog scale (VAS), which presents a serious barrier to the effective assessment and treatment of pain. Self-reported pain is influenced by nociceptive, affective, and cognitive processes, and though many treatments effect reported pain, they likely do so through a varied set of neurophysiological mechanisms, with different consequences for health and long-term well-being. Some patients have difficulty assigning themselves a pain rating, especially those with pain that falls towards the middle of the rating scale. In addition, communications issues, drug-seeking behavior, the desire of some patients to appear stoic, and other issues can create problems with establishing an accurate pain rating. As a result, despite a long history of research, current assessment and treatment of pain is not optimal, with enormous costs to patients and society. PainQx is currently developing the PQX-MED system, a system that will objectively evaluate an individual’s pain level using quantitative EEG (QEEG). Advanced signal processing, machine learning, classification methodologies and a large reference database will be used to develop algorithms that quantify features of an individual’s EEG that are associated with the perception of pain. Before the PainQx platform is ready for its FDA Validation Study, PainQx needs to demonstrate the ability to assess pain in a representative set of patients with chronic pain. To ensure commercial viability, PainQx also needs to be able to generate its pain biomarker using a limited montage of EEG electrodes which can be rapidly applied prior to data acquisition and processing. PainQx proposes to achieve these objectives through the proposed SBIR project. In Phase I, PainQx will conduct a clinical study of 50 chronic pain patients utilizing 19 lead EEG acquisition, add those cases to an existing database of 19 lead pain cases, and demonstrate that 19 Lead EEG data can be used to assess the intensity of pain a patient is experiencing. In Phase II, PainQx will demonstrate that the relationship between the VAS and a QEEG based biomarker demonstrated using 19 leads can be demonstrated using a subset of EEG recording locations to significantly improve clinical utility. Further, predictive accuracy using the reduced montage will meet targets for performance established using 19 lead data. Project Narrative The nature of self-reported pain rating scales leads to difficulty in accurately identifying, evaluating and therefore, optimally treating pain due to issues such as patient communication difficulties, drug-seeking behavior, differences in pain tolerance, and other challenges. As a result, patients can be either over-treated, leading to (or perpetuating) addiction as manifested by the opioid epidemic, or under-treated, leading to readmissions, lost productivity, unnecessary pain and suffering, and significant costs to the healthcare system. By providing physicians an objective pain measurement tool, PainQx believes it will allow physicians to increase certainty in dosing and treatment selection, thereby addressing the over and under treatment paradigm, and consequently reducing opioid abuse and overall healthcare costs.",Development of a Medical Device Utilizing an EEG-Based Algorithm for the Objective Quantification of Pain,9748113,R44DA046964,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communication', 'Comorbidity', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Medical Device', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Modernization', 'Nature', 'Nociception', 'Output', 'Pain', 'Pain Measurement', 'Pain Threshold', 'Pain intensity', 'Pain management', 'Pathology', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Productivity', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regulatory Pathway', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Severities', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Societies', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'Visual Analogue Pain Scale', 'addiction', 'analog', 'base', 'brain electrical activity', 'chronic pain', 'chronic pain patient', 'classification algorithm', 'cognitive process', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'drug seeking behavior', 'expectation', 'experience', 'falls', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'meetings', 'neurophysiology', 'opioid abuse', 'opioid epidemic', 'pain perception', 'pain score', 'product development', 'signal processing', 'standard of care', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'validation studies']",NIDA,"PAINQX, INC.",R44,2019,855144,0.3307619398651443
"Identifying neural pathophysiology in juvenile fibromyalgia ABSTRACT Juvenile-onset fibromyalgia (JFM) is a debilitating, chronic pain condition affecting adolescents, primarily females, during a critical period for brain development, and that persists into adulthood for the majority of patients. Due to the lack of definite physical or laboratory findings, JFM has been questioned as a clinical entity, and sometimes regarded as merely an expression of anxiety or depression. This leads to poor understanding, stigmatization, and appropriate disease management, underscoring the need for identifying objective pathophysiology. We have previously used machine learning applied to fMRI data to yield multivariate patterns of distributed brain activity that, together, can identify test subjects as adult FM patients vs. healthy adults with high cross-validated accuracy (93%). However, extrapolating adult FM brain abnormalities to JFM is problematic, given the many factors impacting the developing adolescent brain and the clinical differences between adult and juvenile forms of the disease. The goal of this proposal is to identify brain pathophysiology characteristic of JFM during tailored symptom provocation tasks. There is currently a complete lack of research into the brain correlates of pain in children with widespread pain/JFM. This study will lay the foundation for a line of research in understanding the neurophysiologic underpinnings of JFM, discovering whether brain pathophysiology in JFM differs from adult FM, and assessing treatment effects on specific markers of brain pathophysiology. This study is an R01 ancillary study to the NIH/NIAMS-funded trial (R01 AR070474; Kashikar-Zuck), “Multi-site randomized clinical trial of Fibromyalgia Integrative Training for Juvenile Fibromyalgia (FIT Teens)”. The exceptionally well characterized cohort of JFM patients from the parent trial presents a unique opportunity to study JFM neural correlates. Our time-sensitive study will transform the scientific output of the parent project by identifying neurophysiological correlates of pain, psychological and physical symptoms in this large, representative, extensively-characterized sample of JFM patients before and after treatment. We hypothesize that machine learning applied to fMRI data during tailored symptom-provocation tasks will identify patterns of neural activity predictive of JFM status (vs. healthy), which will correlate with JFM symptom dimensions (pain, non-painful sensory hypersensitivity, fatigue, and depressive symptoms). This ancillary study will utilize the comprehensive psychological and physical functioning profiles already being captured in the parent R01 trial to identify clinically meaningful neurologic measures in JFM and explore the potential for these measures to change with treatment. This line of research has the potential for a profound impact on understanding and identifying JFM pathophysiology and providing neuro-physiologically informed treatment recommendations. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed study will use functional brain imaging to identify patterns of brain activity associated with juvenile fibromyalgia and assess treatment effects on such neural patterns. The proposed research is relevant to the NIH’s Federal Pain Research Strategy because of its potential for a profound impact on understanding JFM neural pathophysiology and developing neuro-physiologically informed treatment recommendations.",Identifying neural pathophysiology in juvenile fibromyalgia,9830832,R01AR074795,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aerobic Exercise', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Aftercare', 'Ancillary Study', 'Anxiety', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Brain imaging', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Exercise', 'Fatigue', 'Female', 'Female Adolescents', 'Fibromyalgia', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Image Analysis', 'Judgment', 'Kentucky', 'Laboratory Finding', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases', 'Neurologic', 'Ohio', 'Output', 'Pain', 'Pain Measurement', 'Pain Research', 'Pain intensity', 'Painless', 'Parents', 'Parietal', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persistent pain', 'Physical Function', 'Physiological', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Sensory', 'Site', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Stigmatization', 'Stimulus', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'chronic painful condition', 'cingulate cortex', 'clinical pain', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'critical period', 'depressive symptoms', 'disability', 'fibromyalgia patients', 'hands-on learning', 'innovation', 'multisensory', 'neural correlate', 'neural patterning', 'neuromuscular', 'neurophysiology', 'pain symptom', 'parent project', 'physical symptom', 'psychologic', 'psychological symptom', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response']",NIAMS,CINCINNATI CHILDRENS HOSP MED CTR,R01,2019,418757,0.10723090661018855
"Mechanical Biomarkers of Chronic Low Back Pain Abstract The intervertebral disc (IVD) has an essential role in transferring load during normal spine function and when this normal function fails, symptoms, degeneration and altered spine mechanics may occur. The overall scientific premise of this work is that there is a gap in knowledge of the relationship between contributions from mechanical, inflammatory and biopsychosocial factors that lead to chronic low back pain (LBP). An important gap is a poor understanding of the relationship between IVD degeneration and LBP. This lack of understanding leads to discordance between imaging and self-reported pain and, ultimately, treatments being delivered by an exclusionary process. To address this gap, we will use innovative in vivo imaging tools to quantify the mechanical function of the IVD. We will also measure quantitative sensory factors, biochemical markers, and biopsychosocial factors that, when combined with mechanical function, may better identify subgroups or phenotypes of LBP. The overall goal of this project is to identify if mechanical function of the IVD is a potential risk factor and whether mechanical function can assist with defining phenotypes of LBP. The findings from this study would lead to longitudinal analyses to determine whether these phenotypes predict the transition from acute to chronic LBP. The rationale for this proposed research is that: 1) altered mechanical function of the IVD contributes to LBP. 2) LBP is a heterogeneous condition that can result from a combination of mechanical, inflammatory, and central pain based sources. The central hypothesis is that in vivo measured IVD mechanical function will be an important potential risk factor for both acute and chronic non-specific LBP and that this measure will improve the phenotyping of LBP. In Aim I, we will quantify the association between in-vivo measured IVD mechanical function among acute and chronic non-specific LBP participants and asymptomatic controls. In Aim II, we will derive well-defined phenotypes of LBP using combinations of potential risk factors. Identifying phenotypes of LBP will allow for specific rehabilitation, surgical, pharmaceutical or behavioral treatments to be targeted, resulting in improved patient outcomes. Project Narrative Low back pain is a complex and costly public health problem. We will use innovative combinations of in vivo imaging to quantify mechanical function of the intervertebral disc and combine this information with other known risk factors to develop subgroups of patients with low back pain. This can lead to specific interventions to improve outcomes for patients with low back pain.",Mechanical Biomarkers of Chronic Low Back Pain,9837163,R01AR075399,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Back Pain', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Markers', 'Biological Markers', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Chronic low back pain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Etiology', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'Intervention', 'Intervertebral disc structure', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Low Back Pain', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanical Low Back Pain', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases', 'Nature', 'Neuropeptides', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pain', 'Pain Research', 'Participant', 'Patient Selection', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Priority', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Site', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Vertebral column', 'Work', 'base', 'biopsychosocial', 'central pain', 'chronic musculoskeletal pain', 'clinical care', 'clinical development', 'clinical imaging', 'clinical phenotype', 'cost', 'demographics', 'experience', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'in vivo', 'in vivo imaging', 'inflammatory pain', 'innovation', 'intervertebral disk degeneration', 'longitudinal analysis', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'patient subsets', 'random forest', 'three-dimensional modeling']",NIAMS,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,609557,0.12786990869128648
"Finding Good TEMporal PostOperative pain Signatures (TEMPOS) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over 100 million patients undergo surgery each year in the US, and more than 60% of these patients will suffer from severe acute postoperative pain. Recent data suggest that the time course of pain resolution following surgery is highly variable with over one-third of patients experiencing stable or increasing, rather than decreasing, pain on each day after surgery for at least the first 7 postoperative days. While prior work has focused on linear trajectories of average daily postoperative pain, temporal profiles of pain that measure hourly variations in pain intensity provide a more accurate depiction of the postoperative pain experience than simple linear functions derived from daily pain assessments. The purpose of the proposed research is to elucidate the nature, mechanistic underpinnings, and clinical implications of TEMporal PostOperative pain Signatures (TEMPOS) by applying advanced algorithms to characterize postoperative pain profiles in a prospective cohort. The research will address three Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1: To characterize TEMPOS within the surgical population via state of the art time-series analysis techniques; Specific Aim 2: To identify clinical, biological, psychological, and social (CBPS) mechanisms that contribute to TEMPOS; Specific Aim 3: To determine which TEMPOS optimally predict the development of persistent postsurgical pain. To address these aims, we propose a single-center, prospective observational cohort study of 500 surgical patients. Prior to surgery, sociodemographic variables will be obtained via the electronic medical record (EMR), and patients will complete multiple online inventories for depression, anxiety and catastrophizing. A blood sample will be obtained for genetic studies exploring a variety of pain-related genes, and perioperative surgery and anesthetic details will be extracted from the EMR. Pain outcomes will be assessed at three resolutions: every 6 minutes via a patient-controlled analgesia device interrogation; every four hours via clinical assessments; and every day using the McGill Pain Questionnaire and Brief Pain Inventory. Clinical data on analgesic consumption and patient activity will be used for contextual assessment of pain intensity. Patients will be followed for up to 7 days after surgery, and will again be queried at 6 months after surgery to determine the presence and extent of persistent postsurgical pain. Analyses will first compare existing models, which classify patients as positive, neutral, or negative in pain trajectory slope, with higher-order models offering greater resolution in predicting postoperative pain at discrete time points. We will then perform clustering analyses with respect to the temporal patterns of postoperative pain in order to better define TEMPOS phenotypes. These analyses will be repeated with the clinical, biological, psychological, and social factors listed above to determine how these characteristics drive the mechanisms underlying the observed TEMPOS. Finally, we will use advanced machine learning models to forecast both acute and persistent postoperative pain outcomes with respect to the derived TEMPOS definitions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project examines how postoperative pain scores change with respect to time, and the impact of these temporal patterns on the risk for persistent postsurgical pain. These experiments will first demonstrate that there are many different, complex patterns of pain score changes over time after surgery, rather than the currently-established linear pain trajectories offered in the literature. Next, these experiments will determine how clinical, biological, psychological, and social factors predispose patients to different patterns of pain- analgesia-pain cycles, and finally determine how these timing patterns may influence the development of persistent postsurgical pain.",Finding Good TEMporal PostOperative pain Signatures (TEMPOS),9731523,R01GM114290,"['Abdomen', 'Absence of pain sensation', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Analgesics', 'Anesthetics', 'Anxiety', 'Biological', 'Blood specimen', 'Brief Pain Inventory', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Demographic Factors', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dimensions', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Educational Background', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Female', 'Genes', 'Genetic study', 'Hour', 'Lead', 'Linear Models', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Markov Chains', 'McGill Pain Scale', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Nerve Block', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Opioid', 'Orthopedics', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Pain Measurement', 'Pain intensity', 'Pain management', 'Patient-Controlled Analgesia', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perioperative', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Postoperative Pain', 'Postoperative Period', 'Predisposing Factor', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Prospective cohort', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'Translating', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'daily pain', 'discrete time', 'econometrics', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'genetic variant', 'improved', 'indexing', 'learning strategy', 'low socioeconomic status', 'novel', 'opioid use', 'pain catastrophizing', 'pain outcome', 'pain relief', 'pain score', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'public health relevance', 'sex', 'signal processing', 'social', 'sociodemographics', 'temporal measurement', 'trend']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,R01,2019,490997,0.3262437769089531
"Back Pain Consortium (BACPAC) Research Program Data Integration, Algorithm Development and Operations Management Center ABSTRACT The goal of this U24 application is to establish the Data Integration, Algorithm Development and Operations Management Center (DAC) for NIAMS' Back Pain Consortium (BACPAC) Research Program to ensure that the research objectives are met. The objectives of BACPAC include (i) discovery of lower back pain mechanisms through expert application of clinical and translational medicine methodologies; (ii) identification of new interventions targeted to individual patients through knowledge of established and newly discovered mechanisms; and (iii) evaluation of promising interventions to determine those that warrant further study, potentially leading to regulatory approval. A successful BACPAC research program will be based on cutting edge technologies and reflect the patient-centric focus that is critical to any investigation in this chronic and burdensome disease. Central to this success will be an innovative, forward-looking, and productive DAC that brings cohesion to research performed by the participating Mechanistic Research Centers, Technology Research Sites, and Phase 2 Clinical Trials Centers. DAC Investigators will share their vision and provide scientific leadership and organizational support to the BACPAC Consortium. Our research plan consists of designing and conducting clinical trials with precision interventions in stratified patient populations. Precision medicine interventions that focus on identifying the best treatments for individual patients, instead of the best treatments for the most patients, could improve overall outcomes among this heterogenous patient population. Key elements of the DAC that will enhance collaboration and research progress include experienced leadership, innovative design and analysis methodologies (e.g., sequential adaptive designs, machine learning, neural networks, Q-learning), comprehensive research operations support, a state-of-the-art data management and integration system, and superior administrative support. Our communications infrastructure will provide both public and private websites and a social media presence to effectively disseminate appropriate information to BACPAC investigators, participants, and the public. We will develop a secure, user- friendly advanced data management and integration system that includes web-based access for surveys, data entry, research management (including comprehensive reporting, biosample tracking and performance-based reimbursement tools), integration with external applications, and quality control. Our research operations and administration teams will provide a solid foundation to the BACPAC Research Program by facilitating meetings, collaborative document preparation, tracking of regulatory compliance, and support for abstract and publication preparation across the BACPAC Consortium. Together, this integrated structure will set the stage for technology assessments, solicitation of patient input and utilities, and the evaluation of high-impact interventions through the innovative design and sound execution of clinical trials, leading to effective personalized treatment approaches for patients with chronic lower back pain. PROJECT NARRATIVE Chronic low back pain (cLBP) affects over 10% of adults in the US, contributing to the burden of disability and health care costs, and putting those suffering from cLBP at risk of opioid addiction or even overdose.

"Single Session Pain Catastrophizing Treatment: Comparative Efficacy & Mechanisms ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic low back pain (CLBP) is the most common chronic pain condition and is the second leading cause of disability in the U.S. Pain catastrophizing (PC)--a pattern of negative cognitive-emotional responses to actual or anticipated pain-is significantly associated with the development and maintenance of CLBP as well as disability. PC undermines CLBP treatments, thus contributing to a cycle of treatment futility and wasted expenditure. While Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (pain-CBT) treats PC, group treatment involves 6-10 sessions and thus poses substantial burdens of time, travel, and cost. Therefore, there is a critical need to develop and disseminate efficient, low-cost treatments that specifically reduce PC. Accordingly, we developed a single-session, 2-hour pain-CBT class that solely treats PC (""From Catastrophizing to Recovery""; FCR). Our pilot data revealed large effect sizes for FCR in a chronic pain sample and superior outcomes for medical and psychological across PROMIS domains, as compared to a 'treatment as usual' matched clinic cohort. We propose to conduct a 3-arm comparative efficacy RCT in 231 patients with CLBP comparing: (A) FCR, (B) a health education control, and (C) an 8-session pain-CBT class. Our primary endpoint is PC 3 months post- treatment and our secondary endpoint is PC 6 months post-treatment. We hypothesize that FCR will be superior to active control and non-inferior to the 8-session pain-CBT class for improving PC and pain-related outcomes measured by our PROMIS platform. An innovative aspect of the application is our proposal to develop and validate a brief version Daily PCS measure, and apply the measure with high frequency sampling methods to elucidate the mechanics of PC, and to characterize how positive response to active intervention reduces the influence of PC episodes. Additional novel methods our specialized PROMIS platform; actigraphy for objective sleep and activity measurement; and a customized 'FCR Relaxation Resource' app (on Nexus 7 tablets) to objectively quantify skills use in the FCR group. Our rich dataset will allow for detailed phenotyping of responders / non-responders for both active treatments using machine learning and other advanced analytics. We will use daily ratings across a longitudinal timeframe to characterize how PC changes in response to treatment, as well as the mechanistic influence of PC on pain, sleep, activity, and other variables. Our proposal addresses the NCCAM priorities to (1) ""alleviate chronic pain"", (2) study our mind-body intervention in a ""real-world setting,"" and (3) advance scientific understanding of the mechanisms of PC. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Pain catastrophizing (PC)--a negative cognitive and emotional psychological pattern-is so powerful that it undermines medical treatment and contributes to pain chronicity. This project investigates a promising single- session, low-cost intervention that specifically treats PC. The concentrated scope and format of the intervention allows for broad patient access and thus may reduce the suffering of millions of Americans living with chronic pain.",Single Session Pain Catastrophizing Treatment: Comparative Efficacy & Mechanisms,9700604,R01AT008561,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Aftercare', 'American', 'Back Pain', 'Biological Assay', 'Caring', 'Chronic low back pain', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Control Groups', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Education', 'Emotional', 'Expenditure', 'Fatigue', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gap Junctions', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Health education', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Insurance', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mind-Body Intervention', 'National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pain', 'Pain intensity', 'Pain interference', 'Pain management', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physical Function', 'Pilot Projects', 'Psychology', 'Psychophysiology', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recovery', 'Relaxation', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Sleep', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Tablets', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Travel', 'Treatment Cost', 'Treatment Futility', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'actigraphy', 'active control', 'active method', 'arm', 'barrier to care', 'body-mind', 'chronic pain', 'chronic painful condition', 'cohort', 'comparative efficacy', 'comparative treatment', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'daily pain', 'design', 'disability', 'effective therapy', 'efficacy trial', 'improved', 'innovation', 'intervention cost', 'multilevel analysis', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'pain behavior', 'pain catastrophizing', 'pain reduction', 'payment', 'prevent', 'primary endpoint', 'psychologic', 'public health relevance', 'responders and non-responders', 'response', 'secondary endpoint', 'skill acquisition', 'skills', 'trait', 'treatment as usual', 'treatment effect', 'treatment group', 'treatment response']",NCCIH,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,804583,0.3171851329175787

"Wearable nanocomposite sensor system for diagnosing mechanical sources of low back pain and guiding rehabilitation PROJECT SUMMARY Back pain has gained the distinction of being the most disabling condition in the world [1-3], affecting 80-90% of the US population at some point in their lifetime, with 29% of the US population having experienced lower back pain within the last 3 months. Back and neck pain are the leading cause of missed work days and rank second only to the common cold as a reason for a visit to the doctor, accounting for approximately 30% of general practitioner visits. Of particular concern is chronic low back pain (cLBP), which is recurrent and often non-responsive to conservative treatments. It has long been recognized that spinal pathology changes the way that we move. Biomechanists, physical therapists, and surgeons each utilize a variety of tools and techniques to assess and interpret qualitative movement changes as a window to understanding potential mechanical and neurological sources of low back pain and as a critical element in their treatment paradigm. However, objectively characterizing and communicating this information is currently impossible, since clinically feasible (e.g., cost-effective, objective, and accurate) tools and quantitative benchmarks do not exist. This proposal addresses the challenge to improve cLBP outcomes through the use of unique, inexpensive, screen-printable, elastomer-based nano-composite piezoresponsive sensors which will be integrated into a SPInal Nanosensor Environment (SPINE Sense System) to measure lumbar kinematics and provide an objective, quantitative platform for diagnosis, monitoring, and follow-up assessment of cLBP. PROJECT NARRATIVE Our Technology Research Site team is dedicated to improving our ability to diagnose and treat low back pain. Our approach is to utilize a wearable nano-biosensing/biofeedback system to measure low back movements and incorporate that information into a platform for both diagnosis and treatment of chronic low back pain.",Wearable nanocomposite sensor system for diagnosing mechanical sources of low back pain and guiding rehabilitation,9897908,UH2AR076723,"['3-Dimensional', 'Accounting', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Articular Range of Motion', 'Back', 'Back Pain', 'Benchmarking', 'Biofeedback', 'Biosensing Techniques', 'Chronic low back pain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Common Cold', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Elastomers', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Funding', 'General Practitioners', 'Goals', 'Infrastructure', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Joints', 'Legal patent', 'Low Back Pain', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Neck Pain', 'Neurologic', 'Pathology', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Readiness', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recurrence', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Site', 'Source', 'Spinal', 'Surgeon', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Vertebral column', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'design', 'experience', 'follow up assessment', 'improved', 'kinematics', 'machine learning algorithm', 'nano', 'nanocomposite', 'nanosensors', 'new technology', 'off-patent', 'pain outcome', 'pain patient', 'phenotypic data', 'physical therapist', 'practical application', 'prototype', 'response', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'success', 'technological innovation', 'tool']",NIAMS,BRIGHAM YOUNG UNIVERSITY,UH2,2019,725641,0.2288031350857253
"Engaging Veterans Seeking Service-Connection Payments in Pain Treatment Abstract In 2015 alone, 97,223 new Veterans under age 35 began receiving compensation for injuries related to their military service. In total, there are 559,999 post-9/11 Veterans being compensated for back or neck conditions, and a partially overlapping 596,250 for limitation of flexion in joints. Veterans seeking compensation for musculoskeletal conditions often develop chronic pain and are at high risk for substance misuse. Early intervention is needed to arrest worsening pain and risky substance use, particularly among post-9/11 Veterans for whom engagement in non-pharmacological pain treatment has the potential to improve their overall quality of life and spare them the complications of opioid treatments. The service-connection application is an ideal point-of-contact for initiating early intervention treatments for these at-risk Veterans. We propose to test the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of Screening, Brief Intervention and Referral to Treatment for Pain Management (SBIRT-PM), designed to reduce pain and risky substance use. In brief, the counselor explains that treating both physical and psychological aspects of pain leads to the best outcomes, outlines what VA (and non-VA if preferred) services are available to Veterans, explains that substances are sometimes used for pain relief, and segues into traditional SBIRT. SBIRT-PM's efficacy is supported by a completed clinical trial of 101 Veterans applying for service-connection for MSD, and by studies showing the efficacy of SBIRT for people with risky substance use and of Motivational Interviewing for engagement in non-pharmacological pain care. The study will involve a two-year period to arrange for clinicians at a single “hub” site to counsel Veterans throughout New England by phone with SBIRT-PM, and a four-year period to conduct the clinical trial and disseminate its findings. During the two-years of preparation for the clinical trial, the team will prepare SBIRT-PM for implementation by establishing communication (Relational Coordination is the theoretical framework) between the “hub” where the SBIRT-PM clinician is sited and the “spoke” sites, establishing study- related procedures, and piloting the intervention at each of the eight VA medical centers in New England. For the full clinical trial, we will randomize 1200 Veterans applying for compensation related to MSD to either SBIRT-PM or Usual Care (UC) across eight VA medical centers in New England. Outcome assessment by phone will occur at 12 and 36-week follow-ups, and will be corroborated with other sources of information ---the electronic health record and toxicology testing of nail clippings. We hypothesize that, compared to Usual Care, SBIRT-PM will be more effective and cost-effective in improving Veterans' pain and substance use. We further hypothesize that a mediator of these improvements will be use of non-pharmacological services, as extracted from VA records from structured data fields and from narrative text in the medical record using an innovative natural language processing algorithm. Screening and referral to treatment at service-connection examinations can transform a widely-used point of entry to VA into a health-promoting encounter. Narrative Veterans seeking compensation for musculoskeletal conditions often develop chronic pain and are at high risk for substance misuse. We propose to test the effectiveness and cost- effectiveness of Screening, Brief Intervention and Referral to Treatment for Pain Management (SBIRT-PM), designed to reduce pain and reduce risky substance use, in part by helping Veterans get comprehensive pain treatment. The study will involve a 2-year period to arrange for clinicians at a single site to counsel Veterans throughout New England by phone with SBIRT-PM as part of a clinical trial, and a 4-year period to conduct the trial and disseminate its findings.",Engaging Veterans Seeking Service-Connection Payments in Pain Treatment,9949294,UH3AT009758,"['Age', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Algorithms', 'Award', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Brief Pain Inventory', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communication', 'Conduct Clinical Trials', 'Cost Analysis', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Distress', 'Early Intervention', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Financial compensation', 'Health Promotion', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Human Resources', 'Individual', 'Injury compensation', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Joints', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medical Records', 'Medical center', 'Military Personnel', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'Musculoskeletal', 'Musculoskeletal Diseases', 'Nail plate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neck', 'New England', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Assessment', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pain', 'Pain interference', 'Pain management', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Phase', 'Populations at Risk', 'Preparation', 'Procedures', 'Professional counselor', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized', 'Records', 'Risk', 'Secure', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Site Visit', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Toxicology', 'Veterans', 'base', 'chronic pain', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cost effectiveness', 'design', 'experience', 'functional improvement', 'high risk', 'implementation strategy', 'improved', 'informant', 'innovation', 'motivational enhancement therapy', 'multimodality', 'pain outcome', 'pain reduction', 'pain relief', 'pain symptom', 'payment', 'pragmatic trial', 'primary outcome', 'psychologic', 'recruit', 'screening', 'screening, brief intervention, referral, and treatment', 'secondary outcome', 'service utilization', 'substance abuse treatment', 'substance misuse', 'symptomatic improvement', 'treatment as usual', 'willingness to pay']",NCCIH,YALE UNIVERSITY,UH3,2019,1355545,0.2341834452638389
"UCSF Core Center for Patient-centric Mechanistic Phenotyping in Chronic Low Back Pain The proposed UCSF Core Center for Patient-centric Mechanistic Phenotyping in Chronic Low Back Pain (UCSF REACH) will be an interdisciplinary consortium of basic and clinical scientists dedicated to understanding and clarifying the biopsychosocial mechanisms of chronic low back pain (cLBP). The goal of UCSF REACH is to define chronic low back pain (cLBP) phenotypes and pain mechanisms that can lead to effective, personalized treatments for patients across the population. A fundamental challenge for improving lives of cLBP patients is that pain can perpetuate and worsen as a result of dynamic interaction among several patient-specific factors. However, the principle factors and their interactions remain obscure because they haven't been rigorously investigated in a single longitudinal cohort. REACH proposes to overcome this obstacle by forming a linkage between researchers who study disease biology, experts who develop advanced investigational tools and methods, scientists who analyze vast archives of clinical data, and practitioners who actively treat patients. UCSF REACH proposes six cores: 1) Administrative Core; 2) Clinical Core; 3) Informatics Core; 4) Bio-behavioral Core; 5) Pathophysiology Core; and 6) Physical Function and Biomechanics Core. These cores will provide support to a single research project that is focused on the challenge of developing validated and adoptable tools that enable comprehensive yet routine clinical assessment and treatment of CLBP patients. REACH will also foster scientific exchange through an Enrichment Program; the curriculum includes seminars featuring local and visiting scientists, an annual full-day retreat with the External Advisory Committee, and half- day symposia with a rotating topic relevant to the biopsychosocial model of cLBP. Another vital component of REACH is its Pilot/Ancillary Studies Program. This provides seed money to leverage REACH clinical data and cores. Overall, the object of REACH is to make optimum use of all available resources to catalyze discovery and translation of novel diagnostics and therapeutics that improve outcomes of cLBP patients. The overall goal of this BACPAC MRC is to define chronic low back pain (cLBP) phenotypes and pain mechanisms that can lead to effective, personalized treatments for patients across the population. To achieve this goal, we propose three administrative cores, three research cores, and a central research project. The central research project will: 1) validate and prioritize novel instruments that assess critical domains of the biopsychosocial model; 2) validate patient-centered outcome measures; and 3) investigate their clinical utility using the UCSF REACH cLBP cohorts.",UCSF Core Center for Patient-centric Mechanistic Phenotyping in Chronic Low Back Pain,9898132,U19AR076737,"['Adopted', 'Advisory Committees', 'Anatomy', 'Ancillary Study', 'Archives', 'Back Pain', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biomechanics', 'Blood specimen', 'Brain imaging', 'California', 'Chronic', 'Chronic low back pain', 'Clinic', 'Clinic Activity', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical assessments', 'Common Data Element', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Cytometry', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Enrollment', 'Etiology', 'Fostering', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Informatics', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Low Back Pain', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Musculoskeletal', 'National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pain', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patient advocacy', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physical Function', 'Population', 'Prevention strategy', 'Psychology', 'Questionnaires', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Transcend', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Vertebral column', 'Visit', 'analytical tool', 'biobehavior', 'biopsychosocial', 'central pain', 'clinical care', 'clinical imaging', 'clinical pain', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'deep learning', 'digital', 'disability', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'insight', 'instrument', 'interdisciplinary collaboration', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome forecast', 'pain patient', 'pain processing', 'patient oriented', 'personalized medicine', 'prediction algorithm', 'prescription opioid', 'programs', 'psychologic', 'ranpirnase', 'social', 'symposium', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'treatment optimization', 'treatment response', 'wearable device']",NIAMS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",U19,2019,29408845,0.1583440398942507
"Identifying opioid response phenotypes in low back pain electronic health data Pain is the leading reason for adult outpatient and emergency department medical visits, impacting over 100 million Americans at a cost of over $600 billion dollars annually. Low back pain (LBP) represents 28% of this health-care problem and is the leading cause of disability, both in the United States and worldwide. Opioids are the most commonly prescribed drug class in the United States, and the majority of these prescriptions are for LBP. Despite the broad application of opioid therapy in LBP, the phenotypes of individuals who experience pain relief from opioid treatment have not been identified, leaving providers without clear guidance for safe and effective therapy. Given this staggering burden of disease and health-care utilization, clinical information regarding LBP widely populates the electronic health record (EHR), providing a valuable data source. However, this information presently has little meaning beyond the individual patient experience because the majority of pain-related data from the EHR is embedded in free text. Using EHR data may provide the crucial bridge to a better understanding of LBP. Thus, the central hypothesis of this proposal is that translating clinical experiences into discrete and analyzable data, specifically modeling opioid response phenotypes for patients with LBP, will identify clinically relevant phenotypic treatment responses. To test this hypothesis, this mentored career development project will adapt and apply natural language processing (NLP), data standardization, mining, and analysis tools to specifically model opioid response phenotypes for patients with LBP to characterize pain intensity, functional status, and pain interference with activity. Through integrated aims, this proposal will, 1) support the annotation of LBP and opioid note corpus, and the mapping of clinical concepts related to pain intensity, functional status, and pain interference with activities; 2) use NLP to identify and relate relevant opioid response phenotypes in patients with LBP in the EHR; and 3) characterize LBP phenotypes associated with opioid dose escalation. Clinical NLP uses statistical modeling to extract and transform high dimensional clinical data, which, when developed with the PI’s domain knowledge, creates a unique opportunity to understand LBP management, outcomes, and therapeutic efficacy. Ultimately this foundation may be used to predict clinical outcomes and responses to therapeutic interventions. Our long-term goal is to move beyond identifying disease phenotype profiles to create a system to identify treatment response phenotypes. Stratifying patients based on pain intensity, functional status, pain interference and other factors, we plan to identify potential cohorts that warrant further study from a genetic focus. This mentored career development grant (K08) will support a clinical expert’s adaptation of tools and training in a systematic method to allow growth toward a programmatic line of research that is incredibly responsive to the NIH pain research agenda and can transition to independent R01-level funding. Low back pain is the leading cause of disability worldwide. Yet, despite this significant health burden, we lack predictive models for clinical care. Unfortunately, clinicians lack clear guidance for treatment, specifically regarding the use of opioids. This proposal would accelerate pain medicine research by translating clinical experiences into discrete and analyzable data, specifically examining opioid response patterns for patients with low back pain in the electronic health record. Ultimately, this would provide a foundation for advancing clinical care as well as future approaches to genomic and personalized medicine.",Identifying opioid response phenotypes in low back pain electronic health data,9667431,K08EB022631,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Adult', 'Advisory Committees', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Biomedical Research', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Documentation', 'Dose', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Low Back Pain', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Ontology', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Output', 'Pain', 'Pain Research', 'Pain intensity', 'Pain interference', 'Pain management', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Prevention', 'Provider', 'Records', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Scientist', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Vocabulary', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'career development', 'clinical care', 'clinical pain', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'disability', 'disease phenotype', 'effective therapy', 'electronic data', 'experience', 'functional status', 'health care service utilization', 'health data', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'novel', 'opioid therapy', 'opioid use', 'outcome prediction', 'pain patient', 'pain relief', 'patient stratification', 'personalized medicine', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive modeling', 'response', 'search engine', 'symposium', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NIBIB,WAKE FOREST UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,K08,2019,184373,0.22021370209189373
"Effects of Music Based Intervention (MBI) on Neurodevelopment and Pain Response in Preterm Infants Project Summary  In 2018, the World Health Organization reported 15 million (>1 in 10) preterm births with rising annual rates. 50% of preterm infants suffer from neurodevelopmental impairments, and all preterm infants experience high volumes of painful procedures as part of medical care. Preterm music intervention shows immediate physiologic improvements in heart rate and oxygen saturation, as well as improved physiologic responses to pain. What remains unknown is how music impacts preterm brain maturation, neurodevelopment, and pain responses in preterm infants. We propose a R61 project to explore biological mechanisms of music based intervention (MBI) on preterm brain maturation and neurodevelopment using electroencephalography (EEG) and event related potentials (ERPs). EEG captures electrical potential oscillations of the brain which yields valuable information about brain function. Serial EEGs can track brain maturation in preterm infants. ERPs quantify electrical brain potentials changes time-locked with a stimulus. ERPs at 1 month corrected age test recognition memory function and cognitive processing and offers another objective measure to study the early effects of the MBI’s on neurodevelopment. The R61 will also explore the behavioral processes underlying effects of MBI on pain using EEG and the premature infant pain profile (PIPP). In preterm infants, central EEG amplitudes change when time-locked to a painful stimulus and PIPP scores scale pain responses with painful procedures. Specific recorded lullabies with simple arpeggiated accompaniment will be played for 6 weeks in a small randomized, blinded, controlled study of 50 medically stable 30 week preterms. Exploratory R61 findings will be assessed by specific Go/NoGo milestones that provide insight into the effects of MBI on biological mechanisms underlying neurodevelopment and behavioral processes underlying pain. By achieving one of the Go/NoGo milestones, the proposal progresses to the R33 proof of concept pilot clinical trial with an additional 100 randomized subjects that will assess two primary outcomes measures: 1) MBI effects on Late Neurodevelopment using Bayley’s III neurodevelopmental testing at 6 month corrected age, and 2) Cumulative effects of MBI on Pain Response using longitudinal comparisons of baseline PIPP scores and final PIPP scores after 4 weeks of MBI. Secondary measures would explore more nuanced aspects of neurodevelopment: 1) MBI effects on brain maturation with expanded analyses of EEG-sleep components; 2) repeat ERP analysis at 6 months corrected age with expanded memory and cognitive testing (additional mismatch negativity paradigms); and pain response: 3) MBI effects on pain related EEG responses with comparative analyses of central EEG amplitude changes to the frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital lobes. Project Narrative This project addresses the following public health concerns: 1) high rates of neurodevelopmental impairments from preterm birth and 2) detrimental neurodevelopmental sequelae as a result of current preterm pain management regimens. We will initiate a two phased pilot clinical trial (randomized, double blinded, controlled) to support mechanistic research on the effects of music based intervention on neurodevelopment and pain response in preterm infants, with the second phase, as a proof of concept clinical trial evaluating the effects of music based intervention on late neurodevelopment and the cumulative effects of music on pain response. The public health relevance of this study is to provide groundbreaking results on effects of music based intervention in preterm infant health to inform future strategies on music research, given that music intervention is low risk, minimally invasive with a high potential health impact.",Effects of Music Based Intervention (MBI) on Neurodevelopment and Pain Response in Preterm Infants,9883118,R61AT010712,"['Address', 'Age', 'Attention', 'Attenuated', 'Auditory', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Blinded', 'Brain', 'Caring', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Controlled Study', 'Data', 'Development', 'Discrimination', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Electroencephalography', 'Event-Related Potentials', 'Future', 'Health', 'Heart Rate', 'Infant', 'Infant Health', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Knowledge', 'Late Effects', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Memory', 'Music', 'Music Therapy', 'Neonatal Intensive Care Units', 'Neonatology', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurodevelopmental Impairment', 'Occipital lobe', 'Outcome Measure', 'Oxygen', 'Pain', 'Pain management', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Pediatric Neurology', 'Perceptual learning', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Premature Birth', 'Premature Infant', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Regimen', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Wake Cycle', 'Stimulus', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Time', 'World Health Organization', 'attenuation', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'early childhood', 'electrical potential', 'experience', 'frontal lobe', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'intervention effect', 'memory recognition', 'minimally invasive', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurodevelopment', 'non rapid eye movement', 'novel', 'primary outcome', 'public health relevance', 'rapid eye movement', 'recruit', 'response', 'standard of care', 'statistics', 'tool', 'trend']",NCCIH,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R61,2019,100000,0.1443572344806988
"SCH: INT: Collaborative Research: Development and analysis of new mathematical and statistical models for chronic pain Program Director/Principal Investigator (Last, First, Middle): Abrams, Daniel, M Project Description  1. Intellectual merit (see Sec. 2, pages 13-14, for ""Broader impacts"") 1.1 Introduction and background 1.1.1 General introduction During recent decades there has been an extraordinary growth in the availability of data relating to a wide range of microbiological systems. That data has enabled new quantitative approaches to biology, including the development of new mathematical and statistical models that given fun- damental insight into the workings of biological systems.  Another source is now growing explosively: biomedical data. This data has significant potential for use in treatment of human disease, but thus far comparatively fewer mathematical models for medical phenomena have been developed. The hope is that quantitative models will allow for ""personalized"" or ""precision"" medicine, where treatment protocols are customized based on an understanding of how individual patient characteristics impact the effectiveness of the treatment. Deep mathematical understanding of biomedical systems also promises to allow for optimization of medical interventions: the physical and/or financial costs of intervention could be minimized for a given desired level of benefit.  The broad goal of the proposed research is to develop new integrative mathematical models for the dynamics of subjective pain in patients suffering from chronic pain. These models will combine existing qualitative knowledge with insight gained from newly available patient data, with the goal of incorporating data streams corning on line in the near future. We plan to develop multiple models in parallel using a variety of approaches and then to select the best rnodel(s) based on agreement with objective data. 1.1.2 Background on biological application: Sickle cell disease Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a chronic illness associated with frequent medical complications and hospitalizations. Approximately 90% of acute care visits are for pain events, and 30-day reuti- lization rates are alarmingly high [27]. While factors influenci.ng these high re-utilization rates are poorly understood, close follow-up and continued use of pain medication has been shown to de- crease re-hospitalization rates. Mobile technology has become an integral part of health care management and Pl Shah's recently developed mobile application (SMART app - see Figure 1) for SCD assists with documentation of pain and interventions. 1.1.3 Background on hybrid approach Perhaps because of the often distinct educational backgrounds of practitioners or distinct typical applications, statistical and mechanistic approaches are not frequently combined in addressing a single problem. The majority of attempts in the scientific literature have appeared in the context of neural networks [37, 38, 29] and chemical engineering [38, 33, 11], where they largely play a computational rather than analytical role. Some attempts have also been made with medical applications: Rosenberg et al. [30] and Adams et al. [4] developed a model by combining a dy- namical systems approach with a statistical model to predict a patient's CD4 cell counts and HIV viral load over time in an HIV study. Timms et al.

"Cerebral oscillations of pain Summary Chronic pain disorders are amongst the most burdensome of all diseases in terms of their impact on the individual and the costs to society. The development of novel therapeutic approaches for chronic pain have relied on basic studies involving genetic and molecular approaches in rodent models of pain, but existing drugs generally provide very limited relief for only a small number of patients. The result is that a vast number of people with chronic pain go untreated and have only partial relief. There is substantial and growing evidence from within and outside the pain research fields that indicates neural oscillations reflect cognitive, emotional, and sensory processes, which are all components of the pain experience. Furthermore, we can target these oscillatory patterns to alter perception. In particular, alpha band activity has been associated with chronic pain, and our extensive recent work and preliminary findings indicate that alpha can reliably predict future sensitivity to pain experienced minutes to weeks in the future in healthy subjects. In the proposed studies, we use simultaneous EEG-fMRI to continue our ongoing work on alpha oscillations as pain mechanisms and extend it to test the specificity and sensitivity of the signals and the relationship between alpha, brain networks, and pain. The proposed work would lead to improved understanding of the neurobiology of pain, identify novel brain targets for new or improved interventions, and potentially reveal a prognostic biomarker that would be useful for testing new therapeutic approaches and objectively assessing clinical improvement on an individual basis. Narrative Development of treatments for chronic pain has been limited, but the potential for using brain signal predictive and prognostic biomarkers is growing. In the proposed studies we aim to understand the mechanisms of an electroencephalogram (EEG) based brain oscillation that predicts pain sensitivity in healthy subjects. The findings will provide a major step forward in the development of novel therapies for chronic pain and individualized treatment approaches.",Cerebral oscillations of pain,9800796,R01NS112356,"['Affect', 'Alpha Rhythm', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Cerebrum', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Electroencephalogram', 'Emotional', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuscripts', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Neurobiology', 'Pain', 'Pain Research', 'Pain intensity', 'Pain management', 'Pain-Free', 'Painless', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Persistent pain', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Predictive Factor', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Reproducibility', 'Rest', 'Rodent Model', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sensory', 'Sensory Process', 'Signal Transduction', 'Societies', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Task Performances', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'blood oxygen level dependent', 'chronic pain', 'chronic painful condition', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive performance', 'cognitive task', 'cost', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'learning strategy', 'mindfulness intervention', 'neuroimaging', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'novel therapeutics', 'pain model', 'pain sensitivity', 'predictive marker', 'psychosocial', 'relating to nervous system', 'side effect', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy development', 'vector']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,R01,2019,414653,0.3191205502850306
"Electrocardiographic Detection of Non-ST Elevation Myocardial Events for Accelerated Classification of Chest Pain Encounters (ECG-SMART) Electrocardiographic Detection of Non-ST Elevation Myocardial Events for Accelerated  Classification of Chest Pain Encounters (ECG-SMART) ABSTRACT There is a clear need to develop improved tools to stratify risk in patients who seek emergency care for chest pain, one of the most common and potentially deadliest conditions encountered in acute care settings. The ECG has been the mainstay of initial evaluation of chest pain patients, yet is currently only diagnostic for a small subset of patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction. Our well-rounded and collaborative team has been working together for the past four years to develop novel ECG interpretation algorithms that can greatly enhance the utility of the ECG in the early evaluation of acute coronary disease. This line of work is already substantiated by pilot studies that have identified candidate markers of ECG characteristics and preliminary algorithms that can identify patients with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction as well as those with very low risk of coronary artery disease. With these improved tools, emergency providers (physicians, nurses, and paramedics) will be able to streamline the care provided to these patients beyond the costly and time- consuming overnight observation for serial cardiac enzymes and provocative testing. This grant will provide needed resources for our team to enroll a cohort of over 1,800 patients needed to confirm the accuracy of these ECG markers and determine their maximal clinical utility as part of a risk stratification tool. It builds directly on our existing work in this area, which has already yielded necessary preliminary data and multiple joint publications. Validating this technology will set the groundwork for the future development and testing of targeted interventions to improve patient outcomes in non-ST elevation myocardial infarction. SUMMARY/NARRATIVE Current guidelines for diagnosing and treating myocardial infarction (MI) are based on identifying ST elevation (STE) on the 12-lead ECG, yet only one third of MI patients exhibit such elevation. We propose to (1) extend our prior research of novel repolarization indices of non-STE MI available on the initial ECG and (2) incorporate this information into real-time machine-learning algorithms for clinical decision support, which will improve our sensitivity in detecting and treating MI very early during urgent care. Such early and non-invasively acquired diagnostics can improve outcomes and save costs for millions of patients with chest pain annually.",Electrocardiographic Detection of Non-ST Elevation Myocardial Events for Accelerated Classification of Chest Pain Encounters (ECG-SMART),9681483,R01HL137761,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Action Potentials', 'Acute', 'Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Area', 'Aspirin', 'Attenuated', 'Benign', 'Biological Markers', 'Cardiac', 'Caring', 'Catheterization', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chest Pain', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Consumption', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary Occlusions', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Distress', 'Dose', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Emergency Care', 'Emergency Situation', 'Emergency department visit', 'Emergency medical service', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Enzymes', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Harvest', 'Health Care Costs', 'Heart Injuries', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Infarction', 'Injury', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Ischemia', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Muscle strain', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Myocardial Ischemia', 'Myocardium', 'Necrosis', 'Nitrates', 'Nurses', 'Outcome', 'Oxygen', 'Pain Measurement', 'Paramedical Personnel', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Pre-hospital setting', 'Pre-hospitalization care', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'ROC Curve', 'Records', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resource Allocation', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Serum', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Stress Tests', 'Supervision', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Triage', 'Troponin', 'Unstable angina', 'Ventricular', 'Work', 'base', 'billing data', 'candidate marker', 'clinical decision support', 'cohort', 'cost', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'digital', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'indexing', 'injured', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality', 'novel', 'pain patient', 'patient subsets', 'perfusion imaging', 'primary outcome', 'prognostic value', 'reduce symptoms', 'secondary outcome', 'support tools', 'tertiary care', 'tool', 'urgent care']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2019,370300,0.116083377147864
"Neuroimaging-Based Brain and Spinal Cord Biomarkers for Cervical Radiculopathy Chronic pain is a widespread problem that affects a third of Americans and greatly burdens the health care system. Despite its prevalence, chronic pain remains poorly understood, and the current clinical strategies are minimally effective. The application of advanced neuroimaging techniques to the study of chronic pain has significantly increased our understanding of the brain’s role in the development and maintenance of chronic pain, and through these studies, researchers have uncovered previously unknown neural processes involved in pain chronification. The spinal cord is the caudal extension of the brainstem and is actively involved in the modulation and transmission of neural signals between the body and the brain. Alterations in the neural processing in the spinal cord are also thought to have an integral role in pain chronification. Recent advancements in spinal cord neuroimaging have made the quantitative study of the spinal cord’s role in chronic pain possible. Expanding the neuroimaging-based investigation of chronic pain to the spinal cord will provide a complete perspective of the central processes underlying pain chronification. In this mentored career development award (K23), Dr. Weber will identify, characterize, and longitudinally track neuroimaging-based biomarkers for chronic pain in the brain and spinal cord using cervical radiculopathy as a model condition for chronic pain. Cervical radiculopathy is a common cause of neck and upper limb pain and provides a unique opportunity to scientifically study chronic pain in a homogenous patient sample. In Aims 1 and 2, Dr. Weber will identify differences in the brain and spinal cord networks between patients with chronic pain due to right-sided cervical radiculopathy and age- and sex-matched healthy controls. In Aim 3, clinical measures in the same cohort of cervical radiculopathy patients will be longitudinally tracked at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after the imaging session, and neuroimaging-based prognostic factors contributing to pain reduction in cervical radiculopathy will be identified. In the same cohort of patients, the imaging will be repeated at 12 months, and the links between the changes in the brain and spinal cord and recovery will be explored. This research will move the pain field forward by further elucidating the neural processes underlying chronic pain and its recovery. Throughout the award period, Dr. Weber will obtain new skills and expertise in conducting clinical studies including randomized controlled trials and applying advanced computational methods to clinical pain research. Additionally, Dr. Weber will gain further training in advanced neuroimaging methods, pain neurobiology, career development, and grant writing. To accomplish the proposed research and training, Dr. Weber has assembled a multi-disciplinary team of world-class mentors who are committed to his success. This training will build on Dr. Weber’s clinical background and doctoral research training in neuroscience and ultimately provide him with the knowledge and skillset to establish an independent research program, in which, he will lead impactful scientific research that intersects neuroimaging and clinical pain research. New advances in medical imaging are uncovering the central nervous system’s role in chronic pain. Here, we aim to use advanced neuroimaging techniques to identify and characterize neuroimaging-based biomarkers for chronic pain in the brain and spinal cord of cervical radiculopathy patients.

"Altered Microbiome of Chronic Pelvic Pain ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Abundant and diverse bacterial species inhabit the GI tract, constituting the bulk of the GI ""microbiome."" The GI microbiome plays key roles in health and disease processes throughout the body, yet it is unclear whether or how the microbiome mediates the pathogenesis of urologic chronic pelvic pain syndromes (UCPPS). Indeed, UCPPS cause significant morbidity in women and men, but etiologies, diagnostic markers, and therapies are lacking. Here, we present preliminary data demonstrating that UCPPS in women is associated with altered GI microbiota, and specific species are candidates for novel UCPPS biomarkers. Moreover, in clinically relevant murine UCPPS models, symptom-like behaviors can be modulated by manipulating the GI microbiome. We hypothesize that an altered GI microbiome results in circulating bacterial products that act on CNS targets and contribute to UCPPS. This project will use a combination of clinical, translational, and mechanistic studies to define the role of the GI microbiome in UCPPS, and in contrast to voiding dysfunction in the absence of pain. These findings will lead to the development of novel diagnostics and effective probiotic therapies for chronic pelvic pain. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Bacteria residing in the gastrointestinal tract are increasingly understood to shape health and disease processes throughout the body, yet the role of GI bacteria in urologic chronic pelvic pain is unknown.

"Anesthestic modulation of human memory during acute pain Project Summary (abstract): Despite routine use of sedative-hypnotic and analgesic agents (anesthetics) to prevent or ease suffering during aversive conditions, the effects of these agents on behavior and the neural systems that form memories, respond to threat, and process pain are poorly understood. This project will determine the memory-modulating effects of propofol, dexmedetomidine, and fentanyl in the context of periodic pain stimulation. It is a randomized, placebo- controlled, single-blind, parallel arm fMRI study in healthy adults (under age 40). Subjects will perform a memory encoding task while receiving periodic acute pain stimulation. Explicit and implicit memory will be quantified using response time and physiologic responses, including heart rate and electrodermal activity. Neuroimaging will localize brain activity and connectivity. Psychometric data relevant to pain and anxiety will be used to account for inter-individual differences. The central hypothesis is that, when forming memory during concomitant painful stimulation, three anesthetic agents, with different receptor pharmacology, will have distinct behavioral and physiologic response patterns, which are mediated by different activity within and interactions between the neural systems responsible for memory encoding, threat response, and pain processing. There are three scientific research goals of this patient-oriented career development proposal. The first is to determine how behavioral and physiologic measures of explicit and implicit memory are modulated by pain and the individual effects of the three anesthetics under investigation. The second aim is to determine the brain structures differentially engaged in memory encoding under pain and drug conditions, using task-related functional MRI and functional connectivity analyses. The third aim is to determine brain changes correlated to subject psychometric measures of anxiety, stress, sleep, and pain through multivariate psychophysiological interaction analysis. The scientific framework for this project has a direct application in better understanding the impact of memories formed during sedation with anesthetics while experiencing noxious stimuli. Additionally, further extension of this pharmacologic modulation technique to other cognitive neuroscience paradigms could provide a multidisciplinary framework for basic studies of memory formation, the genesis of dysregulated memories, and the necessary conditions for anesthetic-induced amnesia. In addition to the hands-on research experience of running a trial, achieved through the research aims, this project will advance the applicant into an independent physician scientist in anesthesiology through specific career-development activities. This will be accomplished through a combination of mentoring and evaluation meetings, national scientific/professional meetings, formal didactics, and local seminars/presentations. As part of professional development, coursework in multivariate statistical analysis techniques and cognitive and behavioral neuroscience is planned. The project will be conducted at the University of Pittsburgh, in the School of Medicine, which has outstanding support for clinical and translational research and an established record of developing physician scientists into independent investigators. Project Narrative: Memories formed during painful conditions can lead to later psychologic problems, such as anxiety. This study will clarify how three distinct anesthetics affect the formation of conscious and subconscious memories during experimental painful stimulation, using a variety of measurements. This multidisciplinary project brings together research techniques from the distinct fields of behavioral psychology, neuroimaging, and anesthetic pharmacology to better understand this phenomenon.",Anesthestic modulation of human memory during acute pain,9892230,K23GM132755,"['Acute Pain', 'Adrenergic Antagonists', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Amnesia', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Analgesics', 'Anesthesia procedures', 'Anesthesiology', 'Anesthetics', 'Animals', 'Anxiety', 'Attenuated', 'Aversive Stimulus', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Conscious', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Dexmedetomidine', 'Dose', 'Emotions', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Fentanyl', 'Fright', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'General Anesthesia', 'Goals', 'Heart Rate', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Insula of Reil', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Motivation', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurosciences', 'Pain', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Periodicity', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Placebos', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Process', 'Propofol', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychology', 'Psychometrics', 'Psychophysiology', 'Randomized', 'Reaction Time', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Technics', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Sedation procedure', 'Single-Blind Study', 'Sleep', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Stimulus', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Subconscious', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Translational Research', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Work', 'anxiety spectrum disorders', 'arm', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'career development', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cognitive task', 'complement C2a', 'conditioning', 'design', 'direct application', 'experience', 'hands on research', 'human subject', 'hypnotic', 'imaging study', 'implicit memory', 'indexing', 'medical schools', 'meetings', 'memory encoding', 'multidisciplinary', 'neuroimaging', 'pain perception', 'pain processing', 'patient oriented', 'prevent', 'psychologic', 'receptor', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sedative']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,K23,2019,189972,0.12875232972299017
"Development and Preliminary Testing of Novel Virtual Human-Assisted Psychosocial Interviews for Patients with Chronic Musculoskeletal Pain Project Summary / Abstract Chronic musculoskeletal pain is associated with significant psychosocial difficulties. Unfortunately, patients and medical providers find it difficult to discuss psychosocial factors, and these often remain unaddressed during the medical visit. The goal of the proposed application is to develop next-generation Virtual Human-assisted therapeutic interviews that can be integrated in current pain practice to engage patients in a conversation about psychosocial problems associated with their chronic pain. Virtual Humans (VHs) are computer-animated characters that mimic the appearance and behavior of a real person and that can be used as virtual interviewers. This novel technology also makes it possible to implement different experimental conditions with a great degree of standardization, thereby enhancing internal validity and reproducibility, while maintaining a high level of authenticity. Our team’s existing VH prototype has been successfully used to elicit self-disclosure. We propose to adapt our VH for use in patients with chronic pain in preparation for a subsequent large-scale clinical trial. In Phase 1 of the application, we will develop VH-assisted psychosocial interviews specifically for chronic pain. They will address two theoretically important yet divergent targets of communication: (1) psychosocial consequences resulting from the experience of chronic pain (e.g., depression, relationship disruption); and (2) possible psychosocial contributors that may trigger, exacerbate, or maintain chronic pain (e.g., background stressful events, pain attributions). Development of the VH-assisted psychosocial interviews will be guided by prior research on emotion-focused treatment, our extensive clinical expertise, and qualitative feedback from patient stakeholders. In Phase 2, we will bring our VH into the clinic and conduct preliminary feasibility and efficacy testing. Patients will be randomly assigned to one of four experimental conditions in a 2 x 2 factorial design, in which the VH will address (a) psychosocial consequences of chronic pain, (b) psychosocial contributors to chronic pain, (c) a combination of both, or (d) neither (attention control group). All patients will engage in a single VH interview session before their initial medical consultation. Feasibility will be established through participation rates, potential patient concerns about discussing psychosocial stressors with the VH, clinic flow, and stakeholder satisfaction. Based on existing theoretical frameworks, we expect that the VH sessions will impact patient outcomes through improved patient emotion regulation, working memory, and patient-provider relations; shifts in pain attitudes, and increased motivation for behavioral pain management. The pilot data collected in this application will provide essential preliminary information on the therapeutic mechanisms and patient health benefits of the VH-assisted communication approaches. This proposal is expected to be impactful because it 1) utilizes novel yet promising next-generation VH methodology; 2) tests theories and advances practice about how patients’ psychosocial problems related to pain should be addressed in pain management; and 3) examines the feasibility and clinical utility of integrating VHs into pain care. Project Narrative/Relevance Chronic musculoskeletal pain is associated with significant psychosocial difficulties that often remain unaddressed in routine clinical care. The proposed application will develop next-generation Virtual Human (VH) interviewers to talk with patients about psychosocial problems associated with their chronic pain and pilot test whether it is feasible and clinically helpful to integrate VHs in chronic pain management for patients’ disclosure of stress and negative emotion.",Development and Preliminary Testing of Novel Virtual Human-Assisted Psychosocial Interviews for Patients with Chronic Musculoskeletal Pain,9776205,R21AR074020,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Appearance', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attitude', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Caring', 'Clinic', 'Clinic Visits', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communication', 'Computers', 'Consultations', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disclosure', 'Distal', 'Distress', 'Emotions', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Health Benefit', 'Healthcare', 'Interruption', 'Interview', 'Interviewer', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Motivation', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Pain intensity', 'Pain interference', 'Pain management', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Preparation', 'Procedures', 'Provider', 'Psychosocial Factor', 'Psychosocial Influences', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Sampling', 'Self Disclosure', 'Seminal', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Standardization', 'Stress', 'Stressful Event', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Visit', 'Work', 'attentional control', 'base', 'chronic musculoskeletal pain', 'chronic pain', 'chronic pain patient', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'diaries', 'efficacy testing', 'emotion regulation', 'emotional distress', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'multimodality', 'new technology', 'next generation', 'novel', 'pain reduction', 'physical conditioning', 'prototype', 'psychosocial', 'satisfaction', 'sex', 'stressor', 'theories', 'therapeutic evaluation', 'uptake', 'virtual', 'virtual human']",NIAMS,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R21,2019,174528,0.29251063328946136
"Pain Care Quality and Integrated and Complementary Health Approaches DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Improving the quality of pain management is a high priority for the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). VHA has published policy guidance that establishes an innovative stepped care model of pain management (SCM- PM) as the single standard of pain care. The SCM-PM provides the ability to assess and treat pain in primary care settings, while maintaining the capacity to escalate treatment options to include specialized care, if necessary. The model further emphasizes the importance of an individually tailored, integrated, multi-modal approach to pain management that takes into account mental health comorbidities and that incorporates complementary health approaches (CHA) to promote optimal pain control and improved function and quality of life. Despite great strides in promoting this model, pain management performance improvement efforts have been hampered by the limited availability of reliable Pain Care Quality indicators and metrics for key dimensions of pai management in order to promote their utilization in systematic quality improvement efforts. Other than pharmacological and procedure based interventions in which specific, easily retrievable codes are used to document care in the VHA's electronic health record (EHR), it is difficult to capture the broader array of CHA or key aspects of integrated care. These gaps in the EHR and VHA database pose serious barriers to promoting performance improvement efforts including implementation of the SCM-PM. The proposed project extends prior research by our investigator team by using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) to automate a previously validated approach to identify and quantify key dimensions of Pain Care Quality, namely assessment, especially functional assessment, integrated treatment plans, reassessment (outcomes), and patient education from the EHR. Once this automated solution is validated, we intend to apply it to a national sample to test important questions about Pain Care Quality among veterans with comorbid mental health conditions, access to CHA, and the SCM-PM. This innovative solution to identifying key dimensions of healthcare has potential applicability to improving the management of other complex health problems for which existing quality of care indicators and metrics are limited.

"Measuring Infant Pain Objectively using Sensor Fusion and Machine Learning Algorithms Newborns are routinely and frequently exposed to pain during Neonatal ICU (NICU) care. Pain assessments in neonates are difficult, labor intensive, subjective and unreliable – often resulting in excessive or inadequate analgesia. Our overall objective is to measure infant pain objectively, reliably, and in real-time. We will extract pain-related information from multiple non-invasive sensors, develop a sensor fusion framework to integrate multi-modal sensor data into a single pain score, and assess the validity of this approach by comparing with validated clinical pain scores. Specific aims: 1) To differentiate acute pain from baseline or non-painful events, we will study 60 newborns using: facial electromyography (EMG) to record facial expressions specific for infant pain, electrocardiography (ECG) to measure heart rate changes and heart rate variability, skin conductance to measure catecholamine-dependent palmar sweating, electroencephalography (EEG) using 32 “active” electrodes to assess pain-related brain activity, and pulse oximetry (SpO2) to record pain-induced changes in oxygenation and peripheral perfusion. We will study acute painful procedures associated with mild, moderate, or severe pain in 30 late preterm (34-36 weeks) and 30 term newborns (37-42 weeks). Bedside nurses will use validated pain scoring methods to concurrently assess these infants for pain. A pain expert will independently assess 50% of subjects, to establish inter-rater reliability and to authenticate the bedside nurses’ pain scores. From each sensor, we will extract pain-related data that correlate strongly with the clinically relevant pain scores. 2) To develop sensor fusion frameworks integrating data from multiple sensors. Proprietary machine learning algorithms will fuse pain-related data from all 5 sensors, “calibrate” itself for each newborn by using data from prior pain events, and compensate for missing or unreliable data. Sensor fusion frameworks including combinations of these sensors will help to identify infant pain with far greater specificity and sensitivity than the subjective pain scales used clinically. Procedures will be included to assess the scaling properties of this objective approach and to refine the principal algorithms. Data analyses will assess inter-rater reliability and internal consistency, verify content, concurrent and construct validity, and include multivariable modeling for optimal selection and weighting of the sensor variables that will compute the final objective pain score. This approach will eventually lead to a bedside ICU monitor (compatible with the ECG, SpO2, EEG, EMG, and skin conductivity sensors), which displays the current pain intensity and trends within the time periods of clinical interest. An objective, automated pain detection device developed for newborns (and adapted for other nonverbal patients) will reduce the subjectivity and variability of pain assessments, improve the safety and efficacy of various analgesics used for treating neonatal pain, avoid the acute side effects and long-term effects of both unrelieved pain or excessive analgesia in newborns, prevent iatrogenic tolerance and neonatal abstinence syndrome, reduce the workload of bedside NICU nurses and improve clinical outcomes. ! Newborns receiving intensive care in the Neonatal ICU (NICU) are repeatedly exposed to acute painful procedures during routine medical care, but it is difficult to determine if they are experiencing pain or not, or their response to pain-relieving therapies. In this pilot study, we will use a novel machine learning framework to develop an automated bedside monitor that is designed to measure pain intensity in newborn infants – objectively, reliably, and in real-time – capable of displaying the current pain score as well as trends within time periods of interest to bedside clinicians or parents. Reliably measuring pain in newborns will enhance the safety and efficacy of pain-relieving drugs (like morphine) for treating pain in newborns, thus avoiding the immediate side effects as well as the long-term detrimental effects from unrelieved pain, versus excessive or highly variable drug therapy in the newborn period.",Measuring Infant Pain Objectively using Sensor Fusion and Machine Learning Algorithms,9608465,R41DA046983,"['Absence of pain sensation', 'Abstinence', 'Acute', 'Acute Pain', 'Address', 'Adverse effects', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Analgesics', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Caring', 'Catecholamines', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electromyography', 'Engineering', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Future', 'Galvanic Skin Response', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Rate', 'Hospitals', 'Iatrogenesis', 'Infant', 'Intensive Care', 'Lead', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphine', 'Neonatal', 'Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome', 'Neonatal Intensive Care Units', 'Newborn Infant', 'Nurses', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Pain Measurement', 'Pain intensity', 'Pain management', 'Painless', 'Parents', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Peripheral', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Pilot Projects', 'Practice Management', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Pulse Oximetry', 'Safety', 'Scoring Method', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Source', 'Sweat', 'Sweating', 'System', 'Term Birth', 'Time', 'Weight', 'Withdrawal', 'Workload', 'addiction', 'age group', 'base', 'behavioral response', 'clinical care', 'clinical pain', 'clinically relevant', 'design', 'experience', 'heart rate variability', 'improved', 'interest', 'multimodality', 'neonate', 'novel', 'opiate tolerance', 'overtreatment', 'pain reduction', 'pain relief', 'pain score', 'patient safety', 'portability', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'rate of change', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'sensor', 'trend']",NIDA,"AUTONOMOUS HEALTHCARE, INC.",R41,2018,224908,0.3360040937948319
"CPS: Cyber-physically assistive clothing to reduce societal incident of low bac1ak  The objective of this proposal is to address core scientific challenges related to sensing, actuation and control of cyber-physically assistive clothing (CPAC). CPAC is a kind of Human-in-the-loop Cyber-Physical System (HCPS), in which actuated clothing is coordinated in unison with human body movement to enhance safety and health. We propose addressing key HCPS challenges within the context of using CPAC to reduce societal incidence of low back pain, by preventing lumbar (spine) overloading and overuse injuries. Low back pain is targeted because it is one of the leading causes of physical disability and missed work. High and/or repetitive forces on lumbar muscles and discs can occur during daily tasks, and are known to be major risk factors that can lead to back pain and injury. The long-term vision is to create smart clothing that can monitor lumbar loading, train safe movement patterns, and directly assist wearers to reduce the musculoskeletal forces that cause pain and injury. This proposed transformation of clothing is similar to how wristwatches have transformed from timepieces into health monitors; however, CPAC is even more exciting because it combines the form-factor of clothing with the assistance benefits of an exoskeleton to reduce biological tissue loading for a broad range of individuals, occupations and tasks. Thrust 1 will adapt machine learning techniques in order to monitor lumbar loading and detect excessive spine forces via portable, wearable sensors, such that timely feedback/intervention can be provided. This thrust will result in the creation of a publicly shared data set that contains synchronized, multimodal (lab-based and wearable) sensor data collected from >500 actions per subject, the largest such corpus for machine learning in this domain. Thrust 2 will model the dynamics of cyber, physical and human components of CPAC in order to develop optimal control and learning strategies. Thrust 3 will integrate sensors, fusion algorithms and portable actuation into a complete wearable prototype. A human subject experiment will be performed to objectively evaluate the function of CPAC. At the focus of this proposal is the human body; monitored, analyzed and assisted by multidisciplinary CPS technologies. The project integrates expertise in biomechanics, machine learning, sensor fusion, soft robotics, wearable assistive technology, and clinical management of low back pain to transform clothing from materials that cover the body into wearable systems that can track and protect low back health. The key scientific HCPS challenges that need to be overcome, and which are addressed in this proposed research, in order to realize the broad societal benefits of CPAC are: (1) real-time sensing and assistive control of the HCPS and its co-adaptation to different subjects and diverse environments, (2) system design and verification ensuring safe operation and that no harm is done to human subjects through unanticipated feedback, (3) selection and placement of low cost sensors aiding affordable and realistic manufacturing of CPAC, (4) integration of wearable sensors and actuators into a reliable and effective HCPS. CPAC has the potential for broad societal impact given the high prevalence of low back pain. CPAC provides a unique and potentially paradigm-shifting opportunity because it combines the assistive benefits of an exoskeleton with the lightweight and unobtrusive form-factor of everyday clothing. CPAC is expected to (1) fit seamlessly into daily life, (2) connect individuals with health info to empower them to modify their physical activity, (3) generate public health data to inform evidence-based clinical and workplace practices, (4) augment lifting biomechanics to reduce lumbar loading, (5) reduce incidence of low back pain, and costs due to health care and missed work.",CPS: Cyber-physically assistive clothing to reduce societal incident of low bac1ak ,9755822,R01EB028105,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Back', 'Back Injuries', 'Back Pain', 'Biological', 'Biomechanics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clothing', 'Cumulative Trauma Disorders', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Feedback', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'High Prevalence', 'Human', 'Human body', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Lifting', 'Low Back Pain', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Musculoskeletal', 'Occupations', 'Pain', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Physically Handicapped', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Robotics', 'Safety', 'Self-Help Devices', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Vertebral column', 'Vision', 'Work', 'Workplace', 'base', 'cost', 'cyber physical', 'data sharing', 'design', 'evidence base', 'exoskeleton', 'experimental study', 'health data', 'human subject', 'human-in-the-loop', 'learning strategy', 'light weight', 'multidisciplinary', 'multimodality', 'operation', 'portability', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'sensor', 'wearable device']",NIBIB,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,310023,0.1100539466953493
"Development of a Medical Device Utilizing an EEG-Based Algorithm for the Objective Quantification of Pain Project Summary / Abstract Chronic pain affects over 100 million Americans representing a major public health imperative. Objective biomarkers of pathology exist for several diseases, and their development is one of the great advances of modern allopathic medicine; however, objective assessment of pain has lagged far behind. Currently, there are no objectively verifiable and clinically useful means to identify or quantify the presence or severity of pain. The current standard of care relies on patient self-report, such as the visual analog scale (VAS), which presents a serious barrier to the effective assessment and treatment of pain. Self-reported pain is influenced by nociceptive, affective, and cognitive processes, and though many treatments effect reported pain, they likely do so through a varied set of neurophysiological mechanisms, with different consequences for health and long-term well-being. Some patients have difficulty assigning themselves a pain rating, especially those with pain that falls towards the middle of the rating scale. In addition, communications issues, drug-seeking behavior, the desire of some patients to appear stoic, and other issues can create problems with establishing an accurate pain rating. As a result, despite a long history of research, current assessment and treatment of pain is not optimal, with enormous costs to patients and society. PainQx is currently developing the PQX-MED system, a system that will objectively evaluate an individual’s pain level using quantitative EEG (QEEG). Advanced signal processing, machine learning, classification methodologies and a large reference database will be used to develop algorithms that quantify features of an individual’s EEG that are associated with the perception of pain. Before the PainQx platform is ready for its FDA Validation Study, PainQx needs to demonstrate the ability to assess pain in a representative set of patients with chronic pain. To ensure commercial viability, PainQx also needs to be able to generate its pain biomarker using a limited montage of EEG electrodes which can be rapidly applied prior to data acquisition and processing. PainQx proposes to achieve these objectives through the proposed SBIR project. In Phase I, PainQx will conduct a clinical study of 50 chronic pain patients utilizing 19 lead EEG acquisition, add those cases to an existing database of 19 lead pain cases, and demonstrate that 19 Lead EEG data can be used to assess the intensity of pain a patient is experiencing. In Phase II, PainQx will demonstrate that the relationship between the VAS and a QEEG based biomarker demonstrated using 19 leads can be demonstrated using a subset of EEG recording locations to significantly improve clinical utility. Further, predictive accuracy using the reduced montage will meet targets for performance established using 19 lead data. Project Narrative The nature of self-reported pain rating scales leads to difficulty in accurately identifying, evaluating and therefore, optimally treating pain due to issues such as patient communication difficulties, drug-seeking behavior, differences in pain tolerance, and other challenges. As a result, patients can be either over-treated, leading to (or perpetuating) addiction as manifested by the opioid epidemic, or under-treated, leading to readmissions, lost productivity, unnecessary pain and suffering, and significant costs to the healthcare system. By providing physicians an objective pain measurement tool, PainQx believes it will allow physicians to increase certainty in dosing and treatment selection, thereby addressing the over and under treatment paradigm, and consequently reducing opioid abuse and overall healthcare costs.",Development of a Medical Device Utilizing an EEG-Based Algorithm for the Objective Quantification of Pain,9607496,R44DA046964,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communication', 'Comorbidity', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Medical Device', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Modernization', 'Nature', 'Nociception', 'Output', 'Pain', 'Pain Measurement', 'Pain Threshold', 'Pain intensity', 'Pain management', 'Pathology', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Productivity', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regulatory Pathway', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Severities', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Societies', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'Visual Analogue Pain Scale', 'addiction', 'analog', 'base', 'brain electrical activity', 'chronic pain', 'chronic pain patient', 'cognitive process', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'drug seeking behavior', 'expectation', 'experience', 'falls', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'meetings', 'neurophysiology', 'opioid abuse', 'opioid epidemic', 'pain perception', 'pain score', 'product development', 'signal processing', 'standard of care', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'validation studies']",NIDA,"PAINQX, INC.",R44,2018,219430,0.3307619398651443
"Multimodal Assessment of Occurrence and Intensity of Pain for Research and Clinical Use Project Summary/Abstract Pain typically is measured by patient self-report or clinician impressions, either through clinical interview or the visual analog scale. While useful, self-report measures have several limitations that include idiosyncratic use, inconsistent metric properties across scale dimensions, efforts at impression management or deception, and differences between clinicians' and sufferers' conceptualizations of pain. Given individual differences among patients, their families, and healthcare providers, pain is often poorly assessed, underestimated, and inadequately treated [Hadjistavropoulos et al., 2002]. An objective, reliable, and efficient assay of the occurrence and intensity of pain would advance pain monitoring and intervention, leading to a uniform yet individual management of pain and an efficient utilization of the health care system. Machine analysis for the automatic assessment of pain occurrence and intensity could be of considerable value to achieve these goals. To advance pain assessment, monitoring, and intervention, we propose an automatic facial, head, and body movement analysis for the automatic assessment of the occurrence and intensity of pain. Recent efforts demonstrated the validity of automatic detection of shoulder pain from facial expression in a constrained laboratory context using person-dependent, semi-automatic procedures. The current project extends previous efforts to multimodal measurement of the occurrence and intensity of pain in well-characterized and clinically relevant participants with rotator cuff syndrome (RCS) using person-independent, fully-automatic procedures. To collect pain-related behavioral responses to a full range of pain intensities, we will abduct their shoulders pre- and post- a triangular forearm support (TFS) maneuver (a pain relief procedure, [Fishman et al., 2011]). Participants' face, head, and upper body movement will be recorded using synchronized high-definition digital video and Microsoft Kinect cameras during the abduction and flexion of their shoulders before and after TFS. To investigate possible placebo effect of TFS, comparison behavioral responses to a sham procedure of randomly selected RCS participants will be collected before the TFS procedure. To investigate the specificity of pain response to arm abduction, we will include a non-clinical group of participants without RCS or need for pain relief. To investigate the repeatability of the proposed automatic measures, we will obtain multiple movement trials from each participant during both pre- and post treatment. Face, head, and body movement will be automatically tracked using our newly fully- automatic method for face tracking and the automatic Kinect's body skeleton tracking. We will identify optimal features and classifiers for automatic measurement of occurrence and intensity of pain. To investigate validity, we will compare automated measurement with patient-rated visual analog scale and obtained continuous observer ratings of pain intensity from the video recordings. MANOVA will quantify the relationship between the individual modalities and their combination for pain measurement. HLM will investigate possible influence of participant characteristics (e.g. gender). Project Narrative Pain typically is measured by patient self-report, but self-reported pain is difficult to interpret and may be impaired or in some circumstances not possible to obtain. We propose to use a clinically well-characterized data to develop an automatic multimodal method for the detection of occurrence and intensity of pain.",Multimodal Assessment of Occurrence and Intensity of Pain for Research and Clinical Use,9406888,R21NR016510,"['Affect', 'Aftercare', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Appearance', 'Archives', 'Beds', 'Biological Assay', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Conscious', 'Consent', 'Data', 'Deception', 'Detection', 'Dimensions', 'Distress', 'Environment', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Family', 'Forearm', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Head Movements', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'Neurologic', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Orthopedics', 'Pain', 'Pain Measurement', 'Pain Research', 'Pain intensity', 'Pain management', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Placebo Effect', 'Postoperative Care', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rotator Cuff', 'Shapes', 'Shoulder', 'Shoulder Pain', 'Skeleton', 'Specificity', 'Suggestion', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Video Recording', 'Visual', 'analog', 'arm', 'base', 'behavioral response', 'clinically relevant', 'digital', 'experience', 'health care service utilization', 'impression', 'learning strategy', 'movement analysis', 'multimodality', 'pain relief', 'pediatric patients', 'response', 'sensor']",NINR,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R21,2018,192890,0.2775215357126527
"Finding Good TEMporal PostOperative pain Signatures (TEMPOS) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over 100 million patients undergo surgery each year in the US, and more than 60% of these patients will suffer from severe acute postoperative pain. Recent data suggest that the time course of pain resolution following surgery is highly variable with over one-third of patients experiencing stable or increasing, rather than decreasing, pain on each day after surgery for at least the first 7 postoperative days. While prior work has focused on linear trajectories of average daily postoperative pain, temporal profiles of pain that measure hourly variations in pain intensity provide a more accurate depiction of the postoperative pain experience than simple linear functions derived from daily pain assessments. The purpose of the proposed research is to elucidate the nature, mechanistic underpinnings, and clinical implications of TEMporal PostOperative pain Signatures (TEMPOS) by applying advanced algorithms to characterize postoperative pain profiles in a prospective cohort. The research will address three Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1: To characterize TEMPOS within the surgical population via state of the art time-series analysis techniques; Specific Aim 2: To identify clinical, biological, psychological, and social (CBPS) mechanisms that contribute to TEMPOS; Specific Aim 3: To determine which TEMPOS optimally predict the development of persistent postsurgical pain. To address these aims, we propose a single-center, prospective observational cohort study of 500 surgical patients. Prior to surgery, sociodemographic variables will be obtained via the electronic medical record (EMR), and patients will complete multiple online inventories for depression, anxiety and catastrophizing. A blood sample will be obtained for genetic studies exploring a variety of pain-related genes, and perioperative surgery and anesthetic details will be extracted from the EMR. Pain outcomes will be assessed at three resolutions: every 6 minutes via a patient-controlled analgesia device interrogation; every four hours via clinical assessments; and every day using the McGill Pain Questionnaire and Brief Pain Inventory. Clinical data on analgesic consumption and patient activity will be used for contextual assessment of pain intensity. Patients will be followed for up to 7 days after surgery, and will again be queried at 6 months after surgery to determine the presence and extent of persistent postsurgical pain. Analyses will first compare existing models, which classify patients as positive, neutral, or negative in pain trajectory slope, with higher-order models offering greater resolution in predicting postoperative pain at discrete time points. We will then perform clustering analyses with respect to the temporal patterns of postoperative pain in order to better define TEMPOS phenotypes. These analyses will be repeated with the clinical, biological, psychological, and social factors listed above to determine how these characteristics drive the mechanisms underlying the observed TEMPOS. Finally, we will use advanced machine learning models to forecast both acute and persistent postoperative pain outcomes with respect to the derived TEMPOS definitions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project examines how postoperative pain scores change with respect to time, and the impact of these temporal patterns on the risk for persistent postsurgical pain. These experiments will first demonstrate that there are many different, complex patterns of pain score changes over time after surgery, rather than the currently-established linear pain trajectories offered in the literature. Next, these experiments will determine how clinical, biological, psychological, and social factors predispose patients to different patterns of pain- analgesia-pain cycles, and finally determine how these timing patterns may influence the development of persistent postsurgical pain.",Finding Good TEMporal PostOperative pain Signatures (TEMPOS),9502315,R01GM114290,"['Abdomen', 'Absence of pain sensation', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Analgesics', 'Anesthetics', 'Anxiety', 'Biological', 'Blood specimen', 'Brief Pain Inventory', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Demographic Factors', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dimensions', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Educational Background', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Female', 'Genes', 'Genetic study', 'Hour', 'Lead', 'Linear Models', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Markov Chains', 'McGill Pain Scale', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Nerve Block', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Opioid', 'Orthopedics', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Pain Measurement', 'Pain intensity', 'Pain management', 'Patient-Controlled Analgesia', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perioperative', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Postoperative Pain', 'Postoperative Period', 'Predisposing Factor', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Prospective cohort', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'Translating', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'daily pain', 'discrete time', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'genetic variant', 'improved', 'indexing', 'learning strategy', 'low socioeconomic status', 'novel', 'opioid use', 'pain catastrophizing', 'pain outcome', 'pain relief', 'pain score', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'public health relevance', 'sex', 'signal processing', 'social', 'temporal measurement', 'trend']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,R01,2018,499218,0.3262437769089531
"Single Session Pain Catastrophizing Treatment: Comparative Efficacy & Mechanisms ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic low back pain (CLBP) is the most common chronic pain condition and is the second leading cause of disability in the U.S. Pain catastrophizing (PC)--a pattern of negative cognitive-emotional responses to actual or anticipated pain-is significantly associated with the development and maintenance of CLBP as well as disability. PC undermines CLBP treatments, thus contributing to a cycle of treatment futility and wasted expenditure. While Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (pain-CBT) treats PC, group treatment involves 6-10 sessions and thus poses substantial burdens of time, travel, and cost. Therefore, there is a critical need to develop and disseminate efficient, low-cost treatments that specifically reduce PC. Accordingly, we developed a single-session, 2-hour pain-CBT class that solely treats PC (""From Catastrophizing to Recovery""; FCR). Our pilot data revealed large effect sizes for FCR in a chronic pain sample and superior outcomes for medical and psychological across PROMIS domains, as compared to a 'treatment as usual' matched clinic cohort. We propose to conduct a 3-arm comparative efficacy RCT in 231 patients with CLBP comparing: (A) FCR, (B) a health education control, and (C) an 8-session pain-CBT class. Our primary endpoint is PC 3 months post- treatment and our secondary endpoint is PC 6 months post-treatment. We hypothesize that FCR will be superior to active control and non-inferior to the 8-session pain-CBT class for improving PC and pain-related outcomes measured by our PROMIS platform. An innovative aspect of the application is our proposal to develop and validate a brief version Daily PCS measure, and apply the measure with high frequency sampling methods to elucidate the mechanics of PC, and to characterize how positive response to active intervention reduces the influence of PC episodes. Additional novel methods our specialized PROMIS platform; actigraphy for objective sleep and activity measurement; and a customized 'FCR Relaxation Resource' app (on Nexus 7 tablets) to objectively quantify skills use in the FCR group. Our rich dataset will allow for detailed phenotyping of responders / non-responders for both active treatments using machine learning and other advanced analytics. We will use daily ratings across a longitudinal timeframe to characterize how PC changes in response to treatment, as well as the mechanistic influence of PC on pain, sleep, activity, and other variables. Our proposal addresses the NCCAM priorities to (1) ""alleviate chronic pain"", (2) study our mind-body intervention in a ""real-world setting,"" and (3) advance scientific understanding of the mechanisms of PC. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Pain catastrophizing (PC)--a negative cognitive and emotional psychological pattern-is so powerful that it undermines medical treatment and contributes to pain chronicity. This project investigates a promising single- session, low-cost intervention that specifically treats PC.

"Engaging Veterans Seeking Service-Connection Payments in Pain Treatment Abstract In 2015 alone, 97,223 new Veterans under age 35 began receiving compensation for injuries related to their military service. In total, there are 559,999 post-9/11 Veterans being compensated for back or neck conditions, and a partially overlapping 596,250 for limitation of flexion in joints. Veterans seeking compensation for musculoskeletal conditions often develop chronic pain and are at high risk for substance misuse. Early intervention is needed to arrest worsening pain and risky substance use, particularly among post-9/11 Veterans for whom engagement in non-pharmacological pain treatment has the potential to improve their overall quality of life and spare them the complications of opioid treatments. The service-connection application is an ideal point-of-contact for initiating early intervention treatments for these at-risk Veterans. We propose to test the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of Screening, Brief Intervention and Referral to Treatment for Pain Management (SBIRT-PM), designed to reduce pain and risky substance use. In brief, the counselor explains that treating both physical and psychological aspects of pain leads to the best outcomes, outlines what VA (and non-VA if preferred) services are available to Veterans, explains that substances are sometimes used for pain relief, and segues into traditional SBIRT. SBIRT-PM's efficacy is supported by a completed clinical trial of 101 Veterans applying for service-connection for MSD, and by studies showing the efficacy of SBIRT for people with risky substance use and of Motivational Interviewing for engagement in non-pharmacological pain care. The study will involve a two-year period to arrange for clinicians at a single “hub” site to counsel Veterans throughout New England by phone with SBIRT-PM, and a four-year period to conduct the clinical trial and disseminate its findings. During the two-years of preparation for the clinical trial, the team will prepare SBIRT-PM for implementation by establishing communication (Relational Coordination is the theoretical framework) between the “hub” where the SBIRT-PM clinician is sited and the “spoke” sites, establishing study- related procedures, and piloting the intervention at each of the eight VA medical centers in New England. For the full clinical trial, we will randomize 1200 Veterans applying for compensation related to MSD to either SBIRT-PM or Usual Care (UC) across eight VA medical centers in New England. Outcome assessment by phone will occur at 12 and 36-week follow-ups, and will be corroborated with other sources of information ---the electronic health record and toxicology testing of nail clippings. We hypothesize that, compared to Usual Care, SBIRT-PM will be more effective and cost-effective in improving Veterans' pain and substance use. We further hypothesize that a mediator of these improvements will be use of non-pharmacological services, as extracted from VA records from structured data fields and from narrative text in the medical record using an innovative natural language processing algorithm. Screening and referral to treatment at service-connection examinations can transform a widely-used point of entry to VA into a health-promoting encounter. Narrative Veterans seeking compensation for musculoskeletal conditions often develop chronic pain and are at high risk for substance misuse. We propose to test the effectiveness and cost- effectiveness of Screening, Brief Intervention and Referral to Treatment for Pain Management (SBIRT-PM), designed to reduce pain and reduce risky substance use, in part by helping Veterans get comprehensive pain treatment. The study will involve a 2-year period to arrange for clinicians at a single site to counsel Veterans throughout New England by phone with SBIRT-PM as part of a clinical trial, and a 4-year period to conduct the trial and disseminate its findings.",Engaging Veterans Seeking Service-Connection Payments in Pain Treatment,9567925,UG3AT009758,"['Age', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Algorithms', 'Award', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Brief Pain Inventory', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communication', 'Conduct Clinical Trials', 'Cost Analysis', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Distress', 'Early Intervention', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Financial compensation', 'Health Promotion', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Human Resources', 'Individual', 'Injury compensation', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Joints', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medical Records', 'Medical center', 'Military Personnel', 'Modality', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'Musculoskeletal', 'Musculoskeletal Diseases', 'Nail plate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neck', 'New England', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Assessment', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pain', 'Pain interference', 'Pain management', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Phase', 'Populations at Risk', 'Preparation', 'Procedures', 'Professional counselor', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized', 'Records', 'Risk', 'Secure', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Site Visit', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Toxicology', 'Veterans', 'base', 'chronic pain', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cost effectiveness', 'design', 'experience', 'functional improvement', 'high risk', 'implementation strategy', 'improved', 'informant', 'innovation', 'motivational enhancement therapy', 'pain outcome', 'pain reduction', 'pain relief', 'pain symptom', 'payment', 'pragmatic trial', 'primary outcome', 'psychologic', 'recruit', 'screening', 'screening, brief intervention, referral, and treatment', 'secondary outcome', 'service utilization', 'substance abuse treatment', 'substance misuse', 'symptomatic improvement', 'treatment as usual', 'willingness to pay']",NCCIH,YALE UNIVERSITY,UG3,2018,250000,0.2341834452638389
"Identifying opioid response phenotypes in low back pain electronic health data Pain is the leading reason for adult outpatient and emergency department medical visits, impacting over 100 million Americans at a cost of over $600 billion dollars annually. Low back pain (LBP) represents 28% of this health-care problem and is the leading cause of disability, both in the United States and worldwide. Opioids are the most commonly prescribed drug class in the United States, and the majority of these prescriptions are for LBP. Despite the broad application of opioid therapy in LBP, the phenotypes of individuals who experience pain relief from opioid treatment have not been identified, leaving providers without clear guidance for safe and effective therapy. Given this staggering burden of disease and health-care utilization, clinical information regarding LBP widely populates the electronic health record (EHR), providing a valuable data source. However, this information presently has little meaning beyond the individual patient experience because the majority of pain-related data from the EHR is embedded in free text. Using EHR data may provide the crucial bridge to a better understanding of LBP. Thus, the central hypothesis of this proposal is that translating clinical experiences into discrete and analyzable data, specifically modeling opioid response phenotypes for patients with LBP, will identify clinically relevant phenotypic treatment responses. To test this hypothesis, this mentored career development project will adapt and apply natural language processing (NLP), data standardization, mining, and analysis tools to specifically model opioid response phenotypes for patients with LBP to characterize pain intensity, functional status, and pain interference with activity. Through integrated aims, this proposal will, 1) support the annotation of LBP and opioid note corpus, and the mapping of clinical concepts related to pain intensity, functional status, and pain interference with activities; 2) use NLP to identify and relate relevant opioid response phenotypes in patients with LBP in the EHR; and 3) characterize LBP phenotypes associated with opioid dose escalation. Clinical NLP uses statistical modeling to extract and transform high dimensional clinical data, which, when developed with the PI’s domain knowledge, creates a unique opportunity to understand LBP management, outcomes, and therapeutic efficacy. Ultimately this foundation may be used to predict clinical outcomes and responses to therapeutic interventions. Our long-term goal is to move beyond identifying disease phenotype profiles to create a system to identify treatment response phenotypes. Stratifying patients based on pain intensity, functional status, pain interference and other factors, we plan to identify potential cohorts that warrant further study from a genetic focus. This mentored career development grant (K08) will support a clinical expert’s adaptation of tools and training in a systematic method to allow growth toward a programmatic line of research that is incredibly responsive to the NIH pain research agenda and can transition to independent R01-level funding. Low back pain is the leading cause of disability worldwide. Yet, despite this significant health burden, we lack predictive models for clinical care. Unfortunately, clinicians lack clear guidance for treatment, specifically regarding the use of opioids. This proposal would accelerate pain medicine research by translating clinical experiences into discrete and analyzable data, specifically examining opioid response patterns for patients with low back pain in the electronic health record. Ultimately, this would provide a foundation for advancing clinical care as well as future approaches to genomic and personalized medicine.",Identifying opioid response phenotypes in low back pain electronic health data,9459882,K08EB022631,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Adult', 'Advisory Committees', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Biomedical Research', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Documentation', 'Dose', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Low Back Pain', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Ontology', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Output', 'Pain', 'Pain Research', 'Pain intensity', 'Pain interference', 'Pain management', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Prevention', 'Provider', 'Records', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Scientist', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Vocabulary', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'career development', 'clinical care', 'clinical pain', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'disability', 'disease phenotype', 'effective therapy', 'electronic data', 'experience', 'functional status', 'health care service utilization', 'health data', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'novel', 'opioid therapy', 'opioid use', 'outcome prediction', 'pain patient', 'pain relief', 'patient stratification', 'personalized medicine', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive modeling', 'response', 'search engine', 'symposium', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NIBIB,WAKE FOREST UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,K08,2018,184373,0.22021370209189373
"Evaluation of Physicochemical Properties Imparted by Fluorinated Peptidomimetics ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The ability to control pain remains a major problem in medicine and society. According to the Institute of Medicine, chronic pain affects about 100 million American adults, more people than those affected by diabetes, heart disease, and cancer combined. It has been estimated that the costs associated with pain in the USA exceeds $600 billion dollars per year, mainly due to medical treatment and lost productivity. While these expenditures are significant, the costs in terms of suffering and quality of life cannot be adequately calculated. Opioid analgesics, such as morphine and its analogs, have been the mainstay for treatment of pain for thousands of years, and currently represent the ""gold-standard"" for pain management. However, clinicians are conservative in prescribing, and patients are conservative in taking, opioids due to valid concerns about adverse effects as well as social and legal issues. As a result, pain is often undertreated, and patients continue to suffer. Endogenous peptides regulate activity within the central nervous system (CNS), and are particularly interesting for the treatment of pain, depression and anxiety. Unfortunately, the clinical usage of peptide-based agents is limited by poor physicochemical (PC) and pharmacokinetic (PK) properties, which restrict penetration into the CNS. Therefore, these peptide-based agents cannot be employed clinically for the treatment of pain. The present proposal aims to develop and employ a new fluorination strategy to rationally improve biophysical properties of peptide-based probes with insufficient drug-like properties, and to allow for these probes to enter the CNS. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Many clinically employed analgesics possess undesired side effects, including convulsions, euphoria, sedation, respiratory depression, constipation, tolerance and dependence. Therefore, clinicians are conservative in prescribing, and patients are conservative in taking, opioids due to valid concerns about adverse effects as well as social and legal issues. As a result, pain is often undertreated, and patients continue to suffer. The present proposal seeks to explore strategies for delivering other small-molecule analgesics with limited side effect profiles into the central nervous system for the treatment of pain.",Evaluation of Physicochemical Properties Imparted by Fluorinated Peptidomimetics,9472308,R33DA036730,"['Adult', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'American', 'Amides', 'Analgesics', 'Anxiety', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Chemical Structure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Computer Simulation', 'Constipation', 'Convulsions', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Employment', 'Enkephalins', 'Euphoria', 'Evaluation', 'Expenditure', 'Fluorine', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Heart Diseases', 'Ice', 'In Vitro', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Legal', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mental Depression', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphine', 'Neuraxis', 'Neuropeptides', 'Opioid', 'Opioid Analgesics', 'Opioid Peptide', 'Opioid agonist', 'Pain', 'Pain management', 'Patients', 'Penetration', 'Peptides', 'Permeability', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Preparation', 'Productivity', 'Property', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Sedation procedure', 'Societies', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Techniques', 'Ventilatory Depression', 'analog', 'base', 'biophysical properties', 'chronic pain', 'cost', 'experimental study', 'functional group', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'peptidomimetics', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'social', 'tool', 'virtual']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS LAWRENCE,R33,2018,358150,0.25809339802356174
"SCH: INT: Collaborative Research: Development and analysis of new mathematical and statistical models for chronic pain Program Director/Principal Investigator (Last, First, Middle): Abrams, Daniel, M Project Description  1. Intellectual merit (see Sec. 2, pages 13-14, for ""Broader impacts"") 1.1 Introduction and background 1.1.1 General introduction During recent decades there has been an extraordinary growth in the availability of data relating to a wide range of microbiological systems. That data has enabled new quantitative approaches to biology, including the development of new mathematical and statistical models that given fun- damental insight into the workings of biological systems.  Another source is now growing explosively: biomedical data. This data has significant potential for use in treatment of human disease, but thus far comparatively fewer mathematical models for medical phenomena have been developed. The hope is that quantitative models will allow for ""personalized"" or ""precision"" medicine, where treatment protocols are customized based on an understanding of how individual patient characteristics impact the effectiveness of the treatment. Deep mathematical understanding of biomedical systems also promises to allow for optimization of medical interventions: the physical and/or financial costs of intervention could be minimized for a given desired level of benefit.  The broad goal of the proposed research is to develop new integrative mathematical models for the dynamics of subjective pain in patients suffering from chronic pain. These models will combine existing qualitative knowledge with insight gained from newly available patient data, with the goal of incorporating data streams corning on line in the near future. We plan to develop multiple models in parallel using a variety of approaches and then to select the best rnodel(s) based on agreement with objective data. 1.1.2 Background on biological application: Sickle cell disease Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a chronic illness associated with frequent medical complications and hospitalizations. Approximately 90% of acute care visits are for pain events, and 30-day reuti- lization rates are alarmingly high [27]. While factors influenci.ng these high re-utilization rates are poorly understood, close follow-up and continued use of pain medication has been shown to de- crease re-hospitalization rates. Mobile technology has become an integral part of health care management and Pl Shah's recently developed mobile application (SMART app - see Figure 1) for SCD assists with documentation of pain and interventions. 1.1.3 Background on hybrid approach Perhaps because of the often distinct educational backgrounds of practitioners or distinct typical applications, statistical and mechanistic approaches are not frequently combined in addressing a single problem. The majority of attempts in the scientific literature have appeared in the context of neural networks [37, 38, 29] and chemical engineering [38, 33, 11], where they largely play a computational rather than analytical role. Some attempts have also been made with medical applications: Rosenberg et al. [30] and Adams et al. [4] developed a model by combining a dy- namical systems approach with a statistical model to predict a patient's CD4 cell counts and HIV viral load over time in an HIV study. Timms et al.

"Neuroimaging-Based Brain and Spinal Cord Biomarkers for Cervical Radiculopathy Chronic pain is a widespread problem that affects a third of Americans and greatly burdens the health care system. Despite its prevalence, chronic pain remains poorly understood, and the current clinical strategies are minimally effective. The application of advanced neuroimaging techniques to the study of chronic pain has significantly increased our understanding of the brain’s role in the development and maintenance of chronic pain, and through these studies, researchers have uncovered previously unknown neural processes involved in pain chronification. The spinal cord is the caudal extension of the brainstem and is actively involved in the modulation and transmission of neural signals between the body and the brain. Alterations in the neural processing in the spinal cord are also thought to have an integral role in pain chronification. Recent advancements in spinal cord neuroimaging have made the quantitative study of the spinal cord’s role in chronic pain possible. Expanding the neuroimaging-based investigation of chronic pain to the spinal cord will provide a complete perspective of the central processes underlying pain chronification. In this mentored career development award (K23), Dr. Weber will identify, characterize, and longitudinally track neuroimaging-based biomarkers for chronic pain in the brain and spinal cord using cervical radiculopathy as a model condition for chronic pain. Cervical radiculopathy is a common cause of neck and upper limb pain and provides a unique opportunity to scientifically study chronic pain in a homogenous patient sample. In Aims 1 and 2, Dr. Weber will identify differences in the brain and spinal cord networks between patients with chronic pain due to right-sided cervical radiculopathy and age- and sex-matched healthy controls. In Aim 3, clinical measures in the same cohort of cervical radiculopathy patients will be longitudinally tracked at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after the imaging session, and neuroimaging-based prognostic factors contributing to pain reduction in cervical radiculopathy will be identified. In the same cohort of patients, the imaging will be repeated at 12 months, and the links between the changes in the brain and spinal cord and recovery will be explored. This research will move the pain field forward by further elucidating the neural processes underlying chronic pain and its recovery. Throughout the award period, Dr. Weber will obtain new skills and expertise in conducting clinical studies including randomized controlled trials and applying advanced computational methods to clinical pain research.

"Altered Microbiome of Chronic Pelvic Pain ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Abundant and diverse bacterial species inhabit the GI tract, constituting the bulk of the GI ""microbiome."" The GI microbiome plays key roles in health and disease processes throughout the body, yet it is unclear whether or how the microbiome mediates the pathogenesis of urologic chronic pelvic pain syndromes (UCPPS). Indeed, UCPPS cause significant morbidity in women and men, but etiologies, diagnostic markers, and therapies are lacking. Here, we present preliminary data demonstrating that UCPPS in women is associated with altered GI microbiota, and specific species are candidates for novel UCPPS biomarkers. Moreover, in clinically relevant murine UCPPS models, symptom-like behaviors can be modulated by manipulating the GI microbiome. We hypothesize that an altered GI microbiome results in circulating bacterial products that act on CNS targets and contribute to UCPPS. This project will use a combination of clinical, translational, and mechanistic studies to define the role of the GI microbiome in UCPPS, and in contrast to voiding dysfunction in the absence of pain. These findings will lead to the development of novel diagnostics and effective probiotic therapies for chronic pelvic pain. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Bacteria residing in the gastrointestinal tract are increasingly understood to shape health and disease processes throughout the body, yet the role of GI bacteria in urologic chronic pelvic pain is unknown.

"Mechanistic Characterization of Pain in Temporomandibular Disorders: Does Pain Centralization Influence Responsiveness to Peripherally Targeted Treatments? Project Summary / Abstract Temporomandibular disorders (TMD), characterized by persistent pain in the cheek and jaw area of the face, affect approximately 1 in 10 women at some point in their lives. TMD treatments primarily focus on peripheral factors; however, many patients with TMD show no signs of peripheral damage. It is now known that many chronic pain conditions, including TMD, involve pain centralization, meaning the pain is generated and maintained by central, rather than peripheral, nervous system processes. There are currently no well accepted means through which centralized TMD pain can be identified in the clinic, and the failure to properly identify these centralized cases means that ineffective peripheral treatments are administered. The specific aims of this project are to 1) Demonstrate that structural, functional, and neurochemical abnormalities exist in TMD that are similar to those reported in other centralized pain conditions, 2) Utilize questionnaire and quantitative sensory testing measures that can accurately detect centralized pain to place patients on a continuum from peripheral to centralized, and show that the brains of centralized, but not peripheral, patients differ significantly from healthy controls, and 3) Determine the measures of centralization and brain morphology, function, and chemistry that predict lack of improvement from a peripherally targeted treatment regimen, to show that centralized TMD patients do not respond as well to treatments that fail to target their pathology. The primary goal of the mentored (K99) portion of the award is to give the candidate the additional training in neuroimaging necessary for him to obtain a tenure track faculty position and successfully run his own independent research program. The K99 phase will take place at the University of Michigan, under the mentorship of Drs. Daniel Clauw, Richard Harris, and David Williams, who are world-renowned experts in centralized pain conditions, pain neuroimaging, and pain psychometrics, respectively. Dr. William Maixner (Duke University), a world- leading expert on TMD, will also serve as a mentor; he will advise the candidate on the clinically relevant aspects of TMD and help the candidate network with other more established TMD researchers. The University of Michigan is ideal for the K99 phase of the project because of the available resources, including faculty who are committed to clinical pain research and mentoring, research-devoted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanners and state-of-the-art pain testing equipment, and ample laboratory and office space at the Chronic Pain and Fatigue Research Center. Upon completing the K99 portion of the award, the candidate will be well suited to make the transition to tenure-track faculty. Project Narrative TMD, which is the most prevalent orofacial pain condition, is a public health problem that negatively impacts the quality of life and function of numerous individuals. This project addresses large gaps in our knowledge of pain centralization in TMD, building off of what is currently known from other pain conditions. Improvement in our understanding of the etiology of TMD and how it influences treatment will be crucial to bring individualized medicine to TMD patients. As a first step, we will determine what central factors make the prevailing peripheral treatments less effective. The results of this project will inform future studies of TMD by pinpointing the most promising variables to measure in longitudinal treatment studies of TMD.",Mechanistic Characterization of Pain in Temporomandibular Disorders: Does Pain Centralization Influence Responsiveness to Peripherally Targeted Treatments?,9441748,K99DE026810,"['Address', 'Affect', 'American', 'Area', 'Award', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Cheek structure', 'Chemistry', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Equipment', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Face', 'Faculty', 'Failure', 'Fatigue', 'Fibromyalgia', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Goals', 'High Prevalence', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Inflammation', 'Injury', 'Insula of Reil', 'Jaw', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Michigan', 'Motor Cortex', 'Naproxen', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Nociception', 'Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Orofacial Pain', 'Pain', 'Pain Research', 'Paper', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Peripheral Nervous System', 'Persistent pain', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Process', 'Psychometrics', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Questionnaires', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Sample Size', 'Sensory', 'Series', 'Soft Diet', 'Somatosensory Cortex', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Temporomandibular Joint Disorders', 'Temporomandibular joint disorder pain', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Woman', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'brain morphology', 'central pain', 'chronic pain', 'chronic painful condition', 'chronic pelvic pain', 'clinical pain', 'clinically relevant', 'dietary restriction', 'follow-up', 'gray matter', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'neurochemistry', 'neuroimaging', 'outcome forecast', 'pain processing', 'personalized medicine', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'skills', 'targeted treatment', 'tenure track']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K99,2018,117891,0.3070687857628379
"Electrocardiographic Detection of Non-ST Elevation Myocardial Events for Accelerated Classification of Chest Pain Encounters (ECG-SMART) Electrocardiographic Detection of Non-ST Elevation Myocardial Events for Accelerated  Classification of Chest Pain Encounters (ECG-SMART) ABSTRACT There is a clear need to develop improved tools to stratify risk in patients who seek emergency care for chest pain, one of the most common and potentially deadliest conditions encountered in acute care settings. The ECG has been the mainstay of initial evaluation of chest pain patients, yet is currently only diagnostic for a small subset of patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction. Our well-rounded and collaborative team has been working together for the past four years to develop novel ECG interpretation algorithms that can greatly enhance the utility of the ECG in the early evaluation of acute coronary disease. This line of work is already substantiated by pilot studies that have identified candidate markers of ECG characteristics and preliminary algorithms that can identify patients with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction as well as those with very low risk of coronary artery disease. With these improved tools, emergency providers (physicians, nurses, and paramedics) will be able to streamline the care provided to these patients beyond the costly and time- consuming overnight observation for serial cardiac enzymes and provocative testing. This grant will provide needed resources for our team to enroll a cohort of over 1,800 patients needed to confirm the accuracy of these ECG markers and determine their maximal clinical utility as part of a risk stratification tool. It builds directly on our existing work in this area, which has already yielded necessary preliminary data and multiple joint publications. Validating this technology will set the groundwork for the future development and testing of targeted interventions to improve patient outcomes in non-ST elevation myocardial infarction. SUMMARY/NARRATIVE Current guidelines for diagnosing and treating myocardial infarction (MI) are based on identifying ST elevation (STE) on the 12-lead ECG, yet only one third of MI patients exhibit such elevation. We propose to (1) extend our prior research of novel repolarization indices of non-STE MI available on the initial ECG and (2) incorporate this information into real-time machine-learning algorithms for clinical decision support, which will improve our sensitivity in detecting and treating MI very early during urgent care. Such early and non-invasively acquired diagnostics can improve outcomes and save costs for millions of patients with chest pain annually.",Electrocardiographic Detection of Non-ST Elevation Myocardial Events for Accelerated Classification of Chest Pain Encounters (ECG-SMART),9520500,R01HL137761,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Action Potentials', 'Acute', 'Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Area', 'Aspirin', 'Attenuated', 'Benign', 'Biological Markers', 'Cardiac', 'Caring', 'Catheterization', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chest Pain', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary Occlusions', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Distress', 'Dose', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Emergency Care', 'Emergency Situation', 'Emergency department visit', 'Emergency medical service', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Enzymes', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Harvest', 'Health Care Costs', 'Heart Injuries', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Infarction', 'Injury', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Ischemia', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Muscle strain', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Myocardial Ischemia', 'Myocardium', 'Necrosis', 'Nitrates', 'Nurses', 'Outcome', 'Oxygen', 'Pain Measurement', 'Paramedical Personnel', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Pre-hospital setting', 'Pre-hospitalization care', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'ROC Curve', 'Records', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resource Allocation', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Serum', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Stress Tests', 'Supervision', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Triage', 'Troponin', 'Unstable angina', 'Ventricular', 'Work', 'base', 'billing data', 'candidate marker', 'clinical decision support', 'cohort', 'cost', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'digital', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'indexing', 'injured', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'novel', 'pain patient', 'patient subsets', 'perfusion imaging', 'primary outcome', 'prognostic value', 'reduce symptoms', 'secondary outcome', 'support tools', 'tertiary care', 'tool', 'urgent care']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2018,370376,0.116083377147864
"Development and Preliminary Testing of Novel Virtual Human-Assisted Psychosocial Interviews for Patients with Chronic Musculoskeletal Pain Project Summary / Abstract Chronic musculoskeletal pain is associated with significant psychosocial difficulties. Unfortunately, patients and medical providers find it difficult to discuss psychosocial factors, and these often remain unaddressed during the medical visit. The goal of the proposed application is to develop next-generation Virtual Human-assisted therapeutic interviews that can be integrated in current pain practice to engage patients in a conversation about psychosocial problems associated with their chronic pain. Virtual Humans (VHs) are computer-animated characters that mimic the appearance and behavior of a real person and that can be used as virtual interviewers. This novel technology also makes it possible to implement different experimental conditions with a great degree of standardization, thereby enhancing internal validity and reproducibility, while maintaining a high level of authenticity. Our team’s existing VH prototype has been successfully used to elicit self-disclosure. We propose to adapt our VH for use in patients with chronic pain in preparation for a subsequent large-scale clinical trial. In Phase 1 of the application, we will develop VH-assisted psychosocial interviews specifically for chronic pain. They will address two theoretically important yet divergent targets of communication: (1) psychosocial consequences resulting from the experience of chronic pain (e.g., depression, relationship disruption); and (2) possible psychosocial contributors that may trigger, exacerbate, or maintain chronic pain (e.g., background stressful events, pain attributions). Development of the VH-assisted psychosocial interviews will be guided by prior research on emotion-focused treatment, our extensive clinical expertise, and qualitative feedback from patient stakeholders. In Phase 2, we will bring our VH into the clinic and conduct preliminary feasibility and efficacy testing. Patients will be randomly assigned to one of four experimental conditions in a 2 x 2 factorial design, in which the VH will address (a) psychosocial consequences of chronic pain, (b) psychosocial contributors to chronic pain, (c) a combination of both, or (d) neither (attention control group). All patients will engage in a single VH interview session before their initial medical consultation. Feasibility will be established through participation rates, potential patient concerns about discussing psychosocial stressors with the VH, clinic flow, and stakeholder satisfaction. Based on existing theoretical frameworks, we expect that the VH sessions will impact patient outcomes through improved patient emotion regulation, working memory, and patient-provider relations; shifts in pain attitudes, and increased motivation for behavioral pain management. The pilot data collected in this application will provide essential preliminary information on the therapeutic mechanisms and patient health benefits of the VH-assisted communication approaches. This proposal is expected to be impactful because it 1) utilizes novel yet promising next-generation VH methodology; 2) tests theories and advances practice about how patients’ psychosocial problems related to pain should be addressed in pain management; and 3) examines the feasibility and clinical utility of integrating VHs into pain care. Project Narrative/Relevance Chronic musculoskeletal pain is associated with significant psychosocial difficulties that often remain unaddressed in routine clinical care. The proposed application will develop next-generation Virtual Human (VH) interviewers to talk with patients about psychosocial problems associated with their chronic pain and pilot test whether it is feasible and clinically helpful to integrate VHs in chronic pain management for patients’ disclosure of stress and negative emotion.",Development and Preliminary Testing of Novel Virtual Human-Assisted Psychosocial Interviews for Patients with Chronic Musculoskeletal Pain,9584529,R21AR074020,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Appearance', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attitude', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Caring', 'Clinic', 'Clinic Visits', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communication', 'Computers', 'Consultations', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disclosure', 'Distal', 'Distress', 'Emotions', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Health Benefit', 'Healthcare', 'Interruption', 'Interview', 'Interviewer', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Modality', 'Motivation', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Pain intensity', 'Pain interference', 'Pain management', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Preparation', 'Procedures', 'Provider', 'Psychosocial Factor', 'Psychosocial Influences', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Sampling', 'Self Disclosure', 'Seminal', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Standardization', 'Stress', 'Stressful Event', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Visit', 'Work', 'age effect', 'attentional control', 'base', 'chronic musculoskeletal pain', 'chronic pain', 'chronic pain patient', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'diaries', 'efficacy testing', 'emotion regulation', 'emotional distress', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'new technology', 'next generation', 'novel', 'pain reduction', 'physical conditioning', 'prototype', 'psychosocial', 'satisfaction', 'sex', 'stressor', 'theories', 'therapeutic evaluation', 'uptake', 'virtual', 'virtual human']",NIAMS,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R21,2018,207280,0.29251063328946136
"Pain Care Quality and Integrated and Complementary Health Approaches DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Improving the quality of pain management is a high priority for the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). VHA has published policy guidance that establishes an innovative stepped care model of pain management (SCM- PM) as the single standard of pain care. The SCM-PM provides the ability to assess and treat pain in primary care settings, while maintaining the capacity to escalate treatment options to include specialized care, if necessary. The model further emphasizes the importance of an individually tailored, integrated, multi-modal approach to pain management that takes into account mental health comorbidities and that incorporates complementary health approaches (CHA) to promote optimal pain control and improved function and quality of life. Despite great strides in promoting this model, pain management performance improvement efforts have been hampered by the limited availability of reliable Pain Care Quality indicators and metrics for key dimensions of pai management in order to promote their utilization in systematic quality improvement efforts. Other than pharmacological and procedure based interventions in which specific, easily retrievable codes are used to document care in the VHA's electronic health record (EHR), it is difficult to capture the broader array of CHA or key aspects of integrated care. These gaps in the EHR and VHA database pose serious barriers to promoting performance improvement efforts including implementation of the SCM-PM. The proposed project extends prior research by our investigator team by using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) to automate a previously validated approach to identify and quantify key dimensions of Pain Care Quality, namely assessment, especially functional assessment, integrated treatment plans, reassessment (outcomes), and patient education from the EHR. Once this automated solution is validated, we intend to apply it to a national sample to test important questions about Pain Care Quality among veterans with comorbid mental health conditions, access to CHA, and the SCM-PM. This innovative solution to identifying key dimensions of healthcare has potential applicability to improving the management of other complex health problems for which existing quality of care indicators and metrics are limited. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will fill a critical gap in the field of pain management by developing a method for measuring of Pain Care Quality in the nation's largest integrated healthcare system, the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). This measure will make it possible to evaluate the implementation of standardized pain care practices in the VHA and to determine what factors (e.g., emphasis on pain management in primary care settings, presence of mental health disorders, use of complementary health approaches such as acupuncture) are related to better quality care. Successful completion of this project has important public health implications as the methodology may be adapted to promote quality care related to other health problems both within and outside VHA.",Pain Care Quality and Integrated and Complementary Health Approaches,9332333,R01AT008448,"['Acupuncture Therapy', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Americas', 'Award', 'Benchmarking', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Code', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Comorbidity', 'Competence', 'Complex', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disadvantaged', 'Disease', 'Education', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Foundations', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hypnosis', 'Individual', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Massage', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Military Personnel', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Musculoskeletal Pain', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Pain Measurement', 'Pain Research', 'Pain management', 'Pain quality', 'Patient Education', 'Patient Preferences', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Pharmacology', 'Policies', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Quality Indicator', 'Quality of Care', 'Quality of life', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Self Management', 'Spinal Manipulation', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Veterans', 'Work', 'base', 'data management', 'electronic data', 'evidence base', 'health administration', 'improved', 'improved functioning', 'innovation', 'mindfulness-based stress reduction', 'multiple chronic conditions', 'population based', 'primary care setting', 'public health relevance', 'shared decision making', 'tool', 'treatment planning']",NCCIH,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,450624,0.22676150977803117
"Thalamic and Cortical Mechanisms of Itch ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Itch is a common clinical problem that is often difficult to treat. There is currently little understanding of the mechanism used in the CNS to produce itch and this likely contributes to the inability to treat itch. In recent years it have become cler that information related to itch is carried in the periphery and spinal cord by neurons that are also activated by noxious stimuli. This suggests that information necessary for the production of itch in the brain must be extracted from the responses of polysensory neurons in a process called decoding. The proposed studies, will for the first time, use single unit electrophysiologica techniques to determine the areas in the thalamus and cortex where processing of pruriceptive information occurs. The responses of single neurons in the thalamus to various itch-and pain-producing stimuli will be determined. The cortical areas to which pruriceptive thalamic neurons project will be determined using antidromic activation methods. In addition, responses of individual cortical neurons to pruritogens and pain-producing stimuli will be determined. The proposed studies will determine the thalamic nuclei and cortical areas in which processing of information related to itch and pain occur. In addition, using a Machine Learning approach, we will determine the contributions of the intensity and pattern of action potentials within responses to differential coding of itch and pain related responses. The proposed studies will considerably expand our understanding of the CNS mechanisms that produce itch and pain.        RELEVANCE: Very little is known about the neural systems in the thalamus and cerebral cortex that underlie production of the sensation of itch. This lack of understanding likely contributes to the paucity of effective treatments for the majority of types of chronic itch. The proposed studies will determine the areas in the thalamus and cortex in which single neurons process and transmit information about itch and pain.

"PROFILING VULVODYNIA BASED ON NEUROBIOLOGICAL AND BEHAVIORAL ENDOPHENOTYPES DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Vulvodynia (VD) is a chronic pain disorder affecting up to 15% of women and resulting in substantial impairment in health-related quality-of-life. The treatment of the disorder is hampered by a lack of knowledge regarding its neurobiological basis. The proposed study is based on the general hypothesis that like other persistent pain conditions, VD clinical phenotypes are composed of multiple biological endophenotypes, and that meaningful subgroups can be identified. In the current proposal, we plan to extensively phenotype a large sample of VD patients using functional and structural brain imaging together with genetic, physiological, and biological parameters. We hypothesize that central mechanisms (including alterations in the processing/modulation of interoceptive signals from the external genitals) are important determinants of the clinical presentation, and that differences in these brain signatures could play an important role in treatment responsiveness. Such phenotyping has considerable implications for future drug development. We propose to test this hypothesis by accomplishing three specific aims. Aim 1 will characterize alterations in multimodal structural brain and connectivity indices in VD. This will be accomplished by applying complex network analysis and machine learning algorithms to compare resting state [RS] functional and structural (grey and white matter) brain imaging in VD patients to 200 age-matched female healthy controls (HC), 200 patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and 100 patients with interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome which are available from a large brain scan repository at UCLA. Aim 2 will characterize the connectivity indices in VD and identify the association between structural (grey and white matter) and RS alterations with clinical, behavioral and genetic parameters. This will be accomplished by associating structural and RS functional abnormalities identified in Aim 1 with relevant parameters including: clinical (symptom severity, disease duration, co-morbid pain or psychiatric diagnosis), behavioral (pressure pain thresholds), and biological (candidate gene polymorphisms belonging to clusters of genes related to hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal [HPA] axis function, pain, inflammatory, catecholamine, and serotonin signaling systems). Aim 3 will identify VD patient subgroups based on endophenotype clusters by applying advanced mathematical classification techniques to brain, biological, behavioral and clinical endophenotypes.

"fMRI-based Biomarkers for Multiple Components of Pain DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Objective biomarkers of pathology exist for a number of diseases, and their development is one of the great advances of modern allopathic medicine. However, objective assessment of pain and other mental health disorders has lagged far behind. Pain cannot be explained by peripheral damage alone; it is caused by a variety of neuropathological processes, which has made it difficult to assess and treat. Currently, the only acceptable way to measure pain is by self-report, which presents a serious barrier to effective research and treatment. Self-reported pain is influenced by nociceptive, affective, and cognitive decision-making processes-and though there are many treatments that can influence reported pain, they likely do so through a heterogeneous set of neurophysiological mechanisms, with different consequences for health and long-term well being. As a result, in spite of a long history of research, current treatments for pain are effective for a minority of individuals, with enormous costs to patients and to society.  Biomarkers for physical pain could dramatically improve diagnosis and treatment, by allowing pain to be characterized on the basis of underlying neuropathology, rather than external symptoms. They could also improve treatment, by allowing interventions to be targeted to type of neuropathology involved.  Biomarkers that can shed light on the brain pathophysiology that causes pain must necessarily rely on direct measures of brain function. In the past several years, major advances in combining functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with machine learning techniques-algorithms for finding predictive patterns in complex datasets-have brought the goal of fMRI-based pain assessment within reach. In preliminary data, we show for the first time that fMRI activity can predict whether an individual person is experiencing high or low physical pain with over 90% sensitivity and specificity. Critically, the biomarker is specific to physical pain when compared with non-painful touch and several classes of salient, affective events. In addition, it achieves this level of accuracy when applied prospectively to new samples, across different scanners and paradigms.  This preliminary success raises a number of issues that must be addressed before fMRI-based biomarkers can be used in large-scale clinical trials and clinical practice, including a) robustnes across laboratories and procedures, b) specificity to body site, modality, and quality of pain, c) responses to analgesic treatment, and d) applicability to spontaneous and acute hypersensitivity/allodynia in clinical populations. Here, we propose to aggregate existing data across a consortium of researchers, allowing more extensive tests of sensitivity and specificity across 13 fMRI studies in healthy individuals and 18 studies in diverse clinical pain populations. In addition, we will conduct five new experiments to address critical aspects of biomarker performance. These data will allow us to develop and validate new, more comprehensive biomarkers that can assess multiple aspects of pain across healthy individuals and chronic pain sufferers. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Pain affects nearly everyone at some time in their lives, with enormous costs to individuals and society. Current treatments for pain are only modestly effective, in large part because pain is created through a complex set of brain processes and can be measured only by patients' self-reports, which presents a serious barrier to effective research and treatment. This project capitalizes on recent breakthroughs in measuring human brain activity and using it to objectively assess the brain processes that underlie pain experience, which could transform the way pain is measured and new treatments are developed.",fMRI-based Biomarkers for Multiple Components of Pain,9245657,R01DA035484,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Algorithms', 'Analgesics', 'Back Pain', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Distress', 'Emotional', 'Event', 'Fright', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Human', 'Hyperalgesia', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Procedures', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medicine', 'Mental disorders', 'Minority', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Naproxen', 'Nerve Pain', 'Nociception', 'Pain', 'Pain Measurement', 'Pain intensity', 'Pain management', 'Pain quality', 'Painless', 'Pathology', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pelvic Pain', 'Performance', 'Peripheral', 'Persons', 'Pharmacology', 'Physicians', 'Placebos', 'Population', 'Process', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Societies', 'Specificity', 'Stimulus', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Touch sensation', 'Translating', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Validation', 'Visceral pain', 'Visual', 'Wages', 'Work', 'allodynia', 'arthritic pain', 'base', 'chronic pain', 'clinical practice', 'cognitive performance', 'cognitive process', 'cost', 'design', 'distraction', 'duloxetine', 'expectation', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'mental imagery', 'neuropathology', 'neurophysiology', 'painful neuropathy', 'patient population', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'remifentanil', 'response', 'social', 'spontaneous pain', 'success']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO,R01,2017,587021,0.3283857531305346
"Multimodal Assessment of Occurrence and Intensity of Pain for Research and Clinical Use Project Summary/Abstract Pain typically is measured by patient self-report or clinician impressions, either through clinical interview or the visual analog scale. While useful, self-report measures have several limitations that include idiosyncratic use, inconsistent metric properties across scale dimensions, efforts at impression management or deception, and differences between clinicians' and sufferers' conceptualizations of pain. Given individual differences among patients, their families, and healthcare providers, pain is often poorly assessed, underestimated, and inadequately treated [Hadjistavropoulos et al., 2002]. An objective, reliable, and efficient assay of the occurrence and intensity of pain would advance pain monitoring and intervention, leading to a uniform yet individual management of pain and an efficient utilization of the health care system. Machine analysis for the automatic assessment of pain occurrence and intensity could be of considerable value to achieve these goals. To advance pain assessment, monitoring, and intervention, we propose an automatic facial, head, and body movement analysis for the automatic assessment of the occurrence and intensity of pain. Recent efforts demonstrated the validity of automatic detection of shoulder pain from facial expression in a constrained laboratory context using person-dependent, semi-automatic procedures. The current project extends previous efforts to multimodal measurement of the occurrence and intensity of pain in well-characterized and clinically relevant participants with rotator cuff syndrome (RCS) using person-independent, fully-automatic procedures. To collect pain-related behavioral responses to a full range of pain intensities, we will abduct their shoulders pre- and post- a triangular forearm support (TFS) maneuver (a pain relief procedure, [Fishman et al., 2011]). Participants' face, head, and upper body movement will be recorded using synchronized high-definition digital video and Microsoft Kinect cameras during the abduction and flexion of their shoulders before and after TFS. To investigate possible placebo effect of TFS, comparison behavioral responses to a sham procedure of randomly selected RCS participants will be collected before the TFS procedure. To investigate the specificity of pain response to arm abduction, we will include a non-clinical group of participants without RCS or need for pain relief. To investigate the repeatability of the proposed automatic measures, we will obtain multiple movement trials from each participant during both pre- and post treatment. Face, head, and body movement will be automatically tracked using our newly fully- automatic method for face tracking and the automatic Kinect's body skeleton tracking. We will identify optimal features and classifiers for automatic measurement of occurrence and intensity of pain. To investigate validity, we will compare automated measurement with patient-rated visual analog scale and obtained continuous observer ratings of pain intensity from the video recordings. MANOVA will quantify the relationship between the individual modalities and their combination for pain measurement. HLM will investigate possible influence of participant characteristics (e.g. gender). Project Narrative Pain typically is measured by patient self-report, but self-reported pain is difficult to interpret and may be impaired or in some circumstances not possible to obtain. We propose to use a clinically well-characterized data to develop an automatic multimodal method for the detection of occurrence and intensity of pain.",Multimodal Assessment of Occurrence and Intensity of Pain for Research and Clinical Use,9245178,R21NR016510,"['Affect', 'Aftercare', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Appearance', 'Archives', 'Beds', 'Biological Assay', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Conscious', 'Consent', 'Data', 'Deception', 'Detection', 'Dimensions', 'Distress', 'Environment', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Family', 'Forearm', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Head Movements', 'Health Personnel', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'Neurologic', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Orthopedics', 'Pain', 'Pain Measurement', 'Pain Research', 'Pain intensity', 'Pain management', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Placebo Effect', 'Postoperative Care', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rotator Cuff', 'Shapes', 'Shoulder', 'Shoulder Pain', 'Skeleton', 'Specificity', 'Suggestion', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Video Recording', 'Visual', 'analog', 'arm', 'base', 'behavioral response', 'care systems', 'clinically relevant', 'digital', 'experience', 'health care service utilization', 'impression', 'learning strategy', 'movement analysis', 'multimodality', 'pediatric patients', 'response', 'sensor']",NINR,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R21,2017,148363,0.2775215357126527
"Finding Good TEMporal PostOperative pain Signatures (TEMPOS) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over 100 million patients undergo surgery each year in the US, and more than 60% of these patients will suffer from severe acute postoperative pain. Recent data suggest that the time course of pain resolution following surgery is highly variable with over one-third of patients experiencing stable or increasing, rather than decreasing, pain on each day after surgery for at least the first 7 postoperative days. While prior work has focused on linear trajectories of average daily postoperative pain, temporal profiles of pain that measure hourly variations in pain intensity provide a more accurate depiction of the postoperative pain experience than simple linear functions derived from daily pain assessments. The purpose of the proposed research is to elucidate the nature, mechanistic underpinnings, and clinical implications of TEMporal PostOperative pain Signatures (TEMPOS) by applying advanced algorithms to characterize postoperative pain profiles in a prospective cohort. The research will address three Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1: To characterize TEMPOS within the surgical population via state of the art time-series analysis techniques; Specific Aim 2: To identify clinical, biological, psychological, and social (CBPS) mechanisms that contribute to TEMPOS; Specific Aim 3: To determine which TEMPOS optimally predict the development of persistent postsurgical pain. To address these aims, we propose a single-center, prospective observational cohort study of 500 surgical patients. Prior to surgery, sociodemographic variables will be obtained via the electronic medical record (EMR), and patients will complete multiple online inventories for depression, anxiety and catastrophizing. A blood sample will be obtained for genetic studies exploring a variety of pain-related genes, and perioperative surgery and anesthetic details will be extracted from the EMR. Pain outcomes will be assessed at three resolutions: every 6 minutes via a patient-controlled analgesia device interrogation; every four hours via clinical assessments; and every day using the McGill Pain Questionnaire and Brief Pain Inventory. Clinical data on analgesic consumption and patient activity will be used for contextual assessment of pain intensity. Patients will be followed for up to 7 days after surgery, and will again be queried at 6 months after surgery to determine the presence and extent of persistent postsurgical pain. Analyses will first compare existing models, which classify patients as positive, neutral, or negative in pain trajectory slope, with higher-order models offering greater resolution in predicting postoperative pain at discrete time points. We will then perform clustering analyses with respect to the temporal patterns of postoperative pain in order to better define TEMPOS phenotypes. These analyses will be repeated with the clinical, biological, psychological, and social factors listed above to determine how these characteristics drive the mechanisms underlying the observed TEMPOS. Finally, we will use advanced machine learning models to forecast both acute and persistent postoperative pain outcomes with respect to the derived TEMPOS definitions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project examines how postoperative pain scores change with respect to time, and the impact of these temporal patterns on the risk for persistent postsurgical pain. These experiments will first demonstrate that there are many different, complex patterns of pain score changes over time after surgery, rather than the currently-established linear pain trajectories offered in the literature. Next, these experiments will determine how clinical, biological, psychological, and social factors predispose patients to different patterns of pain- analgesia-pain cycles, and finally determine how these timing patterns may influence the development of persistent postsurgical pain.",Finding Good TEMporal PostOperative pain Signatures (TEMPOS),9291477,R01GM114290,"['Abdomen', 'Absence of pain sensation', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Analgesics', 'Anesthetics', 'Anxiety', 'Biological', 'Blood specimen', 'Brief Pain Inventory', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Demographic Factors', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dimensions', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Educational Background', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Female', 'Genes', 'Genetic study', 'Hour', 'Lead', 'Linear Models', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Markov Chains', 'McGill Pain Scale', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Nerve Block', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Opioid', 'Orthopedics', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Pain Measurement', 'Pain intensity', 'Pain management', 'Patient-Controlled Analgesia', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perioperative', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Postoperative Pain', 'Postoperative Period', 'Predisposing Factor', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Prospective cohort', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'Translating', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'discrete time', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'genetic variant', 'improved', 'indexing', 'learning strategy', 'low socioeconomic status', 'novel', 'opioid use', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'public health relevance', 'sex', 'signal processing', 'social', 'temporal measurement', 'trend']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,R01,2017,507168,0.3262437769089531
"Single Session Pain Catastrophizing Treatment: Comparative Efficacy & Mechanisms ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic low back pain (CLBP) is the most common chronic pain condition and is the second leading cause of disability in the U.S. Pain catastrophizing (PC)--a pattern of negative cognitive-emotional responses to actual or anticipated pain-is significantly associated with the development and maintenance of CLBP as well as disability. PC undermines CLBP treatments, thus contributing to a cycle of treatment futility and wasted expenditure. While Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (pain-CBT) treats PC, group treatment involves 6-10 sessions and thus poses substantial burdens of time, travel, and cost. Therefore, there is a critical need to develop and disseminate efficient, low-cost treatments that specifically reduce PC. Accordingly, we developed a single-session, 2-hour pain-CBT class that solely treats PC (""From Catastrophizing to Recovery""; FCR). Our pilot data revealed large effect sizes for FCR in a chronic pain sample and superior outcomes for medical and psychological across PROMIS domains, as compared to a 'treatment as usual' matched clinic cohort. We propose to conduct a 3-arm comparative efficacy RCT in 231 patients with CLBP comparing: (A) FCR, (B) a health education control, and (C) an 8-session pain-CBT class. Our primary endpoint is PC 3 months post- treatment and our secondary endpoint is PC 6 months post-treatment. We hypothesize that FCR will be superior to active control and non-inferior to the 8-session pain-CBT class for improving PC and pain-related outcomes measured by our PROMIS platform. An innovative aspect of the application is our proposal to develop and validate a brief version Daily PCS measure, and apply the measure with high frequency sampling methods to elucidate the mechanics of PC, and to characterize how positive response to active intervention reduces the influence of PC episodes. Additional novel methods our specialized PROMIS platform; actigraphy for objective sleep and activity measurement; and a customized 'FCR Relaxation Resource' app (on Nexus 7 tablets) to objectively quantify skills use in the FCR group. Our rich dataset will allow for detailed phenotyping of responders / non-responders for both active treatments using machine learning and other advanced analytics. We will use daily ratings across a longitudinal timeframe to characterize how PC changes in response to treatment, as well as the mechanistic influence of PC on pain, sleep, activity, and other variables. Our proposal addresses the NCCAM priorities to (1) ""alleviate chronic pain"", (2) study our mind-body intervention in a ""real-world setting,"" and (3) advance scientific understanding of the mechanisms of PC. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Pain catastrophizing (PC)--a negative cognitive and emotional psychological pattern-is so powerful that it undermines medical treatment and contributes to pain chronicity. This project investigates a promising single- session, low-cost intervention that specifically treats PC.

"The Neural Bases of Placebo Effects and their Relation to Regulatory Processes DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Throughout history, placebo effects have been variously considered as tricks played upon the gullible by medical practitioners and powerful but mysterious healing forces. With the advent of direct measurements of human brain function, modern science has shown that placebo effects are neither of these. Rather, they reflect the principled impact of psychological and brain processes on diseases of the brain and body. Placebo effects represent an opportunity-because they provide a window into internal brain processes that influence health- and a challenge, because dozens of clinical trials have now failed to show the superiority of commonly prescribed drugs to placebo, at great cost to health care providers and consumers. This may not be due to the ineffectiveness of the medications, but rather seems to be related to high placebo response rates. Studies of the brain mechanisms underlying placebo effects can provide valuable insight into how the brain actively anticipates, responds to, and learns about active treatments, and the effects of these processes on pain and other aspects of health. In the previous period of this grant, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of placebo and opiate drug effects was instrumental in establishing that placebo treatments impact the neurobiology of pain, including effects on the cortical and subcortical brain regions most closely associated with pain experience. The research also provided some of the first evidence on the interactions in the brain that give rise to placebo effects, and demonstrated the involvement of prefrontal cortical-subcortical-brainstem systems and the endogenous opioid system. The view that emerged is that placebo treatments engage brain systems related to both conceptual thought (explicit beliefs) and learning processes that change the value assigned to treatment cues and pain itself. In this Renewal application, we build on this foundation to address some of the many unanswered questions that need to be addressed before placebo effects are understood, harnessed in therapy, and separated cleanly from drug effects in clinical trials and practice. These include fundamental questions about a) the nature of the ""pain-related"" processes regulated by placebos (are they specific to pain, or general affective processes?) and b) the critical conditions required to create placebo analgesia. Our working hypothesis is that conceptual and learning processes interact, and that both are critical. Learning systems fundamentally shape the motivational value of pain and modulate nociception in subcortical-brainstem systems, and conceptual processes are needed to attribute perceived benefits to the placebo treatment and engage learning. To better understand these systems, we bring to bear new computational machine-learning tools that can identify and test placebo effects on patterns of brain activity specific to pain. We also test the involvement of several neurochemical systems-opioids, dopamine, and oxytocin-and their relationships with specific brain and psychological aspects of the placebo response-generation process. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Though placebo treatments are pharmacologically inert, placebo responses are active neurobiological processes related to the meaning of the treatment and what has been learned about it. Studying them provides a way of understanding the roles of emotion and learning in clinical treatment effects. This project studies the brain mechanisms that underlie placebo analgesia from a multidisciplinary, neural systems-oriented view. It integrates new advances in functional neuroimaging with manipulations of placebo treatment, pharmacology, and hormones to address several fundamental questions about a) the nature of brain processes influenced by placebo treatment, and b) the critical factors underlying the genesis of robust physiological placebo effects.",The Neural Bases of Placebo Effects and their Relation to Regulatory Processes,9184580,R01MH076136,"['Absence of pain sensation', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Alternative Therapies', 'Analgesics', 'Area', 'Belief', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain Stem', 'Brain region', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Cereals', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Competence', 'Concept Formation', 'Conscious', 'Cues', 'Disease', 'Distress', 'Dopamine', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Expectancy', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Generations', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Hormones', 'Human', 'Image Analysis', 'Instruction', 'Insula of Reil', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Motivation', 'Naloxone', 'Narcotic Antagonists', 'Nature', 'Neurobiology', 'Nociception', 'Opiates', 'Opioid', 'Oxytocin', 'Pain', 'Pain Nature', 'Pain intensity', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Pharmacology', 'Physiological', 'Placebo Effect', 'Placebos', 'Play', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Psychological Impact', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Science', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Social Perception', 'Specificity', 'System', 'Testing', 'Ursidae Family', 'Work', 'active method', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'classical conditioning', 'clinical practice', 'conditioning', 'cost', 'design', 'endogenous opioids', 'expectation', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'healing', 'insight', 'multidisciplinary', 'negative affect', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neurochemistry', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'psychologic', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'social', 'social cognition', 'somatosensory', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO,R01,2017,641810,0.13253611920062394

"Engaging Veterans Seeking Service-Connection Payments in Pain Treatment Abstract In 2015 alone, 97,223 new Veterans under age 35 began receiving compensation for injuries related to their military service. In total, there are 559,999 post-9/11 Veterans being compensated for back or neck conditions, and a partially overlapping 596,250 for limitation of flexion in joints. Veterans seeking compensation for musculoskeletal conditions often develop chronic pain and are at high risk for substance misuse. Early intervention is needed to arrest worsening pain and risky substance use, particularly among post-9/11 Veterans for whom engagement in non-pharmacological pain treatment has the potential to improve their overall quality of life and spare them the complications of opioid treatments. The service-connection application is an ideal point-of-contact for initiating early intervention treatments for these at-risk Veterans. We propose to test the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of Screening, Brief Intervention and Referral to Treatment for Pain Management (SBIRT-PM), designed to reduce pain and risky substance use. In brief, the counselor explains that treating both physical and psychological aspects of pain leads to the best outcomes, outlines what VA (and non-VA if preferred) services are available to Veterans, explains that substances are sometimes used for pain relief, and segues into traditional SBIRT. SBIRT-PM's efficacy is supported by a completed clinical trial of 101 Veterans applying for service-connection for MSD, and by studies showing the efficacy of SBIRT for people with risky substance use and of Motivational Interviewing for engagement in non-pharmacological pain care. The study will involve a two-year period to arrange for clinicians at a single “hub” site to counsel Veterans throughout New England by phone with SBIRT-PM, and a four-year period to conduct the clinical trial and disseminate its findings. During the two-years of preparation for the clinical trial, the team will prepare SBIRT-PM for implementation by establishing communication (Relational Coordination is the theoretical framework) between the “hub” where the SBIRT-PM clinician is sited and the “spoke” sites, establishing study- related procedures, and piloting the intervention at each of the eight VA medical centers in New England. For the full clinical trial, we will randomize 1200 Veterans applying for compensation related to MSD to either SBIRT-PM or Usual Care (UC) across eight VA medical centers in New England. Outcome assessment by phone will occur at 12 and 36-week follow-ups, and will be corroborated with other sources of information ---the electronic health record and toxicology testing of nail clippings. We hypothesize that, compared to Usual Care, SBIRT-PM will be more effective and cost-effective in improving Veterans' pain and substance use. We further hypothesize that a mediator of these improvements will be use of non-pharmacological services, as extracted from VA records from structured data fields and from narrative text in the medical record using an innovative natural language processing algorithm. Screening and referral to treatment at service-connection examinations can transform a widely-used point of entry to VA into a health-promoting encounter. Narrative Veterans seeking compensation for musculoskeletal conditions often develop chronic pain and are at high risk for substance misuse. We propose to test the effectiveness and cost- effectiveness of Screening, Brief Intervention and Referral to Treatment for Pain Management (SBIRT-PM), designed to reduce pain and reduce risky substance use, in part by helping Veterans get comprehensive pain treatment. The study will involve a 2-year period to arrange for clinicians at a single site to counsel Veterans throughout New England by phone with SBIRT-PM as part of a clinical trial, and a 4-year period to conduct the trial and disseminate its findings.",Engaging Veterans Seeking Service-Connection Payments in Pain Treatment,9445873,UG3AT009758,"['Age', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Algorithms', 'Award', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Brief Pain Inventory', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communication', 'Conduct Clinical Trials', 'Cost Analysis', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Distress', 'Early Intervention', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Financial compensation', 'Health', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Human Resources', 'Individual', 'Injury compensation', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Joints', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medical Records', 'Medical center', 'Military Personnel', 'Modality', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'Musculoskeletal', 'Musculoskeletal Diseases', 'Nail plate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neck', 'New England', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Assessment', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pain', 'Pain interference', 'Pain management', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Phase', 'Phonation', 'Populations at Risk', 'Preparation', 'Procedures', 'Professional counselor', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized', 'Records', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Risk', 'Secure', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Site Visit', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Toxicology', 'Veterans', 'base', 'chronic pain', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cost effectiveness', 'design', 'experience', 'functional improvement', 'high risk', 'improved', 'informant', 'innovation', 'motivational enhancement therapy', 'pain symptom', 'payment', 'pragmatic trial', 'primary outcome', 'psychologic', 'screening', 'screening, brief intervention, referral, and treatment', 'secondary outcome', 'service utilization', 'substance abuse treatment', 'substance misuse', 'symptomatic improvement', 'treatment as usual', 'willingness to pay']",NCCIH,YALE UNIVERSITY,UG3,2017,250000,0.2341834452638389
"Identifying opioid response phenotypes in low back pain electronic health data Pain is the leading reason for adult outpatient and emergency department medical visits, impacting over 100 million Americans at a cost of over $600 billion dollars annually. Low back pain (LBP) represents 28% of this health-care problem and is the leading cause of disability, both in the United States and worldwide. Opioids are the most commonly prescribed drug class in the United States, and the majority of these prescriptions are for LBP. Despite the broad application of opioid therapy in LBP, the phenotypes of individuals who experience pain relief from opioid treatment have not been identified, leaving providers without clear guidance for safe and effective therapy. Given this staggering burden of disease and health-care utilization, clinical information regarding LBP widely populates the electronic health record (EHR), providing a valuable data source. However, this information presently has little meaning beyond the individual patient experience because the majority of pain-related data from the EHR is embedded in free text. Using EHR data may provide the crucial bridge to a better understanding of LBP. Thus, the central hypothesis of this proposal is that translating clinical experiences into discrete and analyzable data, specifically modeling opioid response phenotypes for patients with LBP, will identify clinically relevant phenotypic treatment responses. To test this hypothesis, this mentored career development project will adapt and apply natural language processing (NLP), data standardization, mining, and analysis tools to specifically model opioid response phenotypes for patients with LBP to characterize pain intensity, functional status, and pain interference with activity. Through integrated aims, this proposal will, 1) support the annotation of LBP and opioid note corpus, and the mapping of clinical concepts related to pain intensity, functional status, and pain interference with activities; 2) use NLP to identify and relate relevant opioid response phenotypes in patients with LBP in the EHR; and 3) characterize LBP phenotypes associated with opioid dose escalation. Clinical NLP uses statistical modeling to extract and transform high dimensional clinical data, which, when developed with the PI’s domain knowledge, creates a unique opportunity to understand LBP management, outcomes, and therapeutic efficacy. Ultimately this foundation may be used to predict clinical outcomes and responses to therapeutic interventions. Our long-term goal is to move beyond identifying disease phenotype profiles to create a system to identify treatment response phenotypes. Stratifying patients based on pain intensity, functional status, pain interference and other factors, we plan to identify potential cohorts that warrant further study from a genetic focus. This mentored career development grant (K08) will support a clinical expert’s adaptation of tools and training in a systematic method to allow growth toward a programmatic line of research that is incredibly responsive to the NIH pain research agenda and can transition to independent R01-level funding. Low back pain is the leading cause of disability worldwide. Yet, despite this significant health burden, we lack predictive models for clinical care. Unfortunately, clinicians lack clear guidance for treatment, specifically regarding the use of opioids. This proposal would accelerate pain medicine research by translating clinical experiences into discrete and analyzable data, specifically examining opioid response patterns for patients with low back pain in the electronic health record.

"Mechanisms of Spontaneous Peripheral Neuropathic Pain Abstract Peripheral neuropathic pain is a major health problem in the U.S. because of its high prevalence and poor response to currently available therapies. Although the pain has many pathological causes and anatomical locations, and its presentation in patients can vary considerably, fundamentally, its positive symptoms include just two distinct features: spontaneous pain and stimulus-evoked pain. Spontaneous pain arises as a consequence of ectopic activity in axons in the injured nerve—action potentials arising spontaneously from hyperexcitable membranes. Surprisingly, it is not at all clear what the exact source of this activity is—whether it originates in injured neurons or in neighboring intact ones, in A- or C-fibers, and in nociceptors or non- nociceptors. Furthermore, although there are changes in ion channel expression after peripheral axonal injury, the molecular mechanisms responsible for ectopic activity are still uncertain. It is also not known whether there are different mechanisms in different sensory neuron subtypes and whether these change over time. The goal of this grant is to precisely elucidate the cellular source and molecular mechanisms of spontaneous somatic pain after sciatic nerve injury in mice using live imaging in vivo, single cell Next Generation profiling by Nuc-seq and by Patch-seq - single cell profiling of electrophysiologically characterized pre-injured and intact neurons in vitro, and by measuring spontaneous changes in behavior in freely moving animals in an automated observer independent way. Finally, the project will also evaluate whether silencing specific subsets of sensory neurons using genetic tools that block synaptic input into the CNS has an effect on spontaneous pain-related behaviors. These experiments will provide data on the timing, extent and pattern of spontaneous activity after nerve injury, and in which sensory neurons. They will also identify those transcriptional changes specific to the presence of spontaneous activity at a single cell level. This mechanistic understanding will lay a foundation for identifying novel therapeutic opportunities for treating spontaneous neuropathic pain. Narrative This proposal is designed to identify in which subsets of somatic sensory neurons changes in excitability after nerve injury generate spontaneous neuropathic pain, and the molecular mechanisms responsible.",Mechanisms of Spontaneous Peripheral Neuropathic Pain,9455155,R01NS101704,"['Action Potentials', 'Afferent Neurons', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Axon', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Assay', 'C Fiber', 'Calcium', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Data', 'Dimensions', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Fiber', 'Fire - disasters', 'Foundations', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Glass', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Grooming', 'Health', 'High Prevalence', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Hyperalgesia', 'Image', 'In Vitro', 'Injury', 'Ion Channel', 'Lifting', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Membrane', 'Membrane Potentials', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Nerve', 'Neurons', 'Nociceptors', 'Pain', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral', 'Population', 'RNA', 'Reporter', 'Sensory', 'Source', 'Stimulus', 'Surface', 'Symptoms', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic Transmission', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tetanus Toxin', 'Time', 'Walking', 'Work', 'activating transcription factor 3', 'allodynia', 'axon injury', 'base', 'cell type', 'design', 'experimental study', 'in vivo', 'in vivo imaging', 'injured', 'nerve injury', 'next generation', 'novel therapeutics', 'pain symptom', 'painful neuropathy', 'pre-clinical', 'release of sequestered calcium ion into cytoplasm', 'response', 'sciatic nerve', 'somatosensory', 'spontaneous pain', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NINDS,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2017,687593,0.17713126968549545
"Evaluation of Physicochemical Properties Imparted by Fluorinated Peptidomimetics ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The ability to control pain remains a major problem in medicine and society. According to the Institute of Medicine, chronic pain affects about 100 million American adults, more people than those affected by diabetes, heart disease, and cancer combined. It has been estimated that the costs associated with pain in the USA exceeds $600 billion dollars per year, mainly due to medical treatment and lost productivity. While these expenditures are significant, the costs in terms of suffering and quality of life cannot be adequately calculated. Opioid analgesics, such as morphine and its analogs, have been the mainstay for treatment of pain for thousands of years, and currently represent the ""gold-standard"" for pain management. However, clinicians are conservative in prescribing, and patients are conservative in taking, opioids due to valid concerns about adverse effects as well as social and legal issues. As a result, pain is often undertreated, and patients continue to suffer. Endogenous peptides regulate activity within the central nervous system (CNS), and are particularly interesting for the treatment of pain, depression and anxiety. Unfortunately, the clinical usage of peptide-based agents is limited by poor physicochemical (PC) and pharmacokinetic (PK) properties, which restrict penetration into the CNS. Therefore, these peptide-based agents cannot be employed clinically for the treatment of pain. The present proposal aims to develop and employ a new fluorination strategy to rationally improve biophysical properties of peptide-based probes with insufficient drug-like properties, and to allow for these probes to enter the CNS. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Many clinically employed analgesics possess undesired side effects, including convulsions, euphoria, sedation, respiratory depression, constipation, tolerance and dependence. Therefore, clinicians are conservative in prescribing, and patients are conservative in taking, opioids due to valid concerns about adverse effects as well as social and legal issues. As a result, pain is often undertreated, and patients continue to suffer. The present proposal seeks to explore strategies for delivering other small-molecule analgesics with limited side effect profiles into the central nervous system for the treatment of pain.",Evaluation of Physicochemical Properties Imparted by Fluorinated Peptidomimetics,9439282,R33DA036730,"['Adult', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Agonist', 'American', 'Amides', 'Analgesics', 'Anxiety', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Chemical Structure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Computer Simulation', 'Constipation', 'Convulsions', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Employment', 'Enkephalins', 'Euphoria', 'Evaluation', 'Expenditure', 'Fluorine', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Heart Diseases', 'Ice', 'In Vitro', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Legal', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mental Depression', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphine', 'Neuraxis', 'Neuropeptides', 'Opioid', 'Opioid Analgesics', 'Opioid Peptide', 'Opioid Receptor', 'Pain', 'Pain management', 'Patients', 'Penetration', 'Peptides', 'Permeability', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Preparation', 'Productivity', 'Property', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Sedation procedure', 'Societies', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Techniques', 'Ventilatory Depression', 'analog', 'base', 'biophysical properties', 'chronic pain', 'cost', 'experimental study', 'functional group', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'peptidomimetics', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'social', 'tool', 'virtual']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS LAWRENCE,R33,2017,347850,0.25809339802356174
"Altered Microbiome of Chronic Pelvic Pain ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Abundant and diverse bacterial species inhabit the GI tract, constituting the bulk of the GI ""microbiome."" The GI microbiome plays key roles in health and disease processes throughout the body, yet it is unclear whether or how the microbiome mediates the pathogenesis of urologic chronic pelvic pain syndromes (UCPPS). Indeed, UCPPS cause significant morbidity in women and men, but etiologies, diagnostic markers, and therapies are lacking. Here, we present preliminary data demonstrating that UCPPS in women is associated with altered GI microbiota, and specific species are candidates for novel UCPPS biomarkers. Moreover, in clinically relevant murine UCPPS models, symptom-like behaviors can be modulated by manipulating the GI microbiome. We hypothesize that an altered GI microbiome results in circulating bacterial products that act on CNS targets and contribute to UCPPS. This project will use a combination of clinical, translational, and mechanistic studies to define the role of the GI microbiome in UCPPS, and in contrast to voiding dysfunction in the absence of pain. These findings will lead to the development of novel diagnostics and effective probiotic therapies for chronic pelvic pain. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Bacteria residing in the gastrointestinal tract are increasingly understood to shape health and disease processes throughout the body, yet the role of GI bacteria in urologic chronic pelvic pain is unknown.

"Mechanistic Characterization of Pain in Temporomandibular Disorders: Does Pain Centralization Influence Responsiveness to Peripherally Targeted Treatments? Project Summary / Abstract Temporomandibular disorders (TMD), characterized by persistent pain in the cheek and jaw area of the face, affect approximately 1 in 10 women at some point in their lives. TMD treatments primarily focus on peripheral factors; however, many patients with TMD show no signs of peripheral damage. It is now known that many chronic pain conditions, including TMD, involve pain centralization, meaning the pain is generated and maintained by central, rather than peripheral, nervous system processes. There are currently no well accepted means through which centralized TMD pain can be identified in the clinic, and the failure to properly identify these centralized cases means that ineffective peripheral treatments are administered. The specific aims of this project are to 1) Demonstrate that structural, functional, and neurochemical abnormalities exist in TMD that are similar to those reported in other centralized pain conditions, 2) Utilize questionnaire and quantitative sensory testing measures that can accurately detect centralized pain to place patients on a continuum from peripheral to centralized, and show that the brains of centralized, but not peripheral, patients differ significantly from healthy controls, and 3) Determine the measures of centralization and brain morphology, function, and chemistry that predict lack of improvement from a peripherally targeted treatment regimen, to show that centralized TMD patients do not respond as well to treatments that fail to target their pathology. The primary goal of the mentored (K99) portion of the award is to give the candidate the additional training in neuroimaging necessary for him to obtain a tenure track faculty position and successfully run his own independent research program. The K99 phase will take place at the University of Michigan, under the mentorship of Drs. Daniel Clauw, Richard Harris, and David Williams, who are world-renowned experts in centralized pain conditions, pain neuroimaging, and pain psychometrics, respectively. Dr. William Maixner (Duke University), a world- leading expert on TMD, will also serve as a mentor; he will advise the candidate on the clinically relevant aspects of TMD and help the candidate network with other more established TMD researchers. The University of Michigan is ideal for the K99 phase of the project because of the available resources, including faculty who are committed to clinical pain research and mentoring, research-devoted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanners and state-of-the-art pain testing equipment, and ample laboratory and office space at the Chronic Pain and Fatigue Research Center. Upon completing the K99 portion of the award, the candidate will be well suited to make the transition to tenure-track faculty. Project Narrative TMD, which is the most prevalent orofacial pain condition, is a public health problem that negatively impacts the quality of life and function of numerous individuals. This project addresses large gaps in our knowledge of pain centralization in TMD, building off of what is currently known from other pain conditions. Improvement in our understanding of the etiology of TMD and how it influences treatment will be crucial to bring individualized medicine to TMD patients. As a first step, we will determine what central factors make the prevailing peripheral treatments less effective. The results of this project will inform future studies of TMD by pinpointing the most promising variables to measure in longitudinal treatment studies of TMD.",Mechanistic Characterization of Pain in Temporomandibular Disorders: Does Pain Centralization Influence Responsiveness to Peripherally Targeted Treatments?,9295562,K99DE026810,"['Address', 'Affect', 'American', 'Area', 'Award', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Cheek structure', 'Chemistry', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Equipment', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Face', 'Faculty', 'Failure', 'Fatigue', 'Fibromyalgia', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Goals', 'High Prevalence', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Inflammation', 'Injury', 'Insula of Reil', 'Jaw', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Michigan', 'Motor Cortex', 'Naproxen', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Nociception', 'Orofacial Pain', 'Pain', 'Pain Research', 'Paper', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Peripheral Nervous System', 'Persistent pain', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Process', 'Psychometrics', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Questionnaires', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Sample Size', 'Sensory', 'Series', 'Soft Diet', 'Somatosensory Cortex', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Temporomandibular Joint Disorders', 'Temporomandibular joint disorder pain', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Woman', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'brain morphology', 'central pain', 'chronic pain', 'chronic pelvic pain', 'clinically relevant', 'dietary restriction', 'follow-up', 'gray matter', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'neurochemistry', 'neuroimaging', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized medicine', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'skills', 'targeted treatment', 'tenure track']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K99,2017,118260,0.3070687857628379

"Pain Care Quality and Integrated and Complementary Health Approaches DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Improving the quality of pain management is a high priority for the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). VHA has published policy guidance that establishes an innovative stepped care model of pain management (SCM- PM) as the single standard of pain care. The SCM-PM provides the ability to assess and treat pain in primary care settings, while maintaining the capacity to escalate treatment options to include specialized care, if necessary. The model further emphasizes the importance of an individually tailored, integrated, multi-modal approach to pain management that takes into account mental health comorbidities and that incorporates complementary health approaches (CHA) to promote optimal pain control and improved function and quality of life. Despite great strides in promoting this model, pain management performance improvement efforts have been hampered by the limited availability of reliable Pain Care Quality indicators and metrics for key dimensions of pai management in order to promote their utilization in systematic quality improvement efforts. Other than pharmacological and procedure based interventions in which specific, easily retrievable codes are used to document care in the VHA's electronic health record (EHR), it is difficult to capture the broader array of CHA or key aspects of integrated care. These gaps in the EHR and VHA database pose serious barriers to promoting performance improvement efforts including implementation of the SCM-PM. The proposed project extends prior research by our investigator team by using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) to automate a previously validated approach to identify and quantify key dimensions of Pain Care Quality, namely assessment, especially functional assessment, integrated treatment plans, reassessment (outcomes), and patient education from the EHR. Once this automated solution is validated, we intend to apply it to a national sample to test important questions about Pain Care Quality among veterans with comorbid mental health conditions, access to CHA, and the SCM-PM. This innovative solution to identifying key dimensions of healthcare has potential applicability to improving the management of other complex health problems for which existing quality of care indicators and metrics are limited. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will fill a critical gap in the field of pain management by developing a method for measuring of Pain Care Quality in the nation's largest integrated healthcare system, the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). This measure will make it possible to evaluate the implementation of standardized pain care practices in the VHA and to determine what factors (e.g., emphasis on pain management in primary care settings, presence of mental health disorders, use of complementary health approaches such as acupuncture) are related to better quality care. Successful completion of this project has important public health implications as the methodology may be adapted to promote quality care related to other health problems both within and outside VHA.",Pain Care Quality and Integrated and Complementary Health Approaches,9137605,R01AT008448,"['Accounting', 'Acupuncture Therapy', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Award', 'Benchmarking', 'Caring', 'Code', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disadvantaged', 'Disease', 'Education', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Foundations', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hypnosis', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Massage', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Military Personnel', 'Modeling', 'Musculoskeletal Pain', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Pain Measurement', 'Pain Research', 'Pain management', 'Pain quality', 'Patient Education', 'Patient Preferences', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Policies', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Quality Indicator', 'Quality of Care', 'Quality of life', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Self Management', 'Spinal Manipulation', 'Structure', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Veterans', 'Work', 'base', 'evidence base', 'health administration', 'improved', 'improved functioning', 'innovation', 'mindfulness-based stress reduction', 'population based', 'primary care setting', 'shared decision making', 'tool', 'treatment planning']",NCCIH,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,450624,0.22676150977803117
"Development of a new technology for assessing pediatric pain (NTAP)     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Advanced sensing and pattern recognition technologies open new possibilities for automated clinical assessment. Integration of this technology into the clinical arena is thus timely. In particular, there is promise in the use of suh technologies to provide automated assessment of poorly quantifiable clinical variables such as pain. Suboptimal pain assessment is particularly prevalent in children, who often rely on pain assessment by proxy which has been shown repeatedly to poorly correlate with patients' self-reports of pain. A number of observational scales have been developed for assessing pain by proxy. However, even some of the most widely used clinical scales were not developed from a rigorous psychometric perspective. Characterizations of the facial display in pain differ dramatically from each other, and differ substantially from empirical descriptions, leading to dramatically different estimates of pain. Suboptimal pain assessment in children results in delays in adequate pain management and unrelieved pain, which may contribute to significant morbidity and mortality in children. Recognition of this issue has led the World Health Organization to mandate that health entities recognize the rights of children to have their pain alleviated. In order to accomplish this goal, a more reliable and accurate method for pain assessment in this at-risk population is needed. We propose the Development of a Novel Tool for the Assessment of Pediatric Pain (NTAP). The primary aim is to develop and evaluate an automated NTAP tool that utilizes novel computer vision and wearable physiology sensor technologies to estimate pain severity in children. The research team comprises expertise from researchers in computer vision (Bartlett & Littlewort), pediatric clinical research and child healt outcomes (Huang), physiological measurement (el Kaliouby & Picard), and pain assessment in children (Craig). The project will collect a dataset of clinical pain in children following a known pain insult (pancreatitis, and postoperative pain following appendectomy.) The dataset will contain video, electrodermal signals, self-report of pain intensity, elapsed time since pain insult and clinical severity ratings. Initial analysis of collected video data will be performed using our NSF-funded automated facial expression recognition system (CERT: Bartlett & Littlewort), and electrodermal activity (EDA) monitoring and recording will be performed by the wearable, wireless Q Sensor from Affectiva (el Kaliouby & Picard). Machine learning (the development of algorithms for making predictions based on a large set of examples/data) will be employed to develop a system for estimating pain from facial expression and electrodermal activity signals. Evaluation protocols will address validity, reliability, and reproducibility. The proposed NTAP too will provide an automated pain estimation system for pediatric pain in the clinical setting that may improve pain assessment in children and provide a foundation for pain assessment in populations with communication limitations.           Suboptimal pain assessment in children is unfortunately common and results in unrelieved pain, and untreated pain contributes to significant morbidity and mortality in children. The World Health Organization and other health organizations have mandated that health entities recognize the rights of children to have their pain alleviated; in order to accomplish this goal, a more reliable and accurate method for pain assessment in this at-risk population is needed. Emerging technologies with their high potential for standardization and reproducibility, as well as grounding in empirical data through machine learning, are uniquely qualified for clinical pain assessment. We will develop and test an automated tool that utilizes novel computer vision and wearable physiology sensor technologies to estimate pain severity in children.

"Thalamic and Cortical Mechanisms of Itch ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Itch is a common clinical problem that is often difficult to treat. There is currently little understanding of the mechanism used in the CNS to produce itch and this likely contributes to the inability to treat itch. In recent years it have become cler that information related to itch is carried in the periphery and spinal cord by neurons that are also activated by noxious stimuli. This suggests that information necessary for the production of itch in the brain must be extracted from the responses of polysensory neurons in a process called decoding. The proposed studies, will for the first time, use single unit electrophysiologica techniques to determine the areas in the thalamus and cortex where processing of pruriceptive information occurs. The responses of single neurons in the thalamus to various itch-and pain-producing stimuli will be determined. The cortical areas to which pruriceptive thalamic neurons project will be determined using antidromic activation methods. In addition, responses of individual cortical neurons to pruritogens and pain-producing stimuli will be determined. The proposed studies will determine the thalamic nuclei and cortical areas in which processing of information related to itch and pain occur. In addition, using a Machine Learning approach, we will determine the contributions of the intensity and pattern of action potentials within responses to differential coding of itch and pain related responses. The proposed studies will considerably expand our understanding of the CNS mechanisms that produce itch and pain.        RELEVANCE: Very little is known about the neural systems in the thalamus and cerebral cortex that underlie production of the sensation of itch. This lack of understanding likely contributes to the paucity of effective treatments for the majority of types of chronic itch. The proposed studies will determine the areas in the thalamus and cortex in which single neurons process and transmit information about itch and pain.

"PROFILING VULVODYNIA BASED ON NEUROBIOLOGICAL AND BEHAVIORAL ENDOPHENOTYPES     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Vulvodynia (VD) is a chronic pain disorder affecting up to 15% of women and resulting in substantial impairment in health-related quality-of-life. The treatment of the disorder is hampered by a lack of knowledge regarding its neurobiological basis. The proposed study is based on the general hypothesis that like other persistent pain conditions, VD clinical phenotypes are composed of multiple biological endophenotypes, and that meaningful subgroups can be identified. In the current proposal, we plan to extensively phenotype a large sample of VD patients using functional and structural brain imaging together with genetic, physiological, and biological parameters. We hypothesize that central mechanisms (including alterations in the processing/modulation of interoceptive signals from the external genitals) are important determinants of the clinical presentation, and that differences in these brain signatures could play an important role in treatment responsiveness. Such phenotyping has considerable implications for future drug development. We propose to test this hypothesis by accomplishing three specific aims. Aim 1 will characterize alterations in multimodal structural brain and connectivity indices in VD. This will be accomplished by applying complex network analysis and machine learning algorithms to compare resting state [RS] functional and structural (grey and white matter) brain imaging in VD patients to 200 age-matched female healthy controls (HC), 200 patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and 100 patients with interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome which are available from a large brain scan repository at UCLA. Aim 2 will characterize the connectivity indices in VD and identify the association between structural (grey and white matter) and RS alterations with clinical, behavioral and genetic parameters. This will be accomplished by associating structural and RS functional abnormalities identified in Aim 1 with relevant parameters including: clinical (symptom severity, disease duration, co-morbid pain or psychiatric diagnosis), behavioral (pressure pain thresholds), and biological (candidate gene polymorphisms belonging to clusters of genes related to hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal [HPA] axis function, pain, inflammatory, catecholamine, and serotonin signaling systems). Aim 3 will identify VD patient subgroups based on endophenotype clusters by applying advanced mathematical classification techniques to brain, biological, behavioral and clinical endophenotypes. This will be accomplished by combining imaging and other phenotyping data using unsupervised machine learning algorithms and will yield distinct mechanistic subgroups of VD.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Vulvodynia is an understudied, often disabling chronic pain disorder that affects up to 15% of women. Current treatment is limited by lack of knowledge of its causes. In order to improve treatment, we examine the influence of brain structure and functioning genetics, clinical and behavioral factors that may underlie this disorder.

"fMRI-based Biomarkers for Multiple Components of Pain DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Objective biomarkers of pathology exist for a number of diseases, and their development is one of the great advances of modern allopathic medicine. However, objective assessment of pain and other mental health disorders has lagged far behind. Pain cannot be explained by peripheral damage alone; it is caused by a variety of neuropathological processes, which has made it difficult to assess and treat. Currently, the only acceptable way to measure pain is by self-report, which presents a serious barrier to effective research and treatment. Self-reported pain is influenced by nociceptive, affective, and cognitive decision-making processes-and though there are many treatments that can influence reported pain, they likely do so through a heterogeneous set of neurophysiological mechanisms, with different consequences for health and long-term well being. As a result, in spite of a long history of research, current treatments for pain are effective for a minority of individuals, with enormous costs to patients and to society.  Biomarkers for physical pain could dramatically improve diagnosis and treatment, by allowing pain to be characterized on the basis of underlying neuropathology, rather than external symptoms. They could also improve treatment, by allowing interventions to be targeted to type of neuropathology involved.  Biomarkers that can shed light on the brain pathophysiology that causes pain must necessarily rely on direct measures of brain function. In the past several years, major advances in combining functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with machine learning techniques-algorithms for finding predictive patterns in complex datasets-have brought the goal of fMRI-based pain assessment within reach. In preliminary data, we show for the first time that fMRI activity can predict whether an individual person is experiencing high or low physical pain with over 90% sensitivity and specificity. Critically, the biomarker is specific to physical pain when compared with non-painful touch and several classes of salient, affective events. In addition, it achieves this level of accuracy when applied prospectively to new samples, across different scanners and paradigms.  This preliminary success raises a number of issues that must be addressed before fMRI-based biomarkers can be used in large-scale clinical trials and clinical practice, including a) robustnes across laboratories and procedures, b) specificity to body site, modality, and quality of pain, c) responses to analgesic treatment, and d) applicability to spontaneous and acute hypersensitivity/allodynia in clinical populations. Here, we propose to aggregate existing data across a consortium of researchers, allowing more extensive tests of sensitivity and specificity across 13 fMRI studies in healthy individuals and 18 studies in diverse clinical pain populations. In addition, we will conduct five new experiments to address critical aspects of biomarker performance. These data will allow us to develop and validate new, more comprehensive biomarkers that can assess multiple aspects of pain across healthy individuals and chronic pain sufferers. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Pain affects nearly everyone at some time in their lives, with enormous costs to individuals and society. Current treatments for pain are only modestly effective, in large part because pain is created through a complex set of brain processes and can be measured only by patients' self-reports, which presents a serious barrier to effective research and treatment. This project capitalizes on recent breakthroughs in measuring human brain activity and using it to objectively assess the brain processes that underlie pain experience, which could transform the way pain is measured and new treatments are developed.",fMRI-based Biomarkers for Multiple Components of Pain,9039027,R01DA035484,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Algorithms', 'Analgesics', 'Back', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Distress', 'Emotional', 'Event', 'Fright', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Heating', 'Human', 'Hyperalgesia', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Procedures', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medicine', 'Mental disorders', 'Minority', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Naproxen', 'Nerve Pain', 'Nociception', 'Pain', 'Pain Measurement', 'Pain intensity', 'Pain management', 'Pain quality', 'Painless', 'Pathology', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pelvic Pain', 'Performance', 'Peripheral', 'Persons', 'Physicians', 'Placebos', 'Population', 'Process', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Societies', 'Specificity', 'Stimulus', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Touch sensation', 'Translating', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Validation', 'Visceral pain', 'Visual', 'Work', 'allodynia', 'arthritic pain', 'base', 'chronic pain', 'clinical practice', 'cognitive performance', 'cognitive process', 'cost', 'design', 'distraction', 'duloxetine', 'expectation', 'experience', 'improved', 'mental imagery', 'neuropathology', 'neurophysiology', 'painful neuropathy', 'patient population', 'psychologic', 'relating to nervous system', 'remifentanil', 'research study', 'response', 'social', 'spontaneous pain', 'success']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO,R01,2016,581150,0.3283857531305346
"Single Session Pain Catastrophizing Treatment: Comparative Efficacy & Mechanisms ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic low back pain (CLBP) is the most common chronic pain condition and is the second leading cause of disability in the U.S. Pain catastrophizing (PC)--a pattern of negative cognitive-emotional responses to actual or anticipated pain-is significantly associated with the development and maintenance of CLBP as well as disability. PC undermines CLBP treatments, thus contributing to a cycle of treatment futility and wasted expenditure. While Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (pain-CBT) treats PC, group treatment involves 6-10 sessions and thus poses substantial burdens of time, travel, and cost. Therefore, there is a critical need to develop and disseminate efficient, low-cost treatments that specifically reduce PC. Accordingly, we developed a single-session, 2-hour pain-CBT class that solely treats PC (""From Catastrophizing to Recovery""; FCR). Our pilot data revealed large effect sizes for FCR in a chronic pain sample and superior outcomes for medical and psychological across PROMIS domains, as compared to a 'treatment as usual' matched clinic cohort. We propose to conduct a 3-arm comparative efficacy RCT in 231 patients with CLBP comparing: (A) FCR, (B) a health education control, and (C) an 8-session pain-CBT class. Our primary endpoint is PC 3 months post- treatment and our secondary endpoint is PC 6 months post-treatment. We hypothesize that FCR will be superior to active control and non-inferior to the 8-session pain-CBT class for improving PC and pain-related outcomes measured by our PROMIS platform. An innovative aspect of the application is our proposal to develop and validate a brief version Daily PCS measure, and apply the measure with high frequency sampling methods to elucidate the mechanics of PC, and to characterize how positive response to active intervention reduces the influence of PC episodes. Additional novel methods our specialized PROMIS platform; actigraphy for objective sleep and activity measurement; and a customized 'FCR Relaxation Resource' app (on Nexus 7 tablets) to objectively quantify skills use in the FCR group. Our rich dataset will allow for detailed phenotyping of responders / non-responders for both active treatments using machine learning and other advanced analytics. We will use daily ratings across a longitudinal timeframe to characterize how PC changes in response to treatment, as well as the mechanistic influence of PC on pain, sleep, activity, and other variables. Our proposal addresses the NCCAM priorities to (1) ""alleviate chronic pain"", (2) study our mind-body intervention in a ""real-world setting,"" and (3) advance scientific understanding of the mechanisms of PC. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Pain catastrophizing (PC)--a negative cognitive and emotional psychological pattern-is so powerful that it undermines medical treatment and contributes to pain chronicity. This project investigates a promising single- session, low-cost intervention that specifically treats PC.

"Finding Good TEMporal PostOperative pain Signatures (TEMPOS) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over 100 million patients undergo surgery each year in the US, and more than 60% of these patients will suffer from severe acute postoperative pain. Recent data suggest that the time course of pain resolution following surgery is highly variable with over one-third of patients experiencing stable or increasing, rather than decreasing, pain on each day after surgery for at least the first 7 postoperative days. While prior work has focused on linear trajectories of average daily postoperative pain, temporal profiles of pain that measure hourly variations in pain intensity provide a more accurate depiction of the postoperative pain experience than simple linear functions derived from daily pain assessments. The purpose of the proposed research is to elucidate the nature, mechanistic underpinnings, and clinical implications of TEMporal PostOperative pain Signatures (TEMPOS) by applying advanced algorithms to characterize postoperative pain profiles in a prospective cohort. The research will address three Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1: To characterize TEMPOS within the surgical population via state of the art time-series analysis techniques; Specific Aim 2: To identify clinical, biological, psychological, and social (CBPS) mechanisms that contribute to TEMPOS; Specific Aim 3: To determine which TEMPOS optimally predict the development of persistent postsurgical pain. To address these aims, we propose a single-center, prospective observational cohort study of 500 surgical patients. Prior to surgery, sociodemographic variables will be obtained via the electronic medical record (EMR), and patients will complete multiple online inventories for depression, anxiety and catastrophizing. A blood sample will be obtained for genetic studies exploring a variety of pain-related genes, and perioperative surgery and anesthetic details will be extracted from the EMR. Pain outcomes will be assessed at three resolutions: every 6 minutes via a patient-controlled analgesia device interrogation; every four hours via clinical assessments; and every day using the McGill Pain Questionnaire and Brief Pain Inventory. Clinical data on analgesic consumption and patient activity will be used for contextual assessment of pain intensity. Patients will be followed for up to 7 days after surgery, and will again be queried at 6 months after surgery to determine the presence and extent of persistent postsurgical pain. Analyses will first compare existing models, which classify patients as positive, neutral, or negative in pain trajectory slope, with higher-order models offering greater resolution in predicting postoperative pain at discrete time points. We will then perform clustering analyses with respect to the temporal patterns of postoperative pain in order to better define TEMPOS phenotypes. These analyses will be repeated with the clinical, biological, psychological, and social factors listed above to determine how these characteristics drive the mechanisms underlying the observed TEMPOS. Finally, we will use advanced machine learning models to forecast both acute and persistent postoperative pain outcomes with respect to the derived TEMPOS definitions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project examines how postoperative pain scores change with respect to time, and the impact of these temporal patterns on the risk for persistent postsurgical pain. These experiments will first demonstrate that there are many different, complex patterns of pain score changes over time after surgery, rather than the currently-established linear pain trajectories offered in the literature. Next, these experiments will determine how clinical, biological, psychological, and social factors predispose patients to different patterns of pain- analgesia-pain cycles, and finally determine how these timing patterns may influence the development of persistent postsurgical pain.",Finding Good TEMporal PostOperative pain Signatures (TEMPOS),9095377,R01GM114290,"['Abdomen', 'Absence of pain sensation', 'Accounting', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Analgesics', 'Anesthetics', 'Anxiety', 'Biological', 'Blood specimen', 'Brief Pain Inventory', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Demographic Factors', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Educational Background', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Female', 'Genes', 'Genetic study', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Lead', 'Linear Models', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Markov Chains', 'McGill Pain Scale', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Nerve Block', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Opioid', 'Orthopedics', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Pain Measurement', 'Pain intensity', 'Pain management', 'Patient-Controlled Analgesia', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perioperative', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Postoperative Pain', 'Postoperative Period', 'Predisposing Factor', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'Translating', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'cohort', 'discrete time', 'experience', 'genetic variant', 'improved', 'indexing', 'learning strategy', 'low socioeconomic status', 'novel', 'opioid use', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'research study', 'sex', 'signal processing', 'social', 'temporal measurement', 'trend']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,R01,2016,514859,0.3262437769089531
"The Neural Bases of Placebo Effects and their Relation to Regulatory Processes DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Throughout history, placebo effects have been variously considered as tricks played upon the gullible by medical practitioners and powerful but mysterious healing forces. With the advent of direct measurements of human brain function, modern science has shown that placebo effects are neither of these. Rather, they reflect the principled impact of psychological and brain processes on diseases of the brain and body. Placebo effects represent an opportunity-because they provide a window into internal brain processes that influence health- and a challenge, because dozens of clinical trials have now failed to show the superiority of commonly prescribed drugs to placebo, at great cost to health care providers and consumers. This may not be due to the ineffectiveness of the medications, but rather seems to be related to high placebo response rates. Studies of the brain mechanisms underlying placebo effects can provide valuable insight into how the brain actively anticipates, responds to, and learns about active treatments, and the effects of these processes on pain and other aspects of health. In the previous period of this grant, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of placebo and opiate drug effects was instrumental in establishing that placebo treatments impact the neurobiology of pain, including effects on the cortical and subcortical brain regions most closely associated with pain experience. The research also provided some of the first evidence on the interactions in the brain that give rise to placebo effects, and demonstrated the involvement of prefrontal cortical-subcortical-brainstem systems and the endogenous opioid system. The view that emerged is that placebo treatments engage brain systems related to both conceptual thought (explicit beliefs) and learning processes that change the value assigned to treatment cues and pain itself. In this Renewal application, we build on this foundation to address some of the many unanswered questions that need to be addressed before placebo effects are understood, harnessed in therapy, and separated cleanly from drug effects in clinical trials and practice. These include fundamental questions about a) the nature of the ""pain-related"" processes regulated by placebos (are they specific to pain, or general affective processes?) and b) the critical conditions required to create placebo analgesia. Our working hypothesis is that conceptual and learning processes interact, and that both are critical. Learning systems fundamentally shape the motivational value of pain and modulate nociception in subcortical-brainstem systems, and conceptual processes are needed to attribute perceived benefits to the placebo treatment and engage learning. To better understand these systems, we bring to bear new computational machine-learning tools that can identify and test placebo effects on patterns of brain activity specific to pain. We also test the involvement of several neurochemical systems-opioids, dopamine, and oxytocin-and their relationships with specific brain and psychological aspects of the placebo response-generation process. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Though placebo treatments are pharmacologically inert, placebo responses are active neurobiological processes related to the meaning of the treatment and what has been learned about it. Studying them provides a way of understanding the roles of emotion and learning in clinical treatment effects. This project studies the brain mechanisms that underlie placebo analgesia from a multidisciplinary, neural systems-oriented view. It integrates new advances in functional neuroimaging with manipulations of placebo treatment, pharmacology, and hormones to address several fundamental questions about a) the nature of brain processes influenced by placebo treatment, and b) the critical factors underlying the genesis of robust physiological placebo effects.",The Neural Bases of Placebo Effects and their Relation to Regulatory Processes,8974856,R01MH076136,"['Absence of pain sensation', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Alternative Therapies', 'Analgesics', 'Area', 'Belief', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain Stem', 'Brain region', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Cereals', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Competence', 'Concept Formation', 'Conscious', 'Cues', 'Disease', 'Distress', 'Dopamine', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Expectancy', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Generations', 'Grant', 'Healed', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Hormones', 'Human', 'Image Analysis', 'Instruction', 'Insula of Reil', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Naloxone', 'Narcotic Antagonists', 'Nature', 'Neurobiology', 'Nociception', 'Opiates', 'Opioid', 'Oxytocin', 'Pain', 'Pain Nature', 'Pain intensity', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Physiological', 'Placebo Effect', 'Placebos', 'Play', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Psychological Impact', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Science', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Social Perception', 'Specificity', 'System', 'Testing', 'Ursidae Family', 'Work', 'active method', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'classical conditioning', 'clinical practice', 'conditioning', 'cost', 'design', 'endogenous opioids', 'expectation', 'experience', 'healing', 'insight', 'multidisciplinary', 'negative affect', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neurochemistry', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'psychologic', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'social', 'social cognition', 'somatosensory', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO,R01,2016,644555,0.13253611920062394

"Evaluation of Physicochemical Properties Imparted by Fluorinated Peptidomimetics ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The ability to control pain remains a major problem in medicine and society. According to the Institute of Medicine, chronic pain affects about 100 million American adults, more people than those affected by diabetes, heart disease, and cancer combined. It has been estimated that the costs associated with pain in the USA exceeds $600 billion dollars per year, mainly due to medical treatment and lost productivity. While these expenditures are significant, the costs in terms of suffering and quality of life cannot be adequately calculated. Opioid analgesics, such as morphine and its analogs, have been the mainstay for treatment of pain for thousands of years, and currently represent the ""gold-standard"" for pain management. However, clinicians are conservative in prescribing, and patients are conservative in taking, opioids due to valid concerns about adverse effects as well as social and legal issues. As a result, pain is often undertreated, and patients continue to suffer. Endogenous peptides regulate activity within the central nervous system (CNS), and are particularly interesting for the treatment of pain, depression and anxiety. Unfortunately, the clinical usage of peptide-based agents is limited by poor physicochemical (PC) and pharmacokinetic (PK) properties, which restrict penetration into the CNS. Therefore, these peptide-based agents cannot be employed clinically for the treatment of pain. The present proposal aims to develop and employ a new fluorination strategy to rationally improve biophysical properties of peptide-based probes with insufficient drug-like properties, and to allow for these probes to enter the CNS. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Many clinically employed analgesics possess undesired side effects, including convulsions, euphoria, sedation, respiratory depression, constipation, tolerance and dependence. Therefore, clinicians are conservative in prescribing, and patients are conservative in taking, opioids due to valid concerns about adverse effects as well as social and legal issues. As a result, pain is often undertreated, and patients continue to suffer. The present proposal seeks to explore strategies for delivering other small-molecule analgesics with limited side effect profiles into the central nervous system for the treatment of pain.",Evaluation of Physicochemical Properties Imparted by Fluorinated Peptidomimetics,9054825,R21DA036730,"['Adult', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Agonist', 'American', 'Amides', 'Analgesics', 'Anxiety', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Chemical Structure', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Computer Simulation', 'Constipation', 'Convulsions', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Employment', 'Enkephalins', 'Euphoria', 'Evaluation', 'Expenditure', 'Fluorine', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Heart Diseases', 'In Vitro', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Legal', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mental Depression', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphine', 'Neuraxis', 'Neuropeptides', 'Opioid', 'Opioid Analgesics', 'Opioid Peptide', 'Opioid Receptor', 'Pain', 'Pain management', 'Patients', 'Penetration', 'Peptides', 'Permeability', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Preparation', 'Productivity', 'Property', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Sedation procedure', 'Societies', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Techniques', 'Ventilatory Depression', 'analog', 'base', 'biophysical properties', 'chronic pain', 'cost', 'functional group', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'peptidomimetics', 'research study', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'social', 'tool', 'virtual']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS LAWRENCE,R21,2016,185625,0.25809339802356174
"A Necessary Multi-Parametric Evaluation of Vulvodynia DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Vulvodynia is a poorly understood and treated chronic pain disorder that affects an estimated 14 million women and is characterized by significant variation in location, temporal characteristics and clinical course. The contribution o multiple known and unknown components hinders adequate diagnosis and consequently rational choice of treatment. Identification and assessment of these underlying mechanisms would greatly advance the phenotyping of this prevalent disorder, which is a necessary step towards efficacious treatment.  The proposed methods contain three necessary components. The first provides a systemic clinical exam of vulvar mucosa and muscle that is broadened greatly to include consideration of pain processes that are initiated by persistent pain. These include spinally-mediated C-fiber temporal summation, central sensitization and altered pain regulatory mechanisms that include decreased descending inhibition and increased descending facilitation. The methods will also evaluate a general pain amplification mechanism that has been observed in vulvodynia, fibromyalgia and low back pain, and that is likely distinct from spinally-mediated central sensitization.  The second component recognizes the influence of psychological variables that determine distinct subgroups in other disorders and that can influence pain through physiological mechanisms ranging from increased muscle tension to increased sympathetic outflow. The proposal will use our previous experience and current results from a large-scale multi-center study (n=3500) and from an ongoing program project (n=1500) to evaluate important dimensions of psychological distress and cognitive style.  The third component recognizes that adequate analysis of multiple evaluation procedures requires considerable knowledge and expertise in advance statistical methods. The research team includes a statistician, Dr. Eric Bair, who is especially knowledgeable about these types of analyses and experiences including the multi-center study and the program project cited above.  The research team is particularly well prepared to conduct the proposed investigation because of significant experience and expertise in the proposed methods including clinical assessment and treatment of vulvodynia, psychophysical and neurophysiological assessment of pain and sensory function and sophisticated statistical analysis of data from pain assessments. The proposed work is supported by a significant amount of pertinent preliminary data that includes advanced clinical and psychophysical methodology. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Vulvodynia is a disabling chronic pain condition that affects 14 million women in the USA at some point in their lifetime. Little is known about the underlying mechanism and effective treatment of women with vulvodynia. Our team is very experienced in the analysis of complex pain mechanisms and is developing novel tools and classification algorithms to identify the relative contribution of multiple pain mechanisms in individual patients to enhance diagnosis and choice of tailored, mechanistic-based treatments.",A Necessary Multi-Parametric Evaluation of Vulvodynia,9097408,R01HD072983,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Assessment tool', 'Attention', 'Behavioral Mechanisms', 'C Fiber', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Chronic disabling pain', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Cognitive', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Cutaneous', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Disease', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Evaluation', 'Fibromyalgia', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Low Back Pain', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mucous Membrane', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Muscle', 'Muscle Tension', 'Organ', 'Orofacial Pain', 'Pain', 'Pain Disorder', 'Pain Measurement', 'Pain management', 'Patients', 'Persistent pain', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychophysics', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Sensory', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stimulus', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Variant', 'Vestibule', 'Vulva', 'Vulvodynia', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'central sensitization', 'chronic pain', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'individual patient', 'learning strategy', 'neuromechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'pain symptom', 'pressure', 'programs', 'psychologic', 'psychological distress', 'research clinical testing', 'research study', 'response', 'tool', 'treatment choice']",NICHD,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2016,360373,0.2790084453095784
"Mobile Coach for Parents of Children and Adolescents with Chronic Pain PROJECT SUMMARY Mobile Coach for Parents of Children and Adolescents with Chronic Pain Chronic pain – or pain that persists for 3 months or more – is conservatively estimated to affect 20% to 35% of children and adolescents around the world, making it a distressingly common experience. For parents, witnessing their children in pain is often a heart breaking experience. Further, the stress among parents of children with chronic pain poses a significant mental health concern as they experience significantly higher levels of anxiety and depression relative to parents of healthy children. Further, childhood pain brings significant direct and indirect costs from healthcare utilization and lost wages due to taking time off work to care for the child. Yet, few interventions for parents of children and adolescents with pain have been developed to address the unmet needs of this group. Several approaches have been found to be effective at helping adults manage the stress of parenting a child with a chronic health condition, including mindful-based stress reduction (MBSR). However, such time-intensive group interventions are difficult to disseminate, with high attrition rates and limited transportability. We propose a new product which will build upon an established core technology platform: BodiMojo Parent Buddy. The Parent Buddy will draw on evidence-based approaches to deliver an intervention designed to help parents: (1) respond to their child's pain, and (2) to decrease stress through mindfulness-based parenting skills. A major innovation of the proposed product is the development of proprietary Empathic Adaptive Dialog Manager (EADM) based on a theory of emotional appraisal. The EADM technology is designed to provide dynamic interaction and relevant content tailored for parents, based on their coping skills and perceived stress. This approach will deliver real time strategies for coping and communication with a child in pain and self-management parenting skills (e.g., “take deep breaths,” “seek support,” or learn to “let it go.”) The development of an easily disseminated mHealth intervention, Parent Buddy, could bridge an important gap in available parenting support for children who suffer with pain. Furthermore, such a program has the potential to deliver a highly cost-effective program to a wide range of parents. The Phase I proposal will evaluate the feasibility of the Parent Buddy for parents of children (ages 8-12) and adolescents (ages 13-18) years who experience chronic pain, through (1) formative research with parents and health providers; (2) the creation of develop a BodiMojo Parent Buddy prototype; and (3) a 30-day pilot test with 24 parents of children and adolescents with chronic pain and acceptability by health providers. PROJECT NARRATIVE The objective of this proposal is to create a mobile intervention, the BodiMojo Parent Buddy for parents of children and adolescents with chronic pain. Chronic pain affects 20% to 35% of children and brings significant direct and indirect costs from healthcare utilization and lost wages. The Parent Buddy technology delivers relevant, real-time coping skills to help parents respond to their child's pain and decrease stress. If the BodiMojo Parent Buddy is successful, the public health significance will be considerable and may potentially improve child health outcomes across numerous childhood health conditions associated with chronic pain.",Mobile Coach for Parents of Children and Adolescents with Chronic Pain,9253145,R43HD090774,"['Absenteeism', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Anger', 'Anxiety', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Child', 'Child Care', 'Child Rearing', 'Child Support', 'Child health care', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Communication', 'Companions', 'Computers', 'Coping Skills', 'Development', 'Direct Costs', 'E-learning', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Emotional', 'Facilities and Administrative Costs', 'Family', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Heart', 'Home environment', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Parents', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Relaxation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Self Management', 'Side', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Staging', 'Stress', 'Suggestion', 'Technology', 'Teenagers', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Wages', 'Work', 'base', 'chronic pain', 'coping', 'cost effective', 'design', 'digital', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'group intervention', 'handheld mobile device', 'health care service utilization', 'high school', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mHealth', 'mindfulness', 'programs', 'prototype', 'skills', 'stress management', 'theories', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'urban area']",NICHD,"BODIMOJO, INC",R43,2016,224925,0.2206364382663849
"Altered Microbiome of Chronic Pelvic Pain ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Abundant and diverse bacterial species inhabit the GI tract, constituting the bulk of the GI ""microbiome."" The GI microbiome plays key roles in health and disease processes throughout the body, yet it is unclear whether or how the microbiome mediates the pathogenesis of urologic chronic pelvic pain syndromes (UCPPS). Indeed, UCPPS cause significant morbidity in women and men, but etiologies, diagnostic markers, and therapies are lacking. Here, we present preliminary data demonstrating that UCPPS in women is associated with altered GI microbiota, and specific species are candidates for novel UCPPS biomarkers. Moreover, in clinically relevant murine UCPPS models, symptom-like behaviors can be modulated by manipulating the GI microbiome. We hypothesize that an altered GI microbiome results in circulating bacterial products that act on CNS targets and contribute to UCPPS. This project will use a combination of clinical, translational, and mechanistic studies to define the role of the GI microbiome in UCPPS, and in contrast to voiding dysfunction in the absence of pain. These findings will lead to the development of novel diagnostics and effective probiotic therapies for chronic pelvic pain.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Bacteria residing in the gastrointestinal tract are increasingly understood to shape health and disease processes throughout the body, yet the role of GI bacteria in urologic chronic pelvic pain is unknown. Here, we will employ clinical, translational, and mechanistic studies to define the role of GI bacteria in chronic pelvic pain, setting the stage for novel diagnostics and probiotic therapies.            ",Altered Microbiome of Chronic Pelvic Pain,9038126,R01DK103769,"['Adrenal Glands', 'Anxiety', 'Bacteria', 'Behavior', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Chronic Prostatitis', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computer Simulation', 'Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone', 'Cystitis', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Escherichia coli', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Feces', 'Female', 'Functional disorder', 'Gastrointestinal tract structure', 'Genetic study', 'Health', 'Human Microbiome', 'Hypothalamic structure', 'In Vitro', 'Infection', 'Interstitial Cystitis', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental Depression', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mus', 'Neurogenic Inflammation', 'Oral', 'Organ', 'Pain', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Pelvic Pain', 'Pelvis', 'Phenotype', 'Pituitary Gland', 'Play', 'Probiotics', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recombinant DNA', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Shapes', 'Staging', 'Symptoms', 'Tactile', 'Taxon', 'Testing', 'Urinary tract infection', 'Urine', 'Vagina', 'Visceral', 'Wild Type Mouse', 'Woman', 'allodynia', 'chronic pelvic pain', 'clinically relevant', 'comparative', 'computerized tools', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'effective therapy', 'hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis', 'men', 'metagenome', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'paraventricular nucleus', 'patient subsets', 'probiotic therapy', 'public health relevance', 'small molecule', 'urinary', 'urologic']",NIDDK,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2016,551584,0.15045659322042962
"Molecular Epidemiology of Neuropathic Pain in Head and Neck Cancer     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pain is often one of the first signs of head and neck cancer. Head and neck cancer pain may be due to the disease itself (tumor) or as a consequence of therapy. Up to 80% of patients with head and neck cancer report pain during treatment and for some 36%, pain persists beyond treatment. Chronic pain leads to prolonged suffering and reduced quality of life. Neuropathic pain, in particular, remains a major clinical problem since existing analgesics are often ineffective and with serious side-effects. Therefore, the goal of this proposal is to perform genome-wide (730,525SNPs) analyses on 2400 patients with head and neck cancer to determine the molecular/genetic basis of chronic pain, with a specific emphasis on validating the role of genetic mechanisms in the transition from acute pain to chronic pain (nociceptive versus neuropathic). The specific aims are; AIM 1: To perform genetic analyses on 2400 patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck in order to identify potentially novel gene variants associated with the development of chronic pain (neuropathic versus nociceptive). Hypothesis 1: Potentially novel genetic variants that may also serve as therapeutic targets for pain will be identified using a genome-wide SNP scan. AIM 2: To establish a cohort of head and neck cancer patients and determine the independent influence of behavioral, epidemiological, biological, and clinical factors in predicting the development of chronic pain (neuropathic/nociceptive) in these patients. Hypothesis 1: The development of chronic pain will vary by cancer treatment (surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy) and behavioral, epidemiological, and clinical factors. AIM 3: To perform exploratory gene-gene and gene-treatment (type of cancer treatment) interaction analyses that will help identify individuals at highest risk for the development of chronic pain (neuropathic versus nociceptive) on the basis of their genetic risk profiles and treatment (e.g. we will test th risk allele of each SNP for its association with detailed treatment information). Pain will be longitudinally assessed by self-report and quantitative sensory testing along with assessment of behavioral, genetic, clinical and epidemiological factors. We expect that new findings from this proposal will provide insight into the genetic mechanisms of chronic pain development and may provide novel information, which could lead to the development of new therapeutic agents for chronic neuropathic pain.          Our study will provide critical information on the epidemiological, clinical, behavioral, and biological/genetic determinants for the development of chronic pain. Importantly, the genome-wide component of the grant may yield potential novel genes as therapeutic target for neuropathic pain, a disabling condition that is hard to treat with available analgesics.

"Pain Care Quality and Integrated and Complementary Health Approaches DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Improving the quality of pain management is a high priority for the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). VHA has published policy guidance that establishes an innovative stepped care model of pain management (SCM- PM) as the single standard of pain care. The SCM-PM provides the ability to assess and treat pain in primary care settings, while maintaining the capacity to escalate treatment options to include specialized care, if necessary. The model further emphasizes the importance of an individually tailored, integrated, multi-modal approach to pain management that takes into account mental health comorbidities and that incorporates complementary health approaches (CHA) to promote optimal pain control and improved function and quality of life. Despite great strides in promoting this model, pain management performance improvement efforts have been hampered by the limited availability of reliable Pain Care Quality indicators and metrics for key dimensions of pai management in order to promote their utilization in systematic quality improvement efforts. Other than pharmacological and procedure based interventions in which specific, easily retrievable codes are used to document care in the VHA's electronic health record (EHR), it is difficult to capture the broader array of CHA or key aspects of integrated care. These gaps in the EHR and VHA database pose serious barriers to promoting performance improvement efforts including implementation of the SCM-PM. The proposed project extends prior research by our investigator team by using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) to automate a previously validated approach to identify and quantify key dimensions of Pain Care Quality, namely assessment, especially functional assessment, integrated treatment plans, reassessment (outcomes), and patient education from the EHR. Once this automated solution is validated, we intend to apply it to a national sample to test important questions about Pain Care Quality among veterans with comorbid mental health conditions, access to CHA, and the SCM-PM. This innovative solution to identifying key dimensions of healthcare has potential applicability to improving the management of other complex health problems for which existing quality of care indicators and metrics are limited. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will fill a critical gap in the field of pain management by developing a method for measuring of Pain Care Quality in the nation's largest integrated healthcare system, the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). This measure will make it possible to evaluate the implementation of standardized pain care practices in the VHA and to determine what factors (e.g., emphasis on pain management in primary care settings, presence of mental health disorders, use of complementary health approaches such as acupuncture) are related to better quality care.

"Use of Machine Learning Classifiers to Forecast Severe Acute Postoperative Pain F DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Up to 40% of patients undergoing surgery report moderate to severe pain in the postoperative period. The development of a clinical decision support system to allow preoperative intervention for this subset of patients may have a profound impact on their recovery, and potentially their long-term outcome. To accurately forecast severe postoperative pain, we propose the use of machine learning classifiers (MLC's), which are classification algorithms employing a range of novel search and classification methodologies that continually update their performance as new information becomes available. This award will permit the applicant to complete a rigorous didactic curriculum emphasizing classification theory, algorithm evaluation, and development of clinical decision support systems. The nature of these studies place them far outside the realm of traditional medical education. By protecting time for continued mentorship from experts in pain biology and psychology, machine learning, and clinical regional anesthesia, the candidate is well-positioned to become an independently-funded researcher in the field of perioperative pain prediction. In Specific Aim 1 of this study, we will test the hypothesis that Machine Learning Classifiers can accurately predict severe post-operative pain in patients undergoing cancer surgery. This portion of the study will retrospectively test MLC's ability to predict severe pain on post-operatie day 1. An array of MLC's will be tested amongst each other, both with and without the implementation of text analytics. Additionally, all MLC's will be compared against more traditional multiple variable regression techniques such as logistic regression. In Specific Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that the addition of prospectively obtained attributes and instances will permit continued improvement in MLC performance. This prospective portion of the study will examine the role of prospectively-obtained psychometric attributes, as well as the ability of MLC's to learn and adapt their accuracy during continued refinements to surgical and anesthetic care. Up to 40% of patients undergoing surgery will suffer from moderate to severe postoperative pain. While regional anesthetics offer the possibility of a pain-free surgical experience, their use is limited by their inherent risk and cost. This project aims t accurately determine which surgical patients will suffer from severe acute postoperative pain through the use of advanced mathematical algorithms, permitting anesthesiologists and surgeons to efficiently target pain therapies in a cost-effective manner.",Use of Machine Learning Classifiers to Forecast Severe Acute Postoperative Pain F,8901203,K23GM102697,"['Acute', 'Acute Pain', 'Algorithms', 'Analgesics', 'Anesthetics', 'Award', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Beck depression inventory', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biology', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Classification Scheme', 'Client satisfaction', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Conduction Anesthesia', 'Data', 'Decision Trees', 'Demographic Factors', 'Development', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical Education', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Nature', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Pain intensity', 'Pain management', 'Pain-Free', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perioperative', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postoperative Pain', 'Postoperative Period', 'Procedures', 'Psychology', 'Psychometrics', 'Recovery', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Surgeon', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Update', 'base', 'biopsychosocial', 'cancer surgery', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'didactic education', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'mathematical algorithm', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'prospective', 'theories']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,K23,2015,117691,0.2071653624479363
"Development of a new technology for assessing pediatric pain (NTAP)     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Advanced sensing and pattern recognition technologies open new possibilities for automated clinical assessment. Integration of this technology into the clinical arena is thus timely. In particular, there is promise in the use of suh technologies to provide automated assessment of poorly quantifiable clinical variables such as pain. Suboptimal pain assessment is particularly prevalent in children, who often rely on pain assessment by proxy which has been shown repeatedly to poorly correlate with patients' self-reports of pain. A number of observational scales have been developed for assessing pain by proxy. However, even some of the most widely used clinical scales were not developed from a rigorous psychometric perspective. Characterizations of the facial display in pain differ dramatically from each other, and differ substantially from empirical descriptions, leading to dramatically different estimates of pain. Suboptimal pain assessment in children results in delays in adequate pain management and unrelieved pain, which may contribute to significant morbidity and mortality in children. Recognition of this issue has led the World Health Organization to mandate that health entities recognize the rights of children to have their pain alleviated. In order to accomplish this goal, a more reliable and accurate method for pain assessment in this at-risk population is needed. We propose the Development of a Novel Tool for the Assessment of Pediatric Pain (NTAP). The primary aim is to develop and evaluate an automated NTAP tool that utilizes novel computer vision and wearable physiology sensor technologies to estimate pain severity in children. The research team comprises expertise from researchers in computer vision (Bartlett & Littlewort), pediatric clinical research and child healt outcomes (Huang), physiological measurement (el Kaliouby & Picard), and pain assessment in children (Craig). The project will collect a dataset of clinical pain in children following a known pain insult (pancreatitis, and postoperative pain following appendectomy.) The dataset will contain video, electrodermal signals, self-report of pain intensity, elapsed time since pain insult and clinical severity ratings. Initial analysis of collected video data will be performed using our NSF-funded automated facial expression recognition system (CERT: Bartlett & Littlewort), and electrodermal activity (EDA) monitoring and recording will be performed by the wearable, wireless Q Sensor from Affectiva (el Kaliouby & Picard). Machine learning (the development of algorithms for making predictions based on a large set of examples/data) will be employed to develop a system for estimating pain from facial expression and electrodermal activity signals. Evaluation protocols will address validity, reliability, and reproducibility. The proposed NTAP too will provide an automated pain estimation system for pediatric pain in the clinical setting that may improve pain assessment in children and provide a foundation for pain assessment in populations with communication limitations.           Suboptimal pain assessment in children is unfortunately common and results in unrelieved pain, and untreated pain contributes to significant morbidity and mortality in children. The World Health Organization and other health organizations have mandated that health entities recognize the rights of children to have their pain alleviated; in order to accomplish this goal, a more reliable and accurate method for pain assessment in this at-risk population is needed. Emerging technologies with their high potential for standardization and reproducibility, as well as grounding in empirical data through machine learning, are uniquely qualified for clinical pain assessment. We will develop and test an automated tool that utilizes novel computer vision and wearable physiology sensor technologies to estimate pain severity in children.

"Thalamic and Cortical Mechanisms of Itch ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Itch is a common clinical problem that is often difficult to treat. There is currently little understanding of the mechanism used in the CNS to produce itch and this likely contributes to the inability to treat itch. In recent years it have become cler that information related to itch is carried in the periphery and spinal cord by neurons that are also activated by noxious stimuli. This suggests that information necessary for the production of itch in the brain must be extracted from the responses of polysensory neurons in a process called decoding. The proposed studies, will for the first time, use single unit electrophysiologica techniques to determine the areas in the thalamus and cortex where processing of pruriceptive information occurs. The responses of single neurons in the thalamus to various itch-and pain-producing stimuli will be determined. The cortical areas to which pruriceptive thalamic neurons project will be determined using antidromic activation methods. In addition, responses of individual cortical neurons to pruritogens and pain-producing stimuli will be determined. The proposed studies will determine the thalamic nuclei and cortical areas in which processing of information related to itch and pain occur. In addition, using a Machine Learning approach, we will determine the contributions of the intensity and pattern of action potentials within responses to differential coding of itch and pain related responses. The proposed studies will considerably expand our understanding of the CNS mechanisms that produce itch and pain.        RELEVANCE: Very little is known about the neural systems in the thalamus and cerebral cortex that underlie production of the sensation of itch. This lack of understanding likely contributes to the paucity of effective treatments for the majority of types of chronic itch. The proposed studies will determine the areas in the thalamus and cortex in which single neurons process and transmit information about itch and pain.                 Project Narrative/Relevance Very little is known about the neural systems in the thalamus and cerebral cortex that underlie production of the sensation of itch.

"PROFILING VULVODYNIA BASED ON NEUROBIOLOGICAL AND BEHAVIORAL ENDOPHENOTYPES     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Vulvodynia (VD) is a chronic pain disorder affecting up to 15% of women and resulting in substantial impairment in health-related quality-of-life. The treatment of the disorder is hampered by a lack of knowledge regarding its neurobiological basis. The proposed study is based on the general hypothesis that like other persistent pain conditions, VD clinical phenotypes are composed of multiple biological endophenotypes, and that meaningful subgroups can be identified. In the current proposal, we plan to extensively phenotype a large sample of VD patients using functional and structural brain imaging together with genetic, physiological, and biological parameters. We hypothesize that central mechanisms (including alterations in the processing/modulation of interoceptive signals from the external genitals) are important determinants of the clinical presentation, and that differences in these brain signatures could play an important role in treatment responsiveness. Such phenotyping has considerable implications for future drug development. We propose to test this hypothesis by accomplishing three specific aims. Aim 1 will characterize alterations in multimodal structural brain and connectivity indices in VD. This will be accomplished by applying complex network analysis and machine learning algorithms to compare resting state [RS] functional and structural (grey and white matter) brain imaging in VD patients to 200 age-matched female healthy controls (HC), 200 patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and 100 patients with interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome which are available from a large brain scan repository at UCLA. Aim 2 will characterize the connectivity indices in VD and identify the association between structural (grey and white matter) and RS alterations with clinical, behavioral and genetic parameters. This will be accomplished by associating structural and RS functional abnormalities identified in Aim 1 with relevant parameters including: clinical (symptom severity, disease duration, co-morbid pain or psychiatric diagnosis), behavioral (pressure pain thresholds), and biological (candidate gene polymorphisms belonging to clusters of genes related to hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal [HPA] axis function, pain, inflammatory, catecholamine, and serotonin signaling systems). Aim 3 will identify VD patient subgroups based on endophenotype clusters by applying advanced mathematical classification techniques to brain, biological, behavioral and clinical endophenotypes. This will be accomplished by combining imaging and other phenotyping data using unsupervised machine learning algorithms and will yield distinct mechanistic subgroups of VD.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Vulvodynia is an understudied, often disabling chronic pain disorder that affects up to 15% of women. Current treatment is limited by lack of knowledge of its causes. In order to improve treatment, we examine the influence of brain structure and functioning genetics, clinical and behavioral factors that may underlie this disorder.

"Evaluation of Pain in Chronic Pancreatitis using the NAPS2 cohorts DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic pancreatitis (CP) is a progressive and destructive inflammatory disorder of the pancreas. One of the most distressing features is pain, which occurs in ~90% of patients, about half of whom have constant pain, which is associated with increased hospitalization and lower quality of life. Since there are multiple pain etiologies and since no standardized method exists to assess pain in patients with CP, novel approaches are needed to better understand the mechanisms of pain in CP and how it can be appropriately treated. The North American Pancreatitis Study 2 (NAPS2) recruited, phenotyped, and obtained biospecimens from the largest US cohort of pancreatitis, and we have completed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) that includes 1,171 NAPS2 CP cases for whom detailed phenotypic pain data are available. We propose to analyze the NAPS2 data set and biospecimens (DNA, serum, pancreas tissue) to define genetic risks and potential mechanisms of constant pain, identify markers of inflammatory pain, and characterize clinical pain complexes that can guide patient management. We have already identified through the full and a nested GWAS 8 candidate genes for ""constant"" pain. Aim 1 will determine whether these variants are associated with functional changes in genes associated with the constant pain phenotype. Targeted SNP genotyping and gene expression studies will be conducted, including mRNA studies and immunohistochemical staining in human samples. Aim 2 will determine whether c-reactive protein (CRP) or cytokine biomarkers correlate with constant pain. Pain is an indicator of active inflammation, with pro-inflammatory cytokines increasing pain, and anti-inflammatory cytokines diminishing pain. We will test 500 NAPS2 samples for elevated CRP and 10 Th1/Th2 cytokines as biomarkers of inflammation. For positive controls we will include blood samples from 40 acute pancreatitis patients who remain hospitalized for > 4 days for pain or inflammation. Aim 3 will apply machine-learning approaches to test for correlation of genotype, biomarkers, and morphology (obstruction) with quantitative measures of pain pattern, severity, and character as well as SF12 v2 quality of life scores (mental and physical) while controlling for sex, smoking, and alcohol. We anticipate that our machine learning approaches will provide decision rules for the proper classification of pain according to etiology worthy of formal testing in clinical trials. In addition, use of machine learning is anticipated to provide insight into pai mechanism by optimally linking the symptoms signatures, biomarkers, imaging studies, and genetics to complex mechanisms that are seen in patients with painful CP. The goal of this study is to use existing NAPS2 data and biospecimens to construct a framework for future clinical studies that test the effectiveness of personalized pain management based on our machine-learning-predicted etiology rather than symptoms alone. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Chronic pancreatitis is a medical condition that is poorly understood. One of the most distressing factors is severe chronic pain, which develops in about half of all patients for no clear reason. We will carefully analyze all the clinical data, CT scan results, lifestyle factors, and selected genes from the largest study of chronic pancreatitis in th US to better understand the origin of pain in chronic pancreatitis.

"Finding Good TEMporal PostOperative pain Signatures (TEMPOS) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over 100 million patients undergo surgery each year in the US, and more than 60% of these patients will suffer from severe acute postoperative pain. Recent data suggest that the time course of pain resolution following surgery is highly variable with over one-third of patients experiencing stable or increasing, rather than decreasing, pain on each day after surgery for at least the first 7 postoperative days. While prior work has focused on linear trajectories of average daily postoperative pain, temporal profiles of pain that measure hourly variations in pain intensity provide a more accurate depiction of the postoperative pain experience than simple linear functions derived from daily pain assessments. The purpose of the proposed research is to elucidate the nature, mechanistic underpinnings, and clinical implications of TEMporal PostOperative pain Signatures (TEMPOS) by applying advanced algorithms to characterize postoperative pain profiles in a prospective cohort. The research will address three Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1: To characterize TEMPOS within the surgical population via state of the art time-series analysis techniques; Specific Aim 2: To identify clinical, biological, psychological, and social (CBPS) mechanisms that contribute to TEMPOS; Specific Aim 3: To determine which TEMPOS optimally predict the development of persistent postsurgical pain. To address these aims, we propose a single-center, prospective observational cohort study of 500 surgical patients. Prior to surgery, sociodemographic variables will be obtained via the electronic medical record (EMR), and patients will complete multiple online inventories for depression, anxiety and catastrophizing. A blood sample will be obtained for genetic studies exploring a variety of pain-related genes, and perioperative surgery and anesthetic details will be extracted from the EMR. Pain outcomes will be assessed at three resolutions: every 6 minutes via a patient-controlled analgesia device interrogation; every four hours via clinical assessments; and every day using the McGill Pain Questionnaire and Brief Pain Inventory. Clinical data on analgesic consumption and patient activity will be used for contextual assessment of pain intensity. Patients will be followed for up to 7 days after surgery, and will again be queried at 6 months after surgery to determine the presence and extent of persistent postsurgical pain. Analyses will first compare existing models, which classify patients as positive, neutral, or negative in pain trajectory slope, with higher-order models offering greater resolution in predicting postoperative pain at discrete time points. We will then perform clustering analyses with respect to the temporal patterns of postoperative pain in order to better define TEMPOS phenotypes. These analyses will be repeated with the clinical, biological, psychological, and social factors listed above to determine how these characteristics drive the mechanisms underlying the observed TEMPOS. Finally, we will use advanced machine learning models to forecast both acute and persistent postoperative pain outcomes with respect to the derived TEMPOS definitions.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project examines how postoperative pain scores change with respect to time, and the impact of these temporal patterns on the risk for persistent postsurgical pain. These experiments will first demonstrate that there are many different, complex patterns of pain score changes over time after surgery, rather than the currently-established linear pain trajectories offered in the literature. Next, these experiments will determine how clinical, biological, psychological, and social factors predispose patients to different patterns of pain- analgesia-pain cycles, and finally determine how these timing patterns may influence the development of persistent postsurgical pain.            ",Finding Good TEMporal PostOperative pain Signatures (TEMPOS),8863868,R01GM114290,"['Abdomen', 'Absence of pain sensation', 'Accounting', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Analgesics', 'Anesthetics', 'Anxiety', 'Biological', 'Blood specimen', 'Brief Pain Inventory', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Demographic Factors', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Educational Background', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Female', 'Genes', 'Genetic study', 'Hour', 'Lead', 'Linear Models', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Markov Chains', 'McGill Pain Scale', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Nerve Block', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Opioid', 'Orthopedics', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Pain Measurement', 'Pain intensity', 'Pain management', 'Patient-Controlled Analgesia', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perioperative', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Postoperative Pain', 'Postoperative Period', 'Predisposing Factor', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'Translating', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'cohort', 'experience', 'genetic variant', 'improved', 'indexing', 'low socioeconomic status', 'novel', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'sex', 'signal processing', 'social', 'temporal measurement', 'trend']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,R01,2015,491939,0.3262437769089531
"Single Session Pain Catastrophizing Treatment: Comparative Efficacy & Mechanisms ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic low back pain (CLBP) is the most common chronic pain condition and is the second leading cause of disability in the U.S. Pain catastrophizing (PC)--a pattern of negative cognitive-emotional responses to actual or anticipated pain-is significantly associated with the development and maintenance of CLBP as well as disability. PC undermines CLBP treatments, thus contributing to a cycle of treatment futility and wasted expenditure. While Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (pain-CBT) treats PC, group treatment involves 6-10 sessions and thus poses substantial burdens of time, travel, and cost. Therefore, there is a critical need to develop and disseminate efficient, low-cost treatments that specifically reduce PC. Accordingly, we developed a single-session, 2-hour pain-CBT class that solely treats PC (""From Catastrophizing to Recovery""; FCR). Our pilot data revealed large effect sizes for FCR in a chronic pain sample and superior outcomes for medical and psychological across PROMIS domains, as compared to a 'treatment as usual' matched clinic cohort. We propose to conduct a 3-arm comparative efficacy RCT in 231 patients with CLBP comparing: (A) FCR, (B) a health education control, and (C) an 8-session pain-CBT class. Our primary endpoint is PC 3 months post- treatment and our secondary endpoint is PC 6 months post-treatment. We hypothesize that FCR will be superior to active control and non-inferior to the 8-session pain-CBT class for improving PC and pain-related outcomes measured by our PROMIS platform. An innovative aspect of the application is our proposal to develop and validate a brief version Daily PCS measure, and apply the measure with high frequency sampling methods to elucidate the mechanics of PC, and to characterize how positive response to active intervention reduces the influence of PC episodes. Additional novel methods our specialized PROMIS platform; actigraphy for objective sleep and activity measurement; and a customized 'FCR Relaxation Resource' app (on Nexus 7 tablets) to objectively quantify skills use in the FCR group. Our rich dataset will allow for detailed phenotyping of responders / non-responders for both active treatments using machine learning and other advanced analytics. We will use daily ratings across a longitudinal timeframe to characterize how PC changes in response to treatment, as well as the mechanistic influence of PC on pain, sleep, activity, and other variables. Our proposal addresses the NCCAM priorities to (1) ""alleviate chronic pain"", (2) study our mind-body intervention in a ""real-world setting,"" and (3) advance scientific understanding of the mechanisms of PC.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Pain catastrophizing (PC)--a negative cognitive and emotional psychological pattern-is so powerful that it undermines medical treatment and contributes to pain chronicity. This project investigates a promising single- session, low-cost intervention that specifically treats PC.

"fMRI-based Biomarkers for Multiple Components of Pain DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Objective biomarkers of pathology exist for a number of diseases, and their development is one of the great advances of modern allopathic medicine. However, objective assessment of pain and other mental health disorders has lagged far behind. Pain cannot be explained by peripheral damage alone; it is caused by a variety of neuropathological processes, which has made it difficult to assess and treat. Currently, the only acceptable way to measure pain is by self-report, which presents a serious barrier to effective research and treatment. Self-reported pain is influenced by nociceptive, affective, and cognitive decision-making processes-and though there are many treatments that can influence reported pain, they likely do so through a heterogeneous set of neurophysiological mechanisms, with different consequences for health and long-term well being. As a result, in spite of a long history of research, current treatments for pain are effective for a minority of individuals, with enormous costs to patients and to society.  Biomarkers for physical pain could dramatically improve diagnosis and treatment, by allowing pain to be characterized on the basis of underlying neuropathology, rather than external symptoms. They could also improve treatment, by allowing interventions to be targeted to type of neuropathology involved.  Biomarkers that can shed light on the brain pathophysiology that causes pain must necessarily rely on direct measures of brain function. In the past several years, major advances in combining functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with machine learning techniques-algorithms for finding predictive patterns in complex datasets-have brought the goal of fMRI-based pain assessment within reach. In preliminary data, we show for the first time that fMRI activity can predict whether an individual person is experiencing high or low physical pain with over 90% sensitivity and specificity. Critically, the biomarker is specific to physical pain when compared with non-painful touch and several classes of salient, affective events. In addition, it achieves this level of accuracy when applied prospectively to new samples, across different scanners and paradigms.  This preliminary success raises a number of issues that must be addressed before fMRI-based biomarkers can be used in large-scale clinical trials and clinical practice, including a) robustnes across laboratories and procedures, b) specificity to body site, modality, and quality of pain, c) responses to analgesic treatment, and d) applicability to spontaneous and acute hypersensitivity/allodynia in clinical populations. Here, we propose to aggregate existing data across a consortium of researchers, allowing more extensive tests of sensitivity and specificity across 13 fMRI studies in healthy individuals and 18 studies in diverse clinical pain populations. In addition, we will conduct five new experiments to address critical aspects of biomarker performance. These data will allow us to develop and validate new, more comprehensive biomarkers that can assess multiple aspects of pain across healthy individuals and chronic pain sufferers. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Pain affects nearly everyone at some time in their lives, with enormous costs to individuals and society. Current treatments for pain are only modestly effective, in large part because pain is created through a complex set of brain processes and can be measured only by patients' self-reports, which presents a serious barrier to effective research and treatment. This project capitalizes on recent breakthroughs in measuring human brain activity and using it to objectively assess the brain processes that underlie pain experience, which could transform the way pain is measured and new treatments are developed.",fMRI-based Biomarkers for Multiple Components of Pain,8826094,R01DA035484,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Algorithms', 'Analgesics', 'Back', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Distress', 'Emotional', 'Event', 'Fright', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Heating', 'Human', 'Hyperalgesia', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Procedures', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medicine', 'Mental disorders', 'Minority', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Naproxen', 'Nerve Pain', 'Nociception', 'Pain', 'Pain Measurement', 'Pain intensity', 'Pain quality', 'Painless', 'Pathology', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pelvic Pain', 'Performance', 'Peripheral', 'Persons', 'Physicians', 'Placebos', 'Population', 'Process', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Societies', 'Specificity', 'Stimulus', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Touch sensation', 'Translating', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Validation', 'Visceral pain', 'Visual', 'Work', 'allodynia', 'arthritic pain', 'base', 'chronic pain', 'clinical practice', 'cognitive performance', 'cognitive process', 'cost', 'design', 'distraction', 'duloxetine', 'expectation', 'experience', 'improved', 'mental imagery', 'neuropathology', 'neurophysiology', 'painful neuropathy', 'patient population', 'psychologic', 'relating to nervous system', 'remifentanil', 'research study', 'response', 'social', 'spontaneous pain', 'success']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO,R01,2015,578216,0.3283857531305346
"The Neural Bases of Placebo Effects and their Relation to Regulatory Processes DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Throughout history, placebo effects have been variously considered as tricks played upon the gullible by medical practitioners and powerful but mysterious healing forces. With the advent of direct measurements of human brain function, modern science has shown that placebo effects are neither of these. Rather, they reflect the principled impact of psychological and brain processes on diseases of the brain and body. Placebo effects represent an opportunity-because they provide a window into internal brain processes that influence health- and a challenge, because dozens of clinical trials have now failed to show the superiority of commonly prescribed drugs to placebo, at great cost to health care providers and consumers. This may not be due to the ineffectiveness of the medications, but rather seems to be related to high placebo response rates. Studies of the brain mechanisms underlying placebo effects can provide valuable insight into how the brain actively anticipates, responds to, and learns about active treatments, and the effects of these processes on pain and other aspects of health. In the previous period of this grant, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of placebo and opiate drug effects was instrumental in establishing that placebo treatments impact the neurobiology of pain, including effects on the cortical and subcortical brain regions most closely associated with pain experience. The research also provided some of the first evidence on the interactions in the brain that give rise to placebo effects, and demonstrated the involvement of prefrontal cortical-subcortical-brainstem systems and the endogenous opioid system. The view that emerged is that placebo treatments engage brain systems related to both conceptual thought (explicit beliefs) and learning processes that change the value assigned to treatment cues and pain itself. In this Renewal application, we build on this foundation to address some of the many unanswered questions that need to be addressed before placebo effects are understood, harnessed in therapy, and separated cleanly from drug effects in clinical trials and practice. These include fundamental questions about a) the nature of the ""pain-related"" processes regulated by placebos (are they specific to pain, or general affective processes?) and b) the critical conditions required to create placebo analgesia. Our working hypothesis is that conceptual and learning processes interact, and that both are critical. Learning systems fundamentally shape the motivational value of pain and modulate nociception in subcortical-brainstem systems, and conceptual processes are needed to attribute perceived benefits to the placebo treatment and engage learning. To better understand these systems, we bring to bear new computational machine-learning tools that can identify and test placebo effects on patterns of brain activity specific to pain. We also test the involvement of several neurochemical systems-opioids, dopamine, and oxytocin-and their relationships with specific brain and psychological aspects of the placebo response-generation process. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Though placebo treatments are pharmacologically inert, placebo responses are active neurobiological processes related to the meaning of the treatment and what has been learned about it. Studying them provides a way of understanding the roles of emotion and learning in clinical treatment effects. This project studies the brain mechanisms that underlie placebo analgesia from a multidisciplinary, neural systems-oriented view. It integrates new advances in functional neuroimaging with manipulations of placebo treatment, pharmacology, and hormones to address several fundamental questions about a) the nature of brain processes influenced by placebo treatment, and b) the critical factors underlying the genesis of robust physiological placebo effects.",The Neural Bases of Placebo Effects and their Relation to Regulatory Processes,8775699,R01MH076136,"['Absence of pain sensation', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Alternative Therapies', 'Analgesics', 'Area', 'Belief', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain Stem', 'Brain region', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Cereals', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Competence', 'Concept Formation', 'Conscious', 'Cues', 'Disease', 'Distress', 'Dopamine', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Expectancy', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Generations', 'Grant', 'Healed', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Hormones', 'Human', 'Image Analysis', 'Instruction', 'Insula of Reil', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Naloxone', 'Narcotic Antagonists', 'Nature', 'Neurobiology', 'Nociception', 'Opiates', 'Opioid', 'Oxytocin', 'Pain', 'Pain Nature', 'Pain intensity', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Physiological', 'Placebo Effect', 'Placebos', 'Play', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Psychological Impact', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Science', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Social Perception', 'Specificity', 'System', 'Testing', 'Ursidae Family', 'Work', 'active method', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'classical conditioning', 'clinical practice', 'conditioning', 'cost', 'design', 'endogenous opioids', 'expectation', 'experience', 'healing', 'insight', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neurochemistry', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'psychologic', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'social', 'social cognition', 'somatosensory', 'tool', 'treatment effect']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO,R01,2015,648290,0.13253611920062394

"Evaluation of Physicochemical Properties Imparted by Fluorinated Peptidomimetics ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The ability to control pain remains a major problem in medicine and society. According to the Institute of Medicine, chronic pain affects about 100 million American adults, more people than those affected by diabetes, heart disease, and cancer combined. It has been estimated that the costs associated with pain in the USA exceeds $600 billion dollars per year, mainly due to medical treatment and lost productivity. While these expenditures are significant, the costs in terms of suffering and quality of life cannot be adequately calculated. Opioid analgesics, such as morphine and its analogs, have been the mainstay for treatment of pain for thousands of years, and currently represent the ""gold-standard"" for pain management. However, clinicians are conservative in prescribing, and patients are conservative in taking, opioids due to valid concerns about adverse effects as well as social and legal issues. As a result, pain is often undertreated, and patients continue to suffer. Endogenous peptides regulate activity within the central nervous system (CNS), and are particularly interesting for the treatment of pain, depression and anxiety. Unfortunately, the clinical usage of peptide-based agents is limited by poor physicochemical (PC) and pharmacokinetic (PK) properties, which restrict penetration into the CNS. Therefore, these peptide-based agents cannot be employed clinically for the treatment of pain. The present proposal aims to develop and employ a new fluorination strategy to rationally improve biophysical properties of peptide-based probes with insufficient drug-like properties, and to allow for these probes to enter the CNS.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Many clinically employed analgesics possess undesired side effects, including convulsions, euphoria, sedation, respiratory depression, constipation, tolerance and dependence. Therefore, clinicians are conservative in prescribing, and patients are conservative in taking, opioids due to valid concerns about adverse effects as well as social and legal issues. As a result, pain is often undertreated, and patients continue to suffer. The present proposal seeks to explore strategies for delivering other small-molecule analgesics with limited side effect profiles into the central nervous system for the treatment of pain.            ",Evaluation of Physicochemical Properties Imparted by Fluorinated Peptidomimetics,8823966,R21DA036730,"['Adult', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Agonist', 'American', 'Amides', 'Analgesics', 'Anxiety', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Chemical Structure', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Computer Simulation', 'Constipation', 'Convulsions', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Employment', 'Enkephalins', 'Euphoria', 'Evaluation', 'Expenditure', 'Fluorine', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Heart Diseases', 'In Vitro', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Legal', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mental Depression', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphine', 'Neuraxis', 'Neuropeptides', 'Opioid', 'Opioid Analgesics', 'Opioid Peptide', 'Opioid Receptor', 'Pain', 'Pain management', 'Patients', 'Penetration', 'Peptides', 'Permeability', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Preparation', 'Productivity', 'Property', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Sedation procedure', 'Societies', 'Techniques', 'Ventilatory Depression', 'analog', 'base', 'biophysical properties', 'chronic pain', 'cost', 'functional group', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'peptidomimetics', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'social', 'tool', 'virtual']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS LAWRENCE,R21,2015,187500,0.25809339802356174
"A Necessary Multi-Parametric Evaluation of Vulvodynia DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Vulvodynia is a poorly understood and treated chronic pain disorder that affects an estimated 14 million women and is characterized by significant variation in location, temporal characteristics and clinical course. The contribution o multiple known and unknown components hinders adequate diagnosis and consequently rational choice of treatment. Identification and assessment of these underlying mechanisms would greatly advance the phenotyping of this prevalent disorder, which is a necessary step towards efficacious treatment.  The proposed methods contain three necessary components. The first provides a systemic clinical exam of vulvar mucosa and muscle that is broadened greatly to include consideration of pain processes that are initiated by persistent pain. These include spinally-mediated C-fiber temporal summation, central sensitization and altered pain regulatory mechanisms that include decreased descending inhibition and increased descending facilitation. The methods will also evaluate a general pain amplification mechanism that has been observed in vulvodynia, fibromyalgia and low back pain, and that is likely distinct from spinally-mediated central sensitization.  The second component recognizes the influence of psychological variables that determine distinct subgroups in other disorders and that can influence pain through physiological mechanisms ranging from increased muscle tension to increased sympathetic outflow. The proposal will use our previous experience and current results from a large-scale multi-center study (n=3500) and from an ongoing program project (n=1500) to evaluate important dimensions of psychological distress and cognitive style.  The third component recognizes that adequate analysis of multiple evaluation procedures requires considerable knowledge and expertise in advance statistical methods. The research team includes a statistician, Dr. Eric Bair, who is especially knowledgeable about these types of analyses and experiences including the multi-center study and the program project cited above.  The research team is particularly well prepared to conduct the proposed investigation because of significant experience and expertise in the proposed methods including clinical assessment and treatment of vulvodynia, psychophysical and neurophysiological assessment of pain and sensory function and sophisticated statistical analysis of data from pain assessments. The proposed work is supported by a significant amount of pertinent preliminary data that includes advanced clinical and psychophysical methodology. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Vulvodynia is a disabling chronic pain condition that affects 14 million women in the USA at some point in their lifetime. Little is known about the underlying mechanism and effective treatment of women with vulvodynia.

"Molecular Epidemiology of Neuropathic Pain in Head and Neck Cancer     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pain is often one of the first signs of head and neck cancer. Head and neck cancer pain may be due to the disease itself (tumor) or as a consequence of therapy. Up to 80% of patients with head and neck cancer report pain during treatment and for some 36%, pain persists beyond treatment. Chronic pain leads to prolonged suffering and reduced quality of life. Neuropathic pain, in particular, remains a major clinical problem since existing analgesics are often ineffective and with serious side-effects. Therefore, the goal of this proposal is to perform genome-wide (730,525SNPs) analyses on 2400 patients with head and neck cancer to determine the molecular/genetic basis of chronic pain, with a specific emphasis on validating the role of genetic mechanisms in the transition from acute pain to chronic pain (nociceptive versus neuropathic). The specific aims are; AIM 1: To perform genetic analyses on 2400 patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck in order to identify potentially novel gene variants associated with the development of chronic pain (neuropathic versus nociceptive). Hypothesis 1: Potentially novel genetic variants that may also serve as therapeutic targets for pain will be identified using a genome-wide SNP scan. AIM 2: To establish a cohort of head and neck cancer patients and determine the independent influence of behavioral, epidemiological, biological, and clinical factors in predicting the development of chronic pain (neuropathic/nociceptive) in these patients. Hypothesis 1: The development of chronic pain will vary by cancer treatment (surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy) and behavioral, epidemiological, and clinical factors. AIM 3: To perform exploratory gene-gene and gene-treatment (type of cancer treatment) interaction analyses that will help identify individuals at highest risk for the development of chronic pain (neuropathic versus nociceptive) on the basis of their genetic risk profiles and treatment (e.g. we will test th risk allele of each SNP for its association with detailed treatment information). Pain will be longitudinally assessed by self-report and quantitative sensory testing along with assessment of behavioral, genetic, clinical and epidemiological factors. We expect that new findings from this proposal will provide insight into the genetic mechanisms of chronic pain development and may provide novel information, which could lead to the development of new therapeutic agents for chronic neuropathic pain.          Our study will provide critical information on the epidemiological, clinical, behavioral, and biological/genetic determinants for the development of chronic pain. Importantly, the genome-wide component of the grant may yield potential novel genes as therapeutic target for neuropathic pain, a disabling condition that is hard to treat with available analgesics.

"Phenotype Modeling and Outcome Mapping for Pain Management Decision Support DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic pain is a major medical challenge, with the number of Americans seeking treatment exceeding the number affected by diabetes, heart disease, and cancer combined. The treatment of chronic pain is provided almost exclusively in outpatient settings by standard-care providers, allied health professionals, and complementary and alternative medicine practitioners. Treatment is challenging because chronic pain can lead to depression, hopelessness and drug dependence, as well as reductions in creativity, performance, motivation, and treatment compliance. It creates a large financial drain on social services, insurance providers, and family resources. Lacking independent tests for pain intensity, diagnosis depends on the information exchange between the patient and the health professional. Therefore, informatics can play a pivotal role in creating and disseminating evidence-based medicine technologies within the practice of pain management. To provide evidence-based medicine, the reservoirs of evidence-generating medicine must be tapped and used effectively. To enable this, there is a critical need to map 'person in pain' phenotypes to effective treatments and to disseminate that knowledge with decision support tools.  The fundamental hypothesis of this work is that secondary care, pain specialist practices can serve as rich reservoirs of evidence-generating information. To explore this possibility, Michigan State University (MSU) has partnered with Michigan Pain Consultants (MPC) to build a phenotype-to-outcome model for pain treatment, utilizing MPC's rich data repositories of administrative data, proprietary patient survey data, and detailed progress notes from approximately 80,000 visits per year. In this proof-of-concept study, we plan to identify, extract, and organize the informatio content of the MPC data reservoir and then create, test, and validate a model uniting person-in-pain phenotypes with treatments and optimal outcomes. In future work we plan to expand this study to include more areas of pain management and to design decision support tools that will allow enhanced treatment for this largest and most challenging cause of chronic morbidity in the US. Full completion of this project will require the powerful tools of natural language processing, factor analysis, structural equation modeling, active learning methodologies, and clinical decision support software designs.  The most important benefit of this work is that a health IT solution will be derived from, and implemented back within, community clinical medicine. Thus, it represents its stakeholders in the closest manner possible. Secondarily, the database generated by this work will enable future research; the process of working with specialist practices will provide a template for other such initiatives; and, the architecture of the solution will create a model for other community-based informatics solutions. The focused goal of this funding request is to establish a proof-of-concept infrastructure to enable these various endpoints. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to public health and the mission of AHRQ because it aims to apply the principles of evidence-based medicine to pain management decisions in community practice. To accomplish this, the rich data repositories of secondary care pain clinics will be extracted, analyzed, and consolidated for eventual use in a queryable decision support tool that will link symptoms, histories, findings, diagnoses, treatments, and outcomes for the various pain phenotypes typifying chronic pain.",Phenotype Modeling and Outcome Mapping for Pain Management Decision Support,8900248,R21HS022335,[' '],AHRQ,MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY,R21,2015,151853,0.2726612894196989
"Pain Care Quality and Integrated and Complementary Health Approaches     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Improving the quality of pain management is a high priority for the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). VHA has published policy guidance that establishes an innovative stepped care model of pain management (SCM- PM) as the single standard of pain care. The SCM-PM provides the ability to assess and treat pain in primary care settings, while maintaining the capacity to escalate treatment options to include specialized care, if necessary. The model further emphasizes the importance of an individually tailored, integrated, multi-modal approach to pain management that takes into account mental health comorbidities and that incorporates complementary health approaches (CHA) to promote optimal pain control and improved function and quality of life. Despite great strides in promoting this model, pain management performance improvement efforts have been hampered by the limited availability of reliable Pain Care Quality indicators and metrics for key dimensions of pai management in order to promote their utilization in systematic quality improvement efforts. Other than pharmacological and procedure based interventions in which specific, easily retrievable codes are used to document care in the VHA's electronic health record (EHR), it is difficult to capture the broader array of CHA or key aspects of integrated care. These gaps in the EHR and VHA database pose serious barriers to promoting performance improvement efforts including implementation of the SCM-PM. The proposed project extends prior research by our investigator team by using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) to automate a previously validated approach to identify and quantify key dimensions of Pain Care Quality, namely assessment, especially functional assessment, integrated treatment plans, reassessment (outcomes), and patient education from the EHR. Once this automated solution is validated, we intend to apply it to a national sample to test important questions about Pain Care Quality among veterans with comorbid mental health conditions, access to CHA, and the SCM-PM. This innovative solution to identifying key dimensions of healthcare has potential applicability to improving the management of other complex health problems for which existing quality of care indicators and metrics are limited.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will fill a critical gap in the field of pain management by developing a method for measuring of Pain Care Quality in the nation's largest integrated healthcare system, the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). This measure will make it possible to evaluate the implementation of standardized pain care practices in the VHA and to determine what factors (e.g., emphasis on pain management in primary care settings, presence of mental health disorders, use of complementary health approaches such as acupuncture) are related to better quality care. Successful completion of this project has important public health implications as the methodology may be adapted to promote quality care related to other health problems both within and outside VHA.            ",Pain Care Quality and Integrated and Complementary Health Approaches,8757682,R01AT008448,"['Accounting', 'Acupuncture procedure', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Award', 'Benchmarking', 'Caring', 'Code', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disadvantaged', 'Disease', 'Education', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Foundations', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hypnosis', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Massage', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Military Personnel', 'Modeling', 'Musculoskeletal Pain', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Pain Measurement', 'Pain Research', 'Pain management', 'Pain quality', 'Patient Education', 'Patient Preferences', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Policies', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Quality Indicator', 'Quality of Care', 'Quality of life', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Self Management', 'Solutions', 'Spinal Manipulation', 'Structure', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Veterans', 'Work', 'base', 'evidence base', 'health administration', 'improved', 'improved functioning', 'innovation', 'mindfulness-based stress reduction', 'population based', 'primary care setting', 'public health relevance', 'shared decision making', 'tool', 'treatment planning']",NCCIH,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2014,456358,0.22676150977803117
"Use of Machine Learning Classifiers to Forecast Severe Acute Postoperative Pain F     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Up to 40% of patients undergoing surgery report moderate to severe pain in the postoperative period. The development of a clinical decision support system to allow preoperative intervention for this subset of patients may have a profound impact on their recovery, and potentially their long-term outcome. To accurately forecast severe postoperative pain, we propose the use of machine learning classifiers (MLC's), which are classification algorithms employing a range of novel search and classification methodologies that continually update their performance as new information becomes available. This award will permit the applicant to complete a rigorous didactic curriculum emphasizing classification theory, algorithm evaluation, and development of clinical decision support systems. The nature of these studies place them far outside the realm of traditional medical education. By protecting time for continued mentorship from experts in pain biology and psychology, machine learning, and clinical regional anesthesia, the candidate is well-positioned to become an independently-funded researcher in the field of perioperative pain prediction. In Specific Aim 1 of this study, we will test the hypothesis that Machine Learning Classifiers can accurately predict severe post-operative pain in patients undergoing cancer surgery. This portion of the study will retrospectively test MLC's ability to predict severe pain on post-operatie day 1. An array of MLC's will be tested amongst each other, both with and without the implementation of text analytics. Additionally, all MLC's will be compared against more traditional multiple variable regression techniques such as logistic regression. In Specific Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that the addition of prospectively obtained attributes and instances will permit continued improvement in MLC performance. This prospective portion of the study will examine the role of prospectively-obtained psychometric attributes, as well as the ability of MLC's to learn and adapt their accuracy during continued refinements to surgical and anesthetic care.          Up to 40% of patients undergoing surgery will suffer from moderate to severe postoperative pain. While regional anesthetics offer the possibility of a pain-free surgical experience, their use is limited by their inherent risk and cost. This project aims t accurately determine which surgical patients will suffer from severe acute postoperative pain through the use of advanced mathematical algorithms, permitting anesthesiologists and surgeons to efficiently target pain therapies in a cost-effective manner.

"Development of a new technology for assessing pediatric pain (NTAP)     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Advanced sensing and pattern recognition technologies open new possibilities for automated clinical assessment. Integration of this technology into the clinical arena is thus timely. In particular, there is promise in the use of suh technologies to provide automated assessment of poorly quantifiable clinical variables such as pain. Suboptimal pain assessment is particularly prevalent in children, who often rely on pain assessment by proxy which has been shown repeatedly to poorly correlate with patients' self-reports of pain. A number of observational scales have been developed for assessing pain by proxy. However, even some of the most widely used clinical scales were not developed from a rigorous psychometric perspective. Characterizations of the facial display in pain differ dramatically from each other, and differ substantially from empirical descriptions, leading to dramatically different estimates of pain. Suboptimal pain assessment in children results in delays in adequate pain management and unrelieved pain, which may contribute to significant morbidity and mortality in children. Recognition of this issue has led the World Health Organization to mandate that health entities recognize the rights of children to have their pain alleviated. In order to accomplish this goal, a more reliable and accurate method for pain assessment in this at-risk population is needed. We propose the Development of a Novel Tool for the Assessment of Pediatric Pain (NTAP). The primary aim is to develop and evaluate an automated NTAP tool that utilizes novel computer vision and wearable physiology sensor technologies to estimate pain severity in children. The research team comprises expertise from researchers in computer vision (Bartlett & Littlewort), pediatric clinical research and child healt outcomes (Huang), physiological measurement (el Kaliouby & Picard), and pain assessment in children (Craig). The project will collect a dataset of clinical pain in children following a known pain insult (pancreatitis, and postoperative pain following appendectomy.) The dataset will contain video, electrodermal signals, self-report of pain intensity, elapsed time since pain insult and clinical severity ratings. Initial analysis of collected video data will be performed using our NSF-funded automated facial expression recognition system (CERT: Bartlett & Littlewort), and electrodermal activity (EDA) monitoring and recording will be performed by the wearable, wireless Q Sensor from Affectiva (el Kaliouby & Picard). Machine learning (the development of algorithms for making predictions based on a large set of examples/data) will be employed to develop a system for estimating pain from facial expression and electrodermal activity signals. Evaluation protocols will address validity, reliability, and reproducibility. The proposed NTAP too will provide an automated pain estimation system for pediatric pain in the clinical setting that may improve pain assessment in children and provide a foundation for pain assessment in populations with communication limitations.           Suboptimal pain assessment in children is unfortunately common and results in unrelieved pain, and untreated pain contributes to significant morbidity and mortality in children. The World Health Organization and other health organizations have mandated that health entities recognize the rights of children to have their pain alleviated; in order to accomplish this goal, a more reliable and accurate method for pain assessment in this at-risk population is needed. Emerging technologies with their high potential for standardization and reproducibility, as well as grounding in empirical data through machine learning, are uniquely qualified for clinical pain assessment. We will develop and test an automated tool that utilizes novel computer vision and wearable physiology sensor technologies to estimate pain severity in children.

"Identification of Clinically Relevant TMD Subtypes Using Cluster Analysis     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Temporomandibular disorder (TMD) ranks second only to headache as the clinical condition most likely to cause craniofacial pain and dysfunction in the U.S. population. Yet in clinical practice, TMD arguably is the least understood and least effectively managed form of craniofacial pain and dysfunction, with treatment for many patients based on little more than symptomatic care. This discrepancy between the scope of suffering and paucity of effective, evidence-based care can be attributed in part to the fact that TMD is a highly heterogeneous disorder. Numerous different biological mechanisms may contribute to orofacial pain, and the most efficacious treatment is likely to depend on the mechanism that is causing the pain. Moreover, patients who do not meet the clinical criteria for TMD may nevertheless experience subclinical symptoms caused by these same biological mechanisms. Such patients may have elevated risk of developing first-onset TMD, and it may be possible to prevent the development of TMD in these patients by providing them with appropriate preventative therapy. Thus, it would be desirable to identify more homogeneous subgroups among TMD patients and TMD-free controls with comparable symptoms. Fortuitously, this goal can be accomplished without an expensive large-scale study. We have generated a large data set during the course of the Orofacial Pain: Prospective Evaluation and Risk Assessment (OPPERA; U01-DE017018-08) study, which is a large-scale prospective study designed to identify psychological, physiological, and genetic factors contributing to the onset and persistence of TMD. Our proposed study is to reanalyze the data collected in OPPERA using cluster analysis and other machine learning methods to identify clinically relevant subtypes of TMD and TMD-like symptoms. To achieve these goals, we will focus on the following specific aims: 1. Using cluster analysis, we will identify and validate latent constructs underlying pain symptoms that define subgroups of OPPERA participants. We hypothesize that we will identify novel subgroups of patients with TMD that differ in clinically and etiologically meaningful ways. We further hypothesize that TMD-free controls can be grouped into similar clusters. 2. Using discriminant analysis, logistic regression, and more advanced machine learning methods, we will develop rules for classifying TMD patients into subgroups. We hypothesize that we will develop simple classification criteria for the different subgroups of TMD that we identify in Specific Aim 1. 3. Using genetic association analysis, we will identify SNP's that are associated with subtypes of TMD. We hypothesize that we will identify SNP's associated with each subtype of TMD, offering additional biological insight into the mechanisms underlying different forms of TMD. !

"PROFILING VULVODYNIA BASED ON NEUROBIOLOGICAL AND BEHAVIORAL ENDOPHENOTYPES     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Vulvodynia (VD) is a chronic pain disorder affecting up to 15% of women and resulting in substantial impairment in health-related quality-of-life. The treatment of the disorder is hampered by a lack of knowledge regarding its neurobiological basis. The proposed study is based on the general hypothesis that like other persistent pain conditions, VD clinical phenotypes are composed of multiple biological endophenotypes, and that meaningful subgroups can be identified. In the current proposal, we plan to extensively phenotype a large sample of VD patients using functional and structural brain imaging together with genetic, physiological, and biological parameters. We hypothesize that central mechanisms (including alterations in the processing/modulation of interoceptive signals from the external genitals) are important determinants of the clinical presentation, and that differences in these brain signatures could play an important role in treatment responsiveness. Such phenotyping has considerable implications for future drug development. We propose to test this hypothesis by accomplishing three specific aims. Aim 1 will characterize alterations in multimodal structural brain and connectivity indices in VD. This will be accomplished by applying complex network analysis and machine learning algorithms to compare resting state [RS] functional and structural (grey and white matter) brain imaging in VD patients to 200 age-matched female healthy controls (HC), 200 patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and 100 patients with interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome which are available from a large brain scan repository at UCLA. Aim 2 will characterize the connectivity indices in VD and identify the association between structural (grey and white matter) and RS alterations with clinical, behavioral and genetic parameters. This will be accomplished by associating structural and RS functional abnormalities identified in Aim 1 with relevant parameters including: clinical (symptom severity, disease duration, co-morbid pain or psychiatric diagnosis), behavioral (pressure pain thresholds), and biological (candidate gene polymorphisms belonging to clusters of genes related to hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal [HPA] axis function, pain, inflammatory, catecholamine, and serotonin signaling systems). Aim 3 will identify VD patient subgroups based on endophenotype clusters by applying advanced mathematical classification techniques to brain, biological, behavioral and clinical endophenotypes. This will be accomplished by combining imaging and other phenotyping data using unsupervised machine learning algorithms and will yield distinct mechanistic subgroups of VD.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Vulvodynia is an understudied, often disabling chronic pain disorder that affects up to 15% of women. Current treatment is limited by lack of knowledge of its causes. In order to improve treatment, we examine the influence of brain structure and functioning genetics, clinical and behavioral factors that may underlie this disorder.

"Evaluation of Pain in Chronic Pancreatitis using the NAPS2 cohorts  Chronic pancreatitis (CP) is a progressive and destructive inflammatory disorder of the pancreas. One of the most distressing features is pain, which occurs in ~90% of patients, about half of whom have constant pain, which is associated with increased hospitalization and lower quality of life. Since there are multiple pain etiologies and since no standardized method exists to assess pain in patients with CP, novel approaches are needed to better understand the mechanisms of pain in CP and how it can be appropriately treated. The North American Pancreatitis Study 2 (NAPS2) recruited, phenotyped, and obtained biospecimens from the largest US cohort of pancreatitis, and we have completed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) that includes 1,171 NAPS2 CP cases for whom detailed phenotypic pain data are available. We propose to analyze the NAPS2 data set and biospecimens (DNA, serum, pancreas tissue) to define genetic risks and potential mechanisms of constant pain, identify markers of inflammatory pain, and characterize clinical pain complexes that can guide patient management. We have already identified through the full and a nested GWAS 8 candidate genes for ""constant"" pain. Aim 1 will determine whether these variants are associated with functional changes in genes associated with the constant pain phenotype. Targeted SNP genotyping and gene expression studies will be conducted, including mRNA studies and immunohistochemical staining in human samples. Aim 2 will determine whether c-reactive protein (CRP) or cytokine biomarkers correlate with constant pain. Pain is an indicator of active inflammation, with pro-inflammatory cytokines increasing pain, and anti-inflammatory cytokines diminishing pain. We will test 500 NAPS2 samples for elevated CRP and 10 Th1/Th2 cytokines as biomarkers of inflammation. For positive controls we will include blood samples from 40 acute pancreatitis patients who remain hospitalized for > 4 days for pain or inflammation. Aim 3 will apply machine-learning approaches to test for correlation of genotype, biomarkers, and morphology (obstruction) with quantitative measures of pain pattern, severity, and character as well as SF12 v2 quality of life scores (mental and physical) while controlling for sex, smoking, and alcohol. We anticipate that our machine learning approaches will provide decision rules for the proper classification of pain according to etiology worthy of formal testing in clinical trials. In addition, use of machine learning is anticipated to provide insight into pain mechanism by optimally linking the symptoms signatures, biomarkers, imaging studies, and genetics to complex mechanisms that are seen in patients with painful CP. The goal of this study is to use existing NAPS2 data and biospecimens to construct a framework for future clinical studies that test the effectiveness of personalized pain management based on our machine-learning-predicted etiology rather than symptoms alone. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Chronic pancreatitis is a medical condition that is poorly understood. One of the most distressing factors is severe chronic pain, which develops in about half of all patients for no clear reason. We will carefully analyze all the clinical data, CT scan results, lifestyle factors, and selected genes from the largest study of chronic pancreatitis in th US to better understand the origin of pain in chronic pancreatitis.

"fMRI-based Biomarkers for Multiple Components of Pain DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Objective biomarkers of pathology exist for a number of diseases, and their development is one of the great advances of modern allopathic medicine. However, objective assessment of pain and other mental health disorders has lagged far behind. Pain cannot be explained by peripheral damage alone; it is caused by a variety of neuropathological processes, which has made it difficult to assess and treat. Currently, the only acceptable way to measure pain is by self-report, which presents a serious barrier to effective research and treatment. Self-reported pain is influenced by nociceptive, affective, and cognitive decision-making processes-and though there are many treatments that can influence reported pain, they likely do so through a heterogeneous set of neurophysiological mechanisms, with different consequences for health and long-term well being. As a result, in spite of a long history of research, current treatments for pain are effective for a minority of individuals, with enormous costs to patients and to society.  Biomarkers for physical pain could dramatically improve diagnosis and treatment, by allowing pain to be characterized on the basis of underlying neuropathology, rather than external symptoms. They could also improve treatment, by allowing interventions to be targeted to type of neuropathology involved.  Biomarkers that can shed light on the brain pathophysiology that causes pain must necessarily rely on direct measures of brain function. In the past several years, major advances in combining functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with machine learning techniques-algorithms for finding predictive patterns in complex datasets-have brought the goal of fMRI-based pain assessment within reach. In preliminary data, we show for the first time that fMRI activity can predict whether an individual person is experiencing high or low physical pain with over 90% sensitivity and specificity. Critically, the biomarker is specific to physical pain when compared with non-painful touch and several classes of salient, affective events. In addition, it achieves this level of accuracy when applied prospectively to new samples, across different scanners and paradigms.  This preliminary success raises a number of issues that must be addressed before fMRI-based biomarkers can be used in large-scale clinical trials and clinical practice, including a) robustnes across laboratories and procedures, b) specificity to body site, modality, and quality of pain, c) responses to analgesic treatment, and d) applicability to spontaneous and acute hypersensitivity/allodynia in clinical populations. Here, we propose to aggregate existing data across a consortium of researchers, allowing more extensive tests of sensitivity and specificity across 13 fMRI studies in healthy individuals and 18 studies in diverse clinical pain populations. In addition, we will conduct five new experiments to address critical aspects of biomarker performance. These data will allow us to develop and validate new, more comprehensive biomarkers that can assess multiple aspects of pain across healthy individuals and chronic pain sufferers. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Pain affects nearly everyone at some time in their lives, with enormous costs to individuals and society.

"Neuroimaging and Mentoring in Translational Pain Research This is a new application for a Midcareer Investigator Award in Patient-Oriented Research (K24). The applicant, Dr. Sean Mackey, is a physician-scientist, Associate Professor and Division Chief of Pain Medicine at Stanford University. Over the past 5 years, Dr. Mackey has developed expertise in several advanced neuroimaging and psychophysical techniques and applied these to the study of pain. This has led to his developing an independent patient-oriented research (POR) career. This independence is demonstrated by his receiving three independent research awards that use MR techniques to investigate the central neural correlates of pain in patients with chronic pain; he is PI on all three of these awards (one each by NIDA, NINDS and NIDDK). Dr. Mackey has a 10 year history of mentoring junior clinician scientists, postdoctoral fellows, medical students, and graduate students - all performing POR. In addition, Dr. Mackey has active collaborations with many NIH-funded investigators in the area of pain research and its intersection with substance abuse. The current application requests funding (50% salary) for 5 years. This funding will guarantee that the candidate will have at least 75% protected time to conduct his ongoing research and to continue to mentor clinician scientists performing POR. As Dr. Mackey is the Division Chief of Pain Medicine, this award will free time now devoted to administrative and clinical responsibilities to focus more on his research and mentoring activities over the next 5 years. In addition to working on the three ongoing NIH-funded projects, the candidate will obtain additional training in advanced multimodal MR collection and analysis methods (machine learning algorithms, diffusion tensor imaging, genomic imaging) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy imaging. This will allow the candidate to develop new approaches to characterize the central neuroplastic changes that occur in chronic pain and its link with addiction. Given the outstanding resources and collaborations at Stanford, these novel projects are expected to be either renewed or to lead to new directions in pain and substance abuse research, and significantly contribute to our scientific understanding of these disabling conditions. Project Narrative  Chronic pain has a tremendous impact on the individual and society as a whole. We need better understanding of the mechanisms leading to the generation and maintenance of chronic pain conditions.

"The Neural Bases of Placebo Effects and their Relation to Regulatory Processes     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Throughout history, placebo effects have been variously considered as tricks played upon the gullible by medical practitioners and powerful but mysterious healing forces. With the advent of direct measurements of human brain function, modern science has shown that placebo effects are neither of these. Rather, they reflect the principled impact of psychological and brain processes on diseases of the brain and body. Placebo effects represent an opportunity-because they provide a window into internal brain processes that influence health- and a challenge, because dozens of clinical trials have now failed to show the superiority of commonly prescribed drugs to placebo, at great cost to health care providers and consumers. This may not be due to the ineffectiveness of the medications, but rather seems to be related to high placebo response rates. Studies of the brain mechanisms underlying placebo effects can provide valuable insight into how the brain actively anticipates, responds to, and learns about active treatments, and the effects of these processes on pain and other aspects of health. In the previous period of this grant, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of placebo and opiate drug effects was instrumental in establishing that placebo treatments impact the neurobiology of pain, including effects on the cortical and subcortical brain regions most closely associated with pain experience. The research also provided some of the first evidence on the interactions in the brain that give rise to placebo effects, and demonstrated the involvement of prefrontal cortical-subcortical-brainstem systems and the endogenous opioid system. The view that emerged is that placebo treatments engage brain systems related to both conceptual thought (explicit beliefs) and learning processes that change the value assigned to treatment cues and pain itself. In this Renewal application, we build on this foundation to address some of the many unanswered questions that need to be addressed before placebo effects are understood, harnessed in therapy, and separated cleanly from drug effects in clinical trials and practice. These include fundamental questions about a) the nature of the ""pain-related"" processes regulated by placebos (are they specific to pain, or general affective processes?) and b) the critical conditions required to create placebo analgesia. Our working hypothesis is that conceptual and learning processes interact, and that both are critical. Learning systems fundamentally shape the motivational value of pain and modulate nociception in subcortical-brainstem systems, and conceptual processes are needed to attribute perceived benefits to the placebo treatment and engage learning. To better understand these systems, we bring to bear new computational machine-learning tools that can identify and test placebo effects on patterns of brain activity specific to pain. We also test the involvement of several neurochemical systems-opioids, dopamine, and oxytocin-and their relationships with specific brain and psychological aspects of the placebo response-generation process.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Though placebo treatments are pharmacologically inert, placebo responses are active neurobiological processes related to the meaning of the treatment and what has been learned about it. Studying them provides a way of understanding the roles of emotion and learning in clinical treatment effects. This project studies the brain mechanisms that underlie placebo analgesia from a multidisciplinary, neural systems-oriented view. It integrates new advances in functional neuroimaging with manipulations of placebo treatment, pharmacology, and hormones to address several fundamental questions about a) the nature of brain processes influenced by placebo treatment, and b) the critical factors underlying the genesis of robust physiological placebo effects.            ",The Neural Bases of Placebo Effects and their Relation to Regulatory Processes,8608002,R01MH076136,"['Absence of pain sensation', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Alternative Therapies', 'Analgesics', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain Stem', 'Brain region', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Cereals', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Competence', 'Concept Formation', 'Conscious', 'Cues', 'Disease', 'Distress', 'Dopamine', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Expectancy', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Generations', 'Grant', 'Healed', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Hormones', 'Human', 'Image Analysis', 'Instruction', 'Insula of Reil', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Naloxone', 'Narcotic Antagonists', 'Nature', 'Neurobiology', 'Nociception', 'Opiates', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Oxytocin', 'Pain', 'Pain Nature', 'Pain intensity', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Physiological', 'Placebo Effect', 'Placebos', 'Play', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Psychological Impact', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Science', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Social Perception', 'Specificity', 'System', 'Testing', 'Ursidae Family', 'Work', 'active method', 'base', 'classical conditioning', 'clinical practice', 'conditioning', 'cost', 'design', 'endogenous opioids', 'expectation', 'experience', 'healing', 'insight', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neurochemistry', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'psychologic', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'social', 'social cognition', 'somatosensory', 'tool', 'treatment effect']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO,R01,2014,650172,0.13253611920062394
"FMRI-based Decoupling of Conditioning and Belief Effects on Placebo Analgesia     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project aims to differentiate between neural mechanisms that underlie placebo analgesia. Currently, many researchers have concluded that placebo analgesia depends primarily on an individual's belief in a treatment, but alternative evidence suggests that other lower level processes may be involved in analgesia that are dissociable from belief. In the proposed study, belief in a placebo treatment will be manipulated using verbal information within subjects, and both experience and belief will be manipulated using conditioning between subjects. The proposed study will separate the effect of verbal information on placebo analgesia from implicit values learned through experience. Subjects are conditioned to believe that a placebo treatment is effective at reducing pain by first receiving a series of high-temperature painful stimulations, and then receiving a second series of low- temperature painful stimuli after the experimenter applies a placebo cream with instructions that it will reduce pain. Half of the subjects will experience a single conditioning session (short conditioning group), and the other half will have four separate sessions on different days (long conditioning group). For all subjects, the placebo effect will be tested in the scanner after the final conditioning session. During testing, subjects will rate the painfulness of medium-temperature painful stimuli with and without the placebo cream. Subjects will then be informed that the treatment they received was a placebo, and will be asked to again rate the painfulness of medium-temperature painful stimuli with and without the placebo cream. Revealing the nature of the treatment allows comparison of fMRI based pain activity at different levels of belief, and allows comparison across groups of subjects depending on how much conditioning they received. FMRI analysis for this project will focus on dissociating the effects of verbal information and experience among pain related brain regions, and whether the relationship between brain activation, pain, and the belief in a treatment is different depending on the amount of training received. We anticipate that pain-related activity in frontal pain areas, including the orbitofrontal and anterior cingulate cortices, will depend on belief in the treatment and that pain-related activity in lower order areas, such as the periaqueductal gray and rostroventromedial medulla, will depend on the amount of conditioning subjects receive. We will use classification techniques to predict which subjects will continue to experience placebo analgesia after the placebo treatment is revealed. We expect to find that activation in the lower order pain regions predicts whether subjects continue to experience placebo analgesia after the reveal. This research will provide a new way of thinking about analgesia and pain relief. If multiple pathways for placebo analgesia are found, it would suggest novel treatments and methods for improving existing pain relief treatments using conditioning to assist the natural pain relief system in the body.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will examine differences in brain systems governing pain relief. This study will focus on brain regions involved in pain relief, testing whether activity in specific regions predicts the effectiveness of a placebo treatment. The results of this study may suggest various procedures to use placebos to give people pain relief, even if they know the treatment is a placebo.",FMRI-based Decoupling of Conditioning and Belief Effects on Placebo Analgesia,8706840,F31DA034516,"['Absence of pain sensation', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Analgesics', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Conscious', 'Cream', 'Data', 'Drops', 'Effectiveness', 'Elements', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Expectancy', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Habits', 'High temperature of physical object', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Instruction', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Midbrain structure', 'Nature', 'Operating System', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Placebo Effect', 'Placebos', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychological Theory', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Training', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'alternative treatment', 'base', 'cingulate cortex', 'cold temperature', 'conditioning', 'expectation', 'experience', 'frontal lobe', 'habit learning', 'hindbrain', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'midbrain central gray substance', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'vector']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO,F31,2014,39358,0.25740757860203956
"A Necessary Multi-Parametric Evaluation of Vulvodynia     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Vulvodynia is a poorly understood and treated chronic pain disorder that affects an estimated 14 million women and is characterized by significant variation in location, temporal characteristics and clinical course. The contribution o multiple known and unknown components hinders adequate diagnosis and consequently rational choice of treatment. Identification and assessment of these underlying mechanisms would greatly advance the phenotyping of this prevalent disorder, which is a necessary step towards efficacious treatment.  The proposed methods contain three necessary components. The first provides a systemic clinical exam of vulvar mucosa and muscle that is broadened greatly to include consideration of pain processes that are initiated by persistent pain. These include spinally-mediated C-fiber temporal summation, central sensitization and altered pain regulatory mechanisms that include decreased descending inhibition and increased descending facilitation. The methods will also evaluate a general pain amplification mechanism that has been observed in vulvodynia, fibromyalgia and low back pain, and that is likely distinct from spinally-mediated central sensitization.  The second component recognizes the influence of psychological variables that determine distinct subgroups in other disorders and that can influence pain through physiological mechanisms ranging from increased muscle tension to increased sympathetic outflow. The proposal will use our previous experience and current results from a large-scale multi-center study (n=3500) and from an ongoing program project (n=1500) to evaluate important dimensions of psychological distress and cognitive style.  The third component recognizes that adequate analysis of multiple evaluation procedures requires considerable knowledge and expertise in advance statistical methods. The research team includes a statistician, Dr. Eric Bair, who is especially knowledgeable about these types of analyses and experiences including the multi-center study and the program project cited above.  The research team is particularly well prepared to conduct the proposed investigation because of significant experience and expertise in the proposed methods including clinical assessment and treatment of vulvodynia, psychophysical and neurophysiological assessment of pain and sensory function and sophisticated statistical analysis of data from pain assessments. The proposed work is supported by a significant amount of pertinent preliminary data that includes advanced clinical and psychophysical methodology.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Vulvodynia is a disabling chronic pain condition that affects 14 million women in the USA at some point in their lifetime. Little is known about the underlying mechanism and effective treatment of women with vulvodynia. Our team is very experienced in the analysis of complex pain mechanisms and is developing novel tools and classification algorithms to identify the relative contribution of multiple pain mechanisms in individual patients to enhance diagnosis and choice of tailored, mechanistic-based treatments.                ",A Necessary Multi-Parametric Evaluation of Vulvodynia,8698643,R01HD072983,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Behavioral Mechanisms', 'C Fiber', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Chronic disabling pain', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Cognitive', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Cutaneous', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Disease', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Evaluation', 'Fibromyalgia', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Low Back Pain', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mucous Membrane', 'Muscle', 'Muscle Tension', 'Organ', 'Orofacial Pain', 'Pain', 'Pain Disorder', 'Pain Measurement', 'Pain management', 'Patients', 'Persistent pain', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychophysics', 'Publishing', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Sensory', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stimulus', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Variant', 'Vestibule', 'Vulva', 'Vulvodynia', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'central sensitization', 'chronic pain', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'neuromechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'pressure', 'programs', 'psychologic', 'psychological distress', 'public health relevance', 'research clinical testing', 'research study', 'response', 'tool']",NICHD,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2014,359139,0.2790084453095784
"Molecular Epidemiology of Neuropathic Pain in Head and Neck Cancer     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pain is often one of the first signs of head and neck cancer. Head and neck cancer pain may be due to the disease itself (tumor) or as a consequence of therapy. Up to 80% of patients with head and neck cancer report pain during treatment and for some 36%, pain persists beyond treatment. Chronic pain leads to prolonged suffering and reduced quality of life. Neuropathic pain, in particular, remains a major clinical problem since existing analgesics are often ineffective and with serious side-effects. Therefore, the goal of this proposal is to perform genome-wide (730,525SNPs) analyses on 2400 patients with head and neck cancer to determine the molecular/genetic basis of chronic pain, with a specific emphasis on validating the role of genetic mechanisms in the transition from acute pain to chronic pain (nociceptive versus neuropathic). The specific aims are; AIM 1: To perform genetic analyses on 2400 patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck in order to identify potentially novel gene variants associated with the development of chronic pain (neuropathic versus nociceptive). Hypothesis 1: Potentially novel genetic variants that may also serve as therapeutic targets for pain will be identified using a genome-wide SNP scan. AIM 2: To establish a cohort of head and neck cancer patients and determine the independent influence of behavioral, epidemiological, biological, and clinical factors in predicting the development of chronic pain (neuropathic/nociceptive) in these patients. Hypothesis 1: The development of chronic pain will vary by cancer treatment (surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy) and behavioral, epidemiological, and clinical factors. AIM 3: To perform exploratory gene-gene and gene-treatment (type of cancer treatment) interaction analyses that will help identify individuals at highest risk for the development of chronic pain (neuropathic versus nociceptive) on the basis of their genetic risk profiles and treatment (e.g. we will test th risk allele of each SNP for its association with detailed treatment information). Pain will be longitudinally assessed by self-report and quantitative sensory testing along with assessment of behavioral, genetic, clinical and epidemiological factors. We expect that new findings from this proposal will provide insight into the genetic mechanisms of chronic pain development and may provide novel information, which could lead to the development of new therapeutic agents for chronic neuropathic pain.          Our study will provide critical information on the epidemiological, clinical, behavioral, and biological/genetic determinants for the development of chronic pain. Importantly, the genome-wide component of the grant may yield potential novel genes as therapeutic target for neuropathic pain, a disabling condition that is hard to treat with available analgesics.

"Phenotype Modeling and Outcome Mapping for Pain Management Decision Support     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic pain is a major medical challenge, with the number of Americans seeking treatment exceeding the number affected by diabetes, heart disease, and cancer combined. The treatment of chronic pain is provided almost exclusively in outpatient settings by standard-care providers, allied health professionals, and complementary and alternative medicine practitioners. Treatment is challenging because chronic pain can lead to depression, hopelessness and drug dependence, as well as reductions in creativity, performance, motivation, and treatment compliance. It creates a large financial drain on social services, insurance providers, and family resources. Lacking independent tests for pain intensity, diagnosis depends on the information exchange between the patient and the health professional. Therefore, informatics can play a pivotal role in creating and disseminating evidence-based medicine technologies within the practice of pain management. To provide evidence-based medicine, the reservoirs of evidence-generating medicine must be tapped and used effectively. To enable this, there is a critical need to map 'person in pain' phenotypes to effective treatments and to disseminate that knowledge with decision support tools.  The fundamental hypothesis of this work is that secondary care, pain specialist practices can serve as rich reservoirs of evidence-generating information. To explore this possibility, Michigan State University (MSU) has partnered with Michigan Pain Consultants (MPC) to build a phenotype-to-outcome model for pain treatment, utilizing MPC's rich data repositories of administrative data, proprietary patient survey data, and detailed progress notes from approximately 80,000 visits per year. In this proof-of-concept study, we plan to identify, extract, and organize the informatio content of the MPC data reservoir and then create, test, and validate a model uniting person-in-pain phenotypes with treatments and optimal outcomes. In future work we plan to expand this study to include more areas of pain management and to design decision support tools that will allow enhanced treatment for this largest and most challenging cause of chronic morbidity in the US. Full completion of this project will require the powerful tools of natural language processing, factor analysis, structural equation modeling, active learning methodologies, and clinical decision support software designs.  The most important benefit of this work is that a health IT solution will be derived from, and implemented back within, community clinical medicine. Thus, it represents its stakeholders in the closest manner possible. Secondarily, the database generated by this work will enable future research; the process of working with specialist practices will provide a template for other such initiatives; and, the architecture of the solution will create a model for other community-based informatics solutions. The focused goal of this funding request is to establish a proof-of-concept infrastructure to enable these various endpoints.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to public health and the mission of AHRQ because it aims to apply the principles of evidence-based medicine to pain management decisions in community practice. To accomplish this, the rich data repositories of secondary care pain clinics will be extracted, analyzed, and consolidated for eventual use in a queryable decision support tool that will link symptoms, histories, findings, diagnoses, treatments, and outcomes for the various pain phenotypes typifying chronic pain.            ",Phenotype Modeling and Outcome Mapping for Pain Management Decision Support,8769249,R21HS022335,[' '],AHRQ,MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY,R21,2014,147203,0.2726612894196989
"Use of Machine Learning Classifiers to Forecast Severe Acute Postoperative Pain F     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Up to 40% of patients undergoing surgery report moderate to severe pain in the postoperative period. The development of a clinical decision support system to allow preoperative intervention for this subset of patients may have a profound impact on their recovery, and potentially their long-term outcome. To accurately forecast severe postoperative pain, we propose the use of machine learning classifiers (MLC's), which are classification algorithms employing a range of novel search and classification methodologies that continually update their performance as new information becomes available. This award will permit the applicant to complete a rigorous didactic curriculum emphasizing classification theory, algorithm evaluation, and development of clinical decision support systems. The nature of these studies place them far outside the realm of traditional medical education. By protecting time for continued mentorship from experts in pain biology and psychology, machine learning, and clinical regional anesthesia, the candidate is well-positioned to become an independently-funded researcher in the field of perioperative pain prediction. In Specific Aim 1 of this study, we will test the hypothesis that Machine Learning Classifiers can accurately predict severe post-operative pain in patients undergoing cancer surgery. This portion of the study will retrospectively test MLC's ability to predict severe pain on post-operatie day 1. An array of MLC's will be tested amongst each other, both with and without the implementation of text analytics. Additionally, all MLC's will be compared against more traditional multiple variable regression techniques such as logistic regression. In Specific Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that the addition of prospectively obtained attributes and instances will permit continued improvement in MLC performance. This prospective portion of the study will examine the role of prospectively-obtained psychometric attributes, as well as the ability of MLC's to learn and adapt their accuracy during continued refinements to surgical and anesthetic care.          Up to 40% of patients undergoing surgery will suffer from moderate to severe postoperative pain. While regional anesthetics offer the possibility of a pain-free surgical experience, their use is limited by their inherent risk and cost. This project aims t accurately determine which surgical patients will suffer from severe acute postoperative pain through the use of advanced mathematical algorithms, permitting anesthesiologists and surgeons to efficiently target pain therapies in a cost-effective manner.

"Development of a new technology for assessing pediatric pain (NTAP)     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Advanced sensing and pattern recognition technologies open new possibilities for automated clinical assessment. Integration of this technology into the clinical arena is thus timely. In particular, there is promise in the use of suh technologies to provide automated assessment of poorly quantifiable clinical variables such as pain. Suboptimal pain assessment is particularly prevalent in children, who often rely on pain assessment by proxy which has been shown repeatedly to poorly correlate with patients' self-reports of pain. A number of observational scales have been developed for assessing pain by proxy. However, even some of the most widely used clinical scales were not developed from a rigorous psychometric perspective. Characterizations of the facial display in pain differ dramatically from each other, and differ substantially from empirical descriptions, leading to dramatically different estimates of pain. Suboptimal pain assessment in children results in delays in adequate pain management and unrelieved pain, which may contribute to significant morbidity and mortality in children. Recognition of this issue has led the World Health Organization to mandate that health entities recognize the rights of children to have their pain alleviated. In order to accomplish this goal, a more reliable and accurate method for pain assessment in this at-risk population is needed. We propose the Development of a Novel Tool for the Assessment of Pediatric Pain (NTAP). The primary aim is to develop and evaluate an automated NTAP tool that utilizes novel computer vision and wearable physiology sensor technologies to estimate pain severity in children. The research team comprises expertise from researchers in computer vision (Bartlett & Littlewort), pediatric clinical research and child healt outcomes (Huang), physiological measurement (el Kaliouby & Picard), and pain assessment in children (Craig). The project will collect a dataset of clinical pain in children following a known pain insult (pancreatitis, and postoperative pain following appendectomy.) The dataset will contain video, electrodermal signals, self-report of pain intensity, elapsed time since pain insult and clinical severity ratings. Initial analysis of collected video data will be performed using our NSF-funded automated facial expression recognition system (CERT: Bartlett & Littlewort), and electrodermal activity (EDA) monitoring and recording will be performed by the wearable, wireless Q Sensor from Affectiva (el Kaliouby & Picard). Machine learning (the development of algorithms for making predictions based on a large set of examples/data) will be employed to develop a system for estimating pain from facial expression and electrodermal activity signals. Evaluation protocols will address validity, reliability, and reproducibility. The proposed NTAP too will provide an automated pain estimation system for pediatric pain in the clinical setting that may improve pain assessment in children and provide a foundation for pain assessment in populations with communication limitations.           Suboptimal pain assessment in children is unfortunately common and results in unrelieved pain, and untreated pain contributes to significant morbidity and mortality in children. The World Health Organization and other health organizations have mandated that health entities recognize the rights of children to have their pain alleviated; in order to accomplish this goal, a more reliable and accurate method for pain assessment in this at-risk population is needed.

"Identification of Clinically Relevant TMD Subtypes Using Cluster Analysis     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Temporomandibular disorder (TMD) ranks second only to headache as the clinical condition most likely to cause craniofacial pain and dysfunction in the U.S. population. Yet in clinical practice, TMD arguably is the least understood and least effectively managed form of craniofacial pain and dysfunction, with treatment for many patients based on little more than symptomatic care. This discrepancy between the scope of suffering and paucity of effective, evidence-based care can be attributed in part to the fact that TMD is a highly heterogeneous disorder. Numerous different biological mechanisms may contribute to orofacial pain, and the most efficacious treatment is likely to depend on the mechanism that is causing the pain. Moreover, patients who do not meet the clinical criteria for TMD may nevertheless experience subclinical symptoms caused by these same biological mechanisms. Such patients may have elevated risk of developing first-onset TMD, and it may be possible to prevent the development of TMD in these patients by providing them with appropriate preventative therapy. Thus, it would be desirable to identify more homogeneous subgroups among TMD patients and TMD-free controls with comparable symptoms. Fortuitously, this goal can be accomplished without an expensive large-scale study. We have generated a large data set during the course of the Orofacial Pain: Prospective Evaluation and Risk Assessment (OPPERA; U01-DE017018-08) study, which is a large-scale prospective study designed to identify psychological, physiological, and genetic factors contributing to the onset and persistence of TMD. Our proposed study is to reanalyze the data collected in OPPERA using cluster analysis and other machine learning methods to identify clinically relevant subtypes of TMD and TMD-like symptoms. To achieve these goals, we will focus on the following specific aims: 1. Using cluster analysis, we will identify and validate latent constructs underlying pain symptoms that define subgroups of OPPERA participants. We hypothesize that we will identify novel subgroups of patients with TMD that differ in clinically and etiologically meaningful ways. We further hypothesize that TMD-free controls can be grouped into similar clusters. 2. Using discriminant analysis, logistic regression, and more advanced machine learning methods, we will develop rules for classifying TMD patients into subgroups. We hypothesize that we will develop simple classification criteria for the different subgroups of TMD that we identify in Specific Aim 1. 3. Using genetic association analysis, we will identify SNP's that are associated with subtypes of TMD. We hypothesize that we will identify SNP's associated with each subtype of TMD, offering additional biological insight into the mechanisms underlying different forms of TMD. !         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Temporomandibular disorder (TMD) ranks second only to headache as the clinical condition most likely to cause craniofacial pain and dysfunction in the U.S. population, yet TMD arguably is the least understood and least effectively managed form of craniofacial pain.

"PROFILING VULVODYNIA BASED ON NEUROBIOLOGICAL AND BEHAVIORAL ENDOPHENOTYPES     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Vulvodynia (VD) is a chronic pain disorder affecting up to 15% of women and resulting in substantial impairment in health-related quality-of-life. The treatment of the disorder is hampered by a lack of knowledge regarding its neurobiological basis. The proposed study is based on the general hypothesis that like other persistent pain conditions, VD clinical phenotypes are composed of multiple biological endophenotypes, and that meaningful subgroups can be identified. In the current proposal, we plan to extensively phenotype a large sample of VD patients using functional and structural brain imaging together with genetic, physiological, and biological parameters. We hypothesize that central mechanisms (including alterations in the processing/modulation of interoceptive signals from the external genitals) are important determinants of the clinical presentation, and that differences in these brain signatures could play an important role in treatment responsiveness. Such phenotyping has considerable implications for future drug development. We propose to test this hypothesis by accomplishing three specific aims. Aim 1 will characterize alterations in multimodal structural brain and connectivity indices in VD. This will be accomplished by applying complex network analysis and machine learning algorithms to compare resting state [RS] functional and structural (grey and white matter) brain imaging in VD patients to 200 age-matched female healthy controls (HC), 200 patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and 100 patients with interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome which are available from a large brain scan repository at UCLA. Aim 2 will characterize the connectivity indices in VD and identify the association between structural (grey and white matter) and RS alterations with clinical, behavioral and genetic parameters. This will be accomplished by associating structural and RS functional abnormalities identified in Aim 1 with relevant parameters including: clinical (symptom severity, disease duration, co-morbid pain or psychiatric diagnosis), behavioral (pressure pain thresholds), and biological (candidate gene polymorphisms belonging to clusters of genes related to hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal [HPA] axis function, pain, inflammatory, catecholamine, and serotonin signaling systems). Aim 3 will identify VD patient subgroups based on endophenotype clusters by applying advanced mathematical classification techniques to brain, biological, behavioral and clinical endophenotypes. This will be accomplished by combining imaging and other phenotyping data using unsupervised machine learning algorithms and will yield distinct mechanistic subgroups of VD.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Vulvodynia is an understudied, often disabling chronic pain disorder that affects up to 15% of women.

"fMRI-based Biomarkers for Multiple Components of Pain     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Objective biomarkers of pathology exist for a number of diseases, and their development is one of the great advances of modern allopathic medicine. However, objective assessment of pain and other mental health disorders has lagged far behind. Pain cannot be explained by peripheral damage alone; it is caused by a variety of neuropathological processes, which has made it difficult to assess and treat. Currently, the only acceptable way to measure pain is by self-report, which presents a serious barrier to effective research and treatment. Self-reported pain is influenced by nociceptive, affective, and cognitive decision-making processes-and though there are many treatments that can influence reported pain, they likely do so through a heterogeneous set of neurophysiological mechanisms, with different consequences for health and long-term well being. As a result, in spite of a long history of research, current treatments for pain are effective for a minority of individuals, with enormous costs to patients and to society.  Biomarkers for physical pain could dramatically improve diagnosis and treatment, by allowing pain to be characterized on the basis of underlying neuropathology, rather than external symptoms. They could also improve treatment, by allowing interventions to be targeted to type of neuropathology involved.  Biomarkers that can shed light on the brain pathophysiology that causes pain must necessarily rely on direct measures of brain function. In the past several years, major advances in combining functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with machine learning techniques-algorithms for finding predictive patterns in complex datasets-have brought the goal of fMRI-based pain assessment within reach. In preliminary data, we show for the first time that fMRI activity can predict whether an individual person is experiencing high or low physical pain with over 90% sensitivity and specificity. Critically, the biomarker is specific to physical pain when compared with non-painful touch and several classes of salient, affective events. In addition, it achieves this level of accuracy when applied prospectively to new samples, across different scanners and paradigms.  This preliminary success raises a number of issues that must be addressed before fMRI-based biomarkers can be used in large-scale clinical trials and clinical practice, including a) robustnes across laboratories and procedures, b) specificity to body site, modality, and quality of pain, c) responses to analgesic treatment, and d) applicability to spontaneous and acute hypersensitivity/allodynia in clinical populations. Here, we propose to aggregate existing data across a consortium of researchers, allowing more extensive tests of sensitivity and specificity across 13 fMRI studies in healthy individuals and 18 studies in diverse clinical pain populations. In addition, we will conduct five new experiments to address critical aspects of biomarker performance. These data will allow us to develop and validate new, more comprehensive biomarkers that can assess multiple aspects of pain across healthy individuals and chronic pain sufferers.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Pain affects nearly everyone at some time in their lives, with enormous costs to individuals and society. Current treatments for pain are only modestly effective, in large part because pain is created through a complex set of brain processes and can be measured only by patients' self-reports, which presents a serious barrier to effective research and treatment. This project capitalizes on recent breakthroughs in measuring human brain activity and using it to objectively assess the brain processes that underlie pain experience, which could transform the way pain is measured and new treatments are developed.                ",fMRI-based Biomarkers for Multiple Components of Pain,8481081,R01DA035484,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Algorithms', 'Analgesics', 'Arthritis', 'Back', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Distress', 'Emotional', 'Event', 'Fright', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Heating', 'Human', 'Hyperalgesia', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Procedures', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medicine', 'Mental disorders', 'Minority', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Naproxen', 'Nerve Pain', 'Nociception', 'Pain', 'Pain Measurement', 'Pain intensity', 'Pain quality', 'Painless', 'Pathology', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pelvis', 'Performance', 'Peripheral', 'Persons', 'Physicians', 'Placebos', 'Population', 'Process', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Societies', 'Specificity', 'Stimulus', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Touch sensation', 'Translating', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Validation', 'Visceral', 'Visual', 'Work', 'allodynia', 'base', 'chronic pain', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'design', 'distraction', 'duloxetine', 'expectation', 'experience', 'improved', 'mental imagery', 'neuropathology', 'neurophysiology', 'painful neuropathy', 'patient population', 'psychologic', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'remifentanil', 'research study', 'response', 'social', 'spontaneous pain', 'success']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO,R01,2013,650387,0.3283857531305346
"Neuroimaging and Mentoring in Translational Pain Research This is a new application for a Midcareer Investigator Award in Patient-Oriented Research (K24). The applicant, Dr. Sean Mackey, is a physician-scientist, Associate Professor and Division Chief of Pain Medicine at Stanford University. Over the past 5 years, Dr. Mackey has developed expertise in several advanced neuroimaging and psychophysical techniques and applied these to the study of pain. This has led to his developing an independent patient-oriented research (POR) career. This independence is demonstrated by his receiving three independent research awards that use MR techniques to investigate the central neural correlates of pain in patients with chronic pain; he is PI on all three of these awards (one each by NIDA, NINDS and NIDDK). Dr. Mackey has a 10 year history of mentoring junior clinician scientists, postdoctoral fellows, medical students, and graduate students - all performing POR. In addition, Dr. Mackey has active collaborations with many NIH-funded investigators in the area of pain research and its intersection with substance abuse. The current application requests funding (50% salary) for 5 years. This funding will guarantee that the candidate will have at least 75% protected time to conduct his ongoing research and to continue to mentor clinician scientists performing POR. As Dr. Mackey is the Division Chief of Pain Medicine, this award will free time now devoted to administrative and clinical responsibilities to focus more on his research and mentoring activities over the next 5 years.

"The Neural Bases of Placebo Effects and their Relation to Regulatory Processes     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Throughout history, placebo effects have been variously considered as tricks played upon the gullible by medical practitioners and powerful but mysterious healing forces. With the advent of direct measurements of human brain function, modern science has shown that placebo effects are neither of these. Rather, they reflect the principled impact of psychological and brain processes on diseases of the brain and body. Placebo effects represent an opportunity-because they provide a window into internal brain processes that influence health- and a challenge, because dozens of clinical trials have now failed to show the superiority of commonly prescribed drugs to placebo, at great cost to health care providers and consumers. This may not be due to the ineffectiveness of the medications, but rather seems to be related to high placebo response rates. Studies of the brain mechanisms underlying placebo effects can provide valuable insight into how the brain actively anticipates, responds to, and learns about active treatments, and the effects of these processes on pain and other aspects of health. In the previous period of this grant, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of placebo and opiate drug effects was instrumental in establishing that placebo treatments impact the neurobiology of pain, including effects on the cortical and subcortical brain regions most closely associated with pain experience. The research also provided some of the first evidence on the interactions in the brain that give rise to placebo effects, and demonstrated the involvement of prefrontal cortical-subcortical-brainstem systems and the endogenous opioid system. The view that emerged is that placebo treatments engage brain systems related to both conceptual thought (explicit beliefs) and learning processes that change the value assigned to treatment cues and pain itself. In this Renewal application, we build on this foundation to address some of the many unanswered questions that need to be addressed before placebo effects are understood, harnessed in therapy, and separated cleanly from drug effects in clinical trials and practice. These include fundamental questions about a) the nature of the ""pain-related"" processes regulated by placebos (are they specific to pain, or general affective processes?) and b) the critical conditions required to create placebo analgesia. Our working hypothesis is that conceptual and learning processes interact, and that both are critical. Learning systems fundamentally shape the motivational value of pain and modulate nociception in subcortical-brainstem systems, and conceptual processes are needed to attribute perceived benefits to the placebo treatment and engage learning. To better understand these systems, we bring to bear new computational machine-learning tools that can identify and test placebo effects on patterns of brain activity specific to pain. We also test the involvement of several neurochemical systems-opioids, dopamine, and oxytocin-and their relationships with specific brain and psychological aspects of the placebo response-generation process.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Though placebo treatments are pharmacologically inert, placebo responses are active neurobiological processes related to the meaning of the treatment and what has been learned about it. Studying them provides a way of understanding the roles of emotion and learning in clinical treatment effects. This project studies the brain mechanisms that underlie placebo analgesia from a multidisciplinary, neural systems-oriented view. It integrates new advances in functional neuroimaging with manipulations of placebo treatment, pharmacology, and hormones to address several fundamental questions about a) the nature of brain processes influenced by placebo treatment, and b) the critical factors underlying the genesis of robust physiological placebo effects.            ",The Neural Bases of Placebo Effects and their Relation to Regulatory Processes,8438012,R01MH076136,"['Absence of pain sensation', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Alternative Therapies', 'Analgesics', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain Stem', 'Brain region', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Cereals', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Competence', 'Concept Formation', 'Conscious', 'Cues', 'Disease', 'Distress', 'Dopamine', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Expectancy', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Generations', 'Grant', 'Healed', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Hormones', 'Human', 'Image Analysis', 'Instruction', 'Insula of Reil', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Naloxone', 'Narcotic Antagonists', 'Nature', 'Neurobiology', 'Nociception', 'Opiates', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Oxytocin', 'Pain', 'Pain Nature', 'Pain intensity', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Physiological', 'Placebo Effect', 'Placebos', 'Play', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Psychological Impact', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Science', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Social Perception', 'Specificity', 'System', 'Testing', 'Ursidae Family', 'Work', 'active method', 'base', 'classical conditioning', 'clinical practice', 'conditioning', 'cost', 'design', 'endogenous opioids', 'expectation', 'experience', 'healing', 'insight', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neurochemistry', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'psychologic', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'social', 'social cognition', 'somatosensory', 'tool', 'treatment effect']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO,R01,2013,748295,0.13253611920062394
"FMRI-based Decoupling of Conditioning and Belief Effects on Placebo Analgesia     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project aims to differentiate between neural mechanisms that underlie placebo analgesia. Currently, many researchers have concluded that placebo analgesia depends primarily on an individual's belief in a treatment, but alternative evidence suggests that other lower level processes may be involved in analgesia that are dissociable from belief. In the proposed study, belief in a placebo treatment will be manipulated using verbal information within subjects, and both experience and belief will be manipulated using conditioning between subjects. The proposed study will separate the effect of verbal information on placebo analgesia from implicit values learned through experience. Subjects are conditioned to believe that a placebo treatment is effective at reducing pain by first receiving a series of high-temperature painful stimulations, and then receiving a second series of low- temperature painful stimuli after the experimenter applies a placebo cream with instructions that it will reduce pain. Half of the subjects will experience a single conditioning session (short conditioning group), and the other half will have four separate sessions on different days (long conditioning group). For all subjects, the placebo effect will be tested in the scanner after the final conditioning session. During testing, subjects will rate the painfulness of medium-temperature painful stimuli with and without the placebo cream. Subjects will then be informed that the treatment they received was a placebo, and will be asked to again rate the painfulness of medium-temperature painful stimuli with and without the placebo cream. Revealing the nature of the treatment allows comparison of fMRI based pain activity at different levels of belief, and allows comparison across groups of subjects depending on how much conditioning they received. FMRI analysis for this project will focus on dissociating the effects of verbal information and experience among pain related brain regions, and whether the relationship between brain activation, pain, and the belief in a treatment is different depending on the amount of training received. We anticipate that pain-related activity in frontal pain areas, including the orbitofrontal and anterior cingulate cortices, will depend on belief in the treatment and that pain-related activity in lower order areas, such as the periaqueductal gray and rostroventromedial medulla, will depend on the amount of conditioning subjects receive. We will use classification techniques to predict which subjects will continue to experience placebo analgesia after the placebo treatment is revealed. We expect to find that activation in the lower order pain regions predicts whether subjects continue to experience placebo analgesia after the reveal. This research will provide a new way of thinking about analgesia and pain relief. If multiple pathways for placebo analgesia are found, it would suggest novel treatments and methods for improving existing pain relief treatments using conditioning to assist the natural pain relief system in the body.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will examine differences in brain systems governing pain relief. This study will focus on brain regions involved in pain relief, testing whether activity in specific regions predicts the effectiveness of a placebo treatment.

"A Necessary Multi-Parametric Evaluation of Vulvodynia     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Vulvodynia is a poorly understood and treated chronic pain disorder that affects an estimated 14 million women and is characterized by significant variation in location, temporal characteristics and clinical course. The contribution o multiple known and unknown components hinders adequate diagnosis and consequently rational choice of treatment. Identification and assessment of these underlying mechanisms would greatly advance the phenotyping of this prevalent disorder, which is a necessary step towards efficacious treatment.  The proposed methods contain three necessary components. The first provides a systemic clinical exam of vulvar mucosa and muscle that is broadened greatly to include consideration of pain processes that are initiated by persistent pain. These include spinally-mediated C-fiber temporal summation, central sensitization and altered pain regulatory mechanisms that include decreased descending inhibition and increased descending facilitation. The methods will also evaluate a general pain amplification mechanism that has been observed in vulvodynia, fibromyalgia and low back pain, and that is likely distinct from spinally-mediated central sensitization.  The second component recognizes the influence of psychological variables that determine distinct subgroups in other disorders and that can influence pain through physiological mechanisms ranging from increased muscle tension to increased sympathetic outflow. The proposal will use our previous experience and current results from a large-scale multi-center study (n=3500) and from an ongoing program project (n=1500) to evaluate important dimensions of psychological distress and cognitive style.  The third component recognizes that adequate analysis of multiple evaluation procedures requires considerable knowledge and expertise in advance statistical methods. The research team includes a statistician, Dr. Eric Bair, who is especially knowledgeable about these types of analyses and experiences including the multi-center study and the program project cited above.  The research team is particularly well prepared to conduct the proposed investigation because of significant experience and expertise in the proposed methods including clinical assessment and treatment of vulvodynia, psychophysical and neurophysiological assessment of pain and sensory function and sophisticated statistical analysis of data from pain assessments.

"Molecular Epidemiology of Neuropathic Pain in Head and Neck Cancer     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pain is often one of the first signs of head and neck cancer. Head and neck cancer pain may be due to the disease itself (tumor) or as a consequence of therapy. Up to 80% of patients with head and neck cancer report pain during treatment and for some 36%, pain persists beyond treatment. Chronic pain leads to prolonged suffering and reduced quality of life. Neuropathic pain, in particular, remains a major clinical problem since existing analgesics are often ineffective and with serious side-effects. Therefore, the goal of this proposal is to perform genome-wide (730,525SNPs) analyses on 2400 patients with head and neck cancer to determine the molecular/genetic basis of chronic pain, with a specific emphasis on validating the role of genetic mechanisms in the transition from acute pain to chronic pain (nociceptive versus neuropathic). The specific aims are; AIM 1: To perform genetic analyses on 2400 patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck in order to identify potentially novel gene variants associated with the development of chronic pain (neuropathic versus nociceptive). Hypothesis 1: Potentially novel genetic variants that may also serve as therapeutic targets for pain will be identified using a genome-wide SNP scan. AIM 2: To establish a cohort of head and neck cancer patients and determine the independent influence of behavioral, epidemiological, biological, and clinical factors in predicting the development of chronic pain (neuropathic/nociceptive) in these patients. Hypothesis 1: The development of chronic pain will vary by cancer treatment (surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy) and behavioral, epidemiological, and clinical factors. AIM 3: To perform exploratory gene-gene and gene-treatment (type of cancer treatment) interaction analyses that will help identify individuals at highest risk for the development of chronic pain (neuropathic versus nociceptive) on the basis of their genetic risk profiles and treatment (e.g. we will test th risk allele of each SNP for its association with detailed treatment information). Pain will be longitudinally assessed by self-report and quantitative sensory testing along with assessment of behavioral, genetic, clinical and epidemiological factors. We expect that new findings from this proposal will provide insight into the genetic mechanisms of chronic pain development and may provide novel information, which could lead to the development of new therapeutic agents for chronic neuropathic pain.          Our study will provide critical information on the epidemiological, clinical, behavioral, and biological/genetic determinants for the development of chronic pain. Importantly, the genome-wide component of the grant may yield potential novel genes as therapeutic target for neuropathic pain, a disabling condition that is hard to treat with available analgesics.

"Development of a new technology for assessing pediatric pain (NTAP)     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Advanced sensing and pattern recognition technologies open new possibilities for automated clinical assessment. Integration of this technology into the clinical arena is thus timely. In particular, there is promise in the use of suh technologies to provide automated assessment of poorly quantifiable clinical variables such as pain. Suboptimal pain assessment is particularly prevalent in children, who often rely on pain assessment by proxy which has been shown repeatedly to poorly correlate with patients' self-reports of pain. A number of observational scales have been developed for assessing pain by proxy. However, even some of the most widely used clinical scales were not developed from a rigorous psychometric perspective. Characterizations of the facial display in pain differ dramatically from each other, and differ substantially from empirical descriptions, leading to dramatically different estimates of pain. Suboptimal pain assessment in children results in delays in adequate pain management and unrelieved pain, which may contribute to significant morbidity and mortality in children. Recognition of this issue has led the World Health Organization to mandate that health entities recognize the rights of children to have their pain alleviated. In order to accomplish this goal, a more reliable and accurate method for pain assessment in this at-risk population is needed. We propose the Development of a Novel Tool for the Assessment of Pediatric Pain (NTAP). The primary aim is to develop and evaluate an automated NTAP tool that utilizes novel computer vision and wearable physiology sensor technologies to estimate pain severity in children. The research team comprises expertise from researchers in computer vision (Bartlett & Littlewort), pediatric clinical research and child healt outcomes (Huang), physiological measurement (el Kaliouby & Picard), and pain assessment in children (Craig). The project will collect a dataset of clinical pain in children following a known pain insult (pancreatitis, and postoperative pain following appendectomy.) The dataset will contain video, electrodermal signals, self-report of pain intensity, elapsed time since pain insult and clinical severity ratings. Initial analysis of collected video data will be performed using our NSF-funded automated facial expression recognition system (CERT: Bartlett & Littlewort), and electrodermal activity (EDA) monitoring and recording will be performed by the wearable, wireless Q Sensor from Affectiva (el Kaliouby & Picard). Machine learning (the development of algorithms for making predictions based on a large set of examples/data) will be employed to develop a system for estimating pain from facial expression and electrodermal activity signals. Evaluation protocols will address validity, reliability, and reproducibility. The proposed NTAP too will provide an automated pain estimation system for pediatric pain in the clinical setting that may improve pain assessment in children and provide a foundation for pain assessment in populations with communication limitations.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Suboptimal pain assessment in children is unfortunately common and results in unrelieved pain, and untreated pain contributes to significant morbidity and mortality in children. The World Health Organization and other health organizations have mandated that health entities recognize the rights of children to have their pain alleviated; in order to accomplish this goal, a more reliable and accurate method for pain assessment in this at-risk population is needed. Emerging technologies with their high potential for standardization and reproducibility, as well as grounding in empirical data through machine learning, are uniquely qualified for clinical pain assessment.

"Use of Machine Learning Classifiers to Forecast Severe Acute Postoperative Pain F     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Up to 40% of patients undergoing surgery report moderate to severe pain in the postoperative period. The development of a clinical decision support system to allow preoperative intervention for this subset of patients may have a profound impact on their recovery, and potentially their long-term outcome. To accurately forecast severe postoperative pain, we propose the use of machine learning classifiers (MLC's), which are classification algorithms employing a range of novel search and classification methodologies that continually update their performance as new information becomes available. This award will permit the applicant to complete a rigorous didactic curriculum emphasizing classification theory, algorithm evaluation, and development of clinical decision support systems. The nature of these studies place them far outside the realm of traditional medical education. By protecting time for continued mentorship from experts in pain biology and psychology, machine learning, and clinical regional anesthesia, the candidate is well-positioned to become an independently-funded researcher in the field of perioperative pain prediction. In Specific Aim 1 of this study, we will test the hypothesis that Machine Learning Classifiers can accurately predict severe post-operative pain in patients undergoing cancer surgery. This portion of the study will retrospectively test MLC's ability to predict severe pain on post-operatie day 1. An array of MLC's will be tested amongst each other, both with and without the implementation of text analytics. Additionally, all MLC's will be compared against more traditional multiple variable regression techniques such as logistic regression. In Specific Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that the addition of prospectively obtained attributes and instances will permit continued improvement in MLC performance. This prospective portion of the study will examine the role of prospectively-obtained psychometric attributes, as well as the ability of MLC's to learn and adapt their accuracy during continued refinements to surgical and anesthetic care.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Up to 40% of patients undergoing surgery will suffer from moderate to severe postoperative pain. While regional anesthetics offer the possibility of a pain-free surgical experience, their use is limited by their inherent risk and cost. This project aims t accurately determine which surgical patients will suffer from severe acute postoperative pain through the use of advanced mathematical algorithms, permitting anesthesiologists and surgeons to efficiently target pain therapies in a cost-effective manner.              Up to 40% of patients undergoing surgery will suffer from moderate to severe postoperative pain.

"Neuroimaging and Mentoring in Translational Pain Research This is a new application for a Midcareer Investigator Award in Patient-Oriented Research (K24). The applicant, Dr. Sean Mackey, is a physician-scientist, Associate Professor and Division Chief of Pain Medicine at Stanford University. Over the past 5 years, Dr. Mackey has developed expertise in several advanced neuroimaging and psychophysical techniques and applied these to the study of pain. This has led to his developing an independent patient-oriented research (POR) career. This independence is demonstrated by his receiving three independent research awards that use MR techniques to investigate the central neural correlates of pain in patients with chronic pain; he is PI on all three of these awards (one each by NIDA, NINDS and NIDDK). Dr. Mackey has a 10 year history of mentoring junior clinician scientists, postdoctoral fellows, medical students, and graduate students - all performing POR. In addition, Dr. Mackey has active collaborations with many NIH-funded investigators in the area of pain research and its intersection with substance abuse. The current application requests funding (50% salary) for 5 years. This funding will guarantee that the candidate will have at least 75% protected time to conduct his ongoing research and to continue to mentor clinician scientists performing POR. As Dr. Mackey is the Division Chief of Pain Medicine, this award will free time now devoted to administrative and clinical responsibilities to focus more on his research and mentoring activities over the next 5 years. In addition to working on the three ongoing NIH-funded projects, the candidate will obtain additional training in advanced multimodal MR collection and analysis methods (machine learning algorithms, diffusion tensor imaging, genomic imaging) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy imaging. This will allow the candidate to develop new approaches to characterize the central neuroplastic changes that occur in chronic pain and its link with addiction. Given the outstanding resources and collaborations at Stanford, these novel projects are expected to be either renewed or to lead to new directions in pain and substance abuse research, and significantly contribute to our scientific understanding of these disabling conditions. Project Narrative  Chronic pain has a tremendous impact on the individual and society as a whole. We need better understanding of the mechanisms leading to the generation and maintenance of chronic pain conditions. This K24 award will permit the PI to increase his efforts in mentoring junior investigators in patient-oriented research, and to conduct research to find solutions to alleviate the suffering of patients with chronic pain.",Neuroimaging and Mentoring in Translational Pain Research,8249852,K24DA029262,"['Absence of pain sensation', 'Academia', 'Acute Pain', 'Address', 'Affective', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Award', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Canada', 'Capsaicin', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Effectiveness', 'Electroencephalography', 'Endowment', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Exploratory/Developmental Grant for Diagnostic Cancer Imaging', 'Exposure to', 'Faculty', 'Feedback', 'Fellowship', 'Fibromyalgia', 'Floor', 'Free Will', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genitourinary system', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hand', 'Heating', 'Human', 'Human Volunteers', 'Hyperalgesia', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Industry', 'Interstitial Cystitis', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Legal', 'Life', 'Limbic System', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetism', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mechanical Stimulation', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Medical Students', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Mid-Career Clinical Scientist Award (K24)', 'Midcareer Investigator Award in Patient-Oriented Research', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'National Research Service Awards', 'Near-Infrared Spectroscopy', 'Neuraxis', 'Nociception', 'Noise', 'Pain', 'Pain Research', 'Paper', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pelvic Pain', 'Pelvis', 'Perception', 'Persons', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Placebos', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychophysiology', 'Publishing', 'Real-Time Systems', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Support', 'Residencies', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Running', 'Scanning', 'Schools', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Societies', 'Solutions', 'Somatosensory Cortex', 'Spinal', 'Spinal Cord', 'Spinal Cord Plasticity', 'Stimulus', 'Substance abuse problem', 'System', 'Tactile', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translations', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Upper Extremity', 'Wages', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'addiction', 'allodynia', 'base', 'career', 'central pain', 'chronic neuropathic pain', 'chronic pain', 'chronic pelvic pain', 'cingulate cortex', 'clinical application', 'clinically significant', 'cohort', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'density', 'design', 'diffuse noxious inhibitory control', 'distraction', 'dorsal horn', 'experience', 'graduate student', 'gray matter', 'healthy volunteer', 'hemodynamics', 'imaging modality', 'interest', 'meetings', 'mind control', 'morphometry', 'neurobehavioral', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'pain inhibition', 'painful bladder syndrome', 'painful neuropathy', 'patient oriented research', 'pressure', 'professor', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'spinal cord imaging', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'undergraduate student', 'urologic']",NIDA,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K24,2012,202100,0.2720120420493323
"FMRI-based Decoupling of Conditioning and Belief Effects on Placebo Analgesia     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project aims to differentiate between neural mechanisms that underlie placebo analgesia. Currently, many researchers have concluded that placebo analgesia depends primarily on an individual's belief in a treatment, but alternative evidence suggests that other lower level processes may be involved in analgesia that are dissociable from belief. In the proposed study, belief in a placebo treatment will be manipulated using verbal information within subjects, and both experience and belief will be manipulated using conditioning between subjects. The proposed study will separate the effect of verbal information on placebo analgesia from implicit values learned through experience. Subjects are conditioned to believe that a placebo treatment is effective at reducing pain by first receiving a series of high-temperature painful stimulations, and then receiving a second series of low- temperature painful stimuli after the experimenter applies a placebo cream with instructions that it will reduce pain. Half of the subjects will experience a single conditioning session (short conditioning group), and the other half will have four separate sessions on different days (long conditioning group). For all subjects, the placebo effect will be tested in the scanner after the final conditioning session. During testing, subjects will rate the painfulness of medium-temperature painful stimuli with and without the placebo cream. Subjects will then be informed that the treatment they received was a placebo, and will be asked to again rate the painfulness of medium-temperature painful stimuli with and without the placebo cream. Revealing the nature of the treatment allows comparison of fMRI based pain activity at different levels of belief, and allows comparison across groups of subjects depending on how much conditioning they received. FMRI analysis for this project will focus on dissociating the effects of verbal information and experience among pain related brain regions, and whether the relationship between brain activation, pain, and the belief in a treatment is different depending on the amount of training received. We anticipate that pain-related activity in frontal pain areas, including the orbitofrontal and anterior cingulate cortices, will depend on belief in the treatment and that pain-related activity in lower order areas, such as the periaqueductal gray and rostroventromedial medulla, will depend on the amount of conditioning subjects receive. We will use classification techniques to predict which subjects will continue to experience placebo analgesia after the placebo treatment is revealed. We expect to find that activation in the lower order pain regions predicts whether subjects continue to experience placebo analgesia after the reveal. This research will provide a new way of thinking about analgesia and pain relief. If multiple pathways for placebo analgesia are found, it would suggest novel treatments and methods for improving existing pain relief treatments using conditioning to assist the natural pain relief system in the body.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will examine differences in brain systems governing pain relief. This study will focus on brain regions involved in pain relief, testing whether activity in specific regions predicts the effectiveness of a placebo treatment.

"Learned regulation of the limbic network via combined EEG and fMRI     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project aims to develop a novel potential treatment for common neuropsychiatric disorders, specifically chronic pain syndrome and affective disorders including depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). We have previously shown that real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (rt-fMRI) can provide a feedback signal (neurofeedback) that allows people to gain learned voluntary control of activation in the rostral anterior cingulate (rACC), which in turn alters pain perception. Here, we aim to develop a brain-validated electroencephalography (EEG) neurofeedback method that involves simultaneous EEG and fMRI recordings. This system will then be used to determine EEG signatures reflective of regulation of rACC and of the amygdala. Multiple psychiatric states (e.g., depressive, anxious) are associated with an inability to regulate emotion and appear to be characterized by dysfunction of the limbic circuit including the ACC and amygdala. However, current psychiatric treatment approaches typically lack specificity regarding brain networks and mechanisms. Based on research studies indicating that individuals can be trained to regulate their own mental and physiological responses through online feedback, the proposed study aims to develop a novel tool for enhancing physiological resilience through psychological training using brain signals as the basis for such feedback. Thus, neurofeedback can provide a potential, complementary/alternate approach for treatment of neuropsychiatric disturbances. The combination of simultaneously acquired high spatial-resolution fMRI data and high temporal-resolution EEG data together with advanced statistical learning approaches provide a plausible way to infer and generate a robust and effective EEG neurofeedback signals that can target even deep brain structures such as the rACC or amygdala as the source of feedback. Given the high prevalence of psychopathology and the non-specific targeting of current treatments, the development of a robust method for learned regulation of specific limbic regions is important. Specifically, the new EEG-neurofeedback tool could be a novel, rational, neuroscience-based therapeutic intervention that could become a portable, easy-to-use, and low-cost clinical tool for improving self-control over brain working. In the long-term such a technique could be useful in alleviating chronic pain and regulating emotional instability and agony in cases of depression and anxiety syndromes.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The inability to self-regulate our affective/mental states is an underlying cause of multiple disorders, including chronic pain syndrome, depression, and anxiety that have serious social and psychological consequences. This project aims to develop a novel system that enables people to learn to regulate pain and emotion, which could lead to improved outcomes for major neuropsychiatric diseases that are often unresponsive to current treatments.              The inability to self-regulate our affective/mental states is an underlying cause of multiple disorders, including chronic pain syndrome, depression, and anxiety that have serious social and psychological consequences.

"A Necessary Multi-Parametric Evaluation of Vulvodynia     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Vulvodynia is a poorly understood and treated chronic pain disorder that affects an estimated 14 million women and is characterized by significant variation in location, temporal characteristics and clinical course. The contribution o multiple known and unknown components hinders adequate diagnosis and consequently rational choice of treatment. Identification and assessment of these underlying mechanisms would greatly advance the phenotyping of this prevalent disorder, which is a necessary step towards efficacious treatment.  The proposed methods contain three necessary components. The first provides a systemic clinical exam of vulvar mucosa and muscle that is broadened greatly to include consideration of pain processes that are initiated by persistent pain. These include spinally-mediated C-fiber temporal summation, central sensitization and altered pain regulatory mechanisms that include decreased descending inhibition and increased descending facilitation. The methods will also evaluate a general pain amplification mechanism that has been observed in vulvodynia, fibromyalgia and low back pain, and that is likely distinct from spinally-mediated central sensitization.  The second component recognizes the influence of psychological variables that determine distinct subgroups in other disorders and that can influence pain through physiological mechanisms ranging from increased muscle tension to increased sympathetic outflow. The proposal will use our previous experience and current results from a large-scale multi-center study (n=3500) and from an ongoing program project (n=1500) to evaluate important dimensions of psychological distress and cognitive style.  The third component recognizes that adequate analysis of multiple evaluation procedures requires considerable knowledge and expertise in advance statistical methods. The research team includes a statistician, Dr. Eric Bair, who is especially knowledgeable about these types of analyses and experiences including the multi-center study and the program project cited above.  The research team is particularly well prepared to conduct the proposed investigation because of significant experience and expertise in the proposed methods including clinical assessment and treatment of vulvodynia, psychophysical and neurophysiological assessment of pain and sensory function and sophisticated statistical analysis of data from pain assessments.

"Molecular Epidemiology of Neuropathic Pain in Head and Neck Cancer     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pain is often one of the first signs of head and neck cancer. Head and neck cancer pain may be due to the disease itself (tumor) or as a consequence of therapy. Up to 80% of patients with head and neck cancer report pain during treatment and for some 36%, pain persists beyond treatment. Chronic pain leads to prolonged suffering and reduced quality of life. Neuropathic pain, in particular, remains a major clinical problem since existing analgesics are often ineffective and with serious side-effects. Therefore, the goal of this proposal is to perform genome-wide (730,525SNPs) analyses on 2400 patients with head and neck cancer to determine the molecular/genetic basis of chronic pain, with a specific emphasis on validating the role of genetic mechanisms in the transition from acute pain to chronic pain (nociceptive versus neuropathic). The specific aims are; AIM 1: To perform genetic analyses on 2400 patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck in order to identify potentially novel gene variants associated with the development of chronic pain (neuropathic versus nociceptive). Hypothesis 1: Potentially novel genetic variants that may also serve as therapeutic targets for pain will be identified using a genome-wide SNP scan. AIM 2: To establish a cohort of head and neck cancer patients and determine the independent influence of behavioral, epidemiological, biological, and clinical factors in predicting the development of chronic pain (neuropathic/nociceptive) in these patients. Hypothesis 1: The development of chronic pain will vary by cancer treatment (surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy) and behavioral, epidemiological, and clinical factors. AIM 3: To perform exploratory gene-gene and gene-treatment (type of cancer treatment) interaction analyses that will help identify individuals at highest risk for the development of chronic pain (neuropathic versus nociceptive) on the basis of their genetic risk profiles and treatment (e.g. we will test th risk allele of each SNP for its association with detailed treatment information). Pain will be longitudinally assessed by self-report and quantitative sensory testing along with assessment of behavioral, genetic, clinical and epidemiological factors. We expect that new findings from this proposal will provide insight into the genetic mechanisms of chronic pain development and may provide novel information, which could lead to the development of new therapeutic agents for chronic neuropathic pain.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Our study will provide critical information on the epidemiological, clinical, behavioral, and biological/genetic determinants for the development of chronic pain. Importantly, the genome-wide component of the grant may yield potential novel genes as therapeutic target for neuropathic pain, a disabling condition that is hard to treat with available analgesics.                  Our study will provide critical information on the epidemiological, clinical, behavioral, and biological/genetic determinants for the development of chronic pain.

"Neuroimaging-based biomarkers for two components of pain    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application addresses broad Challenge Area (03) Biomarker Discovery and Validation, and Specific Challenge topic 03-DA-101, Biomarkers for Pain. The challenge Pain is a central health problem that affects quality of life and productivity for a large segment of the population. Lost work time due to pain costs America an estimated $65 billion annually. The challenge in this request for applications is to define robust and meaningful biomarkers that can serve as objective, quantitative measures of pain-related processes. Currently, pain assessment is based almost exclusively on patients' self- reports, which are inherently limited by the complex relationship between biological nociceptive (pain-related) processes and patients' verbal or written descriptions of pain. Objective biomarkers would be useful for both understanding pain and for predicting pain when self-reports are unavailable or unreliable. They would accelerate the pace of research on pain and enhance patient care in several ways. First, biomarkers could serve as intermediate outcome measures in clinical trials and treatments, making clinical trials less costly and treatments better matched to patients' individual needs. Second, biomarkers could help develop new interventions for pain that directly target specific brain systems, i.e., with non-invasive brain stimulation, which would open up new possibilities for pain management. Third, research on biomarkers could improve the quality of decision-making about pain in legal contexts. Our approach We outline a proposal for using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), in conjunction with other methods, to develop and validate biomarkers for two components of reported pain experience in an acute, experimentally induced pain setting. A central part of this endeavor is the use of machine-learning algorithms to develop optimal fMRI-based predictors of pain. Machine-learning based biomarkers are essentially patterns of activity across brain regions with maximal predictive accuracy and discriminative validity for separating physical and non-physical (e.g., social or emotional) pain. These patterns can serve as the basis for tracking multiple components of pain processing without relying on self-report. Rather than simply trying to develop alternative measures that predict self-reports, however, we place a particular emphasis on identifying separable component brain processes that make different contributions to pain reports. By identifying biomarkers for component processes underlying pain, we aim to develop objective, brain-based measures of ""intermediate phenotypes"" that could be independently targeted for treatment, and so are useful in their own right beyond their ability to provide surrogate measures for pain reports.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ability to identify the brain components that contribute to pain in a particular individual would allow care providers to select treatments appropriate for the individual. We have specific reason to believe that at least two separable components can be identified. New results from our laboratory suggest that at least two distinct brain networks make separable contributions to reported pain. One network, the ""pain-processing network"" (PPN), responds to painful peripheral stimulation (e.g., heat on the skin), and includes classic pain-processing regions. A second network, the ""emotional appraisal network"" (EAN), does not respond to stimulation of the body, but is involved in the cognitive generation of emotion. In our recent fMRI work on pain, both networks appear to make independent contributions to predicting how much pain a person will report in response to a given stimulus. Our goal is to develop biomarkers based on these two putative components. We plan to achieve these broad goals using converging evidence from three complementary approaches, each of which will be pursued in parallel and addressed in one Specific Aim. In Aim 1, we will develop fMRI- based pain biomarkers using machine learning techniques. We will use a set of fMRI data from several acute thermal pain experiments collected in our laboratory over the past 3 years (combined N = 157). These datasets have highly homogenous scanning and experimental protocols and were designed with the goal of fMRI-based pain prediction in mind. Their existence will allow us to accelerate the pace of computational biomarker development. In Aim 2, we will test whether the fMRI-based biomarkers we develop are causally related to pain, using combined fMRI and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Biomarkers that are causally related to pain are most likely to be useful as targets for drug or other treatments. We will stimulate regions within the PPN and EAN during fMRI scanning, and test whether effects on activity and connectivity in each network predict changes in pain experience. In Aim 3, we will extend our biomarker validation to chronic pain. We will test whether biomarkers developed in Aims 1 and 2 predict patterns of hypersensitivity to sensory stimuli in patients with focal lesions in the PPN and EAN. Together, these approaches provide three complementary ways of developing and validating fMRI-based biomarkers for pain. )       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This application addresses broad Challenge Area (03) Biomarker Discovery and Validation, and Specific Challenge topic 03-DA-101, Biomarkers for Pain.

"Advancing Knowledge Discovery for Postoperative Pain Management ABSTRACT Surgery is common and appropriate postoperative pain management is critical as poor management can impair recovery and lead to adverse events, including prolonged opioid use and transition to chronic pain. Literature suggests significant disparities exist with regard to pain management and its quality-of-life impacts, particularly among vulnerable populations (e.g. depressed, obese and diabetics). However, there lacks risk stratification tools to identify individuals at high risk for these disparate pain outcomes. Although pain scores are routinely collected in electronic health records (EHRs), shared algorithms to utilize them for care improvement are limited. To advance the efficient and effective use of the abundant amount of electronic data now available, a common data model (CDM) is necessary: standardized structures, terminologies, and rules to represent EHR data. Using a CMD for postoperative pain research would facilitate timely evidence generation across multiple populations and settings, which can provide critical evidence to stakeholders and move the field away from pain treatment for the ‘average’ patient to pain treatment for an individual. In this grant, we propose an innovative approach to advance the systematic analysis of postoperative pain across populations. Our approach will leverage the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) CDM to develop tools that use standardize data formats and naming conventions; OMOP has over 140 collaborating sites gloablly. We will further utilize analytical tools developed by Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) on this CDM to facilitate disseminate across the research community. Our approach will develop scalable, open source risk stratification tools for adverse pain outcomes across diverse populations. We will accomplish this work in three aims. First, we will develop clinical phenotypes to identify and extract key discriminating features necessary to assess postoperative pain using EHRs. Next, we will develop pain risk stratification models using machine learning, including deep learning, methods and tools based on phenotypes developed in Aim 1. Finally, we will validate our models externally at the VA and disseminate our work through open source libraries and public websites. This project will deliver validated risk-stratification tools derived from real world evidence to identify patients at high risk for adverse pain outcomes following surgery, which can potentially reduce prescribed opioids circulating in the community– a key to curbing the opioid epidemic. NARRATIVE Surgery is common and appropriate postoperative pain management is critical, as poor management can impair recovery, lead to increased morbidity and decreased quality of life; yet, there are significant disparities with regard to pain and its management, particularly in vulnerable populations. The proposed research will develop evidence needed to identify patients at high risk for adverse postoperative pain outcomes. Models will be developed at a tertiary academic health center, validated at the Veterans Health Administration and disseminated to the community via a publicly available website, common data model and open source libraries.",Advancing Knowledge Discovery for Postoperative Pain Management,10019592,R01LM013362,"['Absence of pain sensation', 'Adjuvant', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Anesthesia procedures', 'Caring', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Community Hospitals', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Deposition', 'Depressed mood', 'Economics', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'General Population', 'Generations', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Infrastructure', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Names', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Obesity', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Pain Research', 'Pain management', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Postoperative Pain', 'Quality of life', 'Records', 'Recovery', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Veterans', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'chronic pain', 'clinical phenotype', 'cohort', 'data format', 'data modeling', 'data standards', 'deep learning', 'depressed patient', 'diabetic', 'effective therapy', 'electronic data', 'fundamental research', 'health administration', 'health care settings', 'health data', 'high risk', 'improved', 'informatics tool', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning method', 'model development', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'open source', 'opiate tolerance', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid use', 'pain outcome', 'pain score', 'population based', 'prescription opioid', 'random forest', 'risk sharing', 'social', 'structured data', 'support vector machine', 'symposium', 'tool', 'tool development', 'unstructured data', 'web site']",NLM,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,662684,0.26870069602612534
"Developing A Mouse Chronic Pain Scale by 3D Imaging and Measurement of Mouse Spontaneous Behaviors PROJECT SUMMARY Rodent models are highly valuable for elucidating the molecular and cellular mechanisms of chronic pain. Because rodents cannot articulate their sensation, “pain-like” behaviors have been used as the proxy. However, sensitivity and specificity of many existing methods for measuring rodent “pain” sensation, especially “chronic pain”, are uncertain. Here we propose to explore the feasibility of a largely automated and data-driven behavioral assay for identifying spontaneous pain in freely behaving mice. Specifically, we will take advantage of recent advances in 3D motion analysis, which enable precise and robust measurements of movements without human intervention, to extract movement features from freely moving mice in various pain states (baseline, induced acute pain, chronic pain, and with painkiller treatment). We will generate a database of movement features of control mice and mice with induced acute cheek/leg pain or chronic neuropathic cheek/leg pain, using both sexes of two mouse strains. We will then use machine-learning algorithms to identify the best combination of movement features for predicting the pain state (a “mouse chronic pain scale”). These efforts are expected to produce a novel and objective method to assess spontaneous pain, a characteristic feature of chronic pain, in mice. This method can supplement our recent method in measurements of evoked responses (a “mouse acute pain scale”) to provide efficient, robust, and comprehensive assessments of pain-related rodent behaviors and facilitate mechanistic investigations of brain circuits in mediating and modulating pain. Our interdisciplinary team is well suited to complete these Aims, utilizing combined expertise in mouse somatosensory/pain system (PI Luo), behavioral, systems and computational neuroscience (PI Ding), and 3D imaging and computer vision (PI Park). PROJECT NARRATIVE Rodent models are highly valuable for understanding pain mechanisms and developing treatments for pain relief. The proposed work aims to establish a novel 3D method for imaging, annotating, and interpreting spontaneous pain-related behaviors in mice (a “mouse chronic pain scale”).

"Technology Research Site for Advanced, Faster Quantitative Imaging for BACPAC PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Disorders of the spine have a tremendous impact on society; both physically through the morbidity of afflicted individuals, and financially, through lost productivity and increased health care costs. Despite the significance of this problem, the etiology of symptoms is diverse and unclear in many patients, and there are few reliable methods by which to prospectively determine the appropriate course of patient care and to objectively evaluate the effectiveness of various interventions. Challenges contributing to this major healthcare dilemma include numerous sources of back pain, difficulty in visualization of responsible tissues using any single imaging technique and difficulty in the localization of pain and contributing molecular processes. Magnetic Resonance imaging (MR) has been used to characterize disc, muscle, nerves and Positron Emission Tomography (PET) has been used to study bone turnover, and facet disease in subjects with lower back pain.  The research and tool development proposed in this UH2/UH3 takes the critical next step in the clinical translation of faster, quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MR) of patients with lower back pain. New optimized techniques and patient studies are required to investigate its clinical potential for quantitatively characterizing the tissues implicated in lower back pain, and objective evaluation of pain. Our proposed multidisciplinary Technology Research Site (Tech Site) of the NIH Back Pain Consortium (BACPAC) will develop Phase IV TTMs (Research and Development for Technology Optimization) to leverage two key technical advancements – development of machine learning based faster MR acquisition methods, and machine learning for image segmentation and extraction of objective disease related features from images. We will develop, validate, and deploy end-to-end deep learning-based technologies (TTMs) for accelerated image reconstruction, tissue segmentation, detection of spinal degeneration, to facilitate automated, robust assessment of structure-function relationships between spine characteristics, neurocognitive pain response, and patient reported outcomes. To accomplish this important project, we have assembled a highly-experienced multidisciplinary research team combining extensive expertise MR bioengineering, advanced MRI data analysis, radiology, neuroscience, neurosurgery, orthopedic surgery, multi-dimensional analytics and have existing research agreements with industry. The research facilities and environment include the clinical and research infrastructure required for successful completion of the proposed translational project. The team has disseminated tools before to academia, worked closely with industry and are motivated to totally work with BACPAC as the plans of the consortium evolve. PROJECT NARRATIVE The successful outcome of the proposed project will result in the development and translation into the clinical setting of new methods to enable greatly improved imaging of lower back pain in human subjects. While this project focuses on lower back pain, these new imaging techniques could ultimately benefit the clinical management of other musculoskeletal pain.","Technology Research Site for Advanced, Faster Quantitative Imaging for BACPAC",10214771,UH3AR076724,"['Academia', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Adult', 'Aftercare', 'Agreement', 'Anatomy', 'Back Pain', 'Base of the Brain', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Brain', 'Cartilage', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Chronic low back pain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Exercise Therapy', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Gold', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Intervertebral disc structure', 'Knee', 'Knee Osteoarthritis', 'Laboratories', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Low Back Pain', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Meniscus structure of joint', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphology', 'Muscle', 'Musculoskeletal', 'Musculoskeletal Pain', 'Nerve', 'Nerve Block', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurosciences', 'Orthopedic Surgery procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pain', 'Pain management', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Spinal', 'Spinal Diseases', 'Staging', 'Stenosis', 'Structure', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translations', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Vendor', 'Vertebral column', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'autoencoder', 'base', 'bone turnover', 'clinical imaging', 'clinical infrastructure', 'clinical translation', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'cost estimate', 'data space', 'deep learning', 'disability', 'domain mapping', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'experience', 'feature detection', 'gray matter', 'hands-on learning', 'human subject', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging Segmentation', 'improved', 'intervertebral disk degeneration', 'multi-task learning', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurosurgery', 'novel', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'quantitative imaging', 'reconstruction', 'research and development', 'research facility', 'response', 'scoliosis', 'synaptic function', 'task analysis', 'technology research and development', 'tool', 'tool development']",NIAMS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",UH3,2020,824114,0.18321159704031098
"Development of a deep neural network to measure spontaneous pain from mouse facial expressions PROJECT SUMMARY Opioid analgesics are commonly used to treat pain but have serious side effects, including addiction, dependence, and death from overdose. While there is a significant need for new non-addictive analgesics, efforts to develop new pain medicines have met with limited success. In part, this failure is due to an overreliance on evoked pain measures in preclinical models. Indeed, most preclinical models do not measure spontaneous pain—the main symptom of chronic pain in humans. To increase translational relevance, the Mouse Grimace Scale (MGS) was developed to quantify characteristic facial expressions associated with spontaneous pain. The MGS is reproducible across labs and was used to evaluate the efficacy of analgesics. However, the MGS has not been widely adopted due to its high resource demands and low throughput. To overcome this limitation, we adapted a machine learning model to classify the presence or absence of pain from mouse facial expressions. We called this model the automated Mouse Grimace Scale (aMGS). After training, this model identified mice in pain with 94% accuracy, comparable to a highly-trained human. However, our original “aMGS 1.0” is limited in several respects. It is only accurate at detecting facial grimacing in white- coated mice, and produces a binary assessment (“pain” vs. “no pain”) instead of a graded score. Moreover, aMGS 1.0 cannot dynamically determine pain status from full-motion videos. Additionally, we relied on an older piece of software that does not consistently extract high-quality images of the mouse face. The aMGS 1.0 also has difficulty distinguishing between images of sleeping and grimacing mice. Finally, aMGS 1.0 suffers from a “black box” problem inherent to most machine learning algorithms, in that we do not know what facial details it uses to produce a pain assessment. Here we propose to overcome all of these limitations by developing a more sophisticated version of our automated pain classifier (aMGS 2.0). To achieve this goal we will: 1) Develop and validate a new open-source platform to classify (frame-by-frame) spontaneous pain intensity from mouse facial expressions, using albino (white) mice and motion information. 2) Enhance the generality of aMGS 2.0 for use with black mice. And, 3) Develop a user-friendly web-based platform that operates on computer-based and mobile devices. We will validate the utility of aMGS with three pain assays that produce grimaces in rodents—inflammatory pain, post-surgical (laparotomy) pain, and neuropathic pain. To increase rigor and reproducibility, two pain assays will be performed and scored with aMGS 2.0 in an independent lab. Numerous investigators in the pain field have expressed interest in using our proposed model. The platform will include a cloud-based data repository and analytic tools to facilitate curation of public data, continuous improvement of the model over time, and integration of new analytic tools. One analytic tool that we plan to develop will identify mouse features that most influence pain classification. NARRATIVE As the opioid epidemic has made clear, there is significant need to develop new ways to study chronic pain and relief of pain in preclinical models. Development of an accurate and broadly useful machine learning model and web-based platform will make it possible for researchers to objectively quantify and study spontaneous pain in mice, and hence provide a way to more rapidly identify and validate new analgesic drugs.",Development of a deep neural network to measure spontaneous pain from mouse facial expressions,9866055,R01NS114259,"['Acetic Acids', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Analgesics', 'Animal Model', 'Biological Assay', 'Body Regions', 'Cellular Phone', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Color', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Database Management Systems', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Facial Pain', 'Failure', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Image', 'Laparotomy', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Mus', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Online Systems', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Opioid Analgesics', 'Output', 'Pain', 'Pain Measurement', 'Pain intensity', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Postoperative Pain', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Publishing', 'Reflex action', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rodent', 'Science', 'Screening procedure', 'Sleep', 'Specificity', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'addiction', 'analytical tool', 'associated symptom', 'base', 'blind', 'chronic pain', 'chronic pain relief', 'cloud based', 'convolutional neural network', 'data warehouse', 'deep neural network', 'handheld mobile device', 'improved', 'inflammatory pain', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mobile application', 'multimodality', 'neural circuit', 'novel', 'open source', 'opioid epidemic', 'overdose death', 'pain relief', 'painful neuropathy', 'persistent symptom', 'pre-clinical', 'recurrent neural network', 'side effect', 'smartphone Application', 'spontaneous pain', 'success', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'web services']",NINDS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2020,364998,0.31268969022550025
"Multivariate Machine Learning to Characterize Opioid-induced Alterations in the Brain in Chronic Pain PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Prescription opioids are a potent class of drugs for treating pain. However, growing body of research has described iatrogenic consequences of long-term (> 90 days) opioid use in patients with chronic pain including hyperalgesia and impaired executive function. Dopamine is a critical modulator of executive function. While changes in pain and behavior have been noted, little is known about the brain’s morphology, neural and dopaminergic activity that change over time with long-term prescription opioid use. Consistent with the NIDA Strategic Plan objective 1.3, this K25 proposal seeks to “establish the effects of drug use, addiction, and recovery on brain circuits, behavior, and health” using neuroimaging-informed tools. Specifically, the present study combines multiple levels of investigation, including structural and functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Positron Emission Tomography (PET), Quantitative Sensory Testing (QST) and neuropsychological assessments of executive function, and employ machine learning techniques for analysis to identify the effects of long-term prescription opioid use on the brain in chronic pain patients. The applicant will use her advanced quantitative skills in neuroimaging data analysis and modeling to training in QST, and experience in cognitive neuropsychology, epidemiology of chronic pain and addiction to develop an independent research plan in translational pain and successfully compete for future R01 funding. To achieve the training needed to facilitate this investigation, the applicant has consulted with an expert in chronic pain research and opioid therapy, a substance abuse specialist, a neuropsychologist, an epidemiologist, an imaging scientist, and a machine learning leader in neuroimaging field to develop an innovative study and training plan. 40 patients with a diagnostically homogeneous chronic pain condition (i.e., chronic low back pain; CLBP) on long-term opioid therapy, as compared to 40 opioid-naïve CLBP patients, will be studied to achieve the following Aims: 1) Measure pain, cognitive performance, neural and dopaminergic activity during concurrent pain and executive function task fMRI-PET to characterize the effects of opioids on pain processing and executive function in CLBP; 2) measure intrinsic brain activity during resting state fMRI-PET to identify intrinsic brain alterations associated with long-term opioid use in CLBP; and 3) apply high-resolution structural MRI to measure opioid-induced morphological changes in CLBP. This research is innovative in its use of combined QST and neuro- psychological measures with multimodal imaging and sophisticated statistical approaches. It is significant because of its comprehensive approach towards addressing the NIDA Strategic Plan objective. Findings stand to inform medical decision-making regarding pain care and opioid prescription, as well as risk mitigation strategies. The research, training and results obtained will provide a platform for applicant’s long-term scientific research goal of becoming an independent R01-funded, faculty-level principal investigator performing translational pain research aimed at developing neuroimaging tools to have clinical application. PROJECT NARRATIVE / RELEVANCE Inquiry into the effects of long-term prescription opioid use in patients with chronic pain are highly relevant and timely due to the increased epidemic of prescription opioid use in the US. Using quantitative sensory testing, neuropsychological assessments, multimodal neuroimaging and advanced statistical techniques for data analysis, the proposed study seeks to identify the effects of long-term prescription opioid use on the brain and their relation to clinical symptoms. By detecting changes at behavioral, molecular and neural systems levels, this study will be pivotal in the development of effective pain management strategies in chronic pain, and training of Dr. Jarrahi as an independent investigator in the field of translational pain research.",Multivariate Machine Learning to Characterize Opioid-induced Alterations in the Brain in Chronic Pain,9891124,K25DA048179,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'American', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Chronic low back pain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Consult', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Dopamine', 'Dopamine D1 Receptor', 'Dopamine D2 Receptor', 'Drug usage', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'Faculty', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hyperalgesia', 'Iatrogenesis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Infrastructure', 'Insula of Reil', 'Intercept', 'Investigation', 'Link', 'Long-Term Effects', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Neuropsychology', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Opiate Addiction', 'Opioid', 'Opioid Analgesics', 'Pain', 'Pain Research', 'Pain management', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevalence', 'Principal Investigator', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychophysics', 'Questionnaires', 'Raclopride', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Training', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Societies', 'Specialist', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Training', 'addiction', 'base', 'brain circuitry', 'brain morphology', 'chronic pain', 'chronic pain patient', 'chronic painful condition', 'classification algorithm', 'clinical application', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive performance', 'cognitive process', 'cohort', 'data modeling', 'dopamine system', 'executive function', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'gray matter', 'imaging scientist', 'innovation', 'learning classifier', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'neurotransmission', 'opioid tapering', 'opioid therapy', 'opioid use', 'pain behavior', 'pain patient', 'pain processing', 'patient oriented', 'prescription opioid', 'receptor binding', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'responsible research conduct', 'risk mitigation', 'skills', 'tool']",NIDA,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K25,2020,175889,0.2457213915987527
"Autonomous Pain Recognition in Non-Verbal and Critically Ill Patients The under-assessment of pain response is one of the primary barriers to the adequate treatment of pain in critically ill patients, and is associated with many negative outcomes. Nonetheless, many ICU patients are unable to self-report their pain intensity. Currently, behavioral pain scales are used to assess pain in nonverbal patients. Unfortunately, these scales require repetitive manual administration by overburdened nurses, and show variability in pain intensity ratings by nurses. Furthermore, manual pain assessment tools cannot monitor pain continuously and autonomously. The PIs’ long-term goal is to specify pain intensity in an autonomous and precise manner. The overall objective of this application is to build the foundation of an autonomous, clinically- available pain assessment system by developing and validating pain recognition algorithms in a fully uncontrolled ICU setting. The central hypothesis is we can autonomously assess facial pain expressions and patient activity. The rationale is that autonomous pain quantification can reduce nurse workload and can enable real-time pain monitoring. Contextualization of pain with respect to patient function can also lead to improved functional and clinical outcomes. The overall objective will be achieved by pursuing two specific aims. (1) Developing and validating a pervasive sensing system in two 24-beds ICUs (ICU) to determine if deep learning algorithms can accurately assess pain facial expressions from image data, when compared to existing assessment tools. (2) Developing and validating algorithms for pain contextualization using autonomous activity recognition. The approach is innovative, because it departs from status quo by autonomously assessing pain and functional status in the ICU. The proposed research is significant since it will address several key problems and barriers in critical care, including manual repetitive ICU assessments and lack of granular and continuous pain and function measures. Ultimately, the results are expected to improve patient outcomes and decrease hospitalization costs, as well as lifelong complications. The proposed research is relevant to public health because it can result in enhanced critical care workflow, ultimately improving patient outcomes and decreasing hospitalization costs. The proposed research is relevant to NIBIB mission to improve health by leading the development of biomedical technologies, as the proposed research develops advanced computational methods and uses sensing technologies to automatically assess patient pain and function.",Autonomous Pain Recognition in Non-Verbal and Critically Ill Patients,9856443,R21EB027344,"['Acute Pain', 'Address', 'Agitation', 'Algorithms', 'Assessment tool', 'Beds', 'Behavioral', 'Biomedical Technology', 'Care given by nurses', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Color', 'Complement', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Conscious', 'Critical Care', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Equipment', 'Facial Expression', 'Facial Pain', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hospital Costs', 'Image', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering', 'Nurses', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Pain Assessment Tool', 'Pain Measurement', 'Pain intensity', 'Pain management', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prospective Studies', 'Public Health', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'To specify', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Workload', 'base', 'chronic pain', 'deep learning algorithm', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'functional status', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mortality risk', 'pain patient', 'recruit', 'response', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'ventilation']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,R21,2020,218825,0.3322055082402795
"NCATS ASPIRE REDUCTION-TO-PRACTICE CHALLENGE NCATS has recently established the development of A Specialized Platform for Innovative Research Exploration (ASPIRE) to aid in the discovery and development of novel and effective treatments, while at the same time making the process faster and more cost-effective, with a particular focus on pain, OUD and overdose as part of the the Helping to End Addiction Long-termSM Initiative, or NIH HEAL InitiativeSM.  The NCATS ASPIRE Program aims to develop and integrate automated synthetic chemistry, biological screening and artificial intelligence approaches in order to significantly advance our understanding of the relationship between chemical and biological space and enable further access into biologically-relevant chemical space. The ASPIRE platform will utilize currently available knowledge to develop innovative algorithms and predict and synthesize novel structures capable of interacting with specific targets; enable small-scale synthesis of the predicted molecules; and incorporate in-line, rapid biological testing of the molecules. Any new data obtained through this process would then be fed back into the system to further improve design, synthesis and biological characteristics of molecules.  Over 25 million people in the United States experience pain every day (2012 National Health Interview Survey data(link is external)) and need safe, addiction-free treatments to alleviate their suffering.  This clinical demand is of tremendous importance given that overprescribing of opioids for managing acute and chronic pain has fueled the current epidemic of opioid use disorder and overdose deaths, and the effectiveness of opioids for long-term pain management is being questioned.  Safe, effective, and non-addictive drugs (small molecules and biologics) to treat pain, mitigate addiction and reverse overdose are key to addressing the opioid crisis.  Given failures and limitations of previous drug development efforts, drugs that recognize novel targets, have novel structures, and can be identified in human-based, physiologically relevant in vitro systems are needed.  To further advance the NCATS ASPIRE Program and build on the innovations of the ASPIRE Design Challenges, and reward and spur innovative solutions to the development of new drugs for pain, addiction, and overdose, NCATS is issuing this Reduction-to-Practice Challenge to highly collaborative innovators interested in developing working prototypes of novel approaches that would lead to efficacious and non-addictive pain treatments and/or novel treatments for addiction and overdose.  The ultimate goal of the NCATS ASPIRE Program under the HEAL Initiative is the development of a platform that a wide spectrum of scientists can use to advance their translational science relevant to development and pre-clinical testing of new and safer treatments of pain, OUD, and overdose. Further, it is essential that the approach developed in this phase is applicable to any translational problem. n/a",NCATS ASPIRE REDUCTION-TO-PRACTICE CHALLENGE,10285773,213775,"['Acute pain management', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Back', 'Biologic Characteristic', 'Biological', 'Biological Testing', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Failure', 'Goals', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'National Health Interview Survey', 'Opioid', 'Overdose', 'Pain', 'Pain management', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Preclinical Testing', 'Process', 'Research', 'Rewards', 'Scientist', 'Structure', 'Synthesis Chemistry', 'System', 'Time', 'Translational Research', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'addiction', 'base', 'chronic pain', 'cost effective', 'design', 'drug development', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid use disorder', 'overdose death', 'programs', 'prototype', 'screening', 'small molecule']",NCATS, ,N01,2020,1375000,0.1358192316868058
"Data Center for Acute to Chronic Pain Biosignatures Understanding the mechanisms underlying the transition to chronic pain is a key to mitigating the dual epidemics of chronic pain and opioid use in the U.S. In response to RFA-RM-18-031, and as part of the NIH Common Fund Acute to Chronic Pain Signatures (A2CPS) Program, we will establish a Data Integration and Resource Center (DIRC) to integrate imaging, physiology, -omics, behavioral, and clinical data to develop biosignatures for the transition to chronic pain.

"CPS: Cyber-physically assistive clothing to reduce societal incident of low back pain  The objective of this proposal is to address core scientific challenges related to sensing, actuation and control of cyber-physically assistive clothing (CPAC). CPAC is a kind of Human-in-the-loop Cyber-Physical System (HCPS), in which actuated clothing is coordinated in unison with human body movement to enhance safety and health. We propose addressing key HCPS challenges within the context of using CPAC to reduce societal incidence of low back pain, by preventing lumbar (spine) overloading and overuse injuries. Low back pain is targeted because it is one of the leading causes of physical disability and missed work. High and/or repetitive forces on lumbar muscles and discs can occur during daily tasks, and are known to be major risk factors that can lead to back pain and injury. The long-term vision is to create smart clothing that can monitor lumbar loading, train safe movement patterns, and directly assist wearers to reduce the musculoskeletal forces that cause pain and injury. This proposed transformation of clothing is similar to how wristwatches have transformed from timepieces into health monitors; however, CPAC is even more exciting because it combines the form-factor of clothing with the assistance benefits of an exoskeleton to reduce biological tissue loading for a broad range of individuals, occupations and tasks. Thrust 1 will adapt machine learning techniques in order to monitor lumbar loading and detect excessive spine forces via portable, wearable sensors, such that timely feedback/intervention can be provided. This thrust will result in the creation of a publicly shared data set that contains synchronized, multimodal (lab-based and wearable) sensor data collected from >500 actions per subject, the largest such corpus for machine learning in this domain. Thrust 2 will model the dynamics of cyber, physical and human components of CPAC in order to develop optimal control and learning strategies. Thrust 3 will integrate sensors, fusion algorithms and portable actuation into a complete wearable prototype. A human subject experiment will be performed to objectively evaluate the function of CPAC. At the focus of this proposal is the human body; monitored, analyzed and assisted by multidisciplinary CPS technologies. The project integrates expertise in biomechanics, machine learning, sensor fusion, soft robotics, wearable assistive technology, and clinical management of low back pain to transform clothing from materials that cover the body into wearable systems that can track and protect low back health. The key scientific HCPS challenges that need to be overcome, and which are addressed in this proposed research, in order to realize the broad societal benefits of CPAC are: (1) real-time sensing and assistive control of the HCPS and its co-adaptation to different subjects and diverse environments, (2) system design and verification ensuring safe operation and that no harm is done to human subjects through unanticipated feedback, (3) selection and placement of low cost sensors aiding affordable and realistic manufacturing of CPAC, (4) integration of wearable sensors and actuators into a reliable and effective HCPS. CPAC has the potential for broad societal impact given the high prevalence of low back pain. CPAC provides a unique and potentially paradigm-shifting opportunity because it combines the assistive benefits of an exoskeleton with the lightweight and unobtrusive form-factor of everyday clothing. CPAC is expected to (1) fit seamlessly into daily life, (2) connect individuals with health info to empower them to modify their physical activity, (3) generate public health data to inform evidence-based clinical and workplace practices, (4) augment lifting biomechanics to reduce lumbar loading, (5) reduce incidence of low back pain, and costs due to health care and missed work.",CPS: Cyber-physically assistive clothing to reduce societal incident of low back pain ,9979852,R01EB028105,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Back', 'Back Injuries', 'Back Pain', 'Biological', 'Biomechanics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clothing', 'Cumulative Trauma Disorders', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Feedback', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'High Prevalence', 'Human', 'Human body', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Lifting', 'Low Back Pain', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Musculoskeletal', 'Occupations', 'Pain', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Robotics', 'Safety', 'Self-Help Devices', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Vertebral column', 'Vision', 'Work', 'Workplace', 'base', 'cost', 'cyber physical', 'data sharing', 'design', 'evidence base', 'exoskeleton', 'experimental study', 'health data', 'human subject', 'human-in-the-loop', 'learning strategy', 'light weight', 'multidisciplinary', 'multimodality', 'operation', 'physically handicapped', 'portability', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'sensor', 'wearable sensor technology']",NIBIB,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,311593,0.12871907517386968
"Development of a Medical Device Utilizing an EEG-Based Algorithm for the Objective Quantification of Pain Project Summary / Abstract Chronic pain affects over 100 million Americans representing a major public health imperative. Objective biomarkers of pathology exist for several diseases, and their development is one of the great advances of modern allopathic medicine; however, objective assessment of pain has lagged far behind. Currently, there are no objectively verifiable and clinically useful means to identify or quantify the presence or severity of pain. The current standard of care relies on patient self-report, such as the visual analog scale (VAS), which presents a serious barrier to the effective assessment and treatment of pain. Self-reported pain is influenced by nociceptive, affective, and cognitive processes, and though many treatments effect reported pain, they likely do so through a varied set of neurophysiological mechanisms, with different consequences for health and long-term well-being. Some patients have difficulty assigning themselves a pain rating, especially those with pain that falls towards the middle of the rating scale. In addition, communications issues, drug-seeking behavior, the desire of some patients to appear stoic, and other issues can create problems with establishing an accurate pain rating. As a result, despite a long history of research, current assessment and treatment of pain is not optimal, with enormous costs to patients and society. PainQx is currently developing the PQX-MED system, a system that will objectively evaluate an individual’s pain level using quantitative EEG (QEEG). Advanced signal processing, machine learning, classification methodologies and a large reference database will be used to develop algorithms that quantify features of an individual’s EEG that are associated with the perception of pain. Before the PainQx platform is ready for its FDA Validation Study, PainQx needs to demonstrate the ability to assess pain in a representative set of patients with chronic pain. To ensure commercial viability, PainQx also needs to be able to generate its pain biomarker using a limited montage of EEG electrodes which can be rapidly applied prior to data acquisition and processing. PainQx proposes to achieve these objectives through the proposed SBIR project. In Phase I, PainQx will conduct a clinical study of 50 chronic pain patients utilizing 19 lead EEG acquisition, add those cases to an existing database of 19 lead pain cases, and demonstrate that 19 Lead EEG data can be used to assess the intensity of pain a patient is experiencing. In Phase II, PainQx will demonstrate that the relationship between the VAS and a QEEG based biomarker demonstrated using 19 leads can be demonstrated using a subset of EEG recording locations to significantly improve clinical utility. Further, predictive accuracy using the reduced montage will meet targets for performance established using 19 lead data. Project Narrative The nature of self-reported pain rating scales leads to difficulty in accurately identifying, evaluating and therefore, optimally treating pain due to issues such as patient communication difficulties, drug-seeking behavior, differences in pain tolerance, and other challenges. As a result, patients can be either over-treated, leading to (or perpetuating) addiction as manifested by the opioid epidemic, or under-treated, leading to readmissions, lost productivity, unnecessary pain and suffering, and significant costs to the healthcare system. By providing physicians an objective pain measurement tool, PainQx believes it will allow physicians to increase certainty in dosing and treatment selection, thereby addressing the over and under treatment paradigm, and consequently reducing opioid abuse and overall healthcare costs.",Development of a Medical Device Utilizing an EEG-Based Algorithm for the Objective Quantification of Pain,9968212,R44DA046964,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Medical Device', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Modernization', 'Nature', 'Nociception', 'Output', 'Pain', 'Pain Measurement', 'Pain Threshold', 'Pain intensity', 'Pain management', 'Pathology', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Productivity', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regulatory Pathway', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Severities', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Societies', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'Visual Analogue Pain Scale', 'addiction', 'analog', 'base', 'brain electrical activity', 'chronic pain', 'chronic pain patient', 'classification algorithm', 'cognitive process', 'comorbidity', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'drug seeking behavior', 'expectation', 'experience', 'falls', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'meetings', 'neurophysiology', 'opioid abuse', 'opioid epidemic', 'pain perception', 'pain score', 'product development', 'signal processing', 'standard of care', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'validation studies']",NIDA,"PAINQX, INC.",R44,2020,526563,0.3307619398651443
"Engaging Veterans Seeking Service-Connection Payments in Pain Treatment Abstract In 2015 alone, 97,223 new Veterans under age 35 began receiving compensation for injuries related to their military service. In total, there are 559,999 post-9/11 Veterans being compensated for back or neck conditions, and a partially overlapping 596,250 for limitation of flexion in joints. Veterans seeking compensation for musculoskeletal conditions often develop chronic pain and are at high risk for substance misuse. Early intervention is needed to arrest worsening pain and risky substance use, particularly among post-9/11 Veterans for whom engagement in non-pharmacological pain treatment has the potential to improve their overall quality of life and spare them the complications of opioid treatments. The service-connection application is an ideal point-of-contact for initiating early intervention treatments for these at-risk Veterans. We propose to test the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of Screening, Brief Intervention and Referral to Treatment for Pain Management (SBIRT-PM), designed to reduce pain and risky substance use. In brief, the counselor explains that treating both physical and psychological aspects of pain leads to the best outcomes, outlines what VA (and non-VA if preferred) services are available to Veterans, explains that substances are sometimes used for pain relief, and segues into traditional SBIRT. SBIRT-PM's efficacy is supported by a completed clinical trial of 101 Veterans applying for service-connection for MSD, and by studies showing the efficacy of SBIRT for people with risky substance use and of Motivational Interviewing for engagement in non-pharmacological pain care. The study will involve a two-year period to arrange for clinicians at a single “hub” site to counsel Veterans throughout New England by phone with SBIRT-PM, and a four-year period to conduct the clinical trial and disseminate its findings. During the two-years of preparation for the clinical trial, the team will prepare SBIRT-PM for implementation by establishing communication (Relational Coordination is the theoretical framework) between the “hub” where the SBIRT-PM clinician is sited and the “spoke” sites, establishing study- related procedures, and piloting the intervention at each of the eight VA medical centers in New England. For the full clinical trial, we will randomize 1200 Veterans applying for compensation related to MSD to either SBIRT-PM or Usual Care (UC) across eight VA medical centers in New England. Outcome assessment by phone will occur at 12 and 36-week follow-ups, and will be corroborated with other sources of information ---the electronic health record and toxicology testing of nail clippings. We hypothesize that, compared to Usual Care, SBIRT-PM will be more effective and cost-effective in improving Veterans' pain and substance use. We further hypothesize that a mediator of these improvements will be use of non-pharmacological services, as extracted from VA records from structured data fields and from narrative text in the medical record using an innovative natural language processing algorithm. Screening and referral to treatment at service-connection examinations can transform a widely-used point of entry to VA into a health-promoting encounter. Narrative Veterans seeking compensation for musculoskeletal conditions often develop chronic pain and are at high risk for substance misuse. We propose to test the effectiveness and cost- effectiveness of Screening, Brief Intervention and Referral to Treatment for Pain Management (SBIRT-PM), designed to reduce pain and reduce risky substance use, in part by helping Veterans get comprehensive pain treatment. The study will involve a 2-year period to arrange for clinicians at a single site to counsel Veterans throughout New England by phone with SBIRT-PM as part of a clinical trial, and a 4-year period to conduct the trial and disseminate its findings.",Engaging Veterans Seeking Service-Connection Payments in Pain Treatment,10013125,UH3AT009758,"['Age', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Algorithms', 'Award', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Brief Pain Inventory', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communication', 'Conduct Clinical Trials', 'Cost Analysis', 'Counseling', 'Distress', 'Early Intervention', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Financial compensation', 'Health Promotion', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Human Resources', 'Individual', 'Injury compensation', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Joints', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medical Records', 'Medical center', 'Military Personnel', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'Musculoskeletal', 'Musculoskeletal Diseases', 'Nail plate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neck', 'New England', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Assessment', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pain', 'Pain interference', 'Pain management', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Phase', 'Populations at Risk', 'Preparation', 'Procedures', 'Professional counselor', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized', 'Records', 'Risk', 'Secure', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Site Visit', 'Source', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Toxicology', 'Veterans', 'base', 'chronic pain', 'cost effective', 'cost effectiveness', 'cost estimate', 'design', 'early phase clinical trial', 'effectiveness testing', 'experience', 'functional improvement', 'high risk', 'implementation strategy', 'improved', 'informant', 'innovation', 'motivational enhancement therapy', 'multimodality', 'pain outcome', 'pain reduction', 'pain relief', 'pain symptom', 'payment', 'pragmatic trial', 'primary outcome', 'psychologic', 'recruit', 'screening', 'screening, brief intervention, referral, and treatment', 'secondary outcome', 'service utilization', 'structured data', 'substance abuse treatment', 'substance misuse', 'symptomatic improvement', 'treatment as usual', 'willingness to pay']",NCCIH,YALE UNIVERSITY,UH3,2020,1302384,0.2341834452638389
"Identifying neural pathophysiology in juvenile fibromyalgia ABSTRACT Juvenile-onset fibromyalgia (JFM) is a debilitating, chronic pain condition affecting adolescents, primarily females, during a critical period for brain development, and that persists into adulthood for the majority of patients. Due to the lack of definite physical or laboratory findings, JFM has been questioned as a clinical entity, and sometimes regarded as merely an expression of anxiety or depression. This leads to poor understanding, stigmatization, and appropriate disease management, underscoring the need for identifying objective pathophysiology. We have previously used machine learning applied to fMRI data to yield multivariate patterns of distributed brain activity that, together, can identify test subjects as adult FM patients vs. healthy adults with high cross-validated accuracy (93%). However, extrapolating adult FM brain abnormalities to JFM is problematic, given the many factors impacting the developing adolescent brain and the clinical differences between adult and juvenile forms of the disease. The goal of this proposal is to identify brain pathophysiology characteristic of JFM during tailored symptom provocation tasks. There is currently a complete lack of research into the brain correlates of pain in children with widespread pain/JFM. This study will lay the foundation for a line of research in understanding the neurophysiologic underpinnings of JFM, discovering whether brain pathophysiology in JFM differs from adult FM, and assessing treatment effects on specific markers of brain pathophysiology. This study is an R01 ancillary study to the NIH/NIAMS-funded trial (R01 AR070474; Kashikar-Zuck), “Multi-site randomized clinical trial of Fibromyalgia Integrative Training for Juvenile Fibromyalgia (FIT Teens)”. The exceptionally well characterized cohort of JFM patients from the parent trial presents a unique opportunity to study JFM neural correlates. Our time-sensitive study will transform the scientific output of the parent project by identifying neurophysiological correlates of pain, psychological and physical symptoms in this large, representative, extensively-characterized sample of JFM patients before and after treatment. We hypothesize that machine learning applied to fMRI data during tailored symptom-provocation tasks will identify patterns of neural activity predictive of JFM status (vs. healthy), which will correlate with JFM symptom dimensions (pain, non-painful sensory hypersensitivity, fatigue, and depressive symptoms). This ancillary study will utilize the comprehensive psychological and physical functioning profiles already being captured in the parent R01 trial to identify clinically meaningful neurologic measures in JFM and explore the potential for these measures to change with treatment. This line of research has the potential for a profound impact on understanding and identifying JFM pathophysiology and providing neuro-physiologically informed treatment recommendations. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed study will use functional brain imaging to identify patterns of brain activity associated with juvenile fibromyalgia and assess treatment effects on such neural patterns. The proposed research is relevant to the NIH’s Federal Pain Research Strategy because of its potential for a profound impact on understanding JFM neural pathophysiology and developing neuro-physiologically informed treatment recommendations.",Identifying neural pathophysiology in juvenile fibromyalgia,9984270,R01AR074795,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aerobic Exercise', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Aftercare', 'Ancillary Study', 'Anxiety', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Brain imaging', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Exercise', 'Fatigue', 'Female', 'Female Adolescents', 'Fibromyalgia', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Judgment', 'Kentucky', 'Laboratory Finding', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases', 'Neurologic', 'Ohio', 'Output', 'Pain', 'Pain Measurement', 'Pain Research', 'Pain intensity', 'Painless', 'Parents', 'Parietal', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persistent pain', 'Physical Function', 'Physiological', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Sensory', 'Site', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Stigmatization', 'Stimulus', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'chronic painful condition', 'cingulate cortex', 'clinical pain', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'critical period', 'depressive symptoms', 'disability', 'fibromyalgia patients', 'hands-on learning', 'innovation', 'multisensory', 'neural correlate', 'neural patterning', 'neuromuscular', 'neurophysiology', 'pain symptom', 'parent project', 'physical symptom', 'psychologic', 'psychological symptom', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response']",NIAMS,CINCINNATI CHILDRENS HOSP MED CTR,R01,2020,411201,0.10723090661018855
"Identifying opioid response phenotypes in low back pain electronic health data Pain is the leading reason for adult outpatient and emergency department medical visits, impacting over 100 million Americans at a cost of over $600 billion dollars annually. Low back pain (LBP) represents 28% of this health-care problem and is the leading cause of disability, both in the United States and worldwide. Opioids are the most commonly prescribed drug class in the United States, and the majority of these prescriptions are for LBP. Despite the broad application of opioid therapy in LBP, the phenotypes of individuals who experience pain relief from opioid treatment have not been identified, leaving providers without clear guidance for safe and effective therapy. Given this staggering burden of disease and health-care utilization, clinical information regarding LBP widely populates the electronic health record (EHR), providing a valuable data source. However, this information presently has little meaning beyond the individual patient experience because the majority of pain-related data from the EHR is embedded in free text. Using EHR data may provide the crucial bridge to a better understanding of LBP. Thus, the central hypothesis of this proposal is that translating clinical experiences into discrete and analyzable data, specifically modeling opioid response phenotypes for patients with LBP, will identify clinically relevant phenotypic treatment responses. To test this hypothesis, this mentored career development project will adapt and apply natural language processing (NLP), data standardization, mining, and analysis tools to specifically model opioid response phenotypes for patients with LBP to characterize pain intensity, functional status, and pain interference with activity. Through integrated aims, this proposal will, 1) support the annotation of LBP and opioid note corpus, and the mapping of clinical concepts related to pain intensity, functional status, and pain interference with activities; 2) use NLP to identify and relate relevant opioid response phenotypes in patients with LBP in the EHR; and 3) characterize LBP phenotypes associated with opioid dose escalation. Clinical NLP uses statistical modeling to extract and transform high dimensional clinical data, which, when developed with the PI’s domain knowledge, creates a unique opportunity to understand LBP management, outcomes, and therapeutic efficacy. Ultimately this foundation may be used to predict clinical outcomes and responses to therapeutic interventions. Our long-term goal is to move beyond identifying disease phenotype profiles to create a system to identify treatment response phenotypes. Stratifying patients based on pain intensity, functional status, pain interference and other factors, we plan to identify potential cohorts that warrant further study from a genetic focus. This mentored career development grant (K08) will support a clinical expert’s adaptation of tools and training in a systematic method to allow growth toward a programmatic line of research that is incredibly responsive to the NIH pain research agenda and can transition to independent R01-level funding. Low back pain is the leading cause of disability worldwide. Yet, despite this significant health burden, we lack predictive models for clinical care. Unfortunately, clinicians lack clear guidance for treatment, specifically regarding the use of opioids. This proposal would accelerate pain medicine research by translating clinical experiences into discrete and analyzable data, specifically examining opioid response patterns for patients with low back pain in the electronic health record. Ultimately, this would provide a foundation for advancing clinical care as well as future approaches to genomic and personalized medicine.",Identifying opioid response phenotypes in low back pain electronic health data,9897632,K08EB022631,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Adult', 'Advisory Committees', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Biomedical Research', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Documentation', 'Dose', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Low Back Pain', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Ontology', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Output', 'Pain', 'Pain Research', 'Pain intensity', 'Pain interference', 'Pain management', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Prevention', 'Provider', 'Records', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Scientist', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Vocabulary', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'career development', 'clinical care', 'clinical pain', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'data standards', 'disability', 'disease phenotype', 'effective therapy', 'electronic data', 'experience', 'functional status', 'health care service utilization', 'health data', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'novel', 'opioid therapy', 'opioid use', 'outcome prediction', 'pain patient', 'pain relief', 'patient stratification', 'personalized medicine', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive modeling', 'response', 'search engine', 'symposium', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NIBIB,WAKE FOREST UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,K08,2020,184373,0.22021370209189373
"A Stress and Pain Self-management m-Health App for Adult Outpatients with Sickle Cell Disease Project Summary/Abstract Our long-term goal is to reduce stress and improve sickle cell disease (SCD) pain control with less opioid use through an intervention with self-management relaxation/distraction exercises (RDE), named You Cope, We Support (YCWS). Americans living with SCD suffer recurrent episodes of acute and chronic pain, both of which are exacerbated by stress. Building on the successes of our prior formative studies, we now propose a well- designed, appropriately powered study to test efficacy of YCWS on outcomes (pain intensity, stress intensity, opioid use) in adults with SCD. We propose to recruit 170 adults for a randomized controlled trial of the short- term (8 weeks) and long-term (6 months) effects of YCWS on outcomes (pain, stress, and opioid use). Stratified on worst pain intensity (<=5; >5), we will randomly assign patients to groups: 85 to Control (Self- monitoring of outcomes + alerts/reminders), and 85 to Experimental (Self-monitoring of outcomes + alerts/reminders + use of YCWS [RDE + Support]). We will ask participants to report outcomes daily. During weeks 1-8, we will send system-generated alerts/reminders to both groups via phone call, text, or email to facilitate data entry (both groups) and intervention use support (experimental). If the patient does not enter data after 24 hours, study support staff will contact him/her for data entry trouble-shooting (both groups) and YCWS use (experimental). We will time stamp and track participants' online activities to understand the study context and conduct exit interviews on acceptability of the staff and system-generated support. We will analyze data using mixed-effects regression models (short-term, long-term) to account for repeated measurements over time and utilize machine learning to construct and evaluate models predictive of outcomes. Specific aims are: Aim 1: To determine the short-term effects of YCWS. Hypothesis: in the first 8 weeks, compared to the control group, the experimental group will report reductions in pain intensity (primary outcome, 0-10 scale) and secondary outcomes--stress intensity (0-10 scale) and opioid use (oral morphine equivalence [OME]). Aim 2: To determine the long-term effects of YCWS. Hypothesis: in months 3-6, compared to control group, the experimental group will report reductions in pain intensity (primary outcome, 0-10 scale) and secondary outcomes--stress intensity (0-10 scale) and opioid use (oral morphine equivalence [OME]). Aim 3 (exploratory): Using machine learning, to develop and evaluate models that predict patient outcomes based on their group assignment and on their personal (e.g., self-efficacy, sex, education, family income, computer experience, etc.,) and environmental characteristics (e.g., distance from care, quality of cell connection, etc.). Findings will guide future studies on the implementation of the m-Health enabled YCWS self-management intervention in the real world by adults with SCD. Findings also will guide the discovery of an ideal delivery method for YCWS, and personal and environmental characteristics of patients who would benefit from YCWS to control effectively the pain of SCD and other types of pain and its psychological impact. Project Narrative Our long-term goal is to reduce stress and improve pain control with less opioid use in patients with sickle cell disease by promoting an intervention with self-management relaxation/distraction exercises, named You Cope, We Support (YCWS). Building on the successes of our prior formative studies to develop the intervention and study protocol, we now propose a well-designed, appropriately powered study to test effects of YCWS on stress, pain, and opioid use in adults with sickle cell disease. Findings will be useful for advancing the use of relaxation/distraction exercises in future intervention studies among patients with sickle cell disease.",A Stress and Pain Self-management m-Health App for Adult Outpatients with Sickle Cell Disease,10050181,R01NR018848,"['Absenteeism', 'Acute', 'Acute Pain', 'Adult', 'American', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Caring', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clip', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Computers', 'Control Groups', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Dose', 'Education', 'Electronic Mail', 'Exercise', 'Family', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Income', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Interview', 'Life', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Mobile Health Application', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Names', 'Nature', 'Opioid', 'Opioid Analgesics', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Pain', 'Pain intensity', 'Pain management', 'Participant', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychological Impact', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recurrence', 'Relaxation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Schools', 'Self Efficacy', 'Self Management', 'Sickle Cell Anemia', 'Stress', 'Suggestion', 'Support System', 'System', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Work', 'base', 'chronic pain', 'clinical pain', 'cost', 'design', 'distraction', 'efficacy testing', 'experience', 'experimental group', 'group intervention', 'guided inquiry', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'insight', 'intervention effect', 'mHealth', 'morphine equivalent', 'nondrug therapy', 'opioid sparing', 'opioid use', 'outcome prediction', 'overdose death', 'pain self-management', 'predictive modeling', 'primary outcome', 'recruit', 'response', 'secondary outcome', 'sex', 'side effect', 'stressor', 'success', 'therapy design']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,R01,2020,524332,0.15445141658918088
"Mechanical Biomarkers of Chronic Low Back Pain Abstract The intervertebral disc (IVD) has an essential role in transferring load during normal spine function and when this normal function fails, symptoms, degeneration and altered spine mechanics may occur. The overall scientific premise of this work is that there is a gap in knowledge of the relationship between contributions from mechanical, inflammatory and biopsychosocial factors that lead to chronic low back pain (LBP). An important gap is a poor understanding of the relationship between IVD degeneration and LBP. This lack of understanding leads to discordance between imaging and self-reported pain and, ultimately, treatments being delivered by an exclusionary process. To address this gap, we will use innovative in vivo imaging tools to quantify the mechanical function of the IVD. We will also measure quantitative sensory factors, biochemical markers, and biopsychosocial factors that, when combined with mechanical function, may better identify subgroups or phenotypes of LBP. The overall goal of this project is to identify if mechanical function of the IVD is a potential risk factor and whether mechanical function can assist with defining phenotypes of LBP. The findings from this study would lead to longitudinal analyses to determine whether these phenotypes predict the transition from acute to chronic LBP. The rationale for this proposed research is that: 1) altered mechanical function of the IVD contributes to LBP. 2) LBP is a heterogeneous condition that can result from a combination of mechanical, inflammatory, and central pain based sources. The central hypothesis is that in vivo measured IVD mechanical function will be an important potential risk factor for both acute and chronic non-specific LBP and that this measure will improve the phenotyping of LBP. In Aim I, we will quantify the association between in-vivo measured IVD mechanical function among acute and chronic non-specific LBP participants and asymptomatic controls. In Aim II, we will derive well-defined phenotypes of LBP using combinations of potential risk factors. Identifying phenotypes of LBP will allow for specific rehabilitation, surgical, pharmaceutical or behavioral treatments to be targeted, resulting in improved patient outcomes. Project Narrative Low back pain is a complex and costly public health problem. We will use innovative combinations of in vivo imaging to quantify mechanical function of the intervertebral disc and combine this information with other known risk factors to develop subgroups of patients with low back pain. This can lead to specific interventions to improve outcomes for patients with low back pain.",Mechanical Biomarkers of Chronic Low Back Pain,9981627,R01AR075399,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Back Pain', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Markers', 'Biological Markers', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Chronic low back pain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Etiology', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'Intervention', 'Intervertebral disc structure', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Low Back Pain', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanical Low Back Pain', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases', 'Nature', 'Neuropeptides', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pain', 'Pain Research', 'Participant', 'Patient Selection', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Priority', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Site', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Vertebral column', 'Work', 'base', 'biopsychosocial', 'central pain', 'chronic musculoskeletal pain', 'clinical care', 'clinical development', 'clinical imaging', 'clinical phenotype', 'cost', 'demographics', 'experience', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'in vivo', 'in vivo imaging', 'inflammatory pain', 'innovation', 'intervertebral disk degeneration', 'longitudinal analysis', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'patient subsets', 'random forest', 'three-dimensional modeling']",NIAMS,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,623017,0.12786990869128648
"Central glutamate signaling in postoperative pain regulation - Renewal Postoperative pain is a major morbidity, and persistent opioid use after surgery has contributed to an epidemic. An improved mechanistic understanding of how pain is regulated within the brain can lead to novel non-opioid analgesic development. The long-term goal of this proposal is to understand the central regulation of postoperative pain. The objective of the current application is to define the role of prelimbic cortex (PL) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), two key components of the prefrontal cortex in rodents, in the regulation of acute and chronic postoperative pain. The PL is homologous to human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex that is known to undergo synaptic changes with chronic pain, and the ACC is a well-described region for processing affective component of pain across species. Our central hypothesis is that an imbalance in neural activities in the PL and ACC contributes to symptoms of postoperative pain and thus forms a therapeutic target. Our hypothesis is supported by the current literature showing that the PL has a pain-inhibitory role, whereas the ACC enhances pain aversion, and that chronic pain causes increased excitability in the ACC and hypo-excitability in the PL. It is also supported by our recent results demonstrating that AMPAkines and ketamine, drugs that alter glutamate signaling and shape cortical circuits, reduce pain. In Aim 1, we will test the hypothesis that an imbalance in ACC and PL activities contributes to postoperative pain in awake freely behaving rats. We will use paw incision (PI) to mimic acute reversible incisional pain, and spared nerve injury (SNI) to model chronic pain after intraoperative nerve damage. We will first correlate imbalanced prefrontal activities with pain, by showing a concurrent loss of nociceptive response in the PL and gain of response in the ACC as pain behavior persists, and the resolution of such neural changes as pain resolves, using simultaneous in vivo extracellular recordings of the PL and ACC. Further, to test the causal effect of this imbalance on pain, we will show that optogenetic PL activation, or ACC inhibition, reverses postoperative pain behaviors. Next, we will use optrode recordings to dissect a local pain- regulatory circuit fromthe PL to the ACC. Further, we will use an unbiased supervised machine learning analysis to validate the relationship between the imbalance in PL and ACC activities and the chronicity of postoperative pain. In Aim 2, We will test the hypothesis that pharmacologic and electrical neuromodulation can target imbalanced PL/ACC activities in the postoperative pain state. We will show that AMPAkines and ketamine increase PL outputs and reduce ACC activities to inhibit pain and optimize the timing and dosing regimens for these drugs and test therapeutic synergy. We will also optimize invasive and non-invasive electrical stimulation protocols in the PL to treat pain. This project is innovative because it applies a new systems neuroscience approach with cutting-edge techniques to uncover a central pain-regulatory mechanism. The work is significant because it produces novel applications of FDA-approved drugs (ketamine and APMAkines) for postoperative pain and a blueprint for new deep brain or transcranial stimulation methods to treat pain. Precise understanding of the central mechanisms for postoperative pain is needed to develop novel analgesics and address the current opioid epidemic. The proposed research tests the hypothesis that an imbalance in neural activities in the prefrontal regions of the brain contributes to symptoms of postoperative pain. Further, we aim to define novel brain stimulation methods that target cortical mechanism for the treatment of postoperative pain in preclinical models, and test FDA-approved drugs such as ketamine and AMPkines as pain therapeutics based on their impact on cortical circuitry.",Central glutamate signaling in postoperative pain regulation - Renewal,10051047,R01GM115384,"['Acids', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Affective', 'Analgesics', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Chronic', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Enhancers', 'Epidemic', 'FDA approved', 'Funding', 'Glutamates', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'In Vitro', 'Ketamine', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'N-Methyl-D-Aspartate Receptors', 'Nerve', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organism', 'Output', 'Pain', 'Pain Clinics', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Postoperative Pain', 'Postoperative Period', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'Rattus', 'Regimen', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slice', 'Surgical incisions', 'Symptoms', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Work', 'addiction', 'allodynia', 'awake', 'base', 'central pain', 'chronic pain', 'cingulate cortex', 'combat', 'design', 'drug testing', 'extracellular', 'glutamatergic signaling', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'nerve injury', 'neuropsychiatry', 'neuroregulation', 'nociceptive response', 'non-opioid analgesic', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid use', 'optogenetics', 'pain behavior', 'pain inhibition', 'pain model', 'pain reduction', 'pain relief', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'spared nerve', 'supervised learning', 'synergism', 'therapeutic evaluation', 'therapeutic target']",NIGMS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2020,466122,0.3494537859846375
"Multi-Omic Biomarkers for Neuropathic Pain Secondary to Chemotherapy PROJECT SUMMARY Taxanes are among the most efficacious chemotherapeutic agents and are frequently used in the treatment of early stage and metastatic breast cancer, but are known to produce a pain condition known as chemotherapy- induced peripheral neuropathic pain (CIPNP). CIPNP is one of the primary dose-limiting toxicities of taxane administration. No diagnostic tool exists to identify patients that will develop CIPNP in response to taxane therapy. To address this unmet clinical need, this proposal seeks to develop biomarker signatures associated with taxane-induced neuropathic pain to 1) identify patients at risk for developing debilitating taxane neuropathic pain before chemotherapy is initiated and 2) to identify patients on treatment that are at risk of developing neuropathic pain and need dose adjustments to prevent the onset of symptoms. Our long-term goal is to identify biomarker signatures that can identify patients at high risk of developing taxane-induced CIPNP to enable personalized dose adjustments to minimize CIPNP and optimize therapeutic outcomes. During the R61 phase, we will perform genome-wide, epigenome-wide, miRNome-wide, and untargeted metabolome-wide associations of the 11-point pain-intensity Numerical Rating Scale (NRS), Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy 20- item (CIPN20), the Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS), and Patient Reported Outcome Measurement System (PROMIS) scores for physical function, anxiety, depression, and pain interference to identify novel biomarkers associated with identifiable phenotypes (Aim 1A). Next, we will test panels of candidate mRNA and cytokine biomarkers for their association with NRS, CIPN20, PCS, and PROMIS scores (Aim 1B). An added strength of this study is that by collecting samples before, during, and after taxane treatment we will be able to compare those patients who develop CIPNP to those that remain pain free, providing a better understanding of the molecular mechanism predisposing a patient to developing neuropathic pain. R61 milestones include developing biomarker signatures that identify patients at risk of developing neuropathic pain that compromise quality of life (i) before taxane therapy is started and (ii) over the time course of taxane therapy. One rationale is that some patients will have a detectable biomarker profile suggesting a high likelihood of long term (i.e., greater than 1 year) neuropathic pain and a need to either avoid or reduce taxane doses. A second rationale is that some patients may not have a biomarker signature indicating an adverse response to taxane therapy at baseline, but develop one through the course of taxane therapy. This biomarker signature will be used to detect these susceptible patients early and personalize their taxane therapy to minimize CIPNP. In the R33 phase (Aim 2), we will use machine learning to develop and validate algorithms using biomarker signatures from associations with phenotypic changes from Aim 1 (A and B) to predict individuals at risk of developing CIPNP and to identify patients who are at risk of developing an adverse profile as taxane therapy is administered. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because identification of validated biomarker signatures in taxane-treated breast cancer patients associated with increased likelihood of developing neuropathic pain may contribute to the development of novel approaches to personalize chemotherapy in patients, including altering dosing or using a different chemotherapeutic, reducing the risk for developing neuropathic pain and the development of novel approaches to treat or slow the progression of neuropathic pain by modifying pathways prior to taxane-treatment and before initiation of symptoms. The proposed research is relevant to the NIH mission pertaining to the generation of fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems and the application of that knowledge to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability.",Multi-Omic Biomarkers for Neuropathic Pain Secondary to Chemotherapy,10056337,R61NS113258,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood specimen', 'Breast Cancer Patient', 'Cessation of life', 'Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'DNA Methylation', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Dose', 'Dose-Limiting', 'Early treatment', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Messenger RNA', 'Metastatic breast cancer', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Nature', 'Numeric Rating Scale', 'Organism', 'Pain', 'Pain intensity', 'Pain interference', 'Pain-Free', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physical Function', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Questionnaires', 'ROC Curve', 'Recurrence Score', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Secondary to', 'Sensory', 'Standardization', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'biomarker panel', 'blood-based biomarker', 'candidate marker', 'chemokine', 'chemotherapeutic agent', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical practice', 'cytokine', 'disability', 'epigenome', 'experience', 'genome-wide', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'metabolome', 'molecular marker', 'multiple omics', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'novel strategies', 'oncotype', 'pain catastrophizing', 'pain score', 'painful neuropathy', 'personalized chemotherapy', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive marker', 'predictive signature', 'prevent', 'response', 'side effect', 'taxane', 'therapy outcome', 'tool', 'trait', 'transmission process']",NINDS,CLEVELAND CLINIC LERNER COM-CWRU,R61,2020,4775386,0.20982928314647367
"Opioid Drug Ontology (ODO) PROJECT SUMMARY Analgesics are among the most commonly prescribed medications, and opioid painkillers are the gold standard for the management of severe acute pain, and for many chronic pain conditions. More than 30% of the U.S. population suffers from chronic pain, and nearly 40% of older adults report debilitating chronic pain conditions not caused by cancer. However, side effects of opioids, including tolerance, physical dependence, and respiratory depression have limited their effectiveness as pain killers. Rates of addiction and opioid overdose have escalated to a point of crisis. In the United States, on average approximately 115 people die every day from accidental overdose. Better, efficacious and safe opioid analgesic drugs with reduced risk of use are urgently needed. We propose to develop the Opioid Drug Ontology (ODO) – an integrated knowledgebase aimed at accelerating and improving the success of translational research and drug discovery programs towards the identification of efficacious and save opioid drugs. ODO will enable multi-tiered analyses across diverse data types and hypothesis development for example by connecting chemical structure, biochemical binding profiles, pharmacological responses in animals and drug side effects and thus enable more effective rational drug discovery programs. To develop ODO we will leverage our extensive previous work in several research consortia developing formal ontologies, data standards, processing and integration methods, and software systems to enable integrated access, query and analysis of large scale and diverse data types. The current proposal aims to demonstrate the feasibility of the ODO integrated knowledgebase and illustrate proof of concept via two Specific Aims: (1) to curate and harmonize ODO content from diverse data sources via a semantic knowledge model enabling integration of diverse data types, and (2) to deploy the ODO integrated Data Portal and Search Engine engaging the community and demonstrate its heuristic value. We envision that the ODO will pave the way to enable advanced machine learning and link results from molecular simulations with opioid analgesic drug pharmacology and functional selectivity, thus facilitating, at larger scale, the rational, predictive design, and scaffold optimization in drug development efforts towards identifying safer opioid analgesics. PROJECT NARRATIVE Pain is the number one reason people seek medical attention. Although narcotic pain killers are effective, they are highly addictive and have severe side effects. Doctors need better opioid drugs to treat moderate to severe pain. We propose to develop the Opioid Drug Ontology (ODO), the first public opioid drug knowledgebase with the capability to use machine learning tools to help scientists design new drugs to treat pain without harmful side effects.",Opioid Drug Ontology (ODO),9895053,R21DA048313,"['Acute Pain', 'Adverse drug effect', 'Analgesics', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Behavioral', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chemical Structure', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Crystallization', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Drug Design', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'FAIR principles', 'Failure', 'G-Protein-Coupled Receptors', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'In Vitro', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Libraries', 'Ligands', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Mutagenesis', 'Narcotics', 'Network-based', 'Neuropharmacology', 'Ontology', 'Opioid', 'Opioid Analgesics', 'Opioid Receptor', 'Opioid Receptor Binding', 'Overdose', 'Pain', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Physical Dependence', 'Population', 'Process', 'Program Development', 'Publications', 'Receptor Signaling', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Scientist', 'Semantics', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'System', 'Tissues', 'Translational Research', 'United States', 'Ventilatory Depression', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'chronic pain', 'chronic painful condition', 'clinical pain', 'cloud based', 'computer framework', 'computerized data processing', 'data analysis pipeline', 'data harmonization', 'data portal', 'data standards', 'design', 'diverse data', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'experimental study', 'heuristics', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'journal article', 'knowledge base', 'medical attention', 'mu opioid receptors', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid mortality', 'opioid overdose', 'overdose death', 'predictive modeling', 'prescription opioid', 'programs', 'receptor', 'response', 'scaffold', 'screening', 'search engine', 'side effect', 'simulation', 'small molecule', 'software development', 'software systems', 'structured data', 'success', 'tool']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R21,2020,230250,0.13097072477881735
"Influence of inflammation-related genetic variants on PT treatment response in a population affected by CLBP Project Summary Chronic Low Back Pain (CLBP) is a complex multi-factorial condition, as well as the most prevalent painful musculoskeletal disorder worldwide. Its causes and mechanisms are numerous and still poorly understood, which leads to common failure in its clinical treatment (e.g. physical therapy - PT). Systemic inflammation has been gaining attention in the literature as a likely contributing aspect to CLBP, but its causes are diverse and still lack thorough insight. One of these causes seems to be the presence of specific SNPs (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism, the simplest and most common variation in human DNA) in certain genes that are known to be related to both inflammation and pain. It is unclear how these variations may affect the outcomes of different types of PT treatment for CLBP, which is an innovative aspect of the proposed research project. Overall, the main objective is to be able to better tailor specific PT treatment to each patient. More specifically, this research aims to understand if there is an association between gene variations and outcomes of PT treatment; it also intends to better understand the mechanisms behind how gene variations affect inflammation, to support the formation of novel research questions in the area of pain. Furthermore, it seeks to determine clinical sub- phenotypes of CLBP using machine learning (Network Phenotyping Strategy - NPS) based on patients’ responsiveness to PT treatment. From a career standpoint, it aims at supporting my professional development for a future in pain research and academia. The project will use genetic and clinical data from 200-250 patients, gathered from the 1000 patients’ cohort that the Pitt LB3P Mechanistic Research Center will collect; it will include all the patients with CLBP and no diagnosis of inflammatory or auto-immune disease who will undergo PT treatment as part of their standard of care within the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC). The data that will be used for this study includes the variations for selected genes, PT treatment (to be collected as a novel aspect facilitated by this proposed supplement), the outcomes variables (disability and pain scores, pain interference, the impression of change), as well as other clinically relevant information (e.g. age, sex, comorbidities). The analysis will be performed with two different approaches: first, it will be analyzed with the traditional statistical testing for genetic variations, to look for associations between SNPs and PT treatment outcomes. The analysis will include Logistic regression analysis for the association between genetic variations and outcome measures, Fisher's exact test for proper group determination, Cochran’s Q test for multiple groups if a non-paired assumption will be found to be more clinically relevant. Subsequently, the dataset will be analyzed using the NPS approach, which will help delineate clinical outcome-based phenotypes based on clinical response to PT treatment. By adding this new layer of information to the clinical approach, this research seeks to improve the assessment and treatment of CLBP in a PT setting and to make it more resource-efficient and tailored to each patient’s needs. Project Narrative Physical Therapy (PT) is one of the initial standards of care for the treatment of chronic low back pain (CLBP, a challenging condition that affects a large portion of the world population) but provides variable and overall unsatisfactory results. There are many possible contributing causes for CLBP, and one of them is systemic inflammation, which is partly regulated by genes, but to an unknown extent. This research intends to look into how variations in specific genes that are known to influence pain and inflammation may impact the outcomes of PT, to better inform the assessment and treatment patients with CLBP, and reduce the financial burden for the treatment of this condition.",Influence of inflammation-related genetic variants on PT treatment response in a population affected by CLBP,10208162,U19AR076725,"['Academia', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Back Pain', 'Caring', 'Chronic low back pain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Enrollment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Failure', 'Financial Hardship', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Inflammatory', 'Intervention', 'Journals', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical center', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Molecular', 'Musculoskeletal Diseases', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pain', 'Pain Measurement', 'Pain Research', 'Pain interference', 'Pain management', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Phenotype', 'Physical therapy', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Publications', 'Regression Analysis', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resource Allocation', 'Resources', 'Screening procedure', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Societies', 'Solid', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Vertebral column', 'base', 'career', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'diagnostic screening', 'disability', 'genetic variant', 'human DNA', 'impression', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individual variation', 'individualized medicine', 'inflammatory marker', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'learning network', 'meetings', 'microbiome', 'novel', 'pain outcome', 'pain patient', 'pain score', 'patient response', 'physical therapist', 'predict clinical outcome', 'primary outcome', 'programs', 'rehabilitation science', 'response', 'sex', 'standard of care', 'success', 'symposium', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NIAMS,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,U19,2020,100000,0.13119994791583284
"A Multimodal Approach for Monitoring Prolonged Acute Pain in Neonates Most hospitalized infants experience painful procedures as a part of their care. Repeated or prolonged exposure to pain during early life is associated with permanent changes in brain structure and function and may lead to behavioral and developmental disabilities. Caregivers recognize the need to treat pain in infants but may be reluctant to administer analgesics because of potential short- and long-term side effects. Assessing pain in this vulnerable patient population is difficult as their responses are nonspecific and vary based on developmental stage. This difficulty may lead to both over- and under-treatment of pain, placing infants at risk for permanent neurologic injury. We propose to develop models and computer algorithms to automatically and continuously assess pain in neonates based on behavioral and physiological pain indicators.  To achieve this goal, the proposal has two aims: aim 1- Continuously and synchronously record contextual, behavioral and physiological signals from neonates in the NICU while they are undergoing prolonged acute pain; aim 2 - developing a multimodal system for assessing postoperative pain in neonates. The proposed system would generate continuous and standardized pain scores comparable to those obtained by conventional nurse-derived pain scores. It would improve care outcomes by enhancing the assessment of pain while decreasing the burden of pain documentation. It can also eliminate issues of inter-rater reliability associated with conventional neonatal pain assessment. The proposed data collection plan was designed based on our preliminary results and statistical analysis. The proposed system will be evaluated using standard performance metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, Cohen’s kappa coefficient, or their variations.  The interdisciplinary team includes a neonatologist, Dr. Ho, who is a faculty of both USF College of Medicine and College of Nursing. She practices and oversees the clinical research projects at the Tampa General Hospital NICU (the teaching hospital for USF Health). She ensures the team’s access to the NICU patient population for enrollment. She supervises the performance of the study including nursing pain assessment, video recording, and data collection. The team also includes a professor in nursing who specializes in neonatal opioids dependence and pain, an experienced research nurse, two computer science professors, and one statistics professor. The proposed work aligns very well with the NINR’s mission “to promote and improve the health of individuals, families, and communities.” The proposed neonatal pain assessment approach will provide a tool for nurses to assess pain continuously and more accurately. Pain is one of the critical factors affecting the brain development in neonates, especially in preterm neonates, with chronic illnesses. The incidence of perterm neonates exposed to pain in high and pain assessment and management remain a primary focus of neonatal nursing research. For infants in the NICU coping with pain, the proposed nursing research will enable proper pain treatment that will also improve their long-term outcomes and development. Project Narrative Hospitalized infants may experience hundreds of painful procedures, repeated or prolonged exposure to pain during this early developmental period is associated with permanent alterations in brain structure and function. Assessing pain in this vulnerable population of patients is difficult because their responses are nonspecific and vary based on developmental stage.

"Prognostic biomarkers for high-impact chronic pain: Development and validation PROJECT SUMMARY  Chronic pain represents a public health crisis that affects more than 100 million Americans and costs over $500 billion dollars annually. Chronic musculoskeletal pain conditions comprise 70-80% of all chronic pain. An estimated 8% of US adults suffer from high-impact chronic pain, or pain associated with substantially restricted work, social, and self-care activities for six or more months. Chronic pain—and high-impact chronic pain in particular—is often treated with prescription opioids and is linked to opioid-use disorder. Multidisciplinary chronic pain treatments show incomplete recovery at the population level. However, subgroups of individuals completely respond, do not change, or even worsen following pain management. Thus, robust and validated diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers are needed to identify those with high-impact chronic pain and determine the trajectory of outcome (i.e., recovery versus persistence), respectively. Therefore, our overall goal is to discover and validate diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for musculoskeletal high-impact chronic pain. This goal will require comprehensive, multidimensional assessments with an integrated dataset and a sophisticated computational analysis pipeline to yield reliable and validated diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers. To this end, we have assembled an interdisciplinary research and clinical team to implement the HEAL initiative. The goal of this initiative is to elucidate diagnostic and prognostic biomarker signatures of chronic pain by integrating CNS, multiomic, sensory, functional, psychosocial, and demographic domains. We will achieve this goal through two specific aims: (1) develop diagnostic and prognostic markers of musculoskeletal high-impact chronic pain following multidisciplinary pain treatment (R61 Discovery Phase) and (2) analytically validate the multimodal signatures developed in the first aim (R33 Validation Phase). This proposal will yield valid and clinically useful diagnostic and prognostic biomarker signatures to facilitate risk and treatment stratification in patients with musculoskeletal chronic pain. Such biomarkers are essential to develop safer, more effective patient-specific treatment strategies, particularly for those who are refractory to current pain management options. We will also identify potentially modifiable biological and behavioral factors that can change the course of the pain trajectory and thereby reduce the impact of chronic pain on the individual and society as a whole. PROJECT NARRATIVE  More than 100 million Americans live with chronic pain, 20 million of whom suffer from high-impact chronic pain that substantially restricts work, social, and self-care activities for six or more months. Our proposed HEAL initiative aims to discover and validate clinically useful diagnostic and prognostic biomarker signatures to identify those with musculoskeletal high-impact chronic pain and determine the trajectory of outcome.

"Cerebral oscillations of pain Summary Chronic pain disorders are amongst the most burdensome of all diseases in terms of their impact on the individual and the costs to society. The development of novel therapeutic approaches for chronic pain have relied on basic studies involving genetic and molecular approaches in rodent models of pain, but existing drugs generally provide very limited relief for only a small number of patients. The result is that a vast number of people with chronic pain go untreated and have only partial relief. There is substantial and growing evidence from within and outside the pain research fields that indicates neural oscillations reflect cognitive, emotional, and sensory processes, which are all components of the pain experience. Furthermore, we can target these oscillatory patterns to alter perception. In particular, alpha band activity has been associated with chronic pain, and our extensive recent work and preliminary findings indicate that alpha can reliably predict future sensitivity to pain experienced minutes to weeks in the future in healthy subjects. In the proposed studies, we use simultaneous EEG-fMRI to continue our ongoing work on alpha oscillations as pain mechanisms and extend it to test the specificity and sensitivity of the signals and the relationship between alpha, brain networks, and pain. The proposed work would lead to improved understanding of the neurobiology of pain, identify novel brain targets for new or improved interventions, and potentially reveal a prognostic biomarker that would be useful for testing new therapeutic approaches and objectively assessing clinical improvement on an individual basis. Narrative Development of treatments for chronic pain has been limited, but the potential for using brain signal predictive and prognostic biomarkers is growing. In the proposed studies we aim to understand the mechanisms of an electroencephalogram (EEG) based brain oscillation that predicts pain sensitivity in healthy subjects. The findings will provide a major step forward in the development of novel therapies for chronic pain and individualized treatment approaches.",Cerebral oscillations of pain,10017358,R01NS112356,"['Affect', 'Alpha Rhythm', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Cerebrum', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Electroencephalogram', 'Emotional', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuscripts', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Neurobiology', 'Pain', 'Pain Research', 'Pain intensity', 'Pain management', 'Pain-Free', 'Painless', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Persistent pain', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Predictive Factor', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Reproducibility', 'Rest', 'Rodent Model', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sensory', 'Sensory Process', 'Signal Transduction', 'Societies', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Task Performances', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'blood oxygen level dependent', 'chronic pain', 'chronic painful condition', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive performance', 'cognitive task', 'cost', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'machine learning method', 'mindfulness intervention', 'neuroimaging', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'novel therapeutics', 'pain model', 'pain sensitivity', 'predictive marker', 'psychosocial', 'relating to nervous system', 'side effect', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy development', 'vector']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,R01,2020,414885,0.3191205502850306
"Electrocardiographic Detection of Non-ST Elevation Myocardial Events for Accelerated Classification of Chest Pain Encounters (ECG-SMART) Electrocardiographic Detection of Non-ST Elevation Myocardial Events for Accelerated  Classification of Chest Pain Encounters (ECG-SMART) ABSTRACT There is a clear need to develop improved tools to stratify risk in patients who seek emergency care for chest pain, one of the most common and potentially deadliest conditions encountered in acute care settings. The ECG has been the mainstay of initial evaluation of chest pain patients, yet is currently only diagnostic for a small subset of patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction. Our well-rounded and collaborative team has been working together for the past four years to develop novel ECG interpretation algorithms that can greatly enhance the utility of the ECG in the early evaluation of acute coronary disease. This line of work is already substantiated by pilot studies that have identified candidate markers of ECG characteristics and preliminary algorithms that can identify patients with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction as well as those with very low risk of coronary artery disease. With these improved tools, emergency providers (physicians, nurses, and paramedics) will be able to streamline the care provided to these patients beyond the costly and time- consuming overnight observation for serial cardiac enzymes and provocative testing. This grant will provide needed resources for our team to enroll a cohort of over 1,800 patients needed to confirm the accuracy of these ECG markers and determine their maximal clinical utility as part of a risk stratification tool. It builds directly on our existing work in this area, which has already yielded necessary preliminary data and multiple joint publications. Validating this technology will set the groundwork for the future development and testing of targeted interventions to improve patient outcomes in non-ST elevation myocardial infarction. SUMMARY/NARRATIVE Current guidelines for diagnosing and treating myocardial infarction (MI) are based on identifying ST elevation (STE) on the 12-lead ECG, yet only one third of MI patients exhibit such elevation. We propose to (1) extend our prior research of novel repolarization indices of non-STE MI available on the initial ECG and (2) incorporate this information into real-time machine-learning algorithms for clinical decision support, which will improve our sensitivity in detecting and treating MI very early during urgent care. Such early and non-invasively acquired diagnostics can improve outcomes and save costs for millions of patients with chest pain annually.",Electrocardiographic Detection of Non-ST Elevation Myocardial Events for Accelerated Classification of Chest Pain Encounters (ECG-SMART),9856506,R01HL137761,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Action Potentials', 'Acute', 'Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Area', 'Aspirin', 'Attenuated', 'Benign', 'Biological Markers', 'Cardiac', 'Caring', 'Catheterization', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chest Pain', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Consumption', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary Occlusions', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Distress', 'Dose', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Emergency Care', 'Emergency Situation', 'Emergency department visit', 'Emergency medical service', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Enzymes', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Harvest', 'Health Care Costs', 'Heart Injuries', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Infarction', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Ischemia', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Muscle strain', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Myocardial Ischemia', 'Myocardium', 'Necrosis', 'Nitrates', 'Nurses', 'Outcome', 'Oxygen', 'Pain Measurement', 'Paramedical Personnel', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Pre-hospital setting', 'Pre-hospitalization care', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'ROC Curve', 'Records', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resource Allocation', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Serum', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Stress Tests', 'Supervision', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Triage', 'Troponin', 'Unstable angina', 'Ventricular', 'Work', 'acute care', 'base', 'billing data', 'candidate marker', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical examination', 'cohort', 'cost', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'digital', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'indexing', 'injured', 'innovation', 'ischemic injury', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality', 'novel', 'pain patient', 'patient subsets', 'perfusion imaging', 'primary outcome', 'prognostic value', 'reduce symptoms', 'secondary outcome', 'statistical and machine learning', 'support tools', 'tertiary care', 'tool', 'urgent care']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2020,369672,0.116083377147864
"Efficient and Cost-Effective Multimodal System for Pain Management in Low Back Pain Project Summary/Abstract Pain is among the most pervasive and universal forms of human distress. Pain typically is measured by patient self-report or clinician impressions, either through clinical interview or the visual analog scale. However, self- reported pain is difficult to interpret and in some circumstances not possible to obtain [Hadjistavropoulos et al., 2002]. To improve the standard of care and advance pain assessment, monitoring, and intervention, we propose (1) a savvy technology based on automatic facial, head, and body movement analysis for a reliable and valid assessment of the occurrence and intensity associated with five causes of acute and chronic low back pain (LBP); (2) inform our understanding of psychosocial and behavioral indicators of chronic LBP to develop new means to prevent chronic LBP. Participants' face, head, and body movement will be recorded during clinical assessment using two synchronized high-definition digital video cameras during extension, flexion, and rotation movements. The obtained video-recordings, taken during a first visit to the clinic and 3 follow-up visits after treatment, will be used for the development of automatic measures of the occurrence and intensity of pain. To investigate the generalizability of the proposed automatic measures, we will explicitly train and test the proposed classifiers on five different types of acute and chronic LBP. To do so, face, head, and body movement will be automatically tracked using our fully- automatic methods. The tracking results will be used to train end-to-end deep-leaning based classifiers to automatically measure the occurrence and intensity of LBP. To investigate the validity of the proposed classifiers, we will compare automated measurement to the patient- and clinician- rated visual analog scale, brief pain inventory, and continuous observer ratings of pain intensity from the video recordings. MANOVA will be used to quantify the relationship between the individual modalities and their combination for the measurement of the occurrence and intensity of the five LBP conditions and for chronic and acute conditions. To inform our understanding of how LBP evolves into a chronic form, we will use Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) to collect behavioral and contextual information beyond the video-recordings and pain scores' assessments. Participants will be monitored for 6 months after treatment, at a frequency of 7 consecutive days per month (1 week per month), and 4 prompts per day, to identify those who evolved to chronic LBP. EMA measures will be used to investigate whether pain intensity differs by psychosocial and behavioral factors both between and within LBP groups as well as whether psychosocial and behavioral factors are associated with the development of chronic LBP. Project Narrative Pain typically is measured by patient self-report, but self-reported pain is difficult to interpret and may be impaired or not possible to obtain. We will use clinically well-characterized data to: (1) develop an automatic multimodal method for the detection of occurrence and intensity of pain in five of the most common and disabling acute and chronic LBP conditions; (2) use EMA to characterize early point psychosocial and behavioral signs that acute pain is likely to become chronic.",Efficient and Cost-Effective Multimodal System for Pain Management in Low Back Pain,9886461,R01NR018451,"['Acute', 'Acute Pain', 'Aftercare', 'American', 'Articular Range of Motion', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Assay', 'Brief Pain Inventory', 'Cellular Phone', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Chronic low back pain', 'Clinic', 'Clinic Visits', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical assessments', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Consent', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Depressed mood', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Distress', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Face', 'Family member', 'Frequencies', 'Friends', 'Gender', 'Head', 'Head Movements', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Low Back Pain', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'Musculoskeletal Pain', 'Pain', 'Pain Disorder', 'Pain Measurement', 'Pain intensity', 'Pain management', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Procedures', 'Provider', 'Psychological Factors', 'Psychosocial Factor', 'Psychosocial Stress', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Rotation', 'Sacroiliac joint structure', 'Sampling', 'Slipped Disk', 'Spinal Stenosis', 'Subgroup', 'Suggestion', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Video Recording', 'Visit', 'Visual', 'analog', 'anxious', 'base', 'chronic pain', 'clinical practice', 'comorbidity', 'cost effective', 'developmental disease', 'digital', 'follow-up', 'impression', 'improved', 'movement analysis', 'multimodality', 'neurocognitive disorder', 'pain score', 'prevent', 'psychosocial', 'social factors', 'standard of care', 'treatment response']",NINR,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,486755,0.25366453263302924
"Effects of Music Based Intervention (MBI) on Neurodevelopment and Pain Response in Preterm Infants Project Summary  In 2018, the World Health Organization reported 15 million (>1 in 10) preterm births with rising annual rates. 50% of preterm infants suffer from neurodevelopmental impairments, and all preterm infants experience high volumes of painful procedures as part of medical care. Preterm music intervention shows immediate physiologic improvements in heart rate and oxygen saturation, as well as improved physiologic responses to pain. What remains unknown is how music impacts preterm brain maturation, neurodevelopment, and pain responses in preterm infants. We propose a R61 project to explore biological mechanisms of music based intervention (MBI) on preterm brain maturation and neurodevelopment using electroencephalography (EEG) and event related potentials (ERPs). EEG captures electrical potential oscillations of the brain which yields valuable information about brain function. Serial EEGs can track brain maturation in preterm infants. ERPs quantify electrical brain potentials changes time-locked with a stimulus. ERPs at 1 month corrected age test recognition memory function and cognitive processing and offers another objective measure to study the early effects of the MBI’s on neurodevelopment. The R61 will also explore the behavioral processes underlying effects of MBI on pain using EEG and the premature infant pain profile (PIPP). In preterm infants, central EEG amplitudes change when time-locked to a painful stimulus and PIPP scores scale pain responses with painful procedures. Specific recorded lullabies with simple arpeggiated accompaniment will be played for 6 weeks in a small randomized, blinded, controlled study of 50 medically stable 30 week preterms. Exploratory R61 findings will be assessed by specific Go/NoGo milestones that provide insight into the effects of MBI on biological mechanisms underlying neurodevelopment and behavioral processes underlying pain. By achieving one of the Go/NoGo milestones, the proposal progresses to the R33 proof of concept pilot clinical trial with an additional 100 randomized subjects that will assess two primary outcomes measures: 1) MBI effects on Late Neurodevelopment using Bayley’s III neurodevelopmental testing at 6 month corrected age, and 2) Cumulative effects of MBI on Pain Response using longitudinal comparisons of baseline PIPP scores and final PIPP scores after 4 weeks of MBI. Secondary measures would explore more nuanced aspects of neurodevelopment: 1) MBI effects on brain maturation with expanded analyses of EEG-sleep components; 2) repeat ERP analysis at 6 months corrected age with expanded memory and cognitive testing (additional mismatch negativity paradigms); and pain response: 3) MBI effects on pain related EEG responses with comparative analyses of central EEG amplitude changes to the frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital lobes. Project Narrative This project addresses the following public health concerns: 1) high rates of neurodevelopmental impairments from preterm birth and 2) detrimental neurodevelopmental sequelae as a result of current preterm pain management regimens. We will initiate a two phased pilot clinical trial (randomized, double blinded, controlled) to support mechanistic research on the effects of music based intervention on neurodevelopment and pain response in preterm infants, with the second phase, as a proof of concept clinical trial evaluating the effects of music based intervention on late neurodevelopment and the cumulative effects of music on pain response. The public health relevance of this study is to provide groundbreaking results on effects of music based intervention in preterm infant health to inform future strategies on music research, given that music intervention is low risk, minimally invasive with a high potential health impact.",Effects of Music Based Intervention (MBI) on Neurodevelopment and Pain Response in Preterm Infants,10016175,R61AT010712,"['Address', 'Age', 'Attention', 'Attenuated', 'Auditory', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Blinded', 'Brain', 'Caring', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Controlled Study', 'Data', 'Development', 'Discrimination', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Electroencephalography', 'Event-Related Potentials', 'Future', 'Health', 'Heart Rate', 'Infant', 'Infant Health', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Knowledge', 'Late Effects', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Memory', 'Music', 'Music Therapy', 'Neonatal Intensive Care Units', 'Neonatology', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurodevelopmental Impairment', 'Occipital lobe', 'Outcome Measure', 'Oxygen', 'Pain', 'Pain management', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Pediatric Neurology', 'Perceptual learning', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Premature Birth', 'Premature Infant', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Regimen', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Wake Cycle', 'Stimulus', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Time', 'World Health Organization', 'attenuation', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'early childhood', 'electrical potential', 'experience', 'frontal lobe', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'intervention effect', 'memory recognition', 'minimally invasive', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurodevelopment', 'non rapid eye movement', 'novel', 'primary outcome', 'public health relevance', 'rapid eye movement', 'recruit', 'response', 'standard of care', 'statistics', 'tool', 'trend']",NCCIH,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R61,2020,150001,0.1443572344806988

"Novel PET/MR Imaging Approach for Persistent Postsurgical Pain Following Joint Replacement Project Abstract Overview: This project aims to develop a novel 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) PET/MRI method with novel metal artifact correction techniques to provide early identification of painful complications in the prosthetic joint area causing persistent postsurgical pain (PPSP) following total hip arthroplasty (THA). Relevance: THA is one of the most rapidly growing procedures to treat the end-stage hip joint pain and dysfunction and is estimated to reach 572,000 annual cases by 2030. Unfortunately, a substantial number of patients experience PPSP after the procedure, which, without proper treatment, can significantly impair the quality of life. However, the early identification of pain generators for these patients is very difficult because the current diagnostic methods including X-ray, CT, and MRI, have limited sensitivity to pain and suffer from severe artifacts induced by metal in prostheses. Therefore, there is a pressing need for a novel diagnostic approach to accurately identify the abnormal inflammatory changes causing pain without prohibitive metal artifacts to guide the appropriate treatment matched to the exact cause of pain. Approach: We propose the use of 18F-FDG PET/MRI for early identification of sources of PPSP following THA. Our previous 18F-FDG PET/MRI study of chronic pain syndromes demonstrated promising improvements in detecting sites of painful inflammation. However, the severe metal artifacts near metallic prostheses limit the application of 18F-FDG PET/MRI to THA patients. Therefore, our first aim in this project is the development of metal-aware attenuation correction for PET to enable reliable 18F-FDG PET near the metallic prosthesis. Our second aim is the development of high-resolution hip MRI at 3T with metal artifact correction to maximize our ability to identify morphologic causes of PPSP symptoms. Our third aim is to validate the improvements in detection of the painful lesions using serial 18F-FDG PET/MRI sessions. This will be accomplished by correlating the pain score measurements with 18F-FDG PET/MRI abnormalities at 6 months, 12 months, and 18 months following the unilateral THA procedure. Summary: We propose to develop a novel 18F-FDG PET/MRI method with metal artifact correction techniques for early detection of complications causing PPSP following THA. Successful implementation of our method will enable early indication of individualized, effective treatments for THA patients with PPSP. Project Narrative More than a million cases of total joint arthroplasty, including those with total hip arthroplasty (THA), are performed in the U.S. each year, but 7% to 34% of the patients are reported to develop persistent postsurgical pain (PPSP) after these procedures. Unfortunately, the effective pain management for those patients is significantly limited by current diagnostic methods that have insufficient sensitivity to painful complications and severe imaging artifacts from the metallic prosthesis. Focusing on patients who have undergone THA, this project will develop metal artifact correction techniques for 18F-FDG PET/MRI to implement metabolic (18F-FDG PET) and morphologic (MRI) examination of PPSP following THA for enabling the early detection of painful pathology, and thus guiding appropriate treatments.",Novel PET/MR Imaging Approach for Persistent Postsurgical Pain Following Joint Replacement,10226582,R56AR077706,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Analgesics', 'Area', 'Arthralgia', 'Awareness', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Early treatment', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Hip Joint', 'Hip Prosthesis', 'Hip region structure', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Implant', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Joint Prosthesis', 'Joints', 'Lesion', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Medical History', 'Metabolic', 'Metals', 'Methods', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Morphology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Orthopedic Surgery procedures', 'Outcome', 'PET/CT scan', 'Pain', 'Pain management', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Physical shape', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Postoperative Pain', 'Procedures', 'Prosthesis', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of life', 'Radiation', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Replacement Arthroplasty', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Scanning', 'Schedule', 'Site', 'Source', 'Surveys', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Tracer', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Water', 'attenuation', 'base', 'chronic pain', 'clinical examination', 'effective therapy', 'effectiveness validation', 'experience', 'fluorodeoxyglucose', 'fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography', 'hip replacement arthroplasty', 'imaging approach', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'metallicity', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'pain score', 'pain symptom', 'serial imaging', 'soft tissue', 'success', 'uptake', 'validation studies']",NIAMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R56,2020,577581,0.095108400370236
"PATHWAYS TO NEW BIOMARKERS IN RECURRENT ABDOMINAL PAIN IN CHILDREN PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Abdominal pain-related functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs; previously called Recurrent Abdominal Pain) affect 10-20% of children and adults worldwide exerting a tremendous economic, social, and emotional burden. Up to 66% of children go on to have similar symptoms as adults. In children, the two most common FGIDs are functional abdominal pain (FAP) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS - essentially FAP with changes in stooling pattern). Management and treatment are hampered by lack of biomarkers to characterize and understand pathophysiologically what are phenotypically and arbitrarily defined conditions. Previous studies have evaluated IBS, not FAP, and relied primarily on retrospective symptom evaluation and utilized methodology (e.g., 16S sequencing) that limits in depth interrogation of perturbations (e.g., gut dysbiosis) reported in children and adults with IBS. Further, `omics (metabolomics, lipidomics, metaproteomics) data is largely missing from studies of FGIDs and is urgently required - our preliminary data show that it likely provides critical mechanistic insight into the links between abdominal pain symptoms and the pathobiologic alterations of gut dysbiosis, barrier dysfunction, and neuroimmune dysfunction which we and others have described in FGIDs. Our preliminary data support the hypothesis that these alterations can pathobiologically discriminate FGIDs from healthy controls as well as identify disease mechanisms of pain in FGIDs. We propose to build on our previous work and use previously collected prospective abdominal pain and stooling diaries and stool samples collected from a large and well-vetted group of children with FGIDs (IBS n=133, FAP n=47) and healthy controls (HC, n=112). Our Hypothesis is that microbial community characterization and `omics profiling will provide biomarkers to differentiate FGIDs (IBS and FAP) from HC and generate insight into the genesis of pain symptoms (and stooling characteristics in IBS). Our Specific Aims are to use: 1) Global unbiased whole genome shotgun sequencing, metabolomics, lipidomics and metaproteomics (`omics) on stool samples to differentiate children with FGIDs vs HC using classifier models; Sub-Aim – explore potential differences between FAP and IBS and HC; and 2) Proprietary Texas Children's Hospital Microbiome Center reference databases and state-of-the art bioinformatics approaches (e.g., supervised learning, bipartite, Bayesian models) to identify disorder-specific biomarkers and therapeutic targets within children with FGIDs: Sub-Aim 2a - Characterize the relationships between `omics and abdominal pain symptoms (and stooling symptoms in IBS). Sub-Aim 2b – Characterize the relationships between `omics and abnormal physiology (impaired barrier function, neuroimmune dysfunction). It is anticipated that this innovative, multidisciplinary study will better inform patient management and offer unique therapeutic strategies based on novel insights provided by FGID biomarkers. The goals of this application fit with NINR PA- 18-140, the recently published NINR Symptom Science Model, and the NIH Common Fund and Precision Medicine Initiatives. PROJECT NARRATIVE Abdominal pain-related functional gastrointestinal disorders affect 10-20% of children and adults worldwide exerting a tremendous economic, social, and emotional burden. There is a critical need to understand what factors contribute to pain in these disorders so that effective management and treatment strategies can be designed.

"Neuroimaging-Based Brain and Spinal Cord Biomarkers for Cervical Radiculopathy Chronic pain is a widespread problem that affects a third of Americans and greatly burdens the health care system. Despite its prevalence, chronic pain remains poorly understood, and the current clinical strategies are minimally effective. The application of advanced neuroimaging techniques to the study of chronic pain has significantly increased our understanding of the brain’s role in the development and maintenance of chronic pain, and through these studies, researchers have uncovered previously unknown neural processes involved in pain chronification. The spinal cord is the caudal extension of the brainstem and is actively involved in the modulation and transmission of neural signals between the body and the brain. Alterations in the neural processing in the spinal cord are also thought to have an integral role in pain chronification. Recent advancements in spinal cord neuroimaging have made the quantitative study of the spinal cord’s role in chronic pain possible. Expanding the neuroimaging-based investigation of chronic pain to the spinal cord will provide a complete perspective of the central processes underlying pain chronification. In this mentored career development award (K23), Dr. Weber will identify, characterize, and longitudinally track neuroimaging-based biomarkers for chronic pain in the brain and spinal cord using cervical radiculopathy as a model condition for chronic pain. Cervical radiculopathy is a common cause of neck and upper limb pain and provides a unique opportunity to scientifically study chronic pain in a homogenous patient sample. In Aims 1 and 2, Dr. Weber will identify differences in the brain and spinal cord networks between patients with chronic pain due to right-sided cervical radiculopathy and age- and sex-matched healthy controls. In Aim 3, clinical measures in the same cohort of cervical radiculopathy patients will be longitudinally tracked at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after the imaging session, and neuroimaging-based prognostic factors contributing to pain reduction in cervical radiculopathy will be identified. In the same cohort of patients, the imaging will be repeated at 12 months, and the links between the changes in the brain and spinal cord and recovery will be explored. This research will move the pain field forward by further elucidating the neural processes underlying chronic pain and its recovery. Throughout the award period, Dr. Weber will obtain new skills and expertise in conducting clinical studies including randomized controlled trials and applying advanced computational methods to clinical pain research. Additionally, Dr. Weber will gain further training in advanced neuroimaging methods, pain neurobiology, career development, and grant writing. To accomplish the proposed research and training, Dr. Weber has assembled a multi-disciplinary team of world-class mentors who are committed to his success. This training will build on Dr. Weber’s clinical background and doctoral research training in neuroscience and ultimately provide him with the knowledge and skillset to establish an independent research program, in which, he will lead impactful scientific research that intersects neuroimaging and clinical pain research. New advances in medical imaging are uncovering the central nervous system’s role in chronic pain. Here, we aim to use advanced neuroimaging techniques to identify and characterize neuroimaging-based biomarkers for chronic pain in the brain and spinal cord of cervical radiculopathy patients. The information gained from this study will increase our understanding of the neural processes underlying chronic pain and its treatment.",Neuroimaging-Based Brain and Spinal Cord Biomarkers for Cervical Radiculopathy,10000175,K23NS104211,"['Acute', 'Acute Pain', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'American', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Base of the Brain', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Stem', 'Brain imaging', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cervical Radiculopathies', 'Cervical nerves', 'Cervical spinal cord structure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Etiology', 'Faculty', 'Failure', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Household', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Musculoskeletal Pain', 'Neck', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurobiology', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Neurosciences', 'Pain', 'Pain Research', 'Pain intensity', 'Pathology', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral', 'Plant Roots', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Prognostic Factor', 'Public Health', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sensory', 'Severities', 'Side', 'Spinal Cord', 'Structure', 'Synaptic Transmission', 'Techniques', 'Thalamic structure', 'Training', 'Upper Extremity', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'career development', 'chronic pain', 'chronic pain management', 'chronic pain patient', 'chronic painful condition', 'clinical pain', 'cohort', 'design', 'diffusion weighted', 'disability', 'falls', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'irritation', 'multidisciplinary', 'neural network', 'neuroimaging', 'neurotransmission', 'novel', 'pain model', 'pain reduction', 'patient oriented research', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'sex', 'skills', 'spinal cord imaging', 'statistical learning', 'success', 'tenure track']",NINDS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K23,2020,175122,0.25902490239045584
"Mechanistic Characterization of Pain in Temporomandibular Disorders: Does Pain Centralization Influence Responsiveness to Peripherally Targeted Treatments? Project Summary / Abstract Temporomandibular disorders (TMD), characterized by persistent pain in the cheek and jaw area of the face, affect approximately 1 in 10 women at some point in their lives. TMD treatments primarily focus on peripheral factors; however, many patients with TMD show no signs of peripheral damage. It is now known that many chronic pain conditions, including TMD, involve pain centralization, meaning the pain is generated and maintained by central, rather than peripheral, nervous system processes. There are currently no well accepted means through which centralized TMD pain can be identified in the clinic, and the failure to properly identify these centralized cases means that ineffective peripheral treatments are administered. The specific aims of this project are to 1) Demonstrate that structural, functional, and neurochemical abnormalities exist in TMD that are similar to those reported in other centralized pain conditions, 2) Utilize questionnaire and quantitative sensory testing measures that can accurately detect centralized pain to place patients on a continuum from peripheral to centralized, and show that the brains of centralized, but not peripheral, patients differ significantly from healthy controls, and 3) Determine the measures of centralization and brain morphology, function, and chemistry that predict lack of improvement from a peripherally targeted treatment regimen, to show that centralized TMD patients do not respond as well to treatments that fail to target their pathology. The primary goal of the mentored (K99) portion of the award is to give the candidate the additional training in neuroimaging necessary for him to obtain a tenure track faculty position and successfully run his own independent research program. The K99 phase will take place at the University of Michigan, under the mentorship of Drs. Daniel Clauw, Richard Harris, and David Williams, who are world-renowned experts in centralized pain conditions, pain neuroimaging, and pain psychometrics, respectively. Dr. William Maixner (Duke University), a world- leading expert on TMD, will also serve as a mentor; he will advise the candidate on the clinically relevant aspects of TMD and help the candidate network with other more established TMD researchers. The University of Michigan is ideal for the K99 phase of the project because of the available resources, including faculty who are committed to clinical pain research and mentoring, research-devoted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanners and state-of-the-art pain testing equipment, and ample laboratory and office space at the Chronic Pain and Fatigue Research Center. Upon completing the K99 portion of the award, the candidate will be well suited to make the transition to tenure-track faculty. Project Narrative TMD, which is the most prevalent orofacial pain condition, is a public health problem that negatively impacts the quality of life and function of numerous individuals. This project addresses large gaps in our knowledge of pain centralization in TMD, building off of what is currently known from other pain conditions. Improvement in our understanding of the etiology of TMD and how it influences treatment will be crucial to bring individualized medicine to TMD patients. As a first step, we will determine what central factors make the prevailing peripheral treatments less effective. The results of this project will inform future studies of TMD by pinpointing the most promising variables to measure in longitudinal treatment studies of TMD.",Mechanistic Characterization of Pain in Temporomandibular Disorders: Does Pain Centralization Influence Responsiveness to Peripherally Targeted Treatments?,10101757,R00DE026810,"['Address', 'Affect', 'American', 'Area', 'Award', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Cheek structure', 'Chemistry', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Equipment', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Face', 'Faculty', 'Failure', 'Fatigue', 'Fibromyalgia', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Goals', 'High Prevalence', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Inflammation', 'Injury', 'Insula of Reil', 'Jaw', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Michigan', 'Motor Cortex', 'Naproxen', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Nociception', 'Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Orofacial Pain', 'Pain', 'Pain Research', 'Paper', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Peripheral Nervous System', 'Persistent pain', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Process', 'Psychometrics', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Questionnaires', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Sample Size', 'Sensory', 'Series', 'Soft Diet', 'Somatosensory Cortex', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'TMD treatment', 'Techniques', 'Temporomandibular Joint Disorders', 'Temporomandibular joint disorder pain', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Woman', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'brain morphology', 'central pain', 'chronic pain', 'chronic painful condition', 'chronic pelvic pain', 'clinical pain', 'clinically relevant', 'dietary restriction', 'follow-up', 'gray matter', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'neurochemistry', 'neuroimaging', 'outcome forecast', 'pain processing', 'personalized medicine', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'skills', 'targeted treatment', 'tenure track']",NIDCR,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R00,2020,246352,0.3070687857628379
"Optimizing the use of ketamine to reduce chronic postsurgical pain Chronic pain contributes significantly to the current opioid epidemic. Up to 20% of postoperative patients develop chronic postsurgical pain (CPSP). CPSP is highly associated with chronic opioid use and dependence, and yet routine multimodal analgesia as a combination of acetaminophen, NSAIDs, and anti-neuropathic agents is only moderately effective in preventing CPSP. The incidence for CPSP is particularly high in patients undergoing mastectomy or breast conserving surgery with lymph node dissections (25-60%). This specific postsurgical pain condition is known as post-mastectomy pain syndrome (PMPS), and a recent study showed that 1 in 10 patients continue to use opioids 3 months after surgery. We aim to study the effectiveness of perioperative ketamine for the prevention of PMPS, within the NIH HEAL Pain Management Effectiveness Research Network (Pain ERN). Our rationale is that ketamine can reduce key risks for CPSP including acute pain severity, anxiety and depression, and pain catastrophizing, and in doing so can prevent the development of PMPS. Mechanistically, ketamine is known to enhance endogenous cortical control of pain and mood. There is strong clinical evidence for perioperative ketamine infusion in reducing postsurgical pain, and for a single ketamine bolus (0.3-0.5mg/kg) to treat depression and anxiety associated with postsurgical pain. However, studies are urgently needed to test the efficacy of ketamine in the perioperative period for preventing CPSP, particularly PMPS, in a large cohort of patients and to assess clinical variables predictive for chronic pain severity and for treatment effects. We aim to conduct a multi-site, three-arm RCT to study the effectiveness of ketamine in reducing the incidence and severity of PMPS. 750 patients after mastectomy or breast conserving surgery with lymph node dissection will be randomized to receive either a standard continuous ketamine infusion starting after induction (bolus of 0.35mg/kg followed by infusion at the rate of 0.25mg/kg/hr) and continued for 3 hours after surgery, a regimen of single-bolus ketamine (0.6mg/kg) administered right after surgery, or placebo (saline) control. To maintain the pragmatic nature of an effectiveness trial, all patients will receive routine postoperative multimodal analgesia. Compatible with recent NIH recommendations, we will assess pain, function and mood over 12 months after surgery. We will use Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) severity score at 3 months after surgery as primary endpoints. Secondary endpoints include pain incidence, BPI, short- form McGill's Pain Questionnaire, opioid use, NIH PROMIS scales, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Pain Catastrophizing Scale, and Breast Cancer Pain Questionnaire. We will also build precision medicine models to analyze clinical variables associated with CPSP and with success of ketamine treatment. Agreements have been reached with 11 sites, including 7 Clinical and Translational Science Awards (CTSA) hubs, NYU, Columbia, Einstein, BWH, Washington University at St. Louis, Duke, and Univ. Washington, to carry out this study successfully. PROJECT NARRATIVE Approximately 20% of patients who undergo surgery develop chronic pain, and while chronic postsurgical pain (CPSP) is highly associated with impaired functional recovery and persistent opioid use and dependence, current standard postoperative multimodal analgesia is only moderately effective for its prevention. In a three- arm randomized controlled trial, we aim to study the effectiveness of adding perioperative continuous or single- bolus ketamine to routine postoperative care, for the prevention of post-mastectomy pain syndrome (PMPS), one of the most common CPSP conditions. Ketamine is a low risk treatment option that is easy to implement in a wide range of clinical settings, and thus our proposal can substantially impact postoperative pain management, and in doing so can contribute significantly to our combat against the opioid epidemic.",Optimizing the use of ketamine to reduce chronic postsurgical pain,10154174,UG3CA261067,"['Absence of pain sensation', 'Acetaminophen', 'Acute', 'Acute Pain', 'Agreement', 'American', 'Anxiety', 'Bolus Infusion', 'Breast-Conserving Surgery', 'Brief Pain Inventory', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical and Translational Science Awards', 'Conduction Anesthesia', 'Consent Forms', 'Continuous Infusion', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Effectiveness', 'Emergency Medicine', 'Enrollment', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Incidence', 'Information Dissemination', 'Infrastructure', 'Infusion procedures', 'Intervention', 'Ketamine', 'Link', 'Lymph Node Dissections', 'Machine Learning', 'Mastectomy', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Nature', 'Neuropathy', 'Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Opiate Addiction', 'Pain', 'Pain management', 'Patients', 'Perioperative', 'Phase', 'Placebos', 'Play', 'Postoperative Care', 'Postoperative Pain', 'Postoperative Period', 'Prevention', 'Protocols documentation', 'Questionnaires', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Recovery', 'Recovery of Function', 'Regimen', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Saline', 'Severities', 'Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire', 'Site', 'Societies', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'Woman', 'anxiety treatment', 'arm', 'base', 'breast surgery', 'cancer pain', 'chronic pain', 'cohort', 'combat', 'cost effective', 'data management', 'effectiveness research', 'effectiveness testing', 'effectiveness trial', 'efficacy testing', 'functional disability', 'high reward', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'multimodality', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid sparing', 'opioid use', 'pain catastrophizing', 'participant retention', 'payment', 'pilot trial', 'precision medicine', 'predictive marker', 'prevent', 'primary endpoint', 'recruit', 'secondary analysis', 'secondary endpoint', 'success', 'surgical pain', 'three-arm study', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response', 'treatment risk']",NCI,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,UG3,2020,523335,0.3067747387431928
