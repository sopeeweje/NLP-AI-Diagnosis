"Machine learning for the automated identification and tracking of rare myocardial diseases PROJECT SUMMARY Although cardiac amyloidosis and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) are relatively rare causes of heart failure (HF), they are particularly challenging to detect and treat for several shared reasons: (1) on routine clinical imaging (i.e., echocardiography [echo]), they can be difficult to distinguish from superficially similar, more common forms of cardiac disease that cause left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy; (2) the diagnoses are often missed and thus patients can present late in the course of disease at a time when treatment is difficult; (3) objective, noninvasive metrics that reliably reflect disease progression have not been identified; and (4) the small number of known patients with these diseases can make epidemiology studies and clinical trials difficult to organize and conduct. For both cardiac amyloidosis and HCM, echo plays a critical role in both diagnosis and longitudinal monitoring given its ubiquitous clinical availability, safety, and low cost. More broadly, echo dominates the current landscape of routine cardiac imaging, with tens of millions of echos performed in the United States each year. However, the clinical challenges described above highlight several shortcomings of echo: it is limited in its ability to (1) diagnose disease at its early stages; (2) discriminate between morphologically similar diseases; and (3) quantify disease progression. This proposal seeks to address deficiencies in the current echo reading workflow, which is subjective and captures only a small fraction of the data available in each study. The overall objective of this application is to use advances in machine learning to develop and validate fully-automated echo image analytic approaches to diagnose and track rare cardiomyopathies, focusing on cardiac amyloidosis and HCM. Our proposal is centered on the hypothesis that highly scalable computer vision methods can be applied to echo studies to overcome limitations of the standard clinical echo reading workflow. Accordingly our aims are: (1) Apply an automated method for echo quantification and disease identification to detect and differentiate cardiac diseases that cause increased LV wall thickness; and (2) Characterize quantifiable echo measures of disease progression in cardiac amyloidosis and HCM and associate these with clinical outcomes. Our multidisciplinary team, which is composed of experts in cardiomyopathies, echocardiography, computer vision, and machine learning, will analyze echos and patient data from 2 large patient registries: the Multicenter Amyloid Phenotyping Study (MAPS) and the Sarcomeric Human Cardiomyopathy Registry (SHaRe) HCM Network, with validation using a repository of nearly 400,000 echos. The successful completion of our aims will result in an innovative tool for early diagnosis of myocardial diseases and tracking of disease progression. Importantly, our project will set the stage for conducting larger epidemiology studies of rare myocardial diseases by automating the identification of these patients, and thereby developing previously unattainable broad-based cohorts for these conditions. PROJECT NARRATIVE Rare heart diseases such as amyloidosis (due to abnormal deposition of a protein into the heart muscle) and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (due to a genetic mutation) are important causes of heart failure and sudden death in the general population. These heart diseases are difficult to diagnose, monitor, and treat because: (1) they appear superficially similar to more common forms of heart disease (e.g., high blood pressure) on imaging tests; (2) the optimal monitoring of disease progression over time has not been established; and (3) there is a lack of large-scale studies of patients with these diseases given their rarity. This project aims to use machine learning (artificial intelligence) of digital echocardiographic images to create a completely automated method for diagnosing and tracking these rare heart diseases with the ultimate goal of broad deployment of artificial intelligence algorithms in hospitals and clinics to help identify patients with these rare heart diseases earlier, better predict adverse outcomes, and increase the size and scope of patient registries to enhance research of these conditions.",Machine learning for the automated identification and tracking of rare myocardial diseases,9838368,R01HL140731,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithm Design', 'Algorithms', 'Amyloid', 'Amyloidosis', 'Arrhythmia', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiomyopathies', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinics and Hospitals', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Coronary heart disease', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Echocardiography', 'Face', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Left', 'Left Ventricular Hypertrophy', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Myocardium', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Sudden Death', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Two-Dimensional Echocardiography', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Ventricular', 'adverse outcome', 'automated image analysis', 'base', 'career', 'clinical care', 'clinical imaging', 'cohort', 'cost', 'digital', 'disease diagnosis', 'epidemiology study', 'heart imaging', 'hypertensive heart disease', 'image processing', 'innovation', 'interest', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel therapeutics', 'particle', 'patient registry', 'repository', 'response', 'tool']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2019,687155,0.022701095297248224
"Machine learning of physiological variables to predict diagnose and treat cardiorespiratory instability Project Summary/Abstract: If one could accurately predict who, when and why patients develop cardiorespiratory instability (CRI), then effective preemptive treatments could be given to improve outcome and better use care resources. However, CRI is often unrecognized until it is well established and patients are more refractory to treatment, or progressed to organ injury. We have shown that an integrated monitoring system alert obtained from continuous noninvasively acquired monitoring parameters and coupled to a care algorithm improved step-down unit (SDU) patient outcomes. We also showed that advanced HR variability analysis (sample entropy) identified SDU patients at CRI risk within 2 minutes, and if monitored for 5 minutes differentiated between patients who would develop CRI or remain stable over the next 48 hours. We also applied machine learning (ML) modeling to our clinically-relevant porcine model of hemorrhagic shock to characterize responses to hypovolemia, hemorrhage, and resuscitation, predict which animals would or would not collapse during hypovolemia, and identify occult bleeding 5 minutes earlier than with traditional monitoring. We now propose to apply our work to vulnerable and invasively monitored ICU patients. We will develop multivariable models through ML data-driven classification techniques such as regression, Fourier and principal component analysis, artificial neural networks, random forest classification, etc. as well as more novel approaches (temporal rule learning developed by our team; Bayesian Aggregation) to predict CRI in ICU patients. We will first use our existing annotated high fidelity waveform MIMIC II clinical data set (4200 patients) to develop predictive models and differential signatures for various CRI drivers. We will also use our high-density data collection and processing platform (Bernoulli) to prospectively collect data from ICUs in three institutions: Univ. Pittsburgh (PITT), Univ. California (UC) Irvine and UC San Diego (initial algorithm development conducted at PITT and validated in the UC systems). We will identify the number and type of independent measures, sampling frequency, and lead time necessary to create robust algorithms to: 1) predict impending CRI, 2) select the most effective treatments, 3) monitor treatment response, and 4) determine when treatment has restored physiologic stability and can be stopped. We will also determine the smallest number and types of parameters coupled to the longest CRI lead time to achieve the above four targets with the best sensitivity and specificity (a concept we call Monitoring Parsimony).We will simultaneously iteratively design and test a graphical user interface (GUI) and clinical decision support system (CDSS) driven by these parsimoniously derived predictive smart alerts and functional hemodynamic monitoring treatment approaches in two human simulation environments (PITT & UC Irvine).We envision a basic monitoring surveillance that identifies patients most likely to develop CRI to apply focused clinician attention and targeted treatments to deliver highly personalized medical care. Public Health Narrative If one could accurately predict who, when and why patients develop shock then effective preemptive treatments could be given to improve outcome and more effectively use healthcare resources. But signs of shock often occur late once organ injury is already present. The purpose of this study is to first develop multivariable models through data-driven classification techniques to parsimoniously predict cardiovascular insufficiency, etiology and response to treatment. We will do this first in our existing MIMIC II clinical data sets of 4200 ICU patients as to timing and types of instability. Then we will prospectively collect real time high- density data on patients admitted to our trauma intensive care units of University of Pittsburgh, UC Irvine and UC San Diego. We will create and test in simulators of ICU care bedside user interfaces to drive recognition and treatment algorithms based on these models in all three medical centers.",Machine learning of physiological variables to predict diagnose and treat cardiorespiratory instability,9685235,R01GM117622,"['Acute', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Attention', 'California', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Entropy', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Exposure to', 'Family suidae', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hemorrhagic Shock', 'Homeostasis', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Hypovolemia', 'Injury', 'Institution', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Normal Range', 'Organ', 'Organ failure', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perioperative', 'Physiologic Monitoring', 'Physiological', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Recommendation', 'Refractory', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sepsis', 'Shock', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Stream', 'Stress', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'Triage', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Weaning', 'Work', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'cardiovascular insufficiency', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision support', 'clinically relevant', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'database structure', 'density', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'early onset', 'effective therapy', 'fitness', 'graphical user interface', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual response', 'insight', 'iterative design', 'mortality', 'novel strategies', 'patient population', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'random forest', 'response', 'simulation', 'support tools', 'treatment response']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2019,586227,0.025043752917854736
"Leveraging Artificial-Intelligence to Profile and Enhance Phenotypic Plasticity for Second Injury Prevention: An Innovative Precision Medicine Platform to Revolutionize Injury Care Project Summary/Abstract The best predictor of future injury is previous injury. Unfortunately, this has not changed in a quarter century, despite the introduction of evidence-based medicine and the associated revisions to post-injury treatment and care. Nearly nine million sports-related injuries occur annually, and the majority of these require medical treatment and/or clinical intervention prior to clearance for the athlete to return to play (RTP). Even with formal care, injured athletes are two- to four times (in extreme cases 100 times) more likely to suffer a second injury for up to two years after RTP. This is even more alarming given that 65% of initial sports-related injuries affect children and young adults (ages 5-24 years), setting them up for a lifetime of negative health outcomes. These data implicate the initial injury event as the tipping point for a post-injury cascade of negative sequelae exposing athletes to more physical and psychological pain, higher medical costs and greater risk of severe long-term negative health throughout their life. Thus, an urgent need exists to revolutionize the current standard of post- injury care through better identification and targeting of deficits that underlie second injury risk to enable everyone to stay physically active and healthy for their whole lives. To address this need, we propose a pioneering approach that capitalizes on the biological concept of Phenotypic Plasticity (PP) to quantify an athlete’s functional adaptability across different performance environments. Here PP is computed based on both intrinsic and extrinsic factors that reflect the functional movement capability of the athlete. The overall objective of this proposal is, therefore, to develop a generalizable PP-based precision sports medicine approach for second injury prevention through the development of a systematic bioinformatics-driven approach for PP profile construction, and the training of genetic fuzzy artificial intelligence to establish treatment type and magnitude for precision enhancement of PP. The result of the proposed work will be a generalizable PP-based precision sports medicine approach via two expected outcomes: (1) a formalized phenotypic precision medicine approach to objectively quantify behavioral plasticity, and (2) the successful implementation of a platform leveraging genetic fuzzy artificial intelligence integrated with mixed reality for performance prediction. This platform will support delivery of personalized treatments for PP enhancement. These objectives are the critical first step for the development of a generalizable precision medicine approach that will revolutionize rehabilitation and finally stem the tide of second injury in sport. This contribution will be significant to push back against the initial injury tipping point and, in doing so, create a pathway for injured athletes to return safely to physical activity and to maintain a long-term healthy lifestyle. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because the proposed platform will lead to fewer young men and women who suffer from second injury and the negative effects that lead to poorer long-term health. The project is relevant to NIH’s mission because the knowledge gained will be used to optimize new precision assessment and treatment strategies to prevent injury, and this will enhance health and reduce the burden of athletic injury.",Leveraging Artificial-Intelligence to Profile and Enhance Phenotypic Plasticity for Second Injury Prevention: An Innovative Precision Medicine Platform to Revolutionize Injury Care,9723527,R21EB027865,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Athletic Injuries', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Model', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Combinatorial Optimization', 'Complex', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genomic approach', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Phenotype', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Public Health', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Series', 'Services', 'Sports', 'Sports Medicine', 'Stress', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Training', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior prediction', 'behavioral plasticity', 'complex biological systems', 'environmental change', 'evidence base', 'fitness', 'healthy lifestyle', 'improved', 'indexing', 'injured', 'injury prevention', 'innovation', 'light weight', 'medical specialties', 'mixed reality', 'multimodal data', 'novel strategies', 'personalized medicine', 'precision genetics', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'programs', 'psychologic', 'response', 'stem', 'success', 'treatment strategy', 'young adult', 'young man', 'young woman']",NIBIB,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R21,2019,326700,-0.01377467422436356
"Prediction of seizure lateralization and postoperative outcome through the use of deep learning applied to multi-site MRI/DTI data:  An ENIGMA-Epilepsy study ABSTRACT  Epilepsy is a devastating neurological illness that affects 65 million people worldwide. Approximately one-third of patients affected do not respond to antiepileptic drug therapy and require a thorough diagnostic work-up. Structural neuroimaging plays a pivotal role in the diagnostic evaluation of patients with focal epilepsy, identifying visible lesions in many patients that often coincide with the seizure focus. However, 20- 40% of patients have normal-appearing MRIs and this number appears to be growing. As a result, there is increased interest in identifying subtle gray and white matter network changes on non-invasive, quantitative MRI, including structural MRI (sMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), that can help to delineate the epileptogenic network. Unfortunately, methods for selecting optimal features from sMRI/DTI data in patients with epilepsy that can address these clinical challenges have not been developed. There are at least two major barriers that have limited progress in this field. First, sample sizes have been insufficient to develop reliable classification algorithms in patients with focal epilepsy that lead to reproducible findings. The high cost of data collection - few studies scan more than 50-60 patients - has led to underpowered studies whose findings often fail to replicate and cannot adequately model confounds. Second, high computational demands have previously limited the feasibility of using sophisticated, feature-selection (i.e., Machine Learning; ML) algorithms in clinical settings.  A new, large-scale data initiative (i.e., ENIGMA-epilepsy) acquired from 24 sites world-wide is now lifting these barriers and allowing for the development and validation of innovative data-driven approaches aimed at optimizing the use of MRI data in the evaluation of epilepsy. In this grant, we will leverage data collected through ENIGMA-Epilepsy—a new, cost-effective, innovative global approach that unblocks the power logjam by merging resources, data, capital infrastructure and talents of leading epilepsy centers from 14 countries across the world (2,149 patient and 1,727 healthy control MRI/DTI datasets). We will also leverage new developments in ML (i.e., deep learning) and network-based modeling (i.e., connectome- based approaches) and test whether these novel approaches improve upon classification accuracy relative to simpler, user-driven models. Our primary aim will be to test the ability of our deep learning approach (i.e., dense neural networks) to lateralize the seizure focus. In an exploratory aim, we will test the ability of our model to predict post-operative seizure outcomes. ENIGMA's harmonized approach will allow us to test our approach in over 24 datasets, diverse in age, ethnicity, age of onset, epilepsy duration, and surgical outcomes.  This R-21 application addresses NIH's call for more reproducible studies by introducing a highly- powered design, and is directly aligned with NINDS's 2014 Epilepsy Benchmarks, which encourage the identification of biomarkers for assessing or predicting treatment response in patients with epilepsy. NARRATIVE Epilepsy is a devastating neurological illness, affecting 65 million people worldwide. In this project, we will leverage the ENIGMA-Epilepsy infrastructure to address how advanced, non-invasive neuroimaging can be used to develop algorithms for (1) lateralizing the seizure focus and (2) predicting favorable versus unfavorable surgical outcomes. The research will be accomplished by applying novel machine learning algorithms to clinical and imaging data on an exceptionally large cohort of patients with epilepsy and healthy controls, providing unprecedented power to tackle critical diagnostic and treatment-related questions in epilepsy.",Prediction of seizure lateralization and postoperative outcome through the use of deep learning applied to multi-site MRI/DTI data:  An ENIGMA-Epilepsy study,9751025,R21NS107739,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Age of Onset', 'Algorithms', 'Antiepileptic Agents', 'Benchmarking', 'Capital', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Country', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Electroencephalography', 'Epilepsy', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Evaluation', 'Geography', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Lesion', 'Lifting', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Network-based', 'Neurologic', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Partial Epilepsies', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Play', 'Population', 'Postoperative Period', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Probability', 'Reproducibility', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Seizures', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Syndrome', 'Talents', 'Techniques', 'Temporal Lobe Epilepsy', 'Testing', 'Thinness', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'base', 'biomarker identification', 'brain abnormalities', 'classification algorithm', 'cohort', 'computing resources', 'connectome', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'deep learning', 'design', 'gray matter', 'hands-on learning', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural network', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'personalized approach', 'sex', 'standard of care', 'surgery outcome', 'white matter']",NINDS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R21,2019,444315,-0.013428903086101163
"Leveraging modern analytic approaches to improve diabetes outcomes ABSTRACT Diabetic patients are at risk of developing diabetic heart disease, which may lead to complications in care. Diabetic heart disease patients not only have exceptionally high healthcare expenditures and resource utilization but also are likely to have poor patient outcomes. Studies have shown that early intervention of patients likely to develop diabetic heart disease is cost-effective and yields favorable health outcomes. Therefore, early identiﬁcation of diabetic patients at high-risk of developing diabetic heart disease is crucial to provide effective interventions. The commonly accepted methodology for diabetic heart disease risk prediction is the use of one or more risk scoring systems. However, these risk functions may not generalize well for the diabetes patient and may suffer from poor calibration when used on different cohorts. Moreover, the scoring systems have only been studied on coronary heart disease, one variant of diabetic heart disease while heart failure and diabetic cardiomyopathy remain important, yet insufﬁciently studied problems. Machine learning offers the ability to perform accurate predictive analytics and has been proposed as a way to identify and manage high-risk patients. The primary goal of this proposal is to develop a high-impact and practical risk prediction model that can be used to per- form early identiﬁcation of high-risk diabetic heart disease patients. Given the heterogeneity and complexity of patient information in electronic health records, the model needs to capitalize on the multi-dimensional temporal nature of pa- tient records to extract identifying characteristics of patients that will develop diabetic heart disease. To accomplish this, we will leverage modern machine learning approaches such as tensor factorization and natural language processing to model complex patient characteristics, provide a more complete representation of the patient, and uncover excellent predictors of diabetic heart disease risk. An existing dataset that contains the de-identiﬁed electronic health records of approximately 4,100 diabetic patients from the Emory Healthcare System to compare the predictive power of machine learning-based algorithms with the standard risk scoring systems. These algorithms will be evaluated on calibration, discrimination, and ease of interpretability. The results of this work will provide insight as to how to develop a machine learning–based prediction system that can identify high-risk diabetic heart disease patients. The study may also shed light on the best approaches for fusing data from multiple heterogeneous sources to build a better predictive model and potentially identify novel indicators of high- risk diabetic heart disease factors. Moreover, the work will help inform a larger multi-site study of diabetic heart disease risk prediction and develop methods to generalize the results to a broader spectrum of comorbidities. This project is consistent with the National Library of Medicine's mission to translate biomedical research into practice. PROJECT NARRATIVE Diabetic patients are risk of developing diabetic heart disease which can lead to high healthcare expenditure, high resource utilization, and poor patient outcomes. Existing diabetic risk prediction models can suffer from poor calibration and predictive accuracy.

"Deep Learning and Streaming Analytics for Prediction of Adverse Events in the ICU ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)     Critical care medicine in the United States costs over 80 billion dollars annually. Over the past decade the rate of intensive care unit (ICU) use has been increasing, with a recent study reporting almost one in three Medicare beneficiaries experiencing an ICU visit during the last month of their lives. Every year, sepsis, a medical condition characterized by whole-body inflammation, strikes between 800,000 and 3.1 million Americans, killing approximately one in four patients affected. There is currently no definite treatment for sepsis in spite of many clinicl trials. However, early detection of sepsis and timely initiation of interventions are widely considered as important determinants of patient survival. However, basic care tasks (such as microbiological sampling and antibiotic delivery within 1 h, fluid resuscitation, and risk stratification using serum lactate or alternative), which are known to benefit most patients, are not performed in a timely manner. Previous literature suggests that high-resolution vital signs (such as heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, etc.), and other sequential measurements within the electronic medical records (EMRs), can be dynamically integrated using Machine Learning techniques to help with early detection of sepsis. With the ubiquity of inexpensive high- capacity storage and high-bandwidth streaming technology it is now possible to monitor patients' vital signs continuously (for instance, the research application developed by the Emory hospital ICU uses IBM's streaming analytics platform to transmit over 100,000 real-time data points per 100 beds, per second). Despite this continuous feed of data, commonly used acuity scores, such as APACHE and SAPS, are based on snapshot values of these vital signs (typically the worst values during a 24 hours period). This limitation is partially due to unavailability of computationally efficient and robust algorithms capable of finding predictive features in multivariate, nonlinear and nonstationary sequential data, which may reveal inter- organ communication and disintegration of causal couplings with critical illnesses such as sepsis.  We have recently developed a novel Machine Learning algorithm to discover automatically a collection of predictive multivariate dynamical patterns in a database of patient time-series, which can be used to classify patients or to monitor progression of disease in a given patient. The primary goal of this proposal is to apply our method to assess the predictive power of high- resolution multivariate time-series of vital signs and sequentially recorded EMR data in the ICU for early detection of sepsis and risk stratification of septic patient. To accomplish this, we aim to benchmark our technique on a large ICU cohort (the MIMIC II database with over 60,000 patients), as well as simulated data from a multiscale mathematical model of influence of inflammatory mediators on dynamical patterns of vital signs. Next, the technique will be externally validated on two separate ICU sepsis cohorts (the Emory Sepsis dataset and the Mayo Clinic Metric dataset). Finally, we will provide a real-time implementation of the proposed algorithm in an streaming environment (such as the IBM streaming analytics), in order to address the Big Data challenge of harnessing real-time, streaming sensor data from bedside monitors within the ICU, while enabling advanced pattern recognition and real-time forecasting. Ultimately we believe these methods can change the current standard of care through faster recognition and initiation of basic care, as well as guiding interventional strategis based on severity of illness and mechanisms underlying physiological deterioration. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    The proposed project is making use of computers to analyze data from sickest patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). We want to develop methods to identify patterns in the patient data which predict who is at risk for mortality and who might respond to various medications which could make them better. We have a very strong team of doctors and researchers who work closely together, covering all aspects of the proposed research, which we hope will help us improve the lives of the sickest patients in the ICU.",Deep Learning and Streaming Analytics for Prediction of Adverse Events in the ICU,9983413,K01ES025445,"['Address', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Antibiotics', 'Antihypertensive Agents', 'Beds', 'Benchmarking', 'Big Data', 'Blood Pressure', 'Caring', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computers', 'Critical Care', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Trees', 'Deterioration', 'Differential Equation', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Goals', 'Heart Rate', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Intravenous', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Medicare', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Nature', 'Organ', 'Pathologic', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk stratification', 'SCAP2 gene', 'Sampling', 'Sepsis', 'Series', 'Serum', 'Severity of illness', 'Stream', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telemedicine', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'beneficiary', 'cohort', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'feeding', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mathematical model', 'mortality risk', 'multi-scale modeling', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'parallel computer', 'patient safety', 'physiologic model', 'portability', 'prognostic', 'public health relevance', 'respiratory', 'safety practice', 'sensor', 'septic patients', 'simulation', 'standard of care', 'time use']",NIEHS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",K01,2019,190216,0.010009238545341649
"PRECEDE: PREsurgical Cognitive Evaluation via Digital clockfacEdrawing ABSTRACT Preoperative cognitive impairment is common among older adults preparing for surgery. Despite growing evidence that preoperative cognitive/neuronal integrity is a risk factor for perioperative insults and post- operative adverse outcomes, health care systems do not systematically pre-operatively screen for cognition. Clinical researchers have yet to identify a pragmatic approach to pre-operative cognitive screening. Our team members have developed the digital Clock Drawing Test (dCDT), a tool that captures subtle behavioral variables during a rapid (5-minute) clock drawing assessment. The data and benefit afforded by this tool have yet to be considered across perioperative contexts. We will apply the dCDT within a large number of pre- surgical patients (n=5,000 per year) coupled with novel machine learning algorithms to address three specific aims. Aim 1: examine range and distribution of preoperative neurocognitive impairment with older adult preoperative patients relative to non-surgical older adult demographically matched peers (available n=2,400 via NIH/Boston University Framingham Heart Study) using novel previously unobserved dCDT graphomotor and decision making variables; Aim 2: examine the predictive validity of presurgical dCDT variables on postoperative, clinician reported/hospital recorded events; Aim 3: examine pre to postoperative 6-week, 3- month, and 1-year change in dCDT and NIH PROMIS metrics for thoracic (n=70), orthopedic (n=70), major abdominal-pelvic patients (n=70), and non-surgery peers (n=70). For the observational studies (Aim 1 and 2), individuals > 65 years presenting to the UFHealth presurgical clinic will complete the dCDT as well as a three- word memory test and frailty assessment as part of the standard clinical evaluation. Surgical and anesthetic details will be acquired via the electronic medical record. Clinically-relevant outcomes will include complications, length of stay, cost of care, functional capacity, and mortality. Outcomes will be supplemented by a separate longitudinally-studied subgroup (Aim 3) completing NIH PROMIS metrics at 6 weeks, 3 months, and 1year after surgery. Analyses will focus on stratifying distributions and clusters of dCDT characteristics across numerous sociodemographic, surgical, and anesthetic factors. The predictive value of the dCDT will be modeled relative to clinical outcomes. Changes in dCDT and baseline NIH PROMIS domains will be compared pre- and post-operatively and examined for interactions with longitudinal perioperative events. Subaims: We will apply `deep learning' approaches to drawings to identify novel features of pre-surgical patients relative to a large sample of demographically equated dCDT data points available through the Framingham Heart Study. Symbolic aggregate approximation (SAX)-based machine learning approaches will characterize interactions between preoperative dCDT features and intraoperative anesthetic sensitivities.  PROJECT NARRATIVE Assessing cognition prior to surgery has relevance for a number of reasons, but has yet to be applied due to pragmatic issues associated with assessment complexities and time. Here, we will leverage a modernized digital version of a well-known cognitive screening tool (the Clock Drawing Test) to examine 1) pre-operative cognitive abilities in adults > 65 years attending a tertiary academic medical hospital pre-operative clinic; 2) how pre-operative cognitive abilities predict post-operative hospital/clinical reported outcomes (i.e., length of stay, hospital cost) and 3) how pre-operative cognitive abilities interact with perioperative events to predict post-operative cognitive change and patient reported outcomes. The study will result in improved ability to appreciate cognition in older adults electing surgery and optimize their perioperative experience.",PRECEDE: PREsurgical Cognitive Evaluation via Digital clockfacEdrawing,9739350,R01AG055337,"['Abdomen', 'Academic Medical Centers', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Adult', 'American', 'American College of Surgeons', 'Anesthetics', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Boston', 'Cardiac', 'Characteristics', 'Chest', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complication', 'Comprehension', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Elderly', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Face', 'Framingham Heart Study', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospital Records', 'Hospitals', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Length of Stay', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Memory', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'Neurons', 'Observational Study', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Orthopedics', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patients', 'Pelvis', 'Perioperative', 'Postoperative Complications', 'Postoperative Pain', 'Postoperative Period', 'Predictive Value', 'Price', 'Psyche structure', 'Recovery', 'Regression Analysis', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Secondary to', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Societies', 'Subgroup', 'Suggestion', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'adverse outcome', 'age effect', 'base', 'care costs', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive change', 'cognitive process', 'cognitive testing', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'digital', 'executive function', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'frailty', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'member', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient subsets', 'peer', 'performance tests', 'prospective', 'research clinical testing', 'screening', 'sociodemographics', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,R01,2019,426737,-0.028550355129379014
"Assessment of Peripherally Circulating Plasma Proteins and Clinical Risks to Differentiate Epileptic Seizure from Psychogenic Nonepileptic Seizure Project Summary / Abstract Accurately diagnosing epilepsy is very challenging and time consuming because clinicians rarely observe the actual seizure, and there are many different types of seizures and epilepsy syndromes with differing presentations. Furthermore, other neurological disorders can be mimics of seizures leading to erroneous diagnosis, inappropriate treatments with significant potential adverse events, incorrect prognoses, and significant waste of healthcare resources. A primary indication that is mistaken for epilepsy is psychogenic non-epileptic seizure (PNES) which is commonly misdiagnosed even by seasoned clinicians. Patients that suffer PNES events experience convulsive events which are similar to epileptic seizures but do not arise from aberrant, synchronous, electrical activity in the brain. Rendering a definitive diagnosis of either PNES or epilepsy is critical to long-term patient health and outcome. In many cases, patients suffering PNES events are prescribed anti-epilepsy drugs (AEDs) and suffer unnecessary side effects. Alternatively, patients that are suspected to suffer PNES, but actually have epilepsy and are not treated with AEDs, are at risk of experiencing seizures and even sudden unexplained death in epilepsy (SUDEP). Currently, obtaining a definitive diagnosis of epilepsy or PNES is expensive and inconvenient for patients as it may require inpatient evaluation and a battery of costly tests. Thus, a critical gap in our clinical assessment of seizures, be it epileptic or psychogenic, is an accurate diagnostic blood test that can be used to stratify transient neurological events as either PNES or epilepsy. Towards developing this test, Evogen has developed an innovative informatic approach that incorporates all available clinical information and our protein biomarker approach to detect seizure using an artificial intelligence approach of machine learning. To confirm our previous results, Evogen proposes an epilepsy monitoring unit-based all-comers study which will collect both blood samples and clinical information from patients’ ES and PNES events. Protein biomarker concentrations will be determined and combined with clinical information using a machine learning approach to create a diagnostic algorithm that will provide a probabilistic score that a patient experienced an ES or PNES event. The test will have a profound impact on diagnosis and treatment of both ES and PNES. We believe this test will have an immediate impact on identifying which patients require EMU evaluation. Typically, one third of patients that visit the EMU for a definitive diagnosis suffer from PNES events and represent a large burden to the tertiary epilepsy centers. When patients are referred for EMU monitoring, they are sequentially put on a waiting list and infrequently is any triage used. Therefore, a test that can aid in routing patients with psychogenic events to the appropriate care will increase the accessibility for patients with a high probability of epilepsy. The work proposed here is the first step necessary to confirm pilot results. Upon confirmation, a streamlined development plan has been created to collect all of the information required for CLIA accreditation and bring the test to market. Project Narrative Differentiating epileptic seizures from psychogenic nonepileptic seizure is a substantially unmet medical need. Current tools to differentiate between epileptic seizures and psychogenic nonepileptic seizures have limited performance, high costs and limited availability. A diagnostic test that indicates if a patient recently experienced an epileptic seizure or psychogenic event would provide physicians with objective, actionable data that can result in improved clinical care, patient outcomes and healthcare system savings.",Assessment of Peripherally Circulating Plasma Proteins and Clinical Risks to Differentiate Epileptic Seizure from Psychogenic Nonepileptic Seizure,9846171,R43NS113724,"['Adoption', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Antiepileptic Agents', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood Tests', 'Blood specimen', 'Brain', 'CCL8 gene', 'CLIA certified', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical assessments', 'Collaborations', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Electroencephalography', 'Enrollment', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Epilepsy', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Future', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Industry Standard', 'Inflammation', 'Informatics', 'Inpatients', 'Intercellular adhesion molecule 1', 'Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Monitor', 'Neurologic', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Performance', 'Peripheral', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Plasma Proteins', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Recording of previous events', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Route', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Savings', 'Seasons', 'Seizures', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'TNF gene', 'TNFSF10 gene', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Triage', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Waiting Lists', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'cost', 'design', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'nervous system disorder', 'protein biomarkers', 'prototype', 'research clinical testing', 'side effect', 'statistics', 'success', 'tool', 'validation studies', 'wasting']",NINDS,"EVOGEN, INC.",R43,2019,562119,0.019638262899379883
"Machine Learning of Physiological Waveforms and Electronic Health Record Data to Predict, Diagnose, and Treat Hemodynamic Instability in Surgical Patients Project Summary / Abstract If one could accurately predict who, when and why patients develop cardiorespiratory instability (CRI) during surgery, then effective preemptive treatments could be given to improve postoperative outcome and more effectively use healthcare resources. But signs of shock often occur late once organ injury is already present. The goal of this proposal is to develop, validate, and test real-time intraoperative risk prediction tools based on electronic health record (EHR) data and high-fidelity physiological waveforms to predict CRI and make the databases of intraoperative data and waveforms used for these developments freely accessible. This is extremely relevant because although 5.7 million Americans are admitted to an Intensive Care Units (ICU) in one year, more than 42 millions undergo surgery annually. Previous and ongoing studies conducted in the ICU and in the step down unit have built the architecture to collect real-time high-fidelity physiological waveform data streams and integrate them with patient demographics from the EHR to build large data sets, and derive actionable fused parameters based on machine learning (ML) analytics as well as display information in real time at the bedside to drive clinical decision support (CDS) in the critical care setting. The goal of this proposal is to apply these ML approaches to the complex and time compressed environment of high-risk surgery where greater patient and disease variability exist and shorter period of time is available to deliver truly personalized medicine approaches. The work will be initiated using an already existing annotated intraoperative database from the University of California Irvine including EHR and high-fidelity waveform data. This operating room database already exists and needs only to be extracted. This data will be used for the initial training and development of the ML model that will then be tested on prospectively collected University of California Los Angeles and University of Pittsburgh Medical Center databases. Simultaneously, this approach will use existing knowledge of CRI patterns derived from previous step down unit / intensive care unit cohorts, MIMIC II data, University of California Irvine data, and animal studies to create smart alarms and graphic user interface for clinical decision support based on functional hemodynamic monitoring principles. The next step will then leverage the focus on the issues and strengths of the intraoperative environment, some of which can be listed as: 1) Known patients characteristics before surgery to define pre-stress baseline, allowing functional hemodynamic monitoring stress evaluations, preconditioning, and other preoperative calibrations, 2) High degree of direct observation and data density during most phases of surgery allowing close semi-autonomous monitoring and titration of novel treatment algorithms early, 3) Defined stages in the initial part of surgery (induction, intubation, skin incision) allowing ML approaches to build large common relational database registries, and 4) Defined surgical procedure and stressors (anesthesia induction, intra-abdominal air insufflation, and other surgery-specific interventions), which will alter the impact of CRI on measured variables. Project Narrative The purpose of this study is to first develop multivariable models through data-driven classification techniques to predict parsimoniously cardiorespiratory instability, etiology and response to treatment in patients undergoing high-risk surgery. Using high-fidelity intraoperative physiological waveform data augmented with extensive electronic health record derived annotation and applying machine learning approaches we will characterize and quantify common patterns in subjects destined to develop cardiorespiratory instability during high-risk surgery. We will use these inputs in simulated real-time bedside management to develop an iteratively designed prototype clinical decision support system suitable for intraoperative care.","Machine Learning of Physiological Waveforms and Electronic Health Record Data to Predict, Diagnose, and Treat Hemodynamic Instability in Surgical Patients",9643500,R01HL144692,"['Acute', 'Adopted', 'Air', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anesthesia procedures', 'Animals', 'Architecture', 'Calibration', 'California', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical effectiveness', 'Complex', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Homeostasis', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hospitals', 'Hypotension', 'Injury', 'Insufflation', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Intra-abdominal', 'Intraoperative Care', 'Intraoperative Period', 'Intubation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Operating Rooms', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perioperative', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Postoperative Complications', 'Postoperative Period', 'Process', 'Recommendation', 'Registries', 'Resources', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Shock', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin', 'Specificity', 'Stream', 'Stress', 'Surgical incisions', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Titrations', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'data integration', 'data structure', 'database structure', 'deep neural network', 'demographics', 'density', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'electronic data', 'graphical user interface', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'information display', 'insight', 'interoperability', 'iterative design', 'machine learning algorithm', 'model development', 'mortality', 'neural network algorithm', 'novel', 'patient population', 'personalized medicine', 'preconditioning', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'pressure', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'relational database', 'response', 'simulation', 'stressor', 'support tools', 'surgical risk', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2019,694170,-0.016135945856447103
"Deep Neural Networks To Treat Atrial Fibrillation PROJECT SUMMARY Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a major health problem affecting over 5 million people in the US leading to significant morbidity and even mortality. Therapy for this epidemic is suboptimal, with success of 30-70% at 1 year for most therapies. Despite great advances in understanding potential AF mechanisms, these insights have not yet translated into better AF therapy. The scientific focus of the project centers on the issue of identifying novel phenotypes for the heterogeneous conditions that currently fall under the rubric of AF. Machine learning is an approach well-suited to identify novel classifications from large diverse data sets that are traditionally difficult to separate. I will use machine learning and computational methods to analyze detailed clinical, structural, cardiac electrophysiological and biochemical features in patients with AF, to better predict responders and non-responders to various therapies. This may enable prospective guidance to tailor personalized therapy. In performing this project, I will grow as a physician-scientist focused on patient-oriented research in atrial fibrillation. The specific aims of the scientific project are as follows: First, I will create a novel disease taxonomy for AF that classifies patients successfully treated by risk factor modification, antiarrhythmic drug therapy, or diverse approaches to ablation, using computational methods and supervised learning on large training data from my collaborators. I will assess the predictive efficacy of these disease partitions in a testing cohort of patients referred for treatment of AF. Second, I will use advanced techniques in machine learning and patient-level analyses to explain why a certain strategy may fail or succeed in an individual, paving the way for clinical use. Third, in a pilot prospective clinical study, I will assess the feasibility and accuracy of these machine learning models. The findings from these experiments may provide an immediate clinical impact by delivering AF therapy options in a patient-specific manner that optimizes benefit while reducing risk. In addition, under the balanced and expert mentorship provided by this award, I will gain the necessary computational modelling, clinical research design and biostatistical methodology experience to design comprehensive studies and be competitive for independent funding. PROJECT NARRATIVE Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most prevalent heart rhythm disorder in adults, which may lead to significant morbidity, mortality and economic burden. The results of pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic therapy remain suboptimal, despite the fact that mechanistic data in patients are increasing on atrial structure, electrophysiology and clinical risk factors yet are rarely used to individualize AF therapy to each patient. In this project, computational methods and machine learning are proposed to harmonize large amounts of data, including clinical factors, imaging studies and cardiac signals, to provide tools to devise an individualized AF management strategy.",Deep Neural Networks To Treat Atrial Fibrillation,9821943,K23HL145017,"['Ablation', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Anti-Arrhythmia Agents', 'Arrhythmia', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Award', 'Biochemical', 'Biometry', 'Cardiac', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Economic Burden', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Epidemic', 'Failure', 'Fatigue', 'Flecainide', 'Freedom', 'Funding', 'Health', 'Heart Atrium', 'Heart failure', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Life Style Modification', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nonpharmacologic Therapy', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pulmonary veins', 'Registries', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Syndrome', 'Taxonomy', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Triage', 'Work', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical predictors', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'cost', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'dofetilide', 'economic implication', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'falls', 'functional outcomes', 'heart rhythm', 'imaging study', 'individualized medicine', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality', 'neural network', 'novel', 'patient oriented research', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'responders and non-responders', 'response', 'skills', 'success', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'unsupervised learning']",NHLBI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K23,2019,193536,0.002537557454948622
"Using Causal Inference and Machine Learning Methods to Predict Cognitive Behavioral Treatment Response PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Many patients with anxiety and fear disorders (AFDs) report minimal benefits when treated with an evidence- based psychotherapy (e.g., cognitive-behavioral therapy [CBT]) or pharmacotherapy (e.g., antidepressants; benzodiazepines). Conversely, some AFD patients are likely to benefit from virtually any treatment (e.g., supportive therapy). Using data collected in randomized controlled trials (RCTs), there has been limited progress determining how to use pre-treatment characteristics to match AFD patients to the treatment that is most likely to provide benefit. As a result, NIMH has forwarded Strategic Objectives focused on identifying treatment moderators and developing tools that predict differential treatment response. The broad goal of this proposed secondary data analysis is to apply causal inference and machine learning methods to prospective observational data to predict differential treatment response among patients with AFDs. The sample (n = 1,528) is from a longstanding NIMH-funded study of AFD patients who received: (a) CBT with concurrent pharmacotherapy, (b) CBT without pharmacotherapy, or (c) treatment as usual (TAU). Targeted maximum likelihood estimation (a causal inference method) and super learning (an ensemble machine learning method) will be used to accomplish the proposed Aims. Aim 1 will estimate the (overall) average effects of the three treatment types. Aim 2 will estimate “optimal treatment rules” to determine if differential treatment response can be meaningfully predicted based on a patient's multidimensional profile of pre-treatment symptoms. Aim 3 will estimate “optimal treatment rules” to determine if differential treatment response can be meaningfully predicted using all available pre-treatment covariates. The proposed study is highly innovative and could significantly impact the growing literature focused on predicting differential treatment effects and personalizing treatment for patients with AFDs. Although treatment effects estimates obtained using observational data and causal inference methods (i.e., adjusted for nonrandom treatment selection) are similar to those estimated in RCTs, this would be the first study to apply such methods to AFD patient data. This study will also be the first to use ensemble machine learning to develop composite moderators for AFDs (i.e., optimal treatment rules). In comparison, prior attempts to develop composite moderators have relied on less flexible model-building procedures prone to overfitting and unable to capture complex predictor-outcome associations (e.g., interactions among predictors; nonlinear associations). In achieving the proposed Aims, the current study would be a catalyst for future research using causal inference and machine learning to study predictors of differential treatment response among AFD patients. Results will be used to justify future research aimed at expanding and validating the models in larger observational samples and pragmatic RCTs (e.g., optimal treatment rules for specific medications/doses; timing of pharmacotherapy relative to CBT; second-wave CBT versus acceptance-based CBT). PROJECT NARRATIVE Some patients with anxiety and fear disorders may benefit only from certain evidence-based treatments, while others may benefit from virtually any treatment (e.g., talk therapy). The current study will use casual inference and machine learning methods to develop predictive models that identify the treatment(s) most likely to benefit a particular patient. The models developed in this study will serve as an important initial step toward efficient and personalized treatment for patients with anxiety and fear disorders.",Using Causal Inference and Machine Learning Methods to Predict Cognitive Behavioral Treatment Response,9724776,R21MH119492,"['Antidepressive Agents', 'Anxiety', 'Assessment tool', 'Benzodiazepines', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Fright', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Life Stress', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Onset of illness', 'Outpatients', 'Patient observation', 'Patients', 'Personality', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Procedures', 'Psychotherapy', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Sampling', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Severities', 'Supportive care', 'Symptoms', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Treatment outcome', 'Validation', 'anxiety treatment', 'base', 'catalyst', 'cost', 'depressive symptoms', 'effective therapy', 'evidence base', 'excessive anxiety', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'functional disability', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'model building', 'optimal treatments', 'outcome prediction', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'prospective', 'response', 'sociodemographics', 'stress reactivity', 'symptom treatment', 'treatment as usual', 'treatment disparity', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response', 'virtual']",NIMH,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),R21,2019,265477,0.004963582086133284
"A Protocol-Driven, Digital Conversational Agent at the Hospital Bedside to Support Nurse Teams and to Mitigate Delirium and Falls Risk Abstract About 700,000 to 1 million falls per year occur during hospital stays in the US, costing hospitals $3 billion to $7 billion each year to treat. These costs are not reimbursed by the Centers of Medicare and Medicaid, resulting in significant financial losses for hospitals. Delirium, a major cause of falls, is highly prevalent (29%-64%) among hospitalized elders. Even without causing a fall, the average case of delirium increases the length of stay by 7.78 days, disrupting throughput and significantly reducing net hospital revenues. Including the common sequelae of post-discharge functional decline, delirium costs the national healthcare system over $130 billion per year. Due to the high cost and significant psychosocial needs of certain hospitalized patients, a widely-used intervention to mitigate risk is to assign hospital staff & nurses to serve as “patient sitters” at the bedside, at a cost of $1 million/year for a typical hospital. However, despite the workforce burden and expense, patient sitters often do not reliably execute risk-mitigating protocols, and the literature does not support their efficacy in preventing adverse events. In this SBIR Fast-Track proposal, we seek to develop an advanced, human-in-the-loop artificial intelligence (AI) avatar system to enhance the wellbeing of hospitalized patients, avoid adverse events including delirium and falls, and improve workforce efficiency by supporting nursing staff to work at the top of their license, potentially generating savings of $2,000,000 each year for a typical 300-bed hospital. This proposal aligns with NINR’s cross-cutting focus areas of Promoting Innovation and 21st Century Nurse Scientists, while applying the principles of patient self-management and wellness to the acute care environment, where the outcomes driven by our patient engagement and support platform will have an outsized, immediate cost benefit to enable rapid scaling and dissemination.

"Mechanistic Machine Learning PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The goal of this project is to combine empirical data with mechanistic physiologic knowledge to produce personalized, quantitative predictions that can lead to improved treatments. In normal practice, physicians reason by analogy from generic physiologic principles, but the technology exists to exploit even imperfect physiologic models make treatment personalized and quantitatively grounded in physiology, and to improve learning from empirical data. We will apply data assimilation (DA), mechanistic mathematical modeling, machine learning, and control theory, which have revolutionized space travel, weather forecasting, transportation and flight, and manufacturing. Data assimilation and control theory have seen very limited use in medicine, usually applied in data-rich circumstances like continuous glucose monitoring or packemakers. Our previous work demonstrated use of data assimilation with glucose-insulin models to predict glucose in the outpatient type 2 diabetes setting. We will extend data assimilation and control theory using, for example, a constrained ensemble Kalman filter and an offline Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm, to better handle sparse, short training sets on rapidly changing patients, and we will apply it in the setting of glucose management in the intensive care unit (ICU). Moreover, we will develop DA for phenotyping applications by exploiting the parameter estimation capabilities of DA. Data assimilation can be used to estimate measureable and unmeasureable physiologic states and parameters, and we will use these estimates to create higher definition phenotypes. While we are focusing on glucose management in the ICU, we will develop methods that are likely to generalize, beginning the effort to develop DA in the context of healthcare more broadly. The work we propose is a necessary step toward being able to use mechanism-driven DA to test, validate and optimize personalized short-term treatment strategies, long-term health forecasts, and mechanistic physiologic understanding. We will carry out the following aims: AIM 1—forecast—extend the DA methodology to allow forecasting, personalization, model evaluation, and model selection in the ICU context, relating treatment input to physiologic outcome; AIM 2—phenotype—extend the DA framework to state and parameter estimation to allow for mechanism-based phenotyping, careful uncertainty quantification, and inference of difficult or impossible-to-measure physiology; AIM 3—control—extend the DA to include a controller that begins with desired clinical outcomes, e.g., glucose range, and estimates the inputs, e.g., insulin or nutrition, required to achieve the outcomes. Narrative The goal of this project is to develop better ways to combine data about individual patients with knowledge about physiology to create personalized forecasts and recommendations about a patient's health. We specifically address the management of glucose in the intensive care unit, an area of high importance that could benefit from improved forecasts and recommendations.",Mechanistic Machine Learning,9767278,R01LM012734,"['Address', 'Admission activity', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Assimilations', 'Carbohydrates', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Depressed mood', 'Early Intervention', 'Eating', 'Endocrine Physiology', 'Evaluation', 'Fingers', 'Food', 'Future', 'Glomerular Filtration Rate', 'Glucose', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hepatic', 'Hour', 'Insulin', 'Insulin Infusion Systems', 'Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Markov chain Monte Carlo methodology', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Minor Planets', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Power Plants', 'Property', 'Publishing', 'Recommendation', 'Renal function', 'Running', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transportation', 'Treatment outcome', 'Uncertainty', 'Validity of Results', 'Weather', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical phenotype', 'computerized', 'control theory', 'fly', 'glucose metabolism', 'glucose monitor', 'glucose production', 'health record', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'insulin secretion', 'interstitial', 'mathematical model', 'nutrition', 'optimal treatments', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'personalized learning', 'personalized medicine', 'physiologic model', 'predictive modeling', 'reduced food intake', 'space travel', 'treatment strategy']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R01,2019,660597,0.006111509366166106
"Sepsis Early Prediction and Subphenotype Illumination Study (SEPSIS) PROJECT SUMMARY Sepsis, defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction in response to infection, is a devastating condition that contributes to up to half of hospital deaths and over $24 billion in healthcare costs in the U.S. annually. Over 750,000 patients develop sepsis in the U.S. each year, and survivors suffer long-term cognitive impairment and physical disability. Historically, sepsis research has focused on patients who are already critically ill. However, up to 50% of patients with sepsis receive their care on the inpatient wards, and only 10% of patients with sepsis are initially diagnosed in the intensive care unit (ICU). Because early intervention improves outcomes in sepsis, it is important to optimize the detection and treatment of sepsis outside the ICU.  The current sepsis paradigm has several problems. The first problem is that early identification of infection relies on clinician intuition, and caregivers often disagree regarding which patients are infected. This leads to delays in therapy and increased mortality in some patients and unnecessary therapies and adverse medication side effects in others. A second problem is that there is a lack of accurate tools to risk stratify infected patients outside the ICU after they are identified. Some patients with infection are treated outside the ICU and are later discharged home, while others develop life-threatening complications and die in the hospital. Accurate risk stratification of infected patients would bring additional critical care resources to the bedside of the high-risk patients that need them most. A third problem with the current sepsis paradigm is that it is often treated as a one-size-fits-all syndrome. However, patients with sepsis have a wide range of clinical presentations and outcomes due to the complex interactions between patient risk factors, the infectious organism, and the host immune response. These data suggest that the impact of timely and more aggressive interventions on outcomes may differ based on a patient's clinical phenotype. Identifying important subphenotypes of infected patients is critical to delivering more personalized care at the bedside.  The purpose of this project is to use data from the electronic health record and statistical modeling techniques to identify high-risk infected patients and important new subphenotypes of this syndrome. In Aim 1, we will develop a novel tool for identifying infected patients outside the ICU using modern machine learning techniques. In Aim 2, we will develop a tool for risk stratifying infected patients outside the ICU using machine learning methods. Finally, in Aim 3 we will use cluster analysis techniques to determine whether the benefit of early and more aggressive interventions varies based on clinical phenotype. Our project will provide clinicians with powerful new tools to identify high-risk infected patients and important new subphenotypes of this common and deadly syndrome. This work will help to deliver early, life-saving care to the bedside of septic patients and lead to future interventional trials aimed at decreasing preventable death. PROJECT NARRATIVE Sepsis, defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction in response to infection, is a devastating condition that contributes to up to half of hospital deaths and over $24 billion in costs in the US. The purpose of this project is to use data from the electronic health record and statistical modeling techniques to identify high-risk infected patients and determine which subgroups of patients benefit most from early and more aggressive interventions.

"Reliable Seizure Prediction Using Physiological Signals and Machine Learning ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): For most individuals living with epilepsy, seizures are relatively infrequent events occupying a small fraction of their life. Despite spending as little a 0.01% of their lives having seizures (typically only minutes per month), people with epilepsy take anti-epileptic drugs (AED) daily, suffer AED related side effects, and spend their lives dreading when the next seizure will strike. The apparent randomness of seizures is associated with significant psychological consequences. In addition, despite daily AED approximately 1/3 of patients continue to have seizures. We hypothesize that epilepsy can be more effectively treated, both the seizures and their psychological impact, by providing patients with real-time seizure forecasting. Periods of low seizure probability would not require AEDs, or at least lower doses of AEDs, thus reducing AED exposure and their side effects. Periods of high seizure probability may respond to acute AED and patients could alter their activities to avoid injury. Patients would be empowered to manage their medications and life activities using reliable seizure forecasts. In this grant we investigate the hypothesis that seizures are predictable events, and pursue accurate, clinically relevant seizure forecasting using recent advances in support vector machines (SVM), data-analytic models, and Universum-SVM applied to continuous intracranial EEG (iEEG) in focal canine epilepsy. This is an initial step in establishin a new treatment paradigm for focal epilepsy, whereby the probability of seizure occurrence is continuously tracked for patient warning and intelligent responsive therapies. Naturally occurring focal canine epilepsy is an excellent model for investigation of seizure forecasting because of the clinical and electrophsyiological similarity to focal human epilepsy. This study provides a unique opportunity to study seizure forecasting in naturally occurring canine epilepsy under uniform conditions (the same environment). Importantly, dogs are large enough to accommodate devices designed for human use. The hypotheses driving this proposal are that focal seizures are not random events and there are brain states associated with low or high probability of seizure occurrence, and that these states can be reliably classified using machine learning approaches (SVM & Universum-SVM) that combine features from iEEG, behavioral state tracking, and electrocardiogram (ECG) heart rate variability. The goal of this proposal is to develop reliable seizure forecasting (when possible) and improved understanding (data characterization) when good forecasting is not possible. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This grant proposes to develop the capability for accurate, reliable seizure forecasting using recent advances in support vector machines, data-analytic models, and Universum-SVM applied to continuous intracranial EEG canines with naturally occurring epilepsy.

"Novel Atrial Fibrillation Phenotypes Defined by Functional-Anatomical, Machine-Learned Classifications Abstract Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a pervasive disease which affects over 30 million individuals worldwide, in whom it is associated with morbidity and mortality, yet for which therapeutic outcomes are suboptimal. One major limitation to mechanistic and clinical advances in AF is its taxonomy, which is based on number of days of detected AF rather than increasingly reported functional and personalized mechanisms. I reasoned that a digital and scalable AF taxonomy, based on interactions of anatomic and functional factors and clinical features, may better guide existing therapy and catalyze future mechanistic and therapeutic advances. I set out to create a predictive tool to guide therapy in AF patients using machine learning of rich mechanistic data from a large multicenter registry of patients undergoing ablation. I hypothesized that clinically actionable AF phenotypes can be defined by statistical clustering between electrophysiologic features, anatomic regions and clinical indices, that can be uncovered by physiological and statistical quantification and machine learning. I have two Specific Aims: 1) To construct a multimodal digital atlas of atrial fibrillation which registers functional indices at absolute and relative spatial locations in both atria from a multicenter registry, and make this atlas available as an open-source software resource. This deliverable will uniquely map the probability that specific mechanisms will be relevant to AF in a specific patient of given clinical characteristics. Novel pathophysiological phenotypes will be defined via probabilistic interactions in these individual components. 2) To develop a predictive tool using machine learning to estimate the likelihood that ablation at any site(s) will contribute to success tailored to individual characteristics, by learning clusters of electrophysiologic features, clinical indices, and anatomic regions in a training population and applying it to a validation cohort from a large multicenter registry. This project uses state-of-the-art computational tools and statistical methods that may reconcile divergent AF mechanistic hypotheses to define novel functional AF phenotypes and guide therapy. In the process, I will be mentored by world leading mentors, in an extraordinary training environment to facilitate this development into an independent physician-scientist in bioengineering-heart rhythm medicine. Project Narrative This research provides an avenue to define atrial fibrillation in an actionable classification rooted in pathophysiologic and mechanistic observations. Such a classification scheme would further our understanding and refine our conversation about complex arrhythmia in cardiac tissue. Only an understanding at this level is will provide truly effective and safe treatments of each individual patient’s arrhythmic condition.","Novel Atrial Fibrillation Phenotypes Defined by Functional-Anatomical, Machine-Learned Classifications",9772892,F32HL144101,"['3-Dimensional', 'Ablation', 'Affect', 'Anatomy', 'Anti-Arrhythmia Agents', 'Applications Grants', 'Arrhythmia', 'Atlases', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Cardiac', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Classification Scheme', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Faculty', 'Foundations', 'Freedom', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Heart Atrium', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Mission', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Obstructive Sleep Apnea', 'Patients', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Pulmonary veins', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Taxonomy', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapy trial', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translations', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'base', 'clinically actionable', 'cohort', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'digital', 'disease classification', 'health care service utilization', 'heart rhythm', 'improved outcome', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'mortality', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'open source', 'patient registry', 'patient response', 'patient stratification', 'predictive tools', 'success', 'supervised learning', 'therapy outcome', 'tool', 'trial design']",NHLBI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,F32,2019,66778,0.007208569005037275
"ARTERY Outcomes: tAilored dRug Titration through artificial intElligence: an inteRventional studY Need: Nearly half (34 million) of all hypertension (HTN) patients have their blood pressure (BP) uncontrolled. Despite medication and life-style management, the cost of HTN-associated hospitalizations is $113 billion, or 15% of all hospital costs. HTN is the leading cause for stroke, heart failure (HF) and myocardial infarction (MI) hospitalizations. Clinical trials have shown that active pharmacological treatment management of HTN to BP goal reduces the incidence of stroke by 35-40%, MI by 15-25%, and HF by up to 64%.  Solution: In response to the national “epidemic” of uncontrolled HTN, Optima Integrated Health has developed optima4BP. optima4BP is an artificial intelligence (AI) that transforms the episodic and reactive nature of uncontrolled BP pharmacological treatment management into a process that is continuous, proactive, and personalized. The innovation was developed with the physician in mind by simulating the in-office clinical reasoning treatment decision process. optima4BP is a physician decision support aid that safely and when needed optimizes the pharmacological treatment for HTN. optima4BP is interoperable in real-time with the EpicÒ Electronic Health Record (EHR), constantly evaluating the efficacy of patients’ current treatment and the requirement for optimization. When a treatment optimization is needed, optima4BP communicates directly with the treating physician by providing a recommendation in the EHR In-Basket that can be accepted or declined.  Goal of Direct to Phase II: ARTERY Outcomes [tailored drug titration through artificial intelligence: an interventional study] is a 12 months follow-up, randomized clinical trial (n=300) that: Evaluates optima4BP’s safety and efficacy in improving HTN control [Aim 1], and Ensures Data Systems Maintenance [Aim 2].  Aim 1. Evaluate optima4BP’s safety and efficacy in improving HTN control. We propose to conduct a randomized clinical trial (ARTERY Outcomes) at UC San Francisco Medical Center (UCSF MC). We will investigate the safety and efficacy of optima4BP in improving BP control compared to standard of care (SoC). The primary end-point will examine the reduction in systolic BP (SBP) between in-office start and end of study. Milestone: optima4BP reduces SBP by >6 mmHg than SoC. The safety of using optima4BP will be investigated as a secondary outcome in the context of reported adverse events (AEs).  Aim 2. Ensure data systems maintenance (DSM). DSM is a critical activity that includes optimization, error correction, deletion of discarded features and enhancement of existing features. UCSF MC and Optima IT teams will address (1) Data Acquisition upgrades and patches of any system/component within the data flow; and (2) Surveillance management that addresses systems errors, and performs audits/upgrades on the data repository [data warehouse]. Milestone: Ensure the validity of the collected-processed-analyzed data.  Commercial Application: With a growing need for value-based care, optima4BP is strongly positioned to support this specific care coordination model. Our goal is to simplify the care management of high blood pressure (BP) with the goal of reaching BP control, demonstrated to reduce the incidence of stroke, heart failure, and myocardial infarction. We will investigate the benefits of optima4BP artificial intelligence that transforms the episodic and reactive nature of uncontrolled BP pharmacological treatment management into a process that is continuous, proactive, and personalized.",ARTERY Outcomes: tAilored dRug Titration through artificial intElligence: an inteRventional studY,9840429,R44HL149428,"['Address', 'Adverse event', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Blood Pressure', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Comorbidity', 'Confidential Information', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency department visit', 'Ensure', 'Epidemic', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Gender', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heart failure', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospitalization', 'Hybrids', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Hypertension', 'Information Systems', 'Intervention Studies', 'Learning', 'Life Style', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Safety', 'San Francisco', 'Secure', 'Service delivery model', 'Stroke', 'System', 'Time', 'Titrations', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'adverse event risk', 'arm', 'base', 'blood pressure reduction', 'blood pressure regulation', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'care coordination', 'commercial application', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'data warehouse', 'follow-up', 'health care delivery', 'hypertension control', 'hypertension treatment', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interoperability', 'medication compliance', 'primary endpoint', 'primary outcome', 'randomized trial', 'response', 'secondary outcome', 'side effect', 'standard of care', 'stroke incidence', 'treatment arm', 'treatment choice', 'treatment optimization', 'web services']",NHLBI,"OPTIMA INTEGRATED HEALTH, INC.",R44,2019,739992,-0.031481186484821864
"Investigation of Stereotyped High-Frequency Oscillations with Computational Intelligence for the Prediction of Seizure Onset Zone in Epilepsy PROJECT SUMMARY Neurosurgical therapy of refractory epilepsy requires accurate localization of seizure onset zone (SOZ). In clinical practice, intracranial EEG (iEEG) is recorded in the epilepsy monitoring unit (EMU) over many days where multiple seizures are recorded to provide information to localize the SOZ. The prolonged monitoring in the EMU adds to the risk of complications and can include intracranial bleeding and potentially death. Recently, high frequency oscillations (HFO) of iEEG between 80 to 500 Hz are highly valued as a promising clinical biomarker for epilepsy. HFOs are believed to be clinically significant, and thus could be used for SOZ localization. However, HFOs can also be recorded from normal and non-epileptic cerebral structures. When defined only by rate or frequency, pathological HFOs are indistinguishable from physiological ones, which limit their application in epilepsy pre-surgical planning. In this proposal, to the best of our knowledge, we show of a recurrent waveform pattern that distinguishes pathological HFOs from physiological ones. In particular, we observed that the SOZ generates repeatedly a set of stereotyped HFO waveforms whereas the HFOs from nonepileptic regions were irregular in their waveform morphology. Based on these observations, using computational tools built on recent advances in sparse coding and unsupervised machine learning techniques, we propose to detect these stereotyped recurrent HFO waveform patterns directly from the continuous iEEG data of adult and pediatric patients and test their prognostic value by correlating the spatial distribution of detected events to clinical findings such as SOZ, resection zone and seizure freedom. We hypothesize that accurate detection of pathologic HFOs in brief iEEG recordings can identify the SOZ and eliminate the necessity of prolonged EMU monitoring and reduce the associated risks. With these motivations, in this project an interdisciplinary team composed of biomedical engineers, epileptologists and neurosurgeons will work together to develop and test novel computational tools to detect stereotyped HFOs and its subtypes in large iEEG datasets recorded with clinical electrodes. Developed algorithms and iEEG data will be shared with the research community to contribute to the reproducible research and help other research groups to develop novel methods. The results of this study will be essential for achieving our group's long term goal of developing an online neural signal processing system for the rapid and accurate identification of SOZ with brief invasive recording. PROJECT NARRATIVE Prolonged iEEG monitoring for SOZ localization does add to the risk of complications and may include serious issues, such as intracranial bleeding, meningoencephalitis, and eventually death. The intellectual merit of this project is to develop computational intelligence tools based on recent advances in sparse coding and unsupervised machine learning techniques to investigate stereotyped high frequency oscillations (HFOs) in long-term iEEG and test the hypothesis whether the automated detection of HFOs will yield accurate and fast identification of SOZ.",Investigation of Stereotyped High-Frequency Oscillations with Computational Intelligence for the Prediction of Seizure Onset Zone in Epilepsy,9802783,R01NS112497,"['Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Brain', 'Cerebrum', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Environment', 'Epilepsy', 'Event', 'Excision', 'Freedom', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Hemorrhage', 'High Frequency Oscillation', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Lesion', 'Meningoencephalitis', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Motivation', 'Motor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Neocortex', 'Neurosurgeon', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Recurrence', 'Refractory', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Scheme', 'Seizures', 'Site', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Stereotyping', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translations', 'Visual', 'Work', 'awake', 'base', 'clinical biomarkers', 'clinical practice', 'clinically significant', 'computational intelligence', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'neurotransmission', 'novel', 'pediatric patients', 'prognostic value', 'prospective', 'signal processing', 'tool', 'unsupervised learning']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF HOUSTON,R01,2019,488027,0.006773617713749433
"Novel Non-Invasive Coronary Flow Patterning to Predict Early Coronary Microvascular Disease PROJECT SUMMARY  Coronary microvascular disease (CMD) is notoriously difficult to diagnose non-invasively, and current methods of assessing CMD utilize only the peak velocity of the coronary flow pattern. While new imaging techniques such as cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have improved the assessment coronary perfusion, there are currently no non-invasive methods that incorporate the coronary flow pattern over a complete cardiac cycle to definitively assess and predict the development of CMD.  Coronary blood flow (CBF) reflects the summation of flow in the coronary microcirculation, and our lab has begun to harness the full CBF pattern under varying flow and disease conditions (e.g. type 2 diabetes) to determine whether it might harbor novel clues leading to the early detection of CMD. Our past and preliminary data indicate an early onset of CMD in both type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and metabolic syndrome (MetS) that occurs prior to the onset of macrovascular complications and that are characterized by blood flow impairments and alterations in coronary resistance microvessel (CRM) structure, function, and biomechanics. Our data also uncovered innovative correlations between CRM structure/biomechanics and our newly-defined features of the coronary flow pattern, some of which were unique to normal or diabetic mice. We have initially utilized these CBF features, in the presence and absence of other factors such as cardiac function, to develop a mathematical model in collaboration with Drs. Christopher Bartlett and William Ray that to date demonstrated that 6 simple factors can predict a normal vs. diabetic coronary flow pattern with 85% predictive accuracy. Utilizing a multidisciplinary approach, these preliminary data strongly suggest that the coronary flow pattern and physiological modulators of it (e.g. coronary micovascular structure/function/biomechanics, cardiac function, etc), may be useful in directly diagnosing early CMD. Therefore, we hypothesize that dissecting the elements that influence coronary flow patterning will be critical determinants in the direct assessment of coronary microvascular disease using computational modeling. Using our previous publications and our preliminary data as guides, the hypothesis will be tested by addressing two specific aims: 1) Determine whether unique time-dependent CBF patterning in normal and T2DM is dictated by a combination of CRM remodeling and biomechanics, coronary flow pattern dynamics, and cardiac function, permitting the development of a computational model to accurately predict CMD; 2) Determine the reproducibility and robustness of the machine learning model in predicting CMD in a diet-induced obesity/diabetes mouse model. If successful, these studies will be the first to simultaneously examine the influence of CRMs, CBF, and cardiac structure/function on the distinct pattern of coronary flow, and it will determine whether a mathematical model may be useful in establishing a direct assessment of CMD to eventually enable clinicians to conduct a more direct non-invasive diagnosis of CMD for the prevention and/or treatment of heart disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) is the leading cause of heart disease and is associated with hypertension, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome. Coronary Microvascular Disease (CMD) is comprised of structural and functional deficits of the tiny coronary arteries that may be an earlier indicator of disease prior to the onset of overt CAD. The proposed multidisciplinary research aims to develop a computational artificial intelligence model that will accurately predict CMD based on a non-invasive coronary flow pattern obtained by Doppler echocardiography.",Novel Non-Invasive Coronary Flow Patterning to Predict Early Coronary Microvascular Disease,9769734,R21EB026518,"['Address', 'Age', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biomechanics', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiac', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Simulation', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary artery', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic mouse', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Doppler Echocardiography', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Echocardiography', 'Elements', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hyperemia', 'Hypertension', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impairment', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Methods', 'Microcirculation', 'Microvascular Dysfunction', 'Modeling', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Publications', 'Reproducibility', 'Resistance', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'base', 'coronary perfusion', 'db/db mouse', 'diabetic', 'disorder prevention', 'early onset', 'experimental study', 'heart function', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'macrovascular disease', 'mathematical model', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'novel', 'pressure', 'prevent']",NIBIB,RESEARCH INST NATIONWIDE CHILDREN'S HOSP,R21,2019,228000,-0.021043077235998506
"Estimating Trajectory of Recovery in Cardiac Rehabilitation using Mobile Health Technology and Personalized Machine Learning Project Summary/Abstract The objective of our work leverages mobile health technology to develop machine learning models for longitudinal trajectories of recovery like those needed in cardiac rehabilitation. The investigation uses mobile health technology to quantify trajectories of recovery measures, personalizing understanding of exercise capacity and cardiac function. Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation programs reduce cardiovascular mortality risks and improve patient outcomes in such longitudinal fashion, through increased exercise capacity as measured by peak V02 improvements over the course of care. These programs have recently been extended to include heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) patients. Despite the reduction in mortality and readmissions, participation and adherence in cardiac rehabilitation programs remains a challenge, especially in underserved communities because of limited program availability, the distance and transportation access to a program, its hours of operation, as well as a lack of diversity and gender-dominated programs. Home-based programs using smartphones have shown to increase adherence and achieve similar outcomes. While home-based programs also improved resting heart rate, systolic blood pressure, and levels of physical activity achieved through metabolic equivalent of tasks and peak V02 at the end of the study, users expressed a desire to have individualized education and treatment. Home-based systems still do not achieve real-time interaction, feedback, and monitoring that center-based rehabilitation does through a lack of feedback and necessity of self-reported exertion values. A system is needed that quantify measures of exercise capacity, which can lead to recovery, dynamically throughout the course of treatment. This proposal develops an unobtrusive system, with new mobile health technology sensors, and trains analytic models that allow for personalized quantification of rehabilitation trajectories in HFrEF patients, which can monitor patient adherence and improvement in measures during exercise as well as while at rest. This system investigates the improvement over the course of a 12-week cardiac rehabilitation study and designs trajectories of recovery to understand improvements in peak V02 and exercise capacity in HFrEF patients by also measuring improvements of measurements of heart rate and blood pressure while at rest. This allows for an investigation of additional measures, over time, that may better quantify recovery in HFrEF patients that can be used for center-based rehabilitation or home-based rehabilitation. This can provide a significant enhancement of metrics that define recovery for HFrEF patients with estimations to metrics that are difficult to collect and evaluate. Project Narrative Quantification of trajectories of recovery for patients through wearable mobile health technologies can provide personal understanding of improvements and challenges faced in recovery by patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. Such a system will indicate to each patient the improvement in exercise capacity needed to continue preventing any recurrent events, allowing participants to have the understanding and individualized feeling they get from clinic visits and center-based cardiac rehabilitation at home or any other location they wish to participate in recovery activities. The exploration of additional markers of recovery can continue to provide quantification of heart failure conditions useful for clinicians and patients alike.",Estimating Trajectory of Recovery in Cardiac Rehabilitation using Mobile Health Technology and Personalized Machine Learning,9809933,R21EB028486,"['Achievement', 'Adherence', 'Behavior', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Pressure', 'Cardiac rehabilitation', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Characteristics', 'Chest', 'Clinic Visits', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'EFRAC', 'Education', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Exertion', 'Failure', 'Feedback', 'Feeling', 'Gender', 'Health Technology', 'Heart Rate', 'Heart failure', 'Home environment', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physical activity', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Proxy', 'Pulse Pressure', 'Recovery', 'Recurrence', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Rest', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transportation', 'Update', 'Visit', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'analytical method', 'base', 'compliance behavior', 'design', 'exercise capacity', 'heart function', 'heart rate monitor', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'longitudinal analysis', 'mHealth', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'novel', 'operation', 'prevent', 'programs', 'rate of change', 'sensor technology', 'smart watch', 'wearable device']",NIBIB,TEXAS ENGINEERING EXPERIMENT STATION,R21,2019,208632,-0.0166568851744724
"Improving the measurement and analysis of long-term, patient-centered outcomes following acute respiratory failure PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This Pathway to Independence Award application is submitted by a pulmonary and critical care epidemiologist committed to improving the quality of patient-oriented research for patients experiencing acute respiratory failure (ARF). Worldwide, millions of patients develop ARF annually. In the U.S., nearly one million patients with ARF require mechanical ventilation annually, accounting for a quarter of all intensive care unit (ICU) admissions. As improvements in ICU care reduce such patients’ in-hospital mortality rates, attention has shifted to the challenges ARF survivors face in regaining their prior cognitive, physical, and psychosocial functioning. However, there is a key barrier for randomized clinical trials (RCTs) testing new interventions to improve ARF survivorship – that is, the current lack of an endpoint that (1) captures long-term patient dispositions, (2) incorporates patient preferences and perspectives, and (3) is able to be analyzed without concern for statistical biases. The overarching goal of this research is to support clinical innovation by developing new approaches to measure and report long-term patient-centered outcomes that overcome the methodological barriers currently limiting ARF RCTs. The applicant will accomplish his goals under the mentorship of established researchers in critical care, patient-centered outcomes research, statistics, and informatics to assure his transition to a tenure-track faculty position in the R00 phase and his emergence as a leading pulmonary and critical care epidemiologist. First, the applicant will use an innovative combination of qualitative and quantitative research methods to elicit and integrate ARF survivors’ and their caregivers’ perspectives into a new patient-centered, long-term composite outcome measure (K99 phase). During the R00 phase, the applicant will recruit ARF survivors to participate in a prospective cohort, and follow these patients to describe the burden of ARF survivorship over 1-year using the new endpoint developed during the K99 phase. This endeavor will also provide key data that will facilitate sample size calculations in future ARF RCTs. Data from this cohort will additionally be used to develop an electronic health record (EHR)-based algorithm to predict risks for adverse long-term outcomes among ARF patients early in their ICU stays. Thus, this K99/R00 will augment ARF research by establishing a new outcome measure anchored in patient perspectives, improving the understanding and clinical prognostication of post-ICU morbidity following ARF, and facilitate the efficiency and clinical relevance of future ARF RCTs by enabling measurement of patients’ baseline risks for different outcomes.

"An artificial intelligence-driven distributed stereotactic radiosurgery strategy for multiple brain metastases management PROJECT SUMMARY Brain metastases (BMs) are a life-threatening neurological disease, but current treatment regimens cannot manage multiple (>4) BMs (mBMs) without causing strong adverse effects. Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), utilizing potent dose to irradiate BMs and quick dose falloff to spare nearby tissues, has proven to be an effective treatment regimen for limited-number and small-size BMs. However, SRS could not avoid high toxic dose when BMs are multiple, clustered, or adjacent to critical organs. To safe and effectively treat mBMs with SRS requires addressing these urgent needs: 1) to identify the maximum tolerable SRS dose; 2) to study neurocognitive decline and design strategies to preserve patients’ post-treatment quality of life; and 3) to develop and implement high-quality streamlined mBMs SRS treatment and follow-up care. To address mBMs SRS management needs, we aim to develop and implement an artificial intelligence (AI)- driven treatment planning system (TPS) and conduct a therapeutic intervention clinical trial, both dedicated to improve mBMs SRS treatment quality and efficiency. The AI-driven TPS, namely AimBMs, will have three AI- based computational modules, including AI-Segtor for automatic segmentation, AI-Predictor for treatment outcome prediction and AI-Planner for spatiotemporal distributed SRS plan optimization. AimBMs is initially developed based on retrospective data and facilitate the mBMs distributed SRS prospective phase I/II clinical trials, while the clinical trial will provide critical clinical knowledge and evidence as feedback to improve AimBMs performance. The ultimate goal of the project is to translate the AimBMs to routine clinical practice to improve mBMs SRS treatment quality, patients’ post-treatment QoL, and clinical facility workflow. In response to PAR-18-560, we have formed a multidisciplinary collaboration between radiation oncologists and medical physicists to develop a novel AI-driven distributed SRS technology and conduct a cancer-targeted therapeutic intervention for managing mBMs. The project’s innovations include: 1) novel SRS treatment planning technological capability enabled by AI-based auto-segmentation, treatment outcome prediction, and spatiotemporal plan optimization; 2) novel AI learning capability to improve developed AI tools’ performance through the coherent clinical trial. The technology development will support the therapeutic intervention clinical trial, while the clinical trial is designated to improve the developed system performance. This seamlessly integrated development mode ensures the developed system is clinically practical. Upon completion, our newly developed AimBMs will lay a solid foundation for mBMs SRS management and benefit a wide population of patients with BMs. Moreover, the AI-based treatment planning and treatment delivery infrastructure built for mBMs SRS can be transferred to other tumor sites to generate an even broader clinical impact. PROJECT NARRATIVE Patients with multiple brain metastases, a cancer which has spread to multiple places in the brain, have poor survival or quality of life after single fraction stereotactic radiosurgery or whole brain radiotherapy. We will develop and study a new treatment strategy for multiple brain metastases using spatial and temporal fractionated stereotactic radiosurgery by frameless GammaKnife.

"Detecting Middle Ear Fluid Using Smartphones PROJECT SUMMARY Otitis media is one of the most common childhood diseases in developing countries; many of its complications are preventable if middle ear fluid is detected early. We propose an accessible and accurate smartphone-based screening tool that (i) sends a soft acoustic chirp into the ear canal using the smartphone speaker, (ii) detects reflected sound from the eardrum using the smartphone microphone, and (iii) employs a machine learning model to classify these reflections and predict middle ear fluid status in realtime. Given the ubiquity of smartphones and the inaccuracy of visual otoscopy, the system we propose has the potential to be the default screening tool used in developing countries by healthcare providers and caregivers at home. PROJECT NARRATIVE Otitis media is one of the most common childhood diseases in developing countries affecting over 1.23 billion people in 2013 and can lead to complications such as hearing loss, developmental delay, meningitis, mastoiditis, and death. Many of these complications are preventable if middle ear fluid is detected early. However, the absence of an accurate and accessible method to detect middle ear fluid has led to high misdiagnosis rates. The consequence is associated hearing and speech impairment rates greater than any other pediatric condition and growing microbial resistance as a result of antibiotic over-prescription. Currently, the technique of choice for detecting middle ear fluid by primary care providers is visual otoscopy, which has a diagnostic accuracy as low as 51%. Although more accurate methods like tympanometry and pneumatic otoscopy exist, they require significant expertise and referral to a specialist. Commercial acoustic reflectometers and smartphone-mounted otoscopes require specialized hardware. Thus, there is an urgent, unmet need for an accurate, rapid and easily accessible method for resource-limited healthcare providers and caregivers to detect middle ear fluid. This project aims to demonstrate the feasibility of using the speakers and microphones on existing smartphones to detect middle ear fluid by assessing eardrum mobility. Our proposed system would operate by (i) sending a soft acoustic chirp into the ear canal using the smartphone speaker, (ii) detecting reflected sound from the eardrum using the smartphone microphone, and (iii) employing a machine learning model to classify these reflections and predict middle ear fluid status. No additional attachments would be required beyond a paper funnel, which acts as a speculum to reduce waveform variability and can be constructed with printer paper, scissors, and tape. This technique is the first software-based screening tool for middle ear fluid detection that uses off-the-shelf smartphones which does not require hardware attachments or visual interpretation. Using data from our existing preliminary clinical study we aim to develop signal processing and machine learning algorithms to optimize sensitivity and specificity. We plan to develop a bench testing technique that enables previously unsupported smartphones to to run our test and prospectively validate our optimized algorithm clinically in parallel testing with an acoustic reflectometer. Further we aim to develop a user interface and improved funnel design. These new designs will undergo usability testing in physician and parent populations.

"Personalized Statin Treatment Plan to Optimize Clinical Outcomes Using Big Data PROJECT SUMMARY An estimated 47% of Americans 65 years of age and older take statins, which are highly effective in lowering low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), and reducing all-cause mortality. Unfortunately, ~50% of patients prescribed statins do not obtain these critical benefits because they discontinue use within 1 year of treatment initiation. There, Statin discontinuation has been identified as a major public-health concern due to increased morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs associated with ASCVD. In clinical practice, statin-associated symptoms (SAS) often result in dose reduction or discontinuation of these life-saving medications. Currently, physicians employ reactive strategies to manage SAS concerns after they manifest, such as offering an alternative statin treatment plan (e.g., reducing dosage or changing medication) or a `statin holiday'. However, with numerous statin treatment strategies available and no means of optimizing their match to a given patient, physician decision-making is based on minimal patient data elements. Moreover, using a single patient's data to identify the optimal statin regimen and treatment plan is inadequate to ensure that the harms of statin use are minimized and the benefits are maximized. A decision- support system, by contrast, can use a vast number of variables from a large number of patients (“big data”) to match an optimal statin treatment plan to an individual patient prospectively. We propose to use complex patient information to develop and test an effective predictive model and tool, the personalized statin treatment plan (PSTP) platform, which could be used by physicians to optimize personalized statin treatment to minimize harms (SAS and statin discontinuation) while at the same time maximizing benefits (LDL reduction). The proposed study leverages data from the OptumLabs Data Warehouse (which includes more than 20 years of insurance claims and electronic health records data from more than 150 million patients across the United States), as well as clinical trial simulations, for model development, validation, and evaluation. We will address the following specific aims: 1) Develop and validate a deep-learning model to predict both SAS and statin discontinuation using linked insurance claims and EHR data; 2) Develop and validate the PSTP platform to identify statin treatment plans that optimize both LDL reduction (benefit) and SAS and statin discontinuation (harm) for a given patient profile; and 3) Evaluate the PSTP relative to current and guideline-driven practices using CTS to assess clinical benefits and harms. The proposed study will produce a precision-medicine tool to empower physicians to make proactive clinical decisions regarding statin treatment planning (i.e., selecting the statin drug and dosage optimized for a particular patient to maximize LDL reduction and minimize statin discontinuation and SAS) before any statin is prescribed. The implementation of such a tool would substantially improve public health by reducing statin discontinuation and sub-optimal clinical outcomes inherent in current reactive statin-prescribing strategies based on non-personalized statin treatment plans. PROJECT NARRATIVE About 50% of patients prescribed statins do not obtain critical benefits in lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, and reducing all-cause mortality because they discontinue use within 1 year of treatment initiation largely due to statin-associated symptoms.

"Development of a Machine Learning Model to Integrate Clinical, Laboratory, Sonographic, and Elastographic Data for Noninvasive Liver Tissue Characterization in NAFLD Abstract Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is exceptionally common, with an estimated one hundred million afflicted people in the United States. Detection and risk stratification of this very common disease remains a major challenge. Despite recent advances, including development of numerous therapeutic agents presently in phase 2 and 3 trials, NAFLD remains a silent disease in which the vast majority of patients accumulate progressive liver damage without signs or symptoms and, undiagnosed, receive no medical care. The NAFLD patients at highest risk of cirrhosis are those with moderate or greater liver fibrosis at the time of diagnosis, a group of patients who are described as having high risk non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (hrNASH). The current reference standard for identifying people with hrNASH is liver biopsy, which is expensive, invasive, and limited by interobserver variability. The focus of this project is to develop and validate low cost non-invasive diagnostic technology to diagnose hrNASH. We propose to accomplish this in three Specific Aims. First, we will expand and annotate an existing database of patients with chronic liver disease from 328 subjects to 1,000 subjects, ~40% of whom will have NAFLD. The database will contain ~20,000 images (~10,000 ultrasound elastography images and ~ 10,000 conventional ultrasound images) and multiple demographic and clinical data points for each subject (a total of ~30,000 clinical, laboratory, and demographic data points). We have previously developed advanced image processing techniques to make ultrasound elastography more accurate and less variable. We will use this large database to develop, customize and refine our image processing techniques for NAFLD evaluation (Aim 1), with the goal of improving ultrasound elastography diagnosis of hrNASH. Second, we will combine conventional ultrasound elastography imaging, conventional ultrasound imaging, our advanced image analysis techniques, and the demographic, clinical, and laboratory data in a machine learning model to predict hrNASH and will compare the performance of our predictive model with the FIB4, a widely-used blood test-based prediction rule (Aim 2). Third, we will validate our predictive model in an independent prospective cohort of NAFLD subjects undergoing biopsy for NAFLD risk stratification (Aim 3). We hypothesize that the combination of image processing-enhanced elastography and conventional ultrasound imagery combined with demographic, clinical, and laboratory data will have greater predictive power for hrNASH than clinical or sonographic data alone. The proposed predictive models have the potential to (1) reduce the number of liver biopsies performed for hrNASH detection, (2) facilitate recruitment for clinical trials of NAFLD therapeutics, and (3) improve care quality for the most common liver disease in the United States. Project Narrative In this project, we aim to create low-cost non-invasive technology to diagnose people with high risk non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (hrNASH), a common liver disease that has a high risk of cirrhosis. We will accomplish this goal by improving liver ultrasound imaging and by creating a prediction tool that integrates liver ultrasound, laboratory testing and clinical information. This prediction tool has the potential to reduce the need for liver biopsies.","Development of a Machine Learning Model to Integrate Clinical, Laboratory, Sonographic, and Elastographic Data for Noninvasive Liver Tissue Characterization in NAFLD",9640524,R01DK119860,"['Algorithmic Analysis', 'Area', 'Biopsy', 'Blood Tests', 'Caring', 'Cirrhosis', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Evaluation', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Laboratories', 'Liver', 'Liver Fibrosis', 'Liver diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase II/III Trial', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Prospective cohort', 'Quality of Care', 'ROC Curve', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Reference Standards', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Running', 'Schedule', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Staging', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Therapeutic Clinical Trial', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'chronic liver disease', 'clinical care', 'cost', 'disorder subtype', 'elastography', 'high risk', 'image processing', 'improved', 'liver biopsy', 'liver imaging', 'liver injury', 'non-alcoholic fatty liver disease', 'nonalcoholic steatohepatitis', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'patient population', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'screening', 'standard of care', 'tool']",NIDDK,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2019,462750,-0.0051059358514358
"QuBBD: Geometric Time-Frequency Methods for Multi-modal Physiological Monitoring Modern health monitoring devices at hospitals and wearable sensors in households generate a large amount of time series data at high rate, capturing the physiological status of patients in a real-lime fashion. The premise is that these technology advances enable a data-driven healthcare system that starts making fast, accurate, objective and inexpensive decisions based upon data, in addition to an individual physician's experience and preference. However, there is a significant gap in the mathematical theory and computational tools to promptly extract actionable information from multi-modal non-stationary time series data in a robust and tractable manner, which has become a serious roadblock to further utilize bigger data for better healthcare monitoring. The goal of this research program is to develop a mathematical framework for extracting time-frequency and geometric representations of multi-modal physiological data, in an online and robust manner, and use them to design machine learning algorithms to improve real-lime health monitoring. Specifically, we hypothesize that the development of time-series and geometric methods for large streaming multi-modal monitoring data will lead to more accurate diagnosis on various physiological monitoring applications, including detection and prediction of rare events such as seizure and arrhythmia, classification of sleep stages for newborns and children, and real-time artifact removal of physiological data. To achieve our goal, we plan to develop novel theoretical and computational tools for analyzing non-stationary multi-modal time series data with noise, corruption and missing data as well as real-time algorithms for filtering and event detection from such data. The tools and algorithms will be applied on clinical tasks at the Nationwide Children's Hospital. In addition, the real-time workflow will be implemented on Hadoop clusters with a mission of public sharing of both data and software. The development from the interdisciplinary team composed of mathematicians, biomedical informaticians as well as the hospital will not only transform the frontiers of mathematics knowledge, but also significantly impact clinical applications, data science education, and the development of the $11 O billion emerging market of wireless health. The goal of this project is to develop a series of novel computational theory and software to extract physiological information from the large multi-modal data streams generated by modern health monitoring devices.

"Instrumental screening for dysphagia by combining high-resolution cervical auscultation with advanced data analysis tools to identify silent dysphagia and silent aspiration ABSTRACT Dysphagia (disordered swallowing) causes nearly 150,000 annual hospitalizations and over 220,000 additional hospital days, and prolongs hospital lengths of stay by 40%. Dysphagia risk is typically identified through subjective screening methods and those identified through screening undergo gold standard imaging testing such as videofluoroscopy (VF). However, screening methods over- or underestimate risk, and completely fail to identify patients with silent dysphagia (e.g., silent aspiration) that can cause pneumonia and other adverse events. Pre-emptive detection of silent or near-silent aspiration is essential. The long term goal is to develop an instrumental dysphagia screening approach based on high-resolution cervical auscultation (HRCA) in order to early predict dysphagia-related adverse events, and initiate intervention measures to mitigate them. The overall objective here is to develop accurate, advanced data analysis approaches to translate HRCA signals to swallowing events observed in VF images. Our strong preliminary data has led us to our central hypothesis: advanced data analytics tools are suitable approaches for the analysis of HRCA in order to automate dysphagia screening. The rationale is that a reliable, robust early-warning instrumental dysphagia screening approach will reduce adverse events in patients with silent aspiration/dysphagia, shorten length of stay and improve overall clinical outcomes. Guided by strong preliminary data, we will pursue the following three specific aims: (1) develop machine learning algorithms to differentiate HRCA signals produced by swallowing physiologic events from similar, non-swallow related signals produced during swallowing; (2) translate HRCA swallowing-signal signatures to actual swallow physiologic events to detect abnormal swallowing physiology; and (3) discriminate normal from abnormal airway protection and swallow physiology via machine-learning analysis of HRCA signals with similar accuracy as VF. Under the first aim, a machine learning approach will be used to detect pharyngeal swallowing events and differentiate them from speech, cough and other non- swallow events, with 90% accuracy, when compared to a human expert’s interpretation of our VF data sets. Under the second aim, objective swallowing physiology observations from VF will be matched to swallowing events observed with HRCA in order to show that abnormal swallow physiology and airway protection will produce distinctive HRCA signal signatures that predict the same events identified with VF. Under the third aim, analytical algorithms will be used to detect signs of disordered airway protection in HRCA signal signatures with 90% accuracy when compared to a human expert’s airway protection ratings from VF images. The approach is innovative, as it will produce analysis tools that will infer about dysphagia and aspiration based on the analysis of HRCA with unprecedented accuracy, before patients are placed in harm’s way. Our work is significant, because it will translate to an early-warning HRCA screening tool that predicts dysphagia- related adverse events in asymptomatic patients reducing medical adverse events, and length of stay. The proposed research is relevant to public health because dysphagia is related to nearly 150,000 annual hospitalizations and over 220,000 additional hospital days, it increases pneumonia incidence, prolongs hospital stays by 40% for patients with many diseases, and is prevalent in acute care hospitals and nursing homes. Choking (airway obstruction) and pneumonia due to aspiration (inhalation of swallowed food and liquids), are common results of dysphagia, and both are preventable when dysphagia is identified before patients are offered oral food, liquids or medications. The proposed research is relevant to the part of NIH’s mission that pertains to enhancing health, lengthening life and reducing illnesses, as we will develop new data analytics tools to be used along with high-resolution cervical auscultation in order to instrumentally screen for dysphagia and predict dysphagia-related adverse events before they can harm patients with dysphagia.",Instrumental screening for dysphagia by combining high-resolution cervical auscultation with advanced data analysis tools to identify silent dysphagia and silent aspiration,9735365,R01HD092239,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Aspirate substance', 'Aspiration Pneumonia', 'Auscultation', 'Biomechanics', 'Caring', 'Cervical', 'Choking', 'Clinical', 'Coughing', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Deglutition', 'Deglutition Disorders', 'Dehydration', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Device Designs', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disabled Persons', 'Disease', 'Equipment', 'Event', 'Food', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Group Homes', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Health', 'Hospital Nursing', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Inhalation', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Length of Stay', 'Life', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Malnutrition', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nature', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Nursing Homes', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Pneumonia', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Screening procedure', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speech', 'Stroke', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Water', 'Work', 'airway obstruction', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'clinical practice', 'clinically significant', 'image processing', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'kinematics', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality', 'patient safety', 'post stroke', 'predictive signature', 'predictive tools', 'screening', 'tool', 'translational impact', 'vibration']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2019,302394,0.007657351215185782
"Novel Techniques for Evaluating and Assessing Symptoms, Affect. Heart Rhythm and Functional Status in Patients with Atrial Fibrillation: miAfib Project Project Summary/Abstract Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most prevalent, major arrhythmia in the United States. It leads to an increased risk of stroke, congestive heart failure, and overall mortality. AF is also characterized by symptoms in a majority of patients that can result in significant decreases in health related quality of life and functional status, which are strong predictors of all-cause and cardiovascular hospitalizations in patients with AF. Therefore, improvement in symptoms is an important therapeutic goal in the management of patients with AF along with reducing the risk of stroke and mortality. However, previous studies evaluating symptoms in AF have been limited by their retrospective assessment of symptoms that limits our ability to assess the relationship between heart rhythm, symptoms, affect and functional status in real time. To address all of these gaps, we propose an innovative study that will intensively examine 100 patients with paroxysmal AF using a continuous heart rhythm recorder and a novel mobile application to collect data on symptom and affect ratings during multiple occasions across a day for three weeks. We will then be able to examine the relationship between symptoms, affect, heart rhythm as well as additional features within the ECG recording and assess their effect on functional status in patients with AF. We hypothesize that 1) some symptoms will be much more specifically indicative of being in AF (e.g. palpitations) than others (e.g. fatigue) 2) ECG features derived from signal processing and machine learning algorithms (especially those that serve as surrogates for autonomic function) will be more sensitive and specific for determining the presence and severity of symptoms compared to average heart rate 3) there will be a strong relationship between affect, and both symptoms and functional status . The overarching goal of this proposal is for candidate (Hamid Ghanbari, MD, MPH) to develop an independent research program examining symptoms and associated decline in functional status in patients with paroxysmal AF. The candidate will build upon his previous training by partnering with a team of mentors who are experts in ecological momentary assessment methodology, signal processing and machine learning, affect, and functional status to acquire expertise in evaluation of repeated, real-time assessments of symptoms and to explore novel ECG features that predict symptoms beyond the presence or absence of AF. In concert with the proposed study, the candidate will also pursue didactic training and one-on-one mentoring related to his research aims. This proposal will more clearly characterize symptoms and their physiological and psychological correlates and their subsequent influence on functional status in patients with AF. The insights obtained through this proposal could eventually lead to individualized behavioral and medical interventions that best address these symptoms and associated dysfunction. Project Narrative - Public Health Relevance Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most prevalent arrhythmia in the United States and is associated with an increase in the risk of stroke, congestive heart failure and overall mortality. Despite the importance of AF, our understanding of symptoms associated with AF is limited by studies that rely on evaluation of symptoms based on a single clinical visit. The overarching goal of this proposal is to explore the complex relationship between symptoms, heart rhythm, and affect and assess their influence on day-to-day functioning using wearable sensors and a smartphone based mobile application.","Novel Techniques for Evaluating and Assessing Symptoms, Affect.

"Rethinking Electronic Fetal Monitoring to Improve Perinatal Outcomes and Reduce Frequency of Operative Vaginal and Cesarean Deliveries The essential role of electronic fetal monitoring (EFM) during labor is to prevent adverse outcomes due to fetal hypoxia and ischemia. Its established weaknesses include: 1) the obstetrician’s highly subjective visual interpretations of the signal patterns and 2) the widespread use of unproven surrogates for relevant fetal hypoxic and/or ischemic injury such as umbilical arterial pH, intrapartum stillbirth, newborn Apgar scores and neonatal seizures. This technology over the past 50 years has not been shown to decrease stillbirths or reduce the numbers of infants with cerebral palsy. EFM as it is presently used in the clinical setting has been associated with an extraordinary increase in the use of operative vaginal delivery and cesarean delivery. No functional algorithm has yet been developed that integrates clinical data collected in the antepartum period and during labor and any other patient specific data with the results of EFM. The main objective of the proposed research is to use recent breakthroughs in machine learning to drive the development of predictive analytics to support and improve the interpretation of EFM data, especially under real world conditions and in real time where clinicians must make timely decisions about interventions to prevent adverse outcomes. It is anticipated that the proposed research will result in significantly decreased use of operative vaginal delivery and cesarean delivery while more precisely defining the fetus at risk for developing metabolic acidosis and long term neurologic injury. The essential role of electronic fetal monitoring (EFM) of the fetal heart rate (FHR) during labor is to prevent adverse outcomes due to oxygen deficiency, but its weaknesses almost all stem from the obstetrician’s highly subjective visual interpretations of the signal patterns. The widespread use of this technology over the past 50 years has not been shown to decrease stillbirths or reduce the numbers of infants with severe hypoxic/ischemic neurological disorders, but it has been associated with an extraordinary increase in cesarean delivery rates. The main objective of the proposed research is to use recent breakthroughs in machine learning to drive the development of predictive analytics to support and improve the interpretation of FHR monitoring data, especially under real world conditions where clinicians must make timely decisions about interventions to prevent adverse outcomes.

"A mobile sensing system to monitor symptoms during chemotherapy Cancer treatments can cause a variety of poorly-managed symptoms and toxicities that can impair quality of life and functioning and lead to early discontinuation of life-prolonging medical treatment. The goals of the proposed study are (1) to develop a novel mobile sensing system to passively monitor symptom burden during chemotherapy and (2) to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of using this system to recommend patient-provider communication. To accomplish Aim 1, we will enroll 200 oncology patients starting a new chemotherapy regimen and will collect smartphone and wearable sensor data continuously as well as daily patient-reported symptoms via smartphones for 90 days. Using machine learning methods, we will retrospectively analyze data from the first 100 participants and develop a generalizable and parsimonious population-level model to identify severe symptom days. For the second 100 participants, we will run these computational models in real-time and prospectively evaluate the accuracy of our classifications relative to patient-reported symptoms. For Aim 2, we will enroll 50 patients in a prospective single-arm trial of a system that uses inferences based on sensing and machine learning to recommend contact with providers and will evaluate patient accrual, attrition, and compliance as well as information from both patients and their providers about acceptability and perceived usefulness of the system. The scientific premise of this proposal is that mobile sensing of subtle fluctuations in behavior coupled with real-time computational modeling could enable earlier detection and ultimately better management of severe symptoms during cancer treatment. The proposed project builds on our prior research and completes the necessary development and feasibility work to support a large multisite trial comparing the mobile sensing system to standard of care to determine effects on symptom burden, quality of life, health care utilization, and survival. Public health relevance: Symptoms during cancer treatment are common, compromise patient quality of life and ability to tolerate treatment, and often go undetected at clinic visits. This project aims to combine smartphone and wearable sensor data with machine learning to remotely monitor symptoms during chemotherapy and to develop a system that automatically recommends patient-provider contact when severe symptoms are detected.",A mobile sensing system to monitor symptoms during chemotherapy,9817043,R37CA242545,"['Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chemotherapy-Oncologic Procedure', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinic Visits', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Computer Simulation', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Enrollment', 'Goals', 'Health Status', 'Heart Rate', 'Impairment', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Light', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Noise', 'Notification', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Provider', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Running', 'Secure', 'Severities', 'Sleep', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Support System', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'cancer care', 'cancer therapy', 'care delivery', 'care outcomes', 'chemotherapy', 'common treatment', 'health care service utilization', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'mobile computing', 'novel', 'oncology', 'patient-clinician communication', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'sensor', 'standard of care', 'symptom management', 'trial comparing', 'wearable device']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R37,2019,361184,-0.003933731240594848
"Development and Validation of Quantitative Anterior Segment OCT-based Methods to Evaluate Patients with Primary Angle Closure Disease PROJECT SUMMARY Primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG), the most severe form of primary angle closure disease (PACD), is a leading cause of permanent blindness worldwide. Gonioscopy, a qualitative and subjective angle assessment method, is the current clinical standard for diagnosing PACD despite its limited ability to quantify disease severity, especially in patients with early angle closure. Anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT) is a quantitative and objective imaging-based method for assessing the angle. However, there are limited methods for clinicians to apply AS-OCT to the care of angle closure patients. The primary objectives of this K23 career development proposal are: 1) to demonstrate the benefit of a quantitative anterior segment OCT-based approach to evaluating patients with PACD and develop classification models for PACD based on AS-OCT measurements; and 2) to provide an academic glaucoma specialist with the training and mentored research experience necessary to conduct independent clinical research. Achieving these objectives will provide critical skills and experiences necessary to establish an independent research program focused on applying AS-OCT imaging to improve the clinical care of patients with PACD. The proposed K23 application will provide additional training in four vital areas: 1) epidemiology and mechanisms of chronic disease; 2) classification of disease and prediction of disease risk; 3) biostatistical methods for clinical research; 4) machine learning and automated data analysis. The proposed research will use population-based data collected as part of the NIH-funded Chinese American Eye Study (CHES) to compare AS-OCT and gonioscopic assessments of angle width and determine the strength of association between these assessments and known PACD risk factors. The relationship between the degree of angle closure, measured by AS-OCT, and intraocular pressure (IOP), a sequela of angle closure and strong risk factor for glaucoma, will be characterized with CHES data and validated with data obtained by using a novel pupil control system on PACD patients recruited from the USC Roski Eye Institute (USCREI). Classification models for PACD stage and severity based on AS-OCT data from CHES will be developed using machine learning algorithms and validated with prospective data from USCREI patients with PACD. The results of the proposed research will provide the foundation for a future longitudinal study examining the benefit of using anterior segment OCT-based assessments and classification models to evaluate PACD patients and deliver targeted treatment to patients with higher risk for PACG. The ultimate goal of my research is to develop quantitative imaging-based diagnostic and treatment protocols that guide the standardized care of PACD patients and decrease the incidence of PACG and its associated ocular morbidity. PROJECT NARRATIVE The management of angle closure patients at risk for primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG), the most severe form of primary angle closure disease (PACD) and a leading cause of permanent vision loss worldwide, poses a significant challenge for eye care providers. Gonioscopy, a qualitative and subjective angle assessment method, is the current clinical standard for evaluating angle closure patients despite its limited ability to quantify PACD severity and predict progression to PACG.

"Development of an automated healthcare system for effective management of patients with chronic diseases PROJECT SUMMARY  Care delivery at primary and urgent clinics is critically hindered by doctor shortage, time constraints and the inappropriate use of infrastructures. Rising aging population and unhealthy lifestyle are expected to drive the increase of chronic disease and the national health expenditures associated (20% of the U.S. gross domestic product by 2025). Telemedicine has been proposed as a possible solution to reduce the cost of access to care minimizing the dependence of patients on health professionals. However, current solutions that connect patients with doctors don’t allow accurate diagnosis due to the lack or inappropriate use of medical devices. AdviNow proposes to implement computer vision to offer a clinically reliable approach to perform self- evaluation of vital parameters. AdviNow will develop the first Augmented Reality (AR) algorithms that will guide any non-trained people to a correct usage of Class 2 medical devices at the point of need. The new approach will represent the core component of a novel clinical decision support system (CDSS) which will be integrated into telemedicine platforms, kiosks or any medical office to automate medical visits, improving chronic diseases management.  In this Phase I application, we will develop a minimally viable application based on heart stethoscope exams, in order to assess the feasibility of the proposed approach for multiple medical devices to effectively monitor chronic diseases. Specific activities will include: (1) Development of AR-driven engine for the correct application of heart stethoscope; (2) development of a basic front-end application for Real-time instructions; (3) establishment of a classifier for heart sound abnormalities. We expect to achieve real-time (<300ms) estimation of phonocardiogram key points and accurate validation of the stethoscope position based on camera-capture and audio-recorded data. We expect that our system will recognize normal and abnormal heart sounds with >85% accuracy. Finally, a small feasibility test will be performed with healthy volunteers to verify their ability to position the stethoscope in less than 10 seconds with an error of less than one inch.  The successful completion of this SBIR Phase I project will lay the foundation of a Phase II SBIR proposal for an external validation of the system to be performed in collaboration with urgent care clinics and patients affected by chronic heart conditions. The mission of AdviNow Medical is to develop a disruptive solution for the delivery of healthcare that is safe, effective, timely, efficient, and available in centralized and decentralized locations. By reducing the time for routine analysis, the actual doctor-patient encounter will be more meaningful, improving the clinical outcome as well as patient satisfaction. This invention promises to disrupt healthcare, as providers will improve cost management and profitability by visiting more patients. PROJECT NARRATIVE New strategies for accurate and efficient delivery of healthcare to chronic disease patients are required. This project will develop the first Augmented Reality (AR) algorithms which will guide patients to use Class 2 medical devices for self-assessment of vital parameters to monitor the health status of chronic conditions. The project is expected to introduce a novel clinical decision support system (CDSS) to Primary and Urgent care clinics and remote settings to allow improved medical outcomes and cost management of chronic diseases.",Development of an automated healthcare system for effective management of patients with chronic diseases,9778356,R43NR018631,"['Abdomen', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Augmented Reality', 'Automation', 'Automobile Driving', 'Blood', 'Caring', 'Chest', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Client satisfaction', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decentralization', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion', 'Disease Management', 'Drops', 'Ear', 'Environment', 'Event', 'FDA approved', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Health', 'Health Expenditures', 'Health Professional', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health Status', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart', 'Heart Abnormalities', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart Sounds', 'Human', 'Image', 'Infrastructure', 'Instruction', 'Joints', 'Location', 'Lung', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Medical Device', 'Medical Records', 'Medicine', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Nose', 'Outcome', 'Oxygen', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharyngeal structure', 'Phase', 'Physical Examination', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Research Personnel', 'Self Assessment', 'Self-Examination', 'Site', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Stethoscopes', 'System', 'Technology', 'Telemedicine', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Weight', 'accurate diagnosis', 'aging population', 'base', 'care delivery', 'clinical decision support', 'computational intelligence', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'design', 'health care delivery', 'health care quality', 'healthy volunteer', 'human subject', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'invention', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'predictive modeling', 'pressure', 'prevent', 'respiratory', 'software development', 'sound', 'support tools', 'tool', 'unhealthy lifestyle', 'urgent care']",NINR,"ADVINOW, INC.",R43,2019,149999,-0.0008126507496967933
"Therapeutic potential of vagal neurostimulation to reduce food intake Obesity affects almost 40% percent of US adults and is associated with high levels of comorbidities, including cancer, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Although effective treatments with minimal side effects are lacking, vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) can reduce body weight and suppress feeding behavior. There is little insight, however, into its mechanism and it is unclear whether VNS effects on feeding and body weight result from non-specific side effects, such as nausea. The current application directly addresses these issues by assessing gastrointestinal (GI) myoelectric changes as a potential mechanism for effects of VNS on feeding behavior, while comparing these responses to emetic activation. We plan to accomplish this by using a ferret model, which is a gold-standard for studying emesis, vagus nerve, and GI physiology. We will test the hypothesis that electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve can reduce food intake without triggering indicators of nausea, such as disrupted GI myoelectric responses, retching, and vomiting. We will complete three Aims. Aim 1: Define the individualized GI myoelectric patterns during feeding behavior using machine learning classification. Animals will be implanted with planar electrodes attached to the GI serosal surface from proximal gastric fundus to distal duodenum. We will use machine learning to classify GI myoelectric patterns of meal consumption compared to emetic-related states, including those elicited by intragastric emetine and high amplitude and frequency VNS known to trigger emesis. Aim 2: Test the efficacy of abdominal VNS on reducing meal size without triggering disruptions of GI myoelectric responses, retching, and emesis. Animals will be assessed for effects of abdominal VNS using a variety of stimulus parameters on feeding behavior and multi-site GI myoelectric recordings. Aim 3: Determine the efficacy of cervical VNS in controlling meal size without producing off-target effects (disruptions of GI myoelectric responses, retching, emesis, changes in heart rate, or blood pressure). We will test the impact of cervical VNS parameters on feeding behavior, GI myoelectric responses, retching, emesis, hear rate variability, and blood pressure. Our approach is innovative because we will use machine learning classification to detect individualized GI myoelectric response patterns in an awake free-moving animal for comparing therapeutic and off-target effects of VNS on feeding, GI activity, emesis, and cardiovascular function. This planned research is significant because VNS therapy can potentially provide a frontline treatment option for patients with high levels of obesity refractory to behavioral or pharmacological therapy, which unlike other surgical interventions for weight loss, such as gastric bypass, is potentially tunable and reversible by changing stimulation parameters, switching the device off, or complete removal. Obesity affects almost 40% percent of US adults, is associated with type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer, and has a health-care cost that could total nearly one trillion US dollars by 2030. The current project is designed to test vagus nerve stimulation to reduce food intake, while limiting adverse effects, such as nausea, vomiting, and disrupted gastrointestinal function. Our proposed research is relevant to the NIH’s plan to support the design and testing of new interventions for achieving and maintaining a healthy weight (Strategic Plan for NIH Obesity Research).",Therapeutic potential of vagal neurostimulation to reduce food intake,9796542,R01DK121703,"['Abdomen', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Behavioral', 'Blood Pressure', 'Body Weight', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular Physiology', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cervical', 'Chemicals', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Comorbidity', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Distal', 'Duodenum', 'Eating', 'Effectiveness', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electrodes', 'Emetics', 'Emetine', 'Event', 'Excision', 'FDA approved', 'Feeding behaviors', 'Ferrets', 'Fiber', 'Frequencies', 'Gastric Bypass', 'Gastrointestinal Motility', 'Gastrointestinal Physiology', 'Gastrointestinal tract structure', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hearing', 'Heart Rate', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Laboratory Rat', 'Laboratory mice', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Nausea', 'Nausea and Vomiting', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Rattus', 'Refractory', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rodent Model', 'Satiation', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Stimulus', 'Stomach', 'Strategic Planning', 'Surface', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Upper digestive tract structure', 'Vagus nerve structure', 'Vomiting', 'awake', 'behavioral pharmacology', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'efficacy testing', 'experimental study', 'feeding', 'gastric fundus', 'gastrointestinal', 'gastrointestinal function', 'healthy weight', 'heart rate variability', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'obesity treatment', 'personalized medicine', 'pre-clinical', 'predicting response', 'recruit', 'reduced food intake', 'response', 'side effect', 'therapeutic target', 'vagus nerve stimulation', 'weight loss intervention']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2019,488645,-0.006976700116915794
"Integrate Dynamic System Model and Machine Learning for Calibration-Free Noninvasive ICP Project Summary  No clinical device exists for noninvasive intracranial pressure (nICP) assessment. Past attempts have focused on identifying ICP-related signals that are noninvasively measureable, but have done little to address the calibration problem. Without calibration, only ICP trending can be inferred at the best. However, noninvasive calibration is not trivial. A universal calibration will fail because individual patients require different calibration to obtain accurate results. On the other hand, the use of plain regression for individualized calibration is infeasible because ICP cannot be obtained noninvasively for a de novo patient to begin with.  Invasive ICP monitoring remains a standard of care and this can be leveraged to continuously grow a database of ICP, noninvasive signals, and different calibration equations, e.g., each built from a pair of invasive ICP and noninvasive signal in the database. Then nICP becomes feasible by selecting from a rich set of calibration equations the optimal choice for a de novo patient. In this project, we will pursue three aims that will lead to the development of an accurate noninvasive ICP system based on Transcranial Doppler. These aims are: 1) To implement and validate core algorithms needed for achieving accurate nICP; 2) To test if estimated nICP is sensitive to variations in ultrasound probe placement; 3) To test the generalizability of the proposed nICP approach.  Large epidemiologic surveys reveal that ICP is monitored in only about 58% of US patients when ICP monitoring is indicated. It is a smaller percentage (37%) in European patients and even fewer in developing countries. The proposed nICP approach does not have the high risks associated with invasive ICP, requires no onsite neurosurgical expertise, and can be economically deployed and readily practiced. Therefore, its potential impact is enormous. Project Narrative  No clinically accepted device exists for noninvasive intracranial pressure (ICP) assessment.

"Deep Learning and Fluid Dynamics Based Phenotyping of Expiratory Central Airway Collapse Project Summary/ Abstract Expiratory central airway collapse (ECAC), defined by >50% collapse of large airways during expiration, resulting from either cartilaginous weakening or redundancy of the posterior membranous wall of the trachea, is an increasingly recognized disorder associated with cigarette smoking and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Airflow obstruction in smokers primarily arises from increased resistance to airflow in the small distal conducting airways <2 mm in diameter. It is plausible that in a subset of smokers with and without COPD, central airway collapse results in additional resistance to airflow, resulting in substantial respiratory morbidity. Ninety-two million adults in the Unites States are active or past smokers, and ECAC is present in approximately 5% of current and former smokers. The presence of ECAC is associated with greater dyspnea, worse respiratory-quality of life and greater frequency of exacerbations after adjustment for underlying lung disease. Whether these patients will benefit from interventional therapies such as stenting or tracheopexy depends on whether the airflow resistance caused by ECAC contributes to symptoms, and this in turn depends on the relative contribution of central and small airways to overall airflow resistance. If the overall airflow resistance is primarily due to distal small airways obstruction in a given patient with ECAC, treating central airway collapse is unlikely to benefit such a patient. Our central hypothesis is that ECAC results in additional airflow obstruction beyond that incurred in the small airways, and that in a subset of patients the central airways are the major site of airflow obstruction and hence are amenable to therapy. The complex interplay of proximal and distal airway resistances and transpulmonary pressures does not lend itself to direct measurements in human subjects across a range of physiological pressure and flow changes. We propose a combination of CT-derived imaging and patient-personalized benchtop model and deep learning to answer these questions with the following specific aims. Aim 1 of this application will be to derive personalized patient- specific information on airway geometry and resistance using airway segmentation from computed tomography (CT) scans. We will calculate airway resistances in central and small airways using standard formulae. The goal of Aim 2 is to create bench-top simulations to understand the complex interplay between the resistance of small and large airways. In Aim 3, we will use deep learning to derive probability scores for clinically substantial ECAC from segmented airway images on computed tomography. The results of our study will enable patient-specific personalized therapies for ECAC. The mechanistic insights gained from this study will help identify patients with clinically significant ECAC and hence most likely to benefit from therapeutic interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE Expiratory central airway collapse (ECAC), greater than 50% collapse of the large airways during expiration, is present in 5% of chronic smokers, and is associated with substantial respiratory morbidity disproportionate to underlying lung disease. Resistance to airflow in smokers is thought to primarily occur in the small conducting airways. By using benchtop models and deep learning to determine the effect of central airway collapse on overall airway resistance and its contribution to airflow obstruction relative to small airway resistance, the proposed project will identify patients with ECAC who will benefit from intervention, and cause a paradigm shift in the therapy of these patients.",Deep Learning and Fluid Dynamics Based Phenotyping of Expiratory Central Airway Collapse,9721392,R21EB027891,"['3-Dimensional', '3D Print', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Air', 'Airway Resistance', 'Area', 'Body mass index', 'Breathing', 'Caliber', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Dyspnea', 'Exhalation', 'Forced expiratory volume function', 'Frequencies', 'Generations', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Length', 'Liquid substance', 'Lung diseases', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Probability', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Pulmonary Function Test/Forced Expiratory Volume 1', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Resistance', 'Scanning', 'Site', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Spirometry', 'Stents', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Trachea', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Tube', 'United States', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'airway obstruction', 'base', 'cartilaginous', 'cigarette smoking', 'clinical application', 'clinical predictors', 'clinically significant', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'expiration', 'human subject', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'patient subsets', 'personalized medicine', 'pressure', 'respiratory', 'response', 'sex', 'simulation', 'three-dimensional modeling']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,R21,2019,226659,-0.004051564390979539
"Precision immunoprofiling to reveal diagnostic biomarkers of latent TB infection PROJECT SUMMARY  Tuberculosis (TB) is among the leading causes of mortality worldwide with an estimated 2 billion individuals currently infected. Latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) is the most common form of TB infection affecting 13 million Americans. While many with LTBI remain asymptomatic, an estimated 10% of immunocompetent patients with LTBI will reactivate to active TB, and will become infectious. LTBI is treatable with a prolonged antibiotic treatment; however, potential side effects motivate the development of new diagnostic approaches that can identify with high specificity patients at the highest risk of reactivation, for who therapy would be most beneficial.  The tuberculin skin test (TST) and interferon-γ release assays (IGRAs) are commonly used for TB and LTBI screening. Both tests provide good measures of TB exposure; however, neither is effective at diagnosing LTBI (positive predictive values <5%). Moreover, neither provide any prognostic stratification based upon reactivation risk. Both the TST and IGRAs probe immunological memory to TB-related antigen challenges and we hypothesize that a more nuanced and personalized approach to monitoring immune responses to both TB- specific and non-specific antigens might reveal new approaches to LTBI diagnosis and patient stratification.  Enabling a new, individualized approach to LTBI diagnostics, we propose to combine high throughput, multiplexed inflammatory biomarker detection strategies and powerful bioinformatics tools that allow for the identification of previously obscured multi-marker diagnostic signatures of LTBI status and reactivation risk. Silicon photonic microring resonators are an enabling technology for biomarker analysis due to their intrinsic scalability and multiplexing capabilities. Applied to the detection of cytokine panels, this technology supports the rapid immune profiling of individual samples under both TB-specific and non-specific antigen stimulation conditions. Machine learning algorithms will be utilized to analyze the resulting dense data streams to facilitate selection of key diagnostic signatures forming the basis for predictive model development and deployment. This powerful analytical combination is supplemented by deep expertise in clinical diagnosis and treatment of TB and LTBI, and an enabling collaboration and connection to subjects from an international location with high TB burden and exposure in a healthcare worker population subjected to regularly-scheduled and repeated LTBI screening.  The resulting diagnostic workflow and machine learning feature selection approaches will reveal multiplexed biomarker signatures that have strong positive predictive correlation with LTBI status (+ or -). This approach will also further stratify LTBI+ subjects on the basis of reactivation potential, thus providing a fundamentally new approach to identifying subjects that are most likely to benefit from therapeutic intervention. The end result of this project will be a new precision medicine-based diagnostic strategy that is vastly superior to the current state-of-the-art and offers the potential to transform current clinical practice. PROJECT NARRATIVE Tuberculosis (TB) affects an estimated one third of the world’s population and an asymptomatic latent state of tuberculosis infection (LTBI) is extremely common. Unfortunately, there are not any good clinical tests that can definitely diagnose LTBI, making it difficult to identify patients that should be treated to prevent reactivation to active TB, which is infectious. We will integrate cutting edge measurement technologies and machine learning bioinformatic approaches to identify and test multiplexed biomarker signatures that will transform clinical TB management by enabling personalized diagnosis of LTBI and the stratification of individuals with the highest potential for reactivation.",Precision immunoprofiling to reveal diagnostic biomarkers of latent TB infection,9819449,R01AI141591,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Antigens', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Cytokine Network Pathway', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health Personnel', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunocompetent', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Immunologic Memory', 'Immunologic Monitoring', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory', 'Informatics', 'Interferons', 'International', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevention strategy', 'Regimen', 'Residual state', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Schedule', 'Silicon', 'Specificity', 'Stratification', 'Stream', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Translations', 'Tuberculin Test', 'Tuberculosis', 'Whole Blood', 'antigen challenge', 'base', 'bioinformatics tool', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical practice', 'cytokine', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'high risk', 'immune function', 'immunoregulation', 'improved', 'individual variation', 'latent infection', 'machine learning algorithm', 'model development', 'monocyte', 'mortality', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel strategies', 'patient stratification', 'personalized approach', 'personalized diagnostics', 'photonics', 'precision medicine', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'response', 'screening', 'side effect', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'tuberculosis treatment']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2019,754111,0.0035230223778137375
"Prediction of Clinical Deterioration Using a Bayesian Belief System Project Summary/Abstract Approximately 5-10% of hospitalized patients suffer significant clinical deterioration after admission, resulting in either transfer to the intensive care unit (ICU) or a ""code"" event (i.e., cardiac or pulmonary arrest). Delayed identification of these events result in increased morbidity and mortality. Unfortunately, existing prediction models result in multiple false alarms for every true positive alarm that they generate. In addition with every passing year, new monitoring systems are introduced that generate more false alarms, resulting in alarm fatigue which has been associated with patient deaths. The objective of this mentored career development proposal is to develop and assess novel computational algorithms that can predict the clinical deterioration of hospitalized patients earlier and more accurately than clinicians or conventional early warning systems, thereby allowing for timely intervention. Building upon our experience in the hematologic malignancy subpopulation of hospitalized patients, this new effort: 1) provides a foundation upon which to combine newer machine learning (ML) methods and clinical informatics to improve the capabilities of the model for an individual patient or specific subgroup; 2) assesses the impact and value of different variables from the electronic medical record (EMR) as part of the predictive model; and 3) broadens the evaluation of this approach to additional real-world patient populations, enabling insight into the translation of the models to clinical usage. The specific aims of this project are thus: Specific Aims Aim 1 To identify and extract model variables (features) from the EMR, evaluating different feature selection  methods to optimize different predictive criterion and their impact on ML algorithms. Aim 2 To develop an ML approach that handles multiple asynchronous data streams of longitudinal  information from the EMR, providing predictions on clinical deterioration in real-time. Aim 3 To explore clinician and rapid response team responses to early prediction of clinical deterioration. With successful completion of this proposal, the prediction model will be integrated into the EMR system. Future direction as part of a R01 proposal will involve external validation at other institutions and assessment of clinical impact on patient care. Relevance to Public Health Clinical deterioration in the hospital is often unexpected and is associated with increased mortality and morbidity, with the CDC reporting 17.2 million hospital admissions through the emergency department in 2010 suggesting that approximately 1 million people annually are at risk of clinical deterioration during their hospitalization. Existing early warning systems have not been able to accurately predict these events without creating an overwhelming amount of additional false positive alarms, resulting in alarm fatigue and potential harm. Our project, utilizing machine learning techniques with the large amount of available clinical data, will serve to develop a predictive model that can predict clinical deterioration earlier with a higher positive predictive value than current algorithms/models which, when implemented, will be able to provide hospitalized patients with an additional safety net.",Prediction of Clinical Deterioration Using a Bayesian Belief System,9768542,K01LM012873,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Admission activity', 'Algorithms', 'Belief System', 'Cardiac', 'Caring', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical assessments', 'Code', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Coupled', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Deterioration', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Fatigue', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Health Personnel', 'Heart Arrest', 'Hematologic Neoplasms', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Inpatients', 'Institution', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nature', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Science', 'Specificity', 'Stream', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'United Kingdom', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Workload', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'burnout', 'career development', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'clinical predictors', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'computer science', 'experience', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mental state', 'mortality', 'novel', 'patient population', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'response', 'safety net', 'skills']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,K01,2019,205524,-0.03648379550607712
"In Vivo Knee Motion and ACL Biomechanics During Dynamic Activities Abstract: Radiographic evidence of OA is present in more than 50% of patients 10 years after ACL reconstruction. However, the etiology of early onset OA after ACL reconstruction is not well understood. While previous work has demonstrated changes in joint motion following reconstruction, it is unclear how these altered motions relate to changes in the local mechanical response of cartilage to in vivo loading. This information may be critical to understanding the onset of OA, as the mechanical response of cartilage affects cartilage homeostasis. In line with this mechanism, our pilot data indicates that regions of high cartilage strain measured in patients with ACL injury and reconstruction are susceptible to decreased cartilage thickness, a characteristic feature of OA. Importantly, these degenerative changes are observed as early as 18 months post-reconstruction. Therefore, in this proposal our overall hypothesis is that site-specific changes in the mechanical response of cartilage to loading following ACL injury and reconstruction are predictive of long-term cartilage degeneration. Specifically, we hypothesize that in regions of cartilage experiencing elevated strain during loading, early degeneration will be reflected by altered composition and decreased cartilage thickness. Thus, we will measure localized cartilage strain, composition, and thickness at four time-points: after ACL injury but prior to reconstruction, as well as at 3 months, 1 year, and 2 years after surgery. At each time point, a combination of high-speed biplanar radiography and MR imaging will be used to measure local cartilage strains during in vivo loading. To assess cartilage degeneration, we will use MRI to measure site-specific changes in composition (using T1rho and T2 relaxation times) and cartilage thickness. Additionally, our analyses will account for relevant biological variables such as age, sex, and BMI, and clinical factors such as graft placement characteristics and meniscus injuries. In addition to mechanical factors, biological factors such as joint inflammation and lubrication may also play a role in cartilage degeneration after ACL reconstruction. Therefore, synovial fluid and serum will be collected to measure inflammatory mediators and metabolic biomarkers. Using this data, we will develop a predictive model of cartilage degeneration after ACL reconstruction that utilizes both mechanical and biological factors, as well as other demographic and clinical characteristics, to predict declines in cartilage health. Furthermore, this comprehensive dataset will be used to develop clinical phenotypes to identify those at high risk for cartilage degradation after ACL reconstruction. Importantly, the development of these phenotypes will enable targeted treatment approaches focusing on surgical procedures, pharmaceutical targets, and non- pharmacological interventions such as physical therapy or weight loss in preventing cartilage degeneration. Therefore, our findings will both elucidate the role of alterations in the local mechanical response of cartilage on degeneration after ACL reconstruction and improve the identification and treatment of patients at high risk for cartilage degeneration. Project Narrative Early onset osteoarthritis (OA) is a major concern after ACL reconstruction. This project will develop a predictive model of cartilage degeneration after ACL reconstruction using a novel combination of mechanical factors, biological factors, demographics, and clinical characteristics.

"Biomarker Signature to Predict the Persistence of Post-Traumatic Headache ABSTRACT There is currently no recognized way of accurately predicting who will recover from post-traumatic headache (PTH) during the acute phase following concussion and who will go on to develop persistent post-traumatic headache (PPTH), a condition that is difficult to treat effectively. Clinical experience with treating secondary headaches suggests that treatment is most effective when initiated early after headache onset, before headache patterns become persistent. So, why don't clinicians treat all patients with PTH acutely following concussion? Although it is likely to be beneficial to treat those patients who are at high risk for PPTH as early as possible, medication side effects and toxicities make it potentially harmful to administer unnecessary medication to those patients who would recover on their own without treatment. The inability to identify which concussed patients with acute PTH are at high risk for PTH persistence leaves clinicians without the knowledge needed to make informed decisions regarding how aggressive to manage patients with acute PTH. Study Goal: to develop a prognostic biomarker signature for PPTH using clinical data as well as structural and functional brain neuroimaging and to assess the predictive accuracy of an ensemble biomarker signature for the early identification of patients at high risk for PTH persistence. The accurate prediction of individuals who are at high risk for PTH persistence would allow clinicians to recommend early and more aggressive management with the intention of preventing PTH persistence. A predictive model for PPTH could also guide clinical trials that will test the utility of innovative therapies to prevent PPTH by allowing for enrichment of the subject cohort with patients at high risk of PPTH. R61 Phase: During the R61 phase this study will develop brain imaging and clinical feature prognostic biomarker signatures for PPTH using machine-learning algorithms. The imaging and clinical biomarker signatures will be developed by laboratories that will first work in-parallel, and then the laboratories will combine the neuroimaging and clinical biomarkers using an ensemble approach. Results of this study will determine important clinical factors (e.g. demographics, medical history, brain injury characteristics, headache characteristics, speech patterns) and brain imaging markers (e.g. regional volumes, cortical thickness, white matter tract integrity, perfusion, functional connectivity) for predicting PTH persistence Additionally, the predictive weight of specific clinical factors and neuroimaging features for characterizing patients who are at higher risk for developing PPTH will be determined. R33 Phase: Once the predictive weights of clinical factors and neuroimaging features are determined, the clinical testing battery and neuroimaging sequences can be pruned down and optimized to include only those that have high predictive power for PPTH. The scanning sequences used in this study are commonly available MRI sequences, making their use feasible across healthcare centers. This optimized and shortened testing sequence can be translated into clinical practice and integrated into PTH clinical trials for early identification of those individuals who are at high risk for PTH persistence.   Project Narrative: Currently, there are no adequate methods to predict whether an individual with post-traumatic headache (PTH) will have resolution of headaches during the acute phase or will have persistence of PTH (PPTH). The goal of this study is to identify a prognostic biomarker signature that will accurately predict the persistence of PTH using clinical data and structural and functional brain neuroimaging data collected in the semi-acute post-concussion phase. The ability to predict who will develop PPTH would help clinicians determine how aggressively to manage patients with PTH during the acute phase and would allow for optimizing enrollment into PTH clinical trials by preferentially enrolling individuals who are likely to have PTH persistence.  ",Biomarker Signature to Predict the Persistence of Post-Traumatic Headache,9829475,R61NS113315,"['Acute', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Concussion', 'Brain Injuries', 'Brain imaging', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Deformity', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Early identification', 'Early treatment', 'Enrollment', 'Goals', 'Headache', 'Healthcare', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Innovative Therapy', 'Intention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Measures', 'Medical History', 'Methods', 'Military Personnel', 'Modeling', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perfusion', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Headaches', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Questionnaires', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recovery', 'Resolution', 'Scanning', 'Speech', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Toxic effect', 'Translating', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'biomarker development', 'clinical biomarkers', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'common symptom', 'demographics', 'disability', 'experience', 'high risk', 'imaging biomarker', 'individual patient', 'machine learning algorithm', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'non-opioid analgesic', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'research clinical testing', 'sex', 'side effect', 'white matter']",NINDS,MAYO CLINIC ARIZONA,R61,2019,3152333,-0.007881574615943927
"Multiparametric Prediction of Vasospasm after Subarachnoid Hemorrhage ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (SAH) affects an estimated 14.5 per 100,000 persons in the United States, and is a substantial burden on health care resources, because it can cause long-term functional and cognitive disability. Much of this is due to delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) from vasospasm (VSP). VSP refers to the reactive narrowing of cerebral blood vessels due the unusual presence of blood surrounding the vessel. In its extreme, severe VSP precludes blood flow to brain tissue, resulting in stroke.  SAH is one of the most common disease entities treated in the Neurointensive Care Unit (NICU). Currently, resource planning is scripted around the Modified Fisher Scale, which predicts the odds ratio of developing DCI based on the volume and pattern of blood on initial brain computed tomography (CT). It does not, however, allow for further individualized risk assessments. The first 14 days are occupied by efforts to detect preclinical or early VSP and arrange timely interventions to prevent permanent injury. The only noninvasive tool supported by guidelines to potentially identify preclinical VSP is the transcrania Doppler (TCD), which has an unreliable range of sensitivity and negative predictive values, and is at the mercy of technician availability. If not identified preclinically, VSP must be detected once it is symptomatic and is then dependent on quality and availability of expertise in the complex and diurnal environment of the ICU.  Promisingly, electronic medical record (EMR) data and continuous physiology monitors offer abundant opportunities to risk stratify for future events as well as reveal events in real-time in the acutely brain injured patient. A methodical approach to feature engineering will be performed over a large set of potentially discriminatory data-driven and knowledge-based features. Meta-features representing variations and trends in time series variables will be extracted using a variety of quantitative and symbolic abstraction techniques. Predictive modeling will be performed using Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine.  This project will result in a prediction tool that improves timeliness and precision in VSP classification. It will fill an important gap in the understanding of the potentia of underutilized EMR and physiological data to predict neurological decline. Generating accurate and timely prediction rules from already collected clinical data would be cost effective and have implications not only for SAH patients, but also for almost any monitored patient in any ICU. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    This project will explore the optimal methods for creating a prediction tool that improves timeliness and precision of diagnosis. It will fill an important gap in the understanding of the underutilized potential of electronic medical record and high frequency device monitor data.

"A Real-Time Computational System for Detecting ARDS Using Ventilator Waveform Data Project Summary:  Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a severe form of acute hypoxemic respiratory failure affecting 10% of patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) in the United States. In-hospital mortality of 35-46% has been reported across the spectrum of mild-severe ARDS, and one third of patients with initially mild ARDS will progress to moderate or severe ARDS. Over the last 20 years, multiple studies have reported improved outcomes for ARDS patients using specific ARDS targeted therapies. However, ARDS remains persistently under-recognized and challenging to diagnose. Only one third of ICU providers correctly identify ARDS on the first day when diagnostic criteria are met, and less than two thirds ever recognize the diagnosis in the ICU. This under recognition of ARDS may prevent some patients from receiving lifesaving therapies necessary for treating the disease. Attempts to automate ARDS diagnosis using rule- based algorithms have seen limited success, and require analysis of subjective data from patient histories, like chest scans, which limit diagnosis automation, timeliness, and study reproducibility.  To improve the current state of the art of ARDS detection technology, we intend to utilize objective and readily available data including both ventilator waveform data, (VWD) and electronic health record (EMR) data to 1) improve the recognition of ARDS, and 2) identify high-risk ARDS patients most likely to benefit from additional ARDS treatments. For this task, we will make use of an existing dataset of VWD from over 500 patients receiving mechanical ventilation, including 156 patients with confirmed ARDS. Our preliminary analyses using a machine learned model and a subset of lung physiology features derived solely from VWD, suggest that ARDS can be diagnosed in the absence of a chest scan or medical history. In Aim 1 of this proposal, we will improve our existing model used for discriminating ARDS by adding objective EMR data, and additional features extracted from VWD, such as patient respiratory compliance and airway resistance. Our next focus will be to predict worsening of ARDS severity in intubated patients based on Berlin criteria. So in Aim 2, we will evaluate the best tools for predicting increases in ARDS severity, and which types of temporal information yield the best predictive results.  We hypothesize that model development using additional objective data derived from VWD analysis and the EMR, along with advanced analytic techniques, will further improve ARDS diagnosis, and enable the prediction of clinical trajectories in patients with ARDS. The proposed work will yield innovative clinical decision support models that can be used to improve the state of the art in automated ARDS diagnosis. Our predictive modeling will also enable greater insight into the times when physicians can perform clinical interventions to arrest ARDS induced physiologic deterioration. Ultimately, these innovations could save lives by quickly detecting ARDS, and alerting physicians to begin or intensify ARDS focused therapies based on patient pathophysiologic state. Project Narrative: Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a highly lethal disease contracted by over 100,000 Americans each year. We seek to address whether we can create automated technologies to detect onset and change in severity of ARDS in critically ill patients using widely available ventilator waveform data. With these automated diagnostic testing technologies, doctors can promptly deliver necessary treatments for ARDS before the disease worsens.",A Real-Time Computational System for Detecting ARDS Using Ventilator Waveform Data,9882887,F31HL144028,"['Acute', 'Acute respiratory failure', 'Address', 'Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Affect', 'Airway Resistance', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Automation', 'Berlin', 'Chest', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Contracts', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Decision Support Model', 'Detection', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hour', 'Hypoxemia', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Medical History', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Provider', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Respiratory Failure', 'Sampling', 'Savings', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'United States', 'Ventilator', 'Work', 'adjudicate', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical predictors', 'clinical translation', 'cohort', 'computer science', 'deep learning', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'markov model', 'model development', 'mortality', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'recurrent neural network', 'respiratory', 'success', 'targeted treatment']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,F31,2019,37193,-0.0011931679256609346
"Developing Classification Criteria for the Uveitides ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The uveitides are a collection of ~30 distinct diseases characterized by intraocular infection. Each disease has its own features, course, treatment, and prognosis. Traditionally, the uveitides have been grouped by the primary anatomic site of inflammation as anterior uveitis, intermediate uveitis, posterior uveitis, and panuveitis. However, there are substantial limitations to this ""lumping"" of diseases. For example, among the posterior uveitides, some (e.g. toxoplasmic retinitis and cytomegalovirus retinitis) are infectious and require treatment with antimicrobial/antiviral agents, some are chronic, presumed immune-mediated diseases that require immunosuppression (e.g. birdshot chorioretinitis, multifocal choroiditis, serpiginous choroiditis), and a few are self-limited, spontaneously-remitting diseases with a good prognosis (e.g. acute posterior multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy and multiple evanescent white dot syndrome). As such precise diagnosis is critical for research, including epidemiology, translational pathogenesis research, outcomes research, and disease specific clinical trials. Classification criteria are a type of ""diagnostic"" criteria used for reserch purposes. Although classification criteria seek to optimize sensitivity and specificity, when a trade-off is required, they emphasize specificity in order to ensure that a homogeneous group of patients is being studied. A precise phenotype is required particularly for genomic risk factor studies of complex disorders and translational pathogenesis research, as inclusion of other diseases with different risk factors and disease mechanisms would confound the results. Currently there are no widely-accepted and validated classification criteria for any of the uveitides. Preliminary data indicate ""fair to moderate"" agreement at best on the independent diagnosis of any one case by uveitis experts (κ's 0.27-0.40), but the ability of committees to reach agreement on the diagnosis of >98% of cases. The goal of the ""Developing Classification Criteria for the Uveitides"" project is for the Standardization of Uveitis Nomenclature (SUN) Working Group to develop classification criteria for the 25 leading uveitides using a formal, rigorous approach. There are 4 phases to the project: 1) informatics, to develop a standardized terminology; 2) case collection, to develop a preliminary database of ~250 cases of each disease; 3) case selection, to select at least 150-200 cases of each disease that are generally accepted to be the disease (using formal consensus techniques) from the preliminary database into a final database; and 4) data analysis, using machine learning approaches, of the final database to develop a parsimonious set of criteria for each disease that minimizes misclassification. The informatics and case collection phases of the Project are complete. The case selection phase is well underway and uses online voting and consensus conference calls to achieve supermajority acceptance on all cases included in the final database. The goals of this application are to complete case selection and data analysis and develop classification criteria for the 25 of the major uveitides. These results are crucial to future clinical research i the field of uveitis. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Collectively, the uveitides are the 5th leading cause of blindness in the U.S., and the cost of treating them is estimated to be similar to that of treating diabetic retinopathy. Because uveitis occurs in all age groups, including children and working-age adults, there is a greater potential for years of vision lost than with age- related diseases. Clinical research in the field of uveitis has been hampered by diagnostic imprecision and a lack of widely-accepted and validated classification criteria, the development of which is the goal of this application; these criteria are needed urgently to advance epidemiology, genomic research, translational pathogenesis research, outcomes research, and disease-specific clinical trials.",Developing Classification Criteria for the Uveitides,9663961,R01EY026593,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior uveitis', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Blindness', 'Child', 'Choroiditis', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'Cytomegalovirus Retinitis', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Future', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Immune', 'Immunosuppression', 'Infection', 'Inflammation', 'Informatics', 'Intermediate Uveitis', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Nomenclature', 'Outcomes Research', 'Panuveitis', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Pigments', 'Posterior Uveitis', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Retinitis', 'Risk Factors', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specificity', 'Standardization', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Terminology', 'United States', 'Uveitis', 'Vision', 'Visual impairment', 'Voting', 'age group', 'age related', 'aging population', 'antimicrobial', 'birdshot chorioretinitis', 'cost', 'outcome forecast', 'public health relevance', 'symposium', 'tool', 'web page', 'working group']",NEI,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2019,127308,0.0029789358284465343
"Measuring post-arrest neurologic injury via nanofluidic assay of brain-derived exosomal RNA Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) strikes over 300,000 people in the US annually. Between 30-50% of OHCA survivors experience some degree of long-term neurologic injury, from mild cognitive defects to severe disability. These injuries are the result of a complex set of ischemia-reperfusion phenomena, known as the post-cardiac arrest syndrome (PCAS), that occurs over the first few days after resuscitation. Prognostication during this critical period, and prediction of neurologic disability, remains an enormous challenge. Serologic markers of brain injury, such as nerve-specific enolase or S100-B, have been tested extensively but have limited predictive value. Quantifying PCAS injury during clinical care has remained a key knowledge gap; with more accurate injury measurement, clinicians would be better able to tailor patient care appropriately by adjusting the intensity of brain-protective therapies including targeted temperature management. Our team has developed a novel approach to injury assessment that applies nanofluidic technology to isolate and analyze brain-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) from serum, small circulating bodies that represent their cells of origin and are released into the blood in greater quantity when cells are damaged or die. Exosomes carry a collection of microRNA (miRNA) species that can be measured and sequenced, allowing for precise analysis of a “transcriptome of brain injury”. When we coupled brain-derived exosomal miRNA analysis with machine learning techniques, we demonstrated that exosomal measurement predicted injury severity after traumatic brain injury. We now seek to apply this technology to post-arrest neurologic assessment; we hypothesize that serial EV sampling will allow for more precise measurement of PCAS-related brain injury. We will perform serial blood sampling of adult (age>17 y) non-traumatic resuscitated OHCA patients (0,6,12,24 h post-arrest) as well as from a negative control set of patients with myocardial infarction and positive control set of patients with significant cerebrovascular accident. We will characterize brain-derived miRNA species from both cohorts, first in a “derivation group” (n=10) and then a “validation group” (n=40) for each cohort. We will collect demographic and clinical outcome data, including neurologic status at discharge and at 90 d via modified Rankin Scale (mRS), dichotomized into “good” (mRS 0-2) or “poor” (mRS 3-6) outcome. A machine learning algorithm will be applied to the derivation group to develop an injury predictive tool, which will then be tested in the validation group. We hypothesize that (1) EV-derived miRNA will identify OHCA patients with brain injury at discharge compared to negative controls and (2) miRNA analysis will discriminate between OHCA patients with good or bad outcomes. Finally, we will apply the predictive tool across 4 timepoints in the OHCA cohort, hypothesizing that more injured patients will show a more significant injury miRNA pattern among earlier timepoints. If successful, this strategy could be coupled to post-arrest trials that require real-time neurologic injury evaluation, and could enable clinicians to tailor care to improve long-term neurologic outcomes. NARRATIVE Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest afflicts >300,000 people in the U.S. each year. Many resuscitated victims die before hospital discharge or suffer enduring neurologic disabilities from ischemia-reperfusion injury, yet our ability to quantitatively measure these injuries during critical care are limited. We propose to test a novel diagnostic approach to address this, using nanofluidic technology to isolate and characterize brain-derived microRNAs from a cohort of initial survivors of cardiac arrest, compared to a control cohort of patients with myocardial infarction (negative control) and a cohort of patients with stroke (positive control).",Measuring post-arrest neurologic injury via nanofluidic assay of brain-derived exosomal RNA,9824489,R21NS109763,"['Acute', 'Acute myocardial infarction', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Blood', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Blood Circulation', 'Blood specimen', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'CD81 gene', 'Caliber', 'Caring', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Derivation procedure', 'Development', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Epitopes', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'GLAST Protein', 'Glutamate Receptor', 'Heart Arrest', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hospitals', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Investigation', 'Ischemia', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'MicroRNAs', 'Microfluidics', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mothers', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Nerve', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule L1', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologic Deficit', 'Neurological outcome', 'Neurological status', 'Neuronal Injury', 'Neurons', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Plasma', 'Predictive Value', 'Quality of life', 'RNA', 'Reperfusion Injury', 'Reperfusion Therapy', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resuscitation', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Severities', 'Stroke', 'Surface', 'Survivors', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transcript', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'cell injury', 'cell type', 'clinical care', 'cohort', 'critical period', 'differential expression', 'disability', 'enolase', 'exosome', 'experience', 'extracellular vesicles', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'injured', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'microvesicles', 'multidisciplinary', 'nanofluidic', 'nanoscale', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel strategies', 'out-of-hospital cardiac arrest', 'predictive tools', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'serological marker', 'species difference', 'tool', 'transcriptome']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R21,2019,442750,-0.003951091523218152
"Evidence to improve heat warning effectiveness in reducing morbidity and mortality Project Summary/Abstract  While exposure to high ambient temperature (i.e., heat) has long been recognized as a threat to public health, the burden of illness and death attributable to heat in the US remains high. In an effort to reduce heat- related mortality and morbidity, the US National Weather Service (NWS) issues heat alerts in advance of forecasted extreme heat events to communicate these risks to the public and government officials. However, it is largely unknown: (1) what are the optimal metrics of heat stress to inform when to issue heat alerts, (2) how effective are heat alerts in protecting the public’s health and (3) what factors make heat alerts comparatively more or less effective in some places or in some people versus others. In the absence of such information, we will fail to maximize the public health benefits of heat alerts.  The goals of this proposal are to identify the optimal health-based and location-specific metrics for issuing heat alerts, to estimate the causal benefits of heat alerts, and to identify characteristics of individuals or communities associated with the greatest reductions in morbidity or mortality following heat alerts. Specifically, using national claims data on deaths and hospital admissions among the large, geographically diverse population of >60 million US Medicare beneficiaries age ≥65 years enrolled between 2001 and 2015, and on emergency department visits among >130 million participants of all ages from one of the nation’s largest health insurers, we propose to: (Aim 1) Use novel machine learning methods to identify the heat metric(s) (e.g., heat index, ambient temperature, spatial synoptic classification, wet bulb globe temperature, absolute humidity) that best predict excess heat-related deaths, emergency hospitalizations, and emergency departments visits in each location, (Aim 2) estimate the causal effects of NWS heat alerts on rates of mortality, hospitalizations, and emergency department visits across the country and within groups stratified by health outcome, sex, and age group, and (Aim 3) assess how the benefits of heat alerts vary across characteristics of communities.  Key innovations of this proposal include a very large sample size, geographic diversity encompassing the entire US, the assessment across multiple health endpoints and age groups, and the use of sophisticated methods in statistical learning and causal inference. Collectively, the findings from this proposal will provide meteorologists, public health and emergency management officials, and local policy-makers with critical information to better protect public health during extreme heat events and guide more targeted future research on strategies to mitigate the adverse health effects of heat. Project Narrative Extreme heat is recognized as an important threat to public health, and the burden of illness and death attributable to heat in the US remains high. In an effort to reduce heat-related mortality and morbidity, the US National Weather Service (NWS) issues heat alerts in advance of forecast extreme heat events to communicate these risks to the public and local government officials, although it remains largely unknown whether such alerts are effective in protecting people.

"Real-Time Virtual Assessment of MitraClip Placement ABSTRACT Mitral regurgitation (MR) is the most common type of valvular heart disease in patients over the age of 75 years in the US. Despite the prevalence of MR in the elderly population, however, almost half of patients identified with moderate- severe MR are turned down for traditional open-heart surgery due to co-morbidities. MitraClip (MC) is a recent percutaneous approach to treat MR by placement of MC in the center of the mitral valve (MV) to reduce MR. Despite the positive short-term outcomes of the MC procedure in reducing MR, the long-term outcome can be further improved if the effects of MC on both the fluid and solid mechanics of the MV and left ventricle (LV) were available at the time the clip is placed. Recently, we developed a physics-based human cardiac function simulator for the optimal design of a novel annuloplasty ring with a sub-MV element for correction of MR, as well as physics-based simulations of MC placement. The problem with these simulations, as far as clinical applications is concerned, is they are extremely time consuming (3 days to complete simulations on 96-processor cluster). One way to make these time consuming simulations clinically applicable is to run them in advance for a wide range of patient characteristics (e.g., degree of MR, size and shape of the MV and LV, etc.) and MC placements. Currently, when clinicians are ready to place the MC on the MV, they have at their fingertips real-time data on degree of MR, and size and shape of the MV and LV measured using 3D transesophageal echocardiography (RT3D-TEE). We propose the development and validation of a searchable virtual patient atlas (SVPA) that will provide the clinician with detailed predictions of patient outcomes in real time that are based on MC placement and the RT3D-TEE patient-specific data. The first 50 models in our SVPA will be created from existing RT3D-TEE datasets provided by National Heart Centre Singapore, NHCS. Then, we will use our novel-shape dictionary learning models to automatically generate 150 additional models for our SVPA. Machine learning models will be trained with the simulation data in order to create machine learning-FE (ML-FE) surrogates that can predict FE outputs directly from the model geometry. This would enable real-time prediction of patient-specific MC device outcomes. Our preliminary studies using 3D heart simulations clearly show that the main advantage with the ML model over the 3D FE model is speed (i.e., ML runs in 1 CPU second versus 3D FE model runs in 1100 CPU hours!). We will validate the outcome predictions of our SVPA using an additional 50 existing RT3D-TEE datasets with known MC patient outcomes provided by NHCS. After the outcome prediction using SVPA for each case, we will use the dataset and the measured outcome to train the original SVPA further and validate a new dataset with the original and the updated SVPA. We will select the more accurate SVPA (the original or the updated) to determine possible correlations between the primary geometrical parameters and other patient overall biometric information with the MR and optimal MC placement. NARRATIVE A leaky inlet valve of the major pumping chamber of the heart is the most common valvular heart disease in elderly patients.

"Public Insurance Design and Health at Older Ages PROJECT ABSTRACT Health insurance has been at the forefront of US public policy debate throughout the last decade. For elderly Americans, who benefit from nearly universal coverage under Medicare, decisions about the scope of their insurance coverage have been a central policy concern since Medicare’s inception in 1965. Medicare’s coverage is extensive, but by statute the program only covers medical services that are “reasonable and necessary,” which can be a controversial definition. Some decisions about what Medicare should cover have engendered intense debate, underscoring the importance of the program’s coverage decisions for millions of patients and doctors. The debate around the scope of Medicare coverage is likely to intensify in the coming decades as options for medical treatment, and testing, expand rapidly, the population ages, and public insurance systems grapple with how to address inequality in access to medical innovations. Yet, despite the importance of decisions about the scope of insurance coverage in and outside of Medicare, we know little about how the scope of coverage (as opposed to patient cost-sharing), affects treatment choices, clinical practice, and health outcomes for the elderly. The research outlined in this proposal aims to start filling this gap. The project investigates how the presence or lack of insurance coverage for specific procedural or pharmacologic therapies affects treatment decisions and health outcomes for the elderly with Alzheimer’s Disease and related Dementias (ADRD). This is a population that may be particularly vulnerable to changes and limits in insurance coverage, as the patients may have limited decision-making capacity and may be disproportionately exposed to treatments that are deemed experimental and lacking effectiveness to clear the “reasonable and necessary” threshold. Aim 1 of the project is to estimate the average effect of coverage decisions across prescription drugs and outpatient procedures on treatment decisions and health outcomes of elderly Medicare enrollees with ADRD. Aim 2 is to predict and characterize the subgroups of ADRD patients that are most likely to be affected by decisions that restrict the scope of insurance coverage using machine learning methods. The proposed empirical method is to use quasi- experimental variation that arises from natural experiments of abrupt changes in insurance coverage within different parts of the Medicare program. The analysis takes advantage of variation in the scope of formularies across Medicare Part D plans, as well as the variation in local coverage decisions for physician services and outpatient procedures under Medicare Part B. These sources of variation coupled with methods for quasi- experimental estimation of treatment effects and machine learning methods for heterogeneity analyses, allow estimating the response of treatment decisions and health of the elderly with ADRD across different drugs, procedures, and subgroups of ADRD patients. PROJECT NARRATIVE For elderly Americans, who benefit from nearly universal coverage under Medicare, decisions about the scope of their insurance coverage have been a central policy concern since Medicare’s inception in 1965 - Medicare’s coverage is extensive, but nevertheless incomplete as by statute the program only covers medical services that are “reasonable and necessary,” which can be hard to define. The debate around the scope of Medicare coverage is likely to intensify in the coming decades as options for medical treatment, and testing, expand rapidly, the population ages, and public insurance systems grapple with how to address inequality in access to medical innovations. In this project I investigate how changes in coverage for prescription drugs, physician office visits, and outpatient procedures affect the treatment received by elderly patients with Alzheimer’s Disease and related dementias (ADRD), who often face coverage limitations due to experimental nature of many ADRD treatments, and yet may be most vulnerable to unintended consequences of any coverage restrictions.",Public Insurance Design and Health at Older Ages,9742306,K01AG059843,"['Address', 'Admission activity', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'American', 'Amyloid', 'Anxiety', 'Barbiturates', 'Benzodiazepines', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Comorbidity', 'Cost Sharing', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Drug Targeting', 'Economics', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Family Physicians', 'Formularies', 'Fracture', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Geriatrics', 'Gerontology', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Health Insurance', 'Heart', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'Inequality', 'Insurance', 'Insurance Coverage', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Learning Skill', 'Length of Stay', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicare', 'Medicare Part B', 'Mental Depression', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Movement', 'Natural experiment', 'Nature', 'Office Visits', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Outpatients', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Physicians', 'Policies', 'Policy Maker', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Procedures', 'Public Policy', 'Race', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Services', 'Skilled Nursing Facilities', 'Source', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic procedure', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universal Coverage', 'Variant', 'aging population', 'alternative treatment', 'bariatric surgery', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'decision-making capacity', 'design', 'experience', 'high dimensionality', 'innovation', 'insurance claims', 'learning strategy', 'mortality', 'older patient', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'public health insurance', 'response', 'socioeconomics', 'theories', 'tool', 'treatment choice', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response']",NIA,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K01,2019,126700,0.0006359227314093062
"Application of Data Sciences in Traumatic Brain Injury ABSTRACT Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality, and patients with moderate-severe traumatic brain TBI often require urgent/emergent surgical and anesthesia care. Patients with TBI who have surgery have poor outcomes, attributed to a high (>50%) prevalence of perioperative second insults such as hypotension and hypocarbia, which reduce cerebral perfusion and cause cerebral ischemia. Anesthesiologists provide analgesia, sedation, immobility, and amnesia, and aim to confer physiological stability, expected patient response, real-time physiological data, and professional judgement but are unfortunately unable to accurately predict in real time which patients with TBI will have hypotension and hypocarbia. Yet, avoidance of these second insults increases discharge survival among patients with TBI. Predicting and preventing hypotension and hypocarbia during TBI care is, therefore, vital, and avoidance of hypotension and hypocarbia are key performance indicators for perioperative TBI care. Small data science studies suggest that machine learning (ML) techniques can model and predict TBI pathophysiology and help reduce unwanted second insults after TBI. The project goal is to use ML methods to prevent second insults (hypotension and hypocarbia) during urgent/emergent perioperative TBI care. In response to PA-16-161, we propose 2 Specific Aims: 1) To construct and identify the TBI physiological ML model that most accurately predicts perioperative hypotension and hypocarbia, and 2) To develop ML derived personalized prescriptions for prevention of perioperative hypotension and hypocarbia. This project is innovative and will be impactful because the approach is grounded in strong data science, and acute care, and implementation science frameworks, because it develops ML derived prescriptions to prevent hypotension and hypocarbia, and because we use ML solutions to improve care quality and outcomes after TBI. NARRATIVE Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death and disability, and patients with moderate- severe traumatic brain TBI often require urgent/emergent surgical and anesthesia care.

"A precision medicine framework to improve long-term outcomes in Sepsis Survivors PROJECT ABSTRACT Advances in acute care have decreased short-term mortality of sepsis, resulting in an increasing number of survivors who experience significant morbidity and mortality. Recurrent infections account for 60% of hospital readmissions after sepsis and are an important cause of long-term mortality. Identifying sepsis survivors at risk for infections and understanding predisposing factors are therefore important first steps to develop personalized interventions to improve long-term outcomes. The overall research goal is to develop innovative targeted interventions to improve long-term outcomes after sepsis. This proposal focuses on identifying subgroups of sepsis survivors (phenotypes) at high risk for infection-related hospital readmissions and deaths. It is hypothesized that the combination of host factors, disease characteristics, and interventions prior to and during sepsis will identify distinct phenotypes that are captured by clinical data. These clinical phenotypes likely have distinct pathophysiologic mechanisms (e.g., immunosuppression), predispose to different outcomes (e.g., recurrent infections), and patients with the same phenotype may respond similarly to targeted interventions such as immunomodulation. In Aim 1, three nationally representative datasets of sepsis survivors will be assembled and analyzed by machine learning techniques to identify valid clinical sepsis phenotypes. In Aim 2, phenotypes at high-risk for infection-related readmissions and deaths at 6 months will be identified, and underlying biomarker profiles for these phenotypes analyzed. In Aim 3, these high-risk phenotypes will be used to conceptualize and simulate an adaptive platform trial designed to test the efficacy of three different immunomodulatory drugs. An adaptive trial design was chosen, because it can test multiple interventions simultaneously and reduces the chances of exposing patients to ineffective or harmful interventions. The research plan is augmented by expert mentoring and rigorous didactic training. Together, this will provide the candidate with essential career development skills in the science of precision medicine, including machine learning methodologies, Bayesian statistics, and innovate clinical trial design. This proposal has potentially groundbreaking implications for the future treatment of sepsis survivors, because it deviates from the current “one-size fits all” approach and attempts to create the framework for personalized interventions. This framework sets the stage for future independent investigator (RO1) applications evaluating personalized treatments in adaptive clinical trials, and will uniquely position the candidate as a future leader in the field of long-term outcomes after critical illness. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project is important for public health because sepsis is a life-threatening infection that affects 30 million people worldwide each year. Long-term outcomes for patients who survive a hospital admission for sepsis are poor, and many patients develop new disabilities or worsening of preexisting health conditions. This proposal supports the NIH’s mission to enhance health and reduce illness and disability by trying to identify interventions for sepsis survivors at highest risk for poor outcomes.",A precision medicine framework to improve long-term outcomes in Sepsis Survivors,9718511,K23GM132688,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Asthma', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Biological Markers', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Complex', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Event', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor', 'HLA Antigens', 'Health', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Immunomodulators', 'Immunosuppression', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Integration Host Factors', 'Interleukin-7', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multicenter Studies', 'National Institute of General Medical Sciences', 'Outcome', 'PDCD1LG1 gene', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Phenotype', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposing Factor', 'Probability', 'Public Health', 'Recombinants', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Science', 'Sepsis', 'Subgroup', 'Survivors', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Veterans', 'Whole Blood', 'Work', 'anti-PD-1', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical phenotype', 'cohort', 'design', 'disability', 'efficacy testing', 'experience', 'high risk', 'hospital readmission', 'immunomodulatory therapies', 'immunoregulation', 'improved', 'infection risk', 'innovation', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'mortality', 'novel', 'personalized approach', 'personalized intervention', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'response', 'simulation', 'skill acquisition', 'trial design']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,K23,2019,189327,-0.01153947882092146
"Automated quantitative CT imaging of epicardial adipose tissue and risk of cardiac events PROJECT SUMMARY Coronary artery disease remains the leading cause of death worldwide, and more than half of the individuals suffering acute myocardial infarction have no prior symptoms. Coronary calcium scoring with non-contrast CT is increasingly used for cardiovascular risk stratification in the asymptomatic population. Epicardial adipose tissue (EAT), a local visceral fat depot surrounding the heart, has been recently reported as a significant imaging biomarker for cardiovascular risk stratification. Despite being routinely imaged noninvasively by non-contrast cardiac CT for coronary calcium scoring, EAT features are currently not measured or reported, primarily due to the absence of robust, automated quantification methods.  We propose to employ novel image processing algorithms to achieve fully automated, robust quantification of EAT features from cardiac CT, and to apply machine learning methods to efficiently combine patient clinical data, coronary calcium and EAT features into a new integrated risk score to predict future cardiac events. We will evaluate this risk score in two existing, prospective registries of asymptomatic patients with available coronary calcium scans, clinical data, and followup for cardiac events (myocardial infarction, cardiac death, late revascularization). These rich resources are: the Early Identification of Subclinical Atherosclerosis Using Non-Invasive Imaging Research [EISNER] registry (2614 patients) and the St. Francis Heart Study (4613 patients). We propose three specific aims: 1) To develop and evaluate the accuracy and reproducibility of new computational algorithms for automated quantification of EAT measures; 2) To evaluate the prognostic value of automatically-quantified EAT features, relative to atherosclerotic plaque burden and measures of obesity, for the prediction of future cardiac events in asymptomatic patients in the EISNER registry and the St. Francis Heart Study; 3) To derive and evaluate a new, integrated risk score—combining standard risk factors, coronary calcium score and EAT measures using machine learning—for the prediction of future cardiac events in the EISNER registry, and further, to additionally evaluate this risk score externally in the St. Francis Heart Study patient cohort.  This work in this proposal will provide a novel, personalized paradigm that will objectively and accurately identify asymptomatic patients undergoing coronary calcium scanning who are at increased risk for future cardiac events, without any additional imaging or risk to the patient. PROJECT NARRATIVE (lay language) CT scanning of the heart for coronary calcium scoring is a simple, widely-used, low-cost test with low radiation dose. Using these scans, the researchers propose to establish automated analysis of fat which surrounds the heart, as well as novel computerized scores that identify the patients who are at highest risk of suffering a heart attack.

"Advanced Heart Failure: Epidemiology and Outcomes PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Advanced heart failure is characterized by progressive debilitating symptoms and repeated hospitalizations that degrade quality of life. There is no one criterion to diagnose advanced heart failure; the definition is complex and challenging to apply broadly to populations. As such, our knowledge of advanced heart failure is truncated and skewed as it is based on information from referral populations and convenience samples. Enhancing our understanding of the epidemiology, experiences, and outcomes of patients with advanced heart failure is critical to developing interventions to improve care and quality of life. To address these gaps in knowledge, this proposal leverages diverse data sources and novel applications of quantitative and qualitative methods to assess the epidemiology and outcomes of individuals with advanced heart failure. In Aim 1, we will apply an advanced heart failure definition to a geographically-defined population of individuals with heart failure under the auspices of the Rochester Epidemiology Project. We will determine the prevalence of advanced heart failure, examine the demographic and clinical features of the population, and evaluate the timing of its development and association with risk of outcomes. In Aim 2, we will use machine learning techniques to develop computer algorithms (computable phenotypes) to identify patients with advanced heart failure using electronic health record data. We will then leverage the infrastructure of the National Patient- Centered Clinical Research Network (PCORnet) to validate the performance of the computable phenotypes across diverse patient populations. This will enable the accurate and efficient identification of advanced HF for future applications. In Aim 3, we will use the computable phenotype developed in Aim 2 to prospectively identify individuals living with advanced HF. We will then assess their treatment and illness burdens using a combination of surveys and semi-structured qualitative interviews. This information will be used to inform the development of a palliative care intervention that is tailored to the needs of patients with advanced HF. We will assess the acceptability of the tailored palliative care intervention to stakeholders (patients, caregivers, clinicians). The results of these analyses will provide synergistic information to clarify the epidemiology, case mix, burdens, and outcomes of individuals with advanced heart failure. They will provide a prototype palliative care intervention tailored to decrease burden and improve quality of life in advanced heart failure. Finally, the computable phenotype developed can be used to identify patients with advanced HF for future quality improvement programs, observational studies, and interventional research. PROJECT NARRATIVE Some patients with heart failure (HF) develop end-stage, refractory disease (advanced HF), characterized by progressive debilitating HF symptoms that interfere with daily life. However, our knowledge of the epidemiology and impact of advanced HF is severely limited because the definition is complex and challenging to apply broadly to diverse populations. In this study, we will evaluate the epidemiology and outcomes of advanced HF in a geographically-defined population, develop computer algorithms that can accurately and efficiently identify advanced HF, and assess the burdens and experiences of patients living with advanced HF to enable the design of new interventions to improve care and quality of life.",Advanced Heart Failure: Epidemiology and Outcomes,9815239,R01HL144529,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Affect', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Case Mixes', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Family', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart Transplantation', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Infusion procedures', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial dysfunction', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Palliative Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Prevalence', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Applications Research', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Quality of life', 'Recurrence', 'Refractory', 'Refractory Disease', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Underserved Population', 'United States', 'Ventricular Function', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cohort', 'design', 'disabling symptom', 'end of life care', 'experience', 'functional disability', 'health care disparity', 'high risk', 'hospice environment', 'improved', 'mortality', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'palliative', 'patient oriented', 'patient population', 'population based', 'programs', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'rural setting']",NHLBI,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2019,598123,0.021927777196643305
"Merging Temporal Changes in Clinical Informatics, Transcriptomics, and Cytokine Profiles to Understand the Host Response to Bacteremia As an ICU physician and an immunologist, I have devoted my research career to understanding sepsis,  a disease that affects nearly 2 million people annually in the USA. Sepsis is a life-threatening  condition that arises when the body's response to infection injures its own tissues. Great strides  have been made towards improving the clinical care of the septic patient, but the mortality rate  remains >20% for several reasons: First, each sepsis-causing pathogen, be it bacterial, viral, or  fungal, carries its own virulence factors that affect the host response, but unfortunately, much  research has focused on studying septic patients as a group, rather than distinguishing patients  based on microbiologic cause. Second, researchers often study patients once they manifest  sepsis-induced organ failure yet many people sustain infections due to common sepsis  pathogens, like Staphylococcus aureus, but never develop sepsis; understanding the ""appropriate""  response to a pathogen is critical to understanding the ""inappropriate"" response of  sepsis. Finally, much sepsis research occurs in silos; clinician researchers focus on the  electronic medical record, while basic scientists analyze biologic data. Too often, these  groups do not collaborate to share information, even though understanding the biologic  significance of clinical data may be of great value. To address these issues, I propose a unique  approach to understand the host response to infection that incorporates both biologic data and  clinical electronic medical record (EMR) data from patients with S. aureus bacteremia.  By limiting analysis of the host response to infections caused by a single pathogen at a single  site, we can control for the variability induced by pathogen-specific factors. In addition,  by studying all patients with S. aureus bacteremia, and not simply those patients with  sepsis, we can understand both the appropriate host response as well as the inappropriate host  response that characterizes the development of sepsis. With our bank of samples collected from S.  aureus bacteremia patients we will analyze both cellular mRNA transcripts and plasma  protein/cytokine levels, collected at different time points from each patient. We will  combine the results of these analyses with clinical data found in the EMR to provide a correlation  between the biology of the host response and its clinical manifestations. Our per-patient  data, then, will have unprecedented granularity which we can then use to apply machine learning  techniques to identify multi-faceted endotypes that predict outcomes (such as mortality). Once we  have built these endotype models, we will validate them using pilot data collected from newly  enrolled patients with either S. aureus or E. coli bacteremia. This approach will allow  us to identify factors common to the dysregulated host response across all infections, as well as  those that may be specific to the type of infection. Understanding both the  appropriate and the inappropriate host response to infection, and understanding which  aspects of the host response are pathogen-specific (and which are not) will allow development  of novel therapies for this devastating disease. The mortality rate due to severe sepsis exceeds 20%, yet in spite of 3 decades of research, we  still have a very limited understanding of the dysregulated host response that drives  this mortality. I will use my experience as a PhD-trained immunologist and ICU physician to  study the host response to the two most common causes of bacteremia in hospitalized patients, S.  aureus and E. coli. Understanding both appropriate and dysregulated host responses to infections as  manifested in both biological and clinical data will allow me to develop precision therapy to treat  this deadly disease.","Merging Temporal Changes in Clinical Informatics, Transcriptomics, and Cytokine Profiles to Understand the Host Response to Bacteremia",9807677,R03HL148295,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Allergic', 'Award', 'Bacteremia', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Comorbidity', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Consent', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Enrollment', 'Escherichia coli', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Goals', 'Hour', 'Immune', 'Immune Targeting', 'Immune response', 'Immunologist', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Leukocytes', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Messenger RNA', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Organ', 'Organ failure', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Plasma', 'Plasma Proteins', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Sepsis', 'Site', 'Staphylococcus aureus', 'Subgroup', 'Supportive care', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Validation', 'Viral', 'Virulence Factors', 'Work', 'base', 'biobank', 'career', 'clinical care', 'clinically significant', 'cytokine', 'experience', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'injured', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome prediction', 'pathogen', 'patient subsets', 'personalized therapeutic', 'prospective', 'response', 'septic', 'septic patients', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NHLBI,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R03,2019,79000,-0.0009888771972948415
"Predicting Diabetic Retinopathy from Risk Factor Data and Digital Retinal Images Abstract Diabetic retinopathy is the leading cause of blindness among US adults between the ages of 20 and 74 years. Laser photocoagulation surgery has been established as an effective way of treating retinopathy if it is detected early. Yearly retinal screening examinations are a potent tool in the battle to reduce the incidence of blindness from diabetic retinopathy because they provide diabetic patients with timely diagnoses and consequently, the potential for timely treatment. Primary care safety net clinics provide monitoring and other services for diabetic patients but they are often not equipped to provide specialty care services such as retinal screenings. Access to specialists who can provide retinal screenings can be increased through the use of telemedicine, which has shown great promise as a means of screening for diabetic retinopathy in the US and internationally. A pilot study by Charles Drew University investigators had a total of 2,876 teleretinal screenings performed for diabetic retinopathy, with 2,732 unique diabetic patients from six South Los Angeles safety net clinics screened. The present study aims to build on this prior work by: (a) developing novel software that utilizes information from clinical records to detect latent diabetic retinopathy in diabetic patients who have not yet received an annual eye examination, and (b) devising methods to speed up the diabetic retinopathy detection process for diabetic patients who have had digital retinal images taken by partially automating the process using image processing and machine learning techniques. Specifically, we propose to: 1. Develop predictive models for diabetic retinopathy using risk factors collected from patient clinical records. 2. Develop predictive models for automated diabetic retinopathy assessment using a combination of patient  risk factor data and data from digital retinal images previously evaluated by experts. 3. Evaluate the predictive accuracy of: a) the models developed for specific aim 2, and, b) the assessments of  optometrist readers against standard of care dilated retinal examinations by board certified  ophthalmologists for 300 diabetic patients utilizing a new Los Angeles County reading center. 4. Create web-based software tools based on the predictive models developed in specific aim 1 that can be  used to initiate outreach to high-risk patients in under-resourced settings, boosting detection rates for those  patients who are most at risk for diabetic retinopathy. 5. Establish targeted outreach methods to promote screening for patients that the predictive models from  specific aim 1 identify as potentially having undetected diabetic retinopathy. Narrative Diabetic retinopathy is the leading cause of blindness among US adults between the ages of 20 and 74 years. Although previous studies within the US and internationally have shown that teleretinal screening can increase access to eye examinations for detecting retinopathy, few studies have focused on the US urban safety net, which has ophthalmic screening rates that are well below the US average and a preponderance of diabetic patients who are from ethnic minority groups. Building on a previous teleretinal screening study that assessed 2,732 South Los Angeles patients for retinopathy, this study deploys machine learning and image processing techniques to detect latent retinopathy in unscreened diabetic patients and partially automate the diabetic retinopathy detection process for teleretinal screening.",Predicting Diabetic Retinopathy from Risk Factor Data and Digital Retinal Images,9751381,R01LM012309,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alaska Native', 'American Indians', 'Asian Americans', 'Blindness', 'Blood Circulation', 'Blood Vessels', 'Caring', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Computer software', 'County', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Diagnosis', 'Eye', 'Glucose', 'Health Care Reform', 'Health Insurance', 'Health care facility', 'Hispanics', 'Incidence', 'International', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Minority Groups', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Online Systems', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Ophthalmic examination and evaluation', 'Ophthalmologist', 'Optometrist', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retina', 'Retinal', 'Retinal Diseases', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Rural', 'Services', 'Software Tools', 'Specialist', 'Speed', 'Techniques', 'Telemedicine', 'Time', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Work', 'aged', 'base', 'care systems', 'diabetic', 'diabetic patient', 'digital', 'digital imaging', 'ethnic minority population', 'high risk', 'image processing', 'inner city', 'laser photocoagulation', 'medical specialties', 'medically underserved', 'mortality', 'novel', 'outreach', 'patient screening', 'predictive modeling', 'primary care setting', 'racial minority', 'randomized trial', 'retinal imaging', 'safety net', 'screening', 'standard of care', 'statistics', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'trend']",NLM,CHARLES R.

"Magnetic Resonance Imaging Based Calf Muscle Perfusion To Assess Patients With Symptomatic Peripheral Artery Disease Abstract: Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is associated with impaired leg function, possible limb loss and an increased risk of cardiovascular events. Intermittent claudication (IC) is a classic PAD symptom occurring in 40% of symptomatic patients, and is associated with 5-, and 15-year mortality rates of 30% and 70%, respectively. PAD is a debilitating illness affecting more than 8.5 million Americans of age 40 and older and 202 million people globally. Despite the high prevalence, PAD patients are less likely to receive appropriate treatment for their atherosclerotic risk factors than patients with coronary artery disease. Advances in endovascular therapy have reduced risks associated with intervention, enabling revascularization as a routine procedure in patients with lower extremity ischemia. However, revascularization success rates vary substantially and numerous PAD patients do not improve at 1-year despite technically good revascularization. Previous findings suggest that alterations in the microcirculation due to a paucity of collateralization may contribute to functional impairment in PAD patients. We hypothesize that the change in microvascular perfusion can identify PAD patients who do not improve at 12-months after revascularization. We will utilize contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (CE-MRI) to assess skeletal muscle perfusion in PAD patients. The CE-MRI measures will be associated with hemodynamics and symptoms. The early identification of individuals with a likely poor prognosis post intervention could help to improve surgical treatment strategies. We will investigate the association of microvascular perfusion (Aim 1) and measures of arterial hemodynamics (Aim 2) with leg function and PAD symptoms. We will utilize machine learning methodologies to identify predictors of poor leg function and symptoms (Aim 3). Given the high incidence of PAD and the associated high risk of cardiovascular events, it is paramount to identify individuals who are less likely to improve following lower extremity revascularization. The data of this clinical imaging study will provide novel information on the etiology of microvascular blood flow in PAD. Relevance: The proposed research study is of considerable public health importance given that patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) have an increased risk of atherothrombotic cardiovascular events and mortality. The development of improved non-invasive imaging techniques to assess PAD may enable optimized treatment for individuals who are at an increased risk of future cardiovascular events.",Magnetic Resonance Imaging Based Calf Muscle Perfusion To Assess Patients With Symptomatic Peripheral Artery Disease,9988737,R01HL137763,"['Affect', 'Age', 'American', 'Ankle', 'Arteries', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical assessments', 'Comorbidity', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Development', 'Disease Outcome', 'Early identification', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'High Prevalence', 'Hospitals', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Intermittent Claudication', 'Intervention', 'Ischemia', 'Leg', 'Legal patent', 'Limb structure', 'Literature', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Methodist Church', 'Methodology', 'Microcirculation', 'Muscle', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Oxygen', 'Partial Pressure', 'Participant', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perfusion', 'Peripheral arterial disease', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Pilot Projects', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Reference Values', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skeletal Muscle', 'Standardization', 'Superficial Femoral Artery', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Toes', 'Treadmill Tests', 'Ultrasonography', 'Validation', 'Veterans', 'Walking', 'atherosclerosis risk', 'base', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'contrast enhanced', 'contrast imaging', 'functional disability', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'off-patent', 'outcome forecast', 'post intervention', 'recruit', 'regional difference', 'research study', 'skeletal', 'success', 'successful intervention', 'symptomatic improvement', 'treadmill', 'treatment optimization', 'treatment strategy', 'two-dimensional']",NHLBI,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIV HERSHEY MED CTR,R01,2019,544562,0.0056565213224430665
"Long non-coding RNA signatures to track treatment responses in multiple sclerosis ABSTRACT  Early detection of multiple sclerosis is key to limiting neurological damage but monitoring patient progression and response to therapy is of arguably similar if not greater importance due to the chronic nature of disease. Moreover, rates of non-adherence to therapy has been reported to be as high as 25% to 40% in the patient population suggesting the need to provide continuous monitoring and selection of optimal therapy. Identification of novel actionable biomarkers would provide clinicians with additional information for the purposes of diagnosis, prognosis, clinical subtyping as well as for the selection and monitoring of therapy. Initiation of sub-optimal therapy can be both detrimental to the patient’s health and financial well-being.  To date, the general approach to selecting a disease modifying treatment (DMT) is to weigh the risks and benefits while considering the aggressiveness of disease, efficacy of the drug and the potential side effects of treatment in a “trial and error” fashion. This approach is quite unsettling when understanding that treatment failure or inadequacy can cause irreversible neurological damage. Furthermore, many of these drugs are associated with serious adverse drug reactions such as cardiac events, opportunistic infections and secondary autoimmunity. Selection of the best therapy for a particular patient as well as the ability to identify if/when efficacy of a particular DMT dwindles is highly desirable and would be of great benefit throughout the healthcare spectrum. The course of MS disease does not manifest identically in all patients nor do all patients respond to treatment the same way. Identification of actionable biomarkers to serve as a surrogate for the efficacy of a particular therapy would allow clinicians to identify nonresponsive patients as early as possible and potentially evaluate dosing or administration to optimize patient outcomes.  Our previous work has explored lncRNAs as candidate biomarkers that can be measured in peripheral whole blood to accurately classify MS. The preliminary data provided in support of our fast track application highlights the potential for lncRNA expression levels analyzed with machine learning to not only classify MS but also indicate treatment responses. The emerging view by specialists that take care of patients with autoimmune diseases is that early diagnosis and early, aggressive and effective therapy is critical to produce the best long-term outcomes. This is very evident for multiple sclerosis with the goal of reducing damage to the central nervous system, producing longer and better disease remission, and mitigating long-term disability. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are newly discovered classes of RNAs with an array of regulatory functions. Our hypothesis to test is that classifiers can be built based upon differential expression of novel lncRNAs in blood. These classifiers will possess high levels of accuracy to monitor treatment responses in multiple sclerosis.",Long non-coding RNA signatures to track treatment responses in multiple sclerosis,9776969,R44AI145505,"['Adopted', 'Advocate', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmunity', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Cardiac', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Dose', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Europe', 'Event', 'Evoked Potentials', 'Exhibits', 'Expressed Sequence Tags', 'Expression Profiling', 'Face', 'Foundations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Human', 'Inflammatory', 'Invertebrates', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Messenger RNA', 'Monitor', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Nature', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurologist', 'Oligoclonal Bands', 'Opportunistic Infections', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Probability', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Site', 'Specialist', 'Spinal Cord', 'Suggestion', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment Failure', 'Treatment Side Effects', 'United States', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Vertebrates', 'Whole Blood', 'Work', 'adverse drug reaction', 'aggressive therapy', 'base', 'brain health', 'candidate marker', 'cell type', 'clinical subtypes', 'cohort', 'cost', 'differential expression', 'disability', 'disorder control', 'drug efficacy', 'effective therapy', 'experimental group', 'health organization', 'human disease', 'multiple sclerosis patient', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'outcome forecast', 'patient population', 'phase 2 study', 'preservation', 'response', 'treatment response']",NIAID,"IQUITY LABS, INC",R44,2019,149824,-0.03089072103408239
"Autoimmunity as a Mechanism for Atherosclerosis in COPD ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project will facilitate the development of the principal investigator into an independent translational researcher investigating systemic vascular injury in Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This will be accomplished in the rich academic environment at the University of Pittsburgh, under the guidance of a highly accomplished team of mentors, and in the conduct of multidisciplinary research project that will develop autoimmunity as a novel mechanism for atherosclerosis in COPD. The increased risk of atherosclerosis in COPD is not explained by smoking, age, hypertension, and other established vascular disease risk factors. Chronic inflammation has recently been implicated as an atherogenic mechanism in COPD. We and others have reported that chronic inflammation in COPD may be propagated by humoral autoimmunity. Specifically, smokers with COPD have greatly increased levels of circulating autoantibodies that demonstrate in vitro pathogenic effects. Our subsequent studies also show that these autoantibodies target at least 50 different autoantigens and consistently target glucose regulated protein 78 (GRP78), particularly in patients with parenchymal lung destruction, i.e. emphysema. GRP78 is present in the endoplasmic reticulum, where it regulates the unfolded protein response, and is also a multifunction cell surface receptor. Studies in cancer patients suggest that ligation of the N-terminus of cell surface GRP78 by anti-GRP78 IgG transduces pro-inflammatory and pro-proliferative signals by activation of the AKT pathway, followed by NFκB activation. Additional in vivo studies have identified anti-GRP78 IgG with affinity for the C-terminus of cell surface GRP78 that produce counteracting anti-inflammatory effects by suppressing AKT activation. Our preliminary work shows that circulating anti-GRP78 IgG in COPD patients binds to macrophages and leads to increased NFκB activation and production of atherogenic inflammatory mediators by them. The macrophage is critical in the development of both atherosclerosis and COPD. Also, cross-sectional studies in our cohort find that levels of circulating anti-GRP78 IgG are strongly associated with carotid atherosclerosis in patients with emphysema, independent of established vascular risk factors. Therefore, we hypothesize that autoimmune responses against GRP78 are a mechanism for atherosclerosis in COPD. During this award, we will: (1) Test the hypothesis that elevated levels of circulating anti-GRP78 IgG predict progression of carotid atherosclerosis in patients with emphysema independent of established risk factors over 4 year follow up; (2) Test the hypothesis that anti-GRP78 IgG binds to the N-terminus of cell surface GRP78 and activates the AKT pathway followed by NFκB activation and production of inflammatory mediators using a variety of cell function assays, and provide proof of concept for two potential therapeutic strategies; (3) Test the hypothesis that there are other antigen-specific immune responses associated with atherosclerosis in COPD by using machine learning to analyze high-throughput data on a large number of circulating autoantibody levels. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a lung disease caused by smoking that kills more and more Americans each year, and is now the third leading cause of death in the US. Although it is largely viewed as a disease of the lungs, the most common cause of death in patients with COPD are blockages in blood vessels. This research project will investigate why patients with COPD are so prone to develop these blood vessel blockages.",Autoimmunity as a Mechanism for Atherosclerosis in COPD,9668180,K23HL126912,"['Affinity', 'Age', 'American', 'Antibodies', 'Antigens', 'Antiinflammatory Effect', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Autoantibodies', 'Autoantigens', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmune Responses', 'Autoimmunity', 'Award', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cancer Patient', 'Carotid Artery Plaques', 'Carotid Atherosclerotic Disease', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Surface Receptors', 'Cell physiology', 'Cell surface', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum', 'Environment', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Immune response', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'In Vitro', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Inflammatory', 'Injury', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Ligation', 'Link', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphorylation', 'Principal Investigator', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Reporting', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Western Blotting', 'Work', 'atherosclerosis risk', 'cancer clinical trial', 'cohort', 'follow-up', 'glucose-regulated proteins', 'in vitro testing', 'in vivo', 'machine learning algorithm', 'macrophage', 'novel', 'peptidomimetics', 'predictive marker', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'targeted treatment', 'translational scientist', 'vascular risk factor']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,K23,2019,166104,-0.014786607415129915
"Automated detection and prediction of atrial fibrillation during sepsis 7. ABSTRACT / PROJECT SUMMARY We propose the “Automated detection and prediction of atrial fibrillation during sepsis” study to develop automated technologies capable of accurate atrial fibrillation (AF) detection and prediction during sepsis. Sepsis is a life-threatening, dysregulated response to infection and the most common illness leading to hospitalization in the United States, affecting ~1 million Americans yearly, and is associated with 50% of all hospital deaths. With the exception early antibiotic and fluid use, few therapies improve outcomes among septic patients; new treatment strategies are greatly needed to improve survival. New-onset AF is a common dysrhythmia among critically ill patients with sepsis, affecting up to 1 in 3 septic patients and conferring increased short- and long-term risks stroke, heart failure, and death. Prevention of AF or its complications may improve sepsis outcomes by reducing AF-related morbidity and mortality. Although several evidence-based treatments have shown efficacy in treating and preventing AF in certain high-risk subgroups (e.g., AF prevention following cardiac surgery), studying application of these therapies among critically ill patients with sepsis has been hampered by two major factors: 1) we lack validated automated mechanisms to detect AF and facilitate real-world AF research in large clinical databases, and 2) we cannot presently predict which patients with sepsis will develop AF. Our project will leverage the unique resources of the recently released Multiparameter Intelligent Monitoring in Intensive Care (MIMIC III) database. MIMIC III links continuous ECG and pulse plethysmographic waveforms to a wealth of time-varying clinical and hemodynamic data. Our project will develop and validate state-of-the art automated AF detection algorithms using waveform data from critically ill patients. Automated AF detection would enable expedited clinical treatment of AF, identification of subclinical AF, and will catalyze the study of AF in emerging electronic health record waveform databases. We will develop innovative automated AF prediction capabilities using state-of-the-art waveform analysis algorithms and machine learning methods in critically ill patients. Automated algorithms that identify patients at high risk for developing AF in the near-term would enable targeting of preventative therapies and potentially usher in a new era of AF prevention for critically ill patients. AF prevention and treatment facilitated through our project will allow targeting of novel, AF-based mechanisms of poor outcomes during and following sepsis. 8. Project Narrative Sepsis is a dysregulated response to infection that causes life-threatening organ dysfunction that affects nearly 1 million Americans each year. Atrial fibrillation is a form of cardiac dysfunction that occurs during sepsis characterized by abnormal heart rhythm, loss of normal atrial contraction, rapid heart rates, heart failure, shock and increased risk for stroke. Our proposal seeks to develop automated methods for the detection and prediction of atrial fibrillation during sepsis, methods that will enhance our future ability to prevent and treat atrial fibrillation to avoid its life-threatening consequences.",Automated detection and prediction of atrial fibrillation during sepsis,9650623,R01HL136660,"['Affect', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Antibiotics', 'Arrhythmia', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Big Data', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Surgery procedures', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Comorbidity', 'Complication', 'Computer Assisted', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electrolytes', 'Electromagnetics', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Heart Abnormalities', 'Heart Atrium', 'Heart Rate', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Infection', 'Intelligence', 'Intensive Care', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Myocardial dysfunction', 'Noise', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Prevention', 'Preventive therapy', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sepsis', 'Shock', 'Stroke', 'Stroke Volume', 'Subgroup', 'Technology', 'Telemetry', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'base', 'clinical database', 'clinical predictors', 'data warehouse', 'electronic data', 'heart rhythm', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'mortality', 'novel', 'portability', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive signature', 'prevent', 'response', 'septic patients', 'stroke risk', 'therapeutic target', 'time use', 'tool', 'treatment strategy']",NHLBI,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,R01,2019,535600,0.004906682862551036
"Efficient Statistical Learning Methods for Personalized Medicine Using Large Scale Biomedical Data Project Summary/Abstract  Current medical treatment guidelines largely rely on data from randomized controlled trials that study  average effects, which may be inadequate for making individualized decisions for real-world patients. Large-scale electronic health records (EHRs) data provide unprecedented opportunities to optimize personalized treatment strategies and generate evidence relevant to real-world patients. However, there are inherent challenges in the use of EHRs, including non-experimental nature of data collection processes, heterogeneous data types with complex dependencies, irregular measurement patterns, multiple dynamic treatment sequences, and the need to balance risk and benefit of treatments. Using two high-quality EHR databases, Columbia University Medical Center's clinical data warehouse and the Indiana Network for Patient Care database, and focusing on type 2 diabetes (T2D), this proposal will develop novel and scalable statistical learning approaches that overcome these challenges to discover optimal personalized treatment strategies for T2D from real-world patients. Specifically, under Aim 1, we will develop a unified framework to learn latent temporal processes for feature extraction and dynamic patient records representation. Our approach will accommodate large-scale variables of mixed types (continuous, binary, counts) measured at irregular intervals. They extract lower-dimensional components to reflect patients' dynamic health status, account for informative healthcare documentation processes, and characterize similarities between patients. Under Aim 2, we will develop fast and efficient multi-category machine learning methods, in order to evaluate treatment propensities and adaptively learn optimal dynamic treatment regimens (DTRs) among the extensive number of treatment options observed in the EHRs. The methods will provide  sequential decisions that determine the best treatment sequence for a T2D patient given his/her EHRs. Under Aim 3, we will develop statistical learning methods to assist multi-faceted treatment decision-making, which balances risks versus benefits when evaluating a DTR. Our approach will ensure maximizing benefit to the greatest extent while controlling all risk outcomes under the safety margins. For all aims, we will develop efficient stochastic resampling algorithms to scale up the optimization for massive data sizes. We will identify optimal DTRs for T2D using the extracted information from patients' comorbidity conditions, medications, and laboratory tests, as well as records-collection processes. Our methodologies will be applied and cross-validated between the two EHR databases. The treatment strategies learned from the representative EHR databases with a diverse patient  population will be beneficial for individual patient care, assisting clinicians to adaptively choose the optimal treatment for a patient. Finally, we will disseminate our methods and results through freely available software and outreach to the informatics and clinical experts at our Centers for Translational Science and elsewhere. Project Narrative  This proposal aims to develop novel and scalable statistical learning methods to analyze electronic health records (EHRs) and use two real-world, high-quality EHR databases for personalized medicine research. The methods will handle the non-experimental nature of data collection processes, along with heterogeneous data types, dynamic treatment sequences, and the trade-off between benefit and risk outcomes.

"Statistical methods for healthcare in complex patients with diabetes ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Diabetes affects 8.3% of the US population, and lead to costly adverse healthcare outcomes. Unfortunately, there may be a quality gap in the care of complex diabetes patients, that is, older patients (age>65 years) and those with comorbid conditions. Current practices, relying primarily on the presence of several factors, are not effective in capturing the risk of poor prognosis, i.e., multiple hospitalization and/or emergency department visits, and death. Hence, little evidence exists so far to help prioritize care for thes patients. The diabetes guidelines recognize that tight control of glycosylated hemoglobin (A1c) may not be appropriate for complex patients, and recommend individualizations in tight A1c control. However, neither the outcomes of tight A1c control, nor the effects of the typical treatment regimens used to achieve tight A1c control can be evaluated in clinical trials, with minimal, if any, enrollment of complex diabetes patients due to either their restrictive inclusion criteria or lack of encouragement of the patient and/or clinical investigator to consider the RCT. In order to deliver more effective, efficient and accountable health cares, it is important to help clinicians to examine the relationship between patient complexity and patients' A1c control level, and to modify guideline appropriately with an evidence base. The proposed research will analyze a cohort of 8,304 Medicare beneficiaries with diabetes who were cared for by one of the country's 10 largest physician group practices, the University of Wisconsin Medical Foundation during 2003-2011 to address the following aims: (1) to conduct risk prediction incorporating longitudinal outcomes, (2) to inform guidelines for complex diabetes patients, and (3) to create a patient-centered surveillance tool for detecting short-term negative outcomes. Our analytic approach involves the use of state- of-the-art statistics and machine learning methods to take advantage of the large electronic health records data. The proposed methods and results will help clinicians to identify and quantify risks of tight A1c control in complex diabetes patients an potentially lead to improved patient experiences, and reduce medical expenditures from excess adverse events. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Sub-optimal glycosylated hemoglobin (A1c) control recommendations and treatment recommendations for diabetes patients can result in adverse events, and increased health care utilization. Unfortunately, current guidelines on the care for complex and/or older patients with diabetes are inadequate. We propose to develop an effective and patient-centered health care delivery system for complex diabetes patients, focusing on accurate prediction of adverse events, development of potential guidelines on targeting tight control of A1c and treatment regimens, and real-time monitoring of health conditions.",Statistical methods for healthcare in complex patients with diabetes,9749124,R01DK108073,"['Address', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biometry', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Comorbidity', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency department visit', 'Enrollment', 'Exclusion Criteria', 'Expenditure', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Glean', 'Glycosylated Hemoglobin', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'Goals', 'Group Practice', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Long-Term Care', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical History', 'Medicare', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient observation', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Privatization', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recommendation', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sampling', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Time', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Trees', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Wisconsin', 'Work', 'adverse event risk', 'base', 'beneficiary', 'care outcomes', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'cost', 'data resource', 'design', 'diabetes management', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'health care delivery', 'health care quality', 'health care service utilization', 'high risk', 'improved', 'inclusion criteria', 'learning algorithm', 'learning strategy', 'longitudinal dataset', 'mortality', 'older patient', 'optimal treatments', 'outcome forecast', 'patient oriented', 'patient population', 'population health', 'public health relevance', 'real time monitoring', 'statistics', 'tool', 'treatment guidelines', 'treatment planning', 'user friendly software']",NIDDK,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2019,283296,0.015090805922151238
"Predictive Personalized Public Health (P3H): A Novel Paradigm to Treat Infectious Disease Challenge, Innovation and Impact: In recent years, we have demonstrated that it is feasible to predict epidemic disease outbreaks from retrospective seasonal and geographical case data and to show that we can take climate factors into account in our predictive models. We are moving closer to real-time prediction at the population level. But we have never used prediction at point-of-care for treating the individual patient.  Presently, personalized medicine uses delayed results of laboratory testing of individuals. For infectious disease, most of such testing has targeted the pathogen in the host-pathogen interaction. The role of laboratory testing is to modify therapy after a variable period of time delay. Personalized medicine today is reactive. Complicating matters further, many infectious epidemic diseases are strongly dependent on environmental factors and climate. Lastly, we want to name the pathogens we are fighting, but we really need to know the resistance characteristics to select therapy for patients effectively. Both speciation and resistance can now be determined from molecular data, which can be integrated into point-of-care treatment predictions.  We here propose a radically different approach to the treatment of infectious diseases. Our hypothesis is that the alternative to time-delayed and expensive laboratory analysis of specimens from individual patients, is to use predictive modeling to forecast point-of-care treatment. Time-delayed personalized testing can be conducted as surveillance, and that data used for real-time prediction to guide point-of-care treatment.  We will introduce predictive personalized public health (P3H) policy at the individual patient level, with the potential to substantially improve patient outcomes compared with our present reactive approaches. Our key rationale is to expand population infectious disease predictive modeling in order to achieve prediction for treatment at point-of-care. Our primary insight is that we can reposition the delayed reactive personalized testing from the urgent medical decision-making process, and into a predictive modeling framework. The gaps and opportunities in technology that we will address are four-fold. First, we will employ individual case geospatial mapping at a fine scale to take into account infection spread and environmental factors. Second, our ability to perform pan-microbial analysis using molecular techniques is now feasible. Third, modeling our novel fusion of data has no simple low-dimensional solution – but machine learning technologies are now capable of handling such big data assimilation, model discovery and prediction. Fourth, our proposal is not an academic exercise. We have a partnership with the economic planners within a developing country to design and implement our new methods. We will prospectively tune and validate our algorithms in real-time. Our deliverable will be an open-source framework ready for clinical trials testing and adaptation to the public health infrastructure in any country. Project Narrative We have made substantial progress in our abilities to track and predict infectious disease epidemics at the population level, but prediction has never been used at the individual level to guide treatment at point-of-care. The individual treatment for all infectious disease syndromes at point-of-care is presently empirical, because laboratory testing is reactive and time delayed. We here propose a novel framework to use rigorous prediction strategies to guide point-of-care treatment for infectious diseases, and to validate this approach under real-world conditions.",Predictive Personalized Public Health (P3H): A Novel Paradigm to Treat Infectious Disease,9776462,R01AI145057,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Antigens', 'Assimilations', 'Bacterial Meningitis', 'Bacteriology', 'Big Data', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Cholera', 'Climate', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complex', 'Country', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Developed Countries', 'Developing Countries', 'Diagnostic', 'Diarrhea', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Economics', 'Engineering', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemic', 'Equilibrium', 'Exanthema', 'Exercise', 'Fever', 'Frequencies', 'Genus staphylococcus', 'Geography', 'HIV', 'Hand', 'Health Policy', 'Hospitals', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infection', 'Infrastructure', 'Investments', 'Laboratories', 'Leadership', 'Leptospirosis', 'Machine Learning', 'Malaria', 'Measles', 'Medical', 'Medical emergency', 'Melioidosis', 'Meningitis', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Names', 'Newborn Infant', 'Paralysed', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Preventive', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Reaction', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sepsis', 'Specimen', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Uganda', 'Work', 'acute infection', 'antimicrobial', 'authority', 'climate data', 'cost', 'cost outcomes', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'fighting', 'flu', 'global health', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'infectious disease model', 'infectious disease treatment', 'innovation', 'insight', 'microbial', 'mortality', 'neonatal infection', 'novel', 'open source', 'pathogen', 'personalized medicine', 'personalized predictions', 'point of care', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'resistance gene', 'spreading factor', 'surveillance data']",NIAID,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIV HERSHEY MED CTR,R01,2019,1606082,-0.005601090842643359
"Serum antibody biomarkers of myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome Chronic fatigue syndrome is a disabling condition for 2.5 million Americans associated with  prolonged fatigue, post-exertional malaise, and sleep disturbances. The cause of CFS remains  unknown, and there are currently no available diagnostic tests to confirm disease. However, a  substantial number of immune features have been measured in CFS. Given this problem, the objective  of this project is to identify a panel of distinct antibody epitopes that can be used to identify  cases of CFS using a blood test. In Aim 1, we will apply serum epitope repertoire analysis to  determine the antibody epitope repertoires within a cohort of 200 CFS patients and 175  controls. Antibody epitopes occurring in CFS sera, and not controls will be identified   using bioinformatics methods. A panel of motifs will be downselected using machine  learning to optimize sensitivity and specificity within the discovery set. The performance of  the panel will be measured in an independent set of specimens to determine sensitivity and  specificity, and identify potential CFS subgroups. We will determine whether individual  markers, or sets of markers, correlate with various clinical features of CFS. Infections with a variety of pathogens have been associated with the development of fatigue lasting  one year or longer, and post-infection fatigue patients typically meet clinical criteria for CFS.  Given the potential for heterogeneous infectious etiology, we hypothesize that CFS patients may  exhibit increased rates of seropositivity for a broad set of infectious agents associated with  fatigue. Using serum epitope repertoire analysis, we will determine whether IgG seropositivity for  20 infections (as a group) differs between CFS patients and controls. The proposed project may  identify antibody biomarkers suitable for development of diagnostic immunoassay for CFS, and may  elucidate whether prior or ongoing infections are associated with CFS. Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), also known as myalgic encephalitis (ME), is a disabling condition  affecting an estimated 2.5 million people in the United States. The cause of CFS  remains unknown, and there are no objective laboratory diagnostic tests to  confirm disease. Consequently, diagnosis of CFS remains exceptionally difficult, requiring the  exclusion of a wide variety fatiguing illnesses. This project aims to apply advanced molecular  discovery tools and computation to identify patterns of circulating antibodies that can be   used to diagnose and monitor CFS patients using a blood test. This project also holds the  potential to associate prior infections with the development of CFS.",Serum antibody biomarkers of myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome,9778480,R43AI145696,"['Academy', 'Adrenergic Agents', 'Affect', 'American', 'Antibodies', 'Antigens', 'Arthralgia', 'Autoantibodies', 'Binding', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Tests', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'Caregivers', 'Cell physiology', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Cholinergic Receptors', 'Chronic Fatigue Syndrome', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Cost of Illness', 'Coxiella', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Encephalitis', 'Epitopes', 'Etiology', 'Exclusion', 'Exertion', 'Exhibits', 'Facilities and Administrative Costs', 'Fatigue', 'Feeling', 'Fever Chills', 'Gene Expression', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Human Herpesvirus 4', 'Immune', 'Immunoassay', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infectious Agent', 'Infectious Mononucleosis', 'Inflammatory', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Research', 'Longitudinal prospective study', 'Machine Learning', 'Malaise', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Muscarinics', 'Myalgia', 'Natural Killer Cells', 'Nuclear Antigens', 'Organism', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Proteins', 'Psyche structure', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Seroprevalences', 'Serum', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Societies', 'Sore Throat', 'Specificity', 'Specimen', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'United States', 'acute infection', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomarker discovery', 'candidate marker', 'cohort', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'flu', 'immune activation', 'interest', 'lymph nodes', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'pathogenic virus', 'seropositive', 'sleep abnormalities', 'tool', 'trend']",NIAID,"SERIMMUNE, INC.",R43,2019,224975,-0.0014527832901594967
"Systems Level Causal Discovery in Heterogeneous TOPMed Data SYSTEMS LEVEL CAUSAL DISCOVERY IN HETEROGENEOUS TOPMED DATA ABSTRACT The advent of new technologies for collecting and analyzing multiple heterogeneous data streams from the same individual makes possible the detailed phenotypic characterization of diseases and paves the way for the development of individualized precision therapies. A major bottleneck in this process is the lack of robust, efficient and truly integrative analytic methods for such multi-modal data. This proposal builds on the ongoing efforts of our group in the area of causal learning in biomedicine. The objective of this application is to extend, modify and tailor our causal probabilistic graphical models to data typically collected by TOPMed projects, such as –omics data (SNPs, metabolomics, RNA-seq, etc), imaging, patients' history, and clinical data. COPDGene® is one of the TOPMed projects and has generated datasets with those modalities for 10,000 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), the third leading cause of death and a major cause of disability and health care costs in the US. The prevailing view is that COPD is a syndrome, consisting of multiple diseases with different characteristics. There is currently no satisfactory method for COPD subtyping or prediction of disease progression. In this project we will apply, test and validate our approaches on COPDGene® and another large independent COPD cohort. The extension and application of our methods to cross-sectional and longitudinal data will also allow us to investigate a number of important questions and aspects related to COPD. Mechanistically, we will investigate how SNPs, genes and their networks are causally linked to disease phenotypes. In pathology, we will identify conditional biomarkers, which will lead to disease sub-classification and identification of causal components in each subtype. In pathophysiology, we will identify features that are directly linked to lung function decline and outcome. We will make all our algorithms and results available to the community through web and public cloud interfaces. The deliverables will be (1) new probabilistic approaches for integration and analysis of multi-modal cross-sectional and longitudinal data, including SNPs, blood biomarkers, CT scans and clinical data; (2) new cloud-based server to make these approaches available to the research community; (3) results on the mechanism, pathology and pathophysiology of COPD facilitation and progression. To guarantee the success of the project we have assembled a team of experts in genomics, machine learning, cloud computing and COPD. This cross- disciplinary team project will have a positive impact beyond the above deliverables, since the generality of our approaches makes them applicable to any disease. We expect that during this U01 we will have the opportunity to collaborate with other teams in the TOPMed consortium to help them investigate the causes of their corresponding disease phenotypes. We do believe that data integration in a single probabilistic framework will be in the heart of precision medicine strategies in the future, when massive high-throughput data collection will become a routine diagnostic and prognostic procedure in all hospitals. PROJECT NARRATIVE Current technologies for high-throughput biomedical data collection allow the interrogation of multiple modalities from a single patient. New promising analytical methods started emerging, which can analyze those multi-modal data in a holistic way. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) constitutes the third leading cause of death and a major cause of disability and health care costs in the US. The prevailing view is that COPD is a syndrome, consisting of multiple diseases with their own characteristics. There is currently no satisfactory method for COPD subtyping. We will apply, test and validate new probabilistic approaches on two cohorts of COPD patients. We will investigate the mechanisms of disease facilitation; we will identify patient cohorts with specific characteristics (disease subtypes); and investigate risk factors and causal variants for the disease progression in each subtype.  ",Systems Level Causal Discovery in Heterogeneous TOPMed Data,9678366,U01HL137159,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Models', 'Blood', 'Cause of Death', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cloud Computing', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease model', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Health Care Costs', 'Heart', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Learning', 'Lifting', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Assessment', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Pulmonology', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Stream', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Tissues', 'Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Visit', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'analytical method', 'base', 'causal variant', 'clinical imaging', 'clinically relevant', 'cloud based', 'cohort', 'computer science', 'cost effective', 'data integration', 'disability', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder subtype', 'graphical user interface', 'high throughput technology', 'innovation', 'longitudinal dataset', 'medical schools', 'metabolomics', 'mortality', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'new technology', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'patient subsets', 'precision genomic medicine', 'precision medicine', 'prognostic', 'repository', 'success', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'user-friendly']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,U01,2019,602448,-0.0055436967047008965
"Long non-coding RNA signatures to distinguish fibromyalgia syndrome from rheumatic diseases No other group of diseases encompasses a greater pathophysiology than do the rheumatic diseases. Spanning multiple organ systems, clinical decisions often rely on coordinated efforts from primary care providers and rheumatologists to rule in or rule out differential diagnoses when treating inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). RA is a symmetric, inflammatory, peripheral polyarthritis leading to deformity of joints via erosion of bone and surrounding cartilage. SLE can affect virtually any organ leading to fatigue, fever, myalgia, weight change and complications associated with renal, central nervous system, and hematologic systems can be life-threatening. RA and SLE are diagnosed through clinical judgment after excluding alternative diagnoses. In the case of both diseases, individual laboratory tests are effective only in a portion of the disease population. Across these analyses, the sensitivity and specificity for these laboratory measurements may have high specificity to rule in SLE but lack sensitivity as these diagnostic markers can be found in other disorders. As a physician colleague pointed out, “it is difficult to diagnose a negative”. Diagnostic approaches for both RA and SLE often rely on multiple, independent laboratory tests combined with clinical observation. Distinguishing between these diseases is important since treatment procedures for these diseases are different. Time is a factor in diagnosis of these diseases and tools are required to facilitate earlier diagnosis as treatment for autoimmune diseases are highly effective and early initiation of therapy leads to the best outcomes. Misdiagnosis of these conditions is not uncommon. Another common disease seen by rheumatologists is fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS). FMS is a common cause of widespread musculoskeletal pain that affects tendons, ligaments, and muscle. FMS is difficult to diagnose and treat and a critical clinical point is that FMS is not explained by another rheumatic or systemic disorder. Thus, FMS is a diagnosis of exclusion once other etiologies have been considered and excluded. RA and SLE are two diseases that must be eliminated from the differential diagnosis. Given the complicated diagnostic process these patients are often forced to endure, recent studies have also suggested that healthcare dollars are saved post-diagnosis and patient outcomes improve. To date, there is no laboratory test that can determine presence or absence of these three conditions from a single blood sample.  The question of whether or not disease classifiers capable of providing clinically useful information could be built based upon disease-specific expression levels of mRNAs in whole blood has been a subject of research for several years. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA) are recently discovered regulatory RNA molecules that do not code for proteins but influence a vast array of biological processes. It is also thought that lncRNAs drive biologic complexity observed in vertebrates that may also be reflected by the greater array of complex idiopathic diseases that humans develop. As such, our data obtained in the phase 1 portion of this work, support the notion that disease-associated lncRNAs exhibit far greater differences in expression than disease-associated mRNAs. In this application, we propose to explore the hypothesis that lncRNAs are better biomarkers of human disease than mRNAs. Here, we will focus on FMS and the rheumatic diseases as disease categories and have identified and validated FMS and rheumatic disease-associated associated differentially expressed lncRNAs. Study of lncRNAs in human autoimmune disease is in its infancy and exploration of lncRNAs as biomarkers of autoimmune disease has not been previously addressed. We propose to determine expression levels of target lncRNAs in blood obtained from larger cohorts of subjects that include 1) subjects with fibromyalgia syndrome, 2) healthy controls, 3) rheumatoid arthritis, 4) systemic lupus erythematosus, and 5) peripheral autoimmune disease controls obtained from various sites in the U.S. and Europe to establish a wide geographic distribution and to identify optimum machine learning classifiers to distinguish fibromyalgia syndrome and rheumatic diseases from healthy and disease control cohorts with greatest overall accuracy. Diagnosis of fibromyalgia syndrome and other rheumatic diseases can be a difficult, long and costly process and misdiagnosis of these diseases is not uncommon. Biomarkers to aid and accelerate diagnosis is an area of active investigation. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are newly discovered classes of RNAs with an array of regulatory functions. Our hypothesis to test, and supported by our phase 1 studies, is that classifiers can be built based upon differential expression of lncRNAs in blood. These classifiers will possess greater accuracy to identify fibromyalgia syndrome and rheumatic disease and provide meaningful clinical information to health- care providers faced with these diagnostic dilemmas.",Long non-coding RNA signatures to distinguish fibromyalgia syndrome from rheumatic diseases,9640388,R44AI129147,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Body Weight Changes', 'Cartilage', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Deformity', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Etiology', 'Europe', 'Exclusion', 'Exhibits', 'Fatigue', 'Fever', 'Fibromyalgia', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Geographic Distribution', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Hematology', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'Invertebrates', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Judgment', 'Kidney', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Ligaments', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Messenger RNA', 'Mixed Connective Tissue Disease', 'Muscle', 'Musculoskeletal Pain', 'Myalgia', 'Neuraxis', 'Organ', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Polyarthritides', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Research Subjects', 'Rheumatism', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Sjogren&apos', 's Syndrome', 'Specificity', 'System', 'Systemic Lupus Erythematosus', 'Tendon structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Vertebrates', 'Whole Blood', 'Work', 'base', 'body system', 'bone erosion', 'care providers', 'cell type', 'cohort', 'cost', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'differential expression', 'disease diagnosis', 'disorder control', 'human disease', 'improved outcome', 'infancy', 'phase 1 study', 'rheumatologist', 'tool', 'virtual']",NIAID,"IQUITY LABS, INC",R44,2019,496653,-0.02082138144182134
"Autonomous diagnosis and management of the critically ill during air transport (ADMIT) Project Summary/Abstract: Cardiorespiratory instability (CRI) is common in trauma patients and other acutely ill patients being transferred from trauma sites or between hospital centers. Although paramedics/nurses (PM/RN) have some success in rescuing unstable patients with CRI using defined protocols and decrease incidence of inter-transport severe circulatory shock, the shock recognition tools available and resuscitation endpoints are limited to blood pressure and heart rate thresholds. However, CRI is often unrecognized until it is well established when patients are more refractory to treatment, or progressed to organ injury. If one could accurately predict who, when and why these critically ill patients develop CRI, then effective preemptive treatments could be given to improve care and triage resulting in better use of healthcare resources. We have shown that an integrated monitoring system alert obtained from continuous noninvasively acquired monitoring parameters coupled to a care algorithm improved step-down unit (SDU) patient outcomes. We also applied machine learning (ML) modeling to our clinically-relevant porcine model of hemorrhagic shock to characterize responses to hypovolemia, hemorrhage, and resuscitation, predict which animals would or would not collapse during hypovolemia, and identify occult bleeding 5 minutes earlier than with traditional monitoring. We now propose to apply our work to vulnerable STAT MedEvac air transported patients. We will validate these approaches in our existing >5,000 patient STAT MedEvac database, containing highly granular continuous non-invasive monitoring waveforms of air transported critically ill patients linked to their primary care and inpatient electronic health records (EHR). This level of patient information and granularity linked to treatment data and patient outcomes is unprecedented. We will extend our analysis to include more complex CRI, richer data, deeper analytics, and larger libraries of critically ill patients while in air transport, linking our proven Functional Hemodynamic Monitoring (FHM) principles for pathophysiologic diagnosis and resuscitation with non-invasive monitoring to operationalize personalized resuscitation. We will concurrently running two specific aims. First, we will develop through the Carnegie Melon University Auton Lab multivariable models through ML data-driven classification techniques to predict CRI. We will do this initially on our existing porcine hemorrhagic shock model data (n=60) and then on our STAT MedEvac dataset linked to EHR (n >5,000 patients), determining the minimal data (measures, sampling frequency, observation duration) required to robustly identify deviation from health, likely CRI cause, and response to treatment (endpoint of resuscitation), as well as the incremental benefit of additional variables, analysis, lead-time and sampling frequency to predict CRI and response to treatment, and examine the trade-offs between model parsimony and specificity. Second, we will evaluate our existing clinical decision support (CDS) tools to interface with FHM principles and ML- defined interactions, and trial this in silico first on our porcine hemorrhagic shock resuscitation, then on our STAT MedEvac data, followed by prospective human simulation on flight crew PM/RN (n=160) during annual training for agreement and benefit, defining effectiveness based on diagnosis accuracy, time to diagnosis, intervention choice accuracy and time to intervention. This iterative process will modify the existing CDS platform into one more specifically suited for air transport scenarios. Finally, we will evaluate the resultant semi-autonomous management protocol initially in retrospect in 100 STAT MedEvac patients and 10 Emergency Department trauma patients and then prospectively by active CDS in a final 100 STAT MedEvac patients. We will prospectively analyze the effectiveness of these calibrated CDS tools for predictive ability of the various ML models and apply the best, most practical and parsimonious predictive models for clinical care during transport based on patient population, pathological processes and support staff. Project narrative We propose to develop and trial of proactive approach to diagnosis and management of vulnerable critically ill patients during STAT MedEvac air transport from trauma sites and inter-hospital transfer. We will use machine learning approaches to plumb our existing rich >5500 patient STAT MedEvac waveform data linked to their electronic health records to define level of severity, predict impending cardiovascular instability and to both drive in-flight resuscitation and alert receiving Emergency Department triage. We will use our existing clinically relevant porcine model of hemorrhagic shock to focus initial human instability algorithms and then refine our existing graph user interface clinical decisions support (CDS) algorithm, first in animal and with paramedic/nurse dyads in human simulation and then during actual STAT MedEvac air transport and Emergency Department care of trauma patients creating a scalable CDS platform to support paramedic/nurse smart monitoring and proactive resuscitation of these high risk patients.",Autonomous diagnosis and management of the critically ill during air transport (ADMIT),9738159,R01HL141916,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute', 'Agreement', 'Air', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Blood Pressure', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Coupled', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency Care', 'Emergency Department Physician', 'Environment', 'Family suidae', 'Frequencies', 'Graph', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Rate', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hemorrhagic Shock', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Hypovolemia', 'Incidence', 'Injury', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Medical', 'Melons', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Normal Range', 'Nurses', 'Organ', 'Organ failure', 'Paramedical Personnel', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Records', 'Refractory', 'Resources', 'Resuscitation', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Sepsis', 'Series', 'Serious Adverse Event', 'Severities', 'Shock', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Standardization', 'Stream', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trauma', 'Trauma patient', 'Traumatic Hemorrhage', 'Triage', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Weaning', 'Work', 'advanced system', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision support', 'clinically relevant', 'cost', 'data modeling', 'demographics', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'insight', 'iterative design', 'mortality', 'non-invasive monitor', 'patient population', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'prospective', 'response', 'signal processing', 'simulation', 'success', 'support tools', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2019,763789,0.012035655307671703
"Intelligent Virtual Reality Curriculum for Personalized Surgical Training PROJECT SUMMARY The problems with current surgical training paradigms include the failure of opportunities for training to keep up with rising demands; surgeons in practice often have limited time and resources to practice, leading to risky usage of more complex technologies. Successful utilization of virtual reality (VR) in surgical training has led to the wide-spread adoption of such systems in General Surgery training programs; however, the focus on high-fidelity, near-real-life environments has made the methodology prohibitively expensive and inaccessible. This resource intensiveness has resulted in generalized VR modules that do not target specific procedures or skills. Considering the increasing number of new and complex devices coming onto the market and the direct link between volume of procedures and surgical expertise, the healthcare field must see a radical shift in the use of surgeon training technology in order to maximize quality training time before trainees enter the workforce. The current state of VR is ill-fit to be a true surgical training supplement as it cannot fulfil this need. Osso VR is developing a solution to this issue: The Smart Curriculum, a purposefully low-fidelity VR-based training curriculum that incorporates an artificial intelligence (AI) to adapt the session and curriculum to a trainee’s performance. A low-fidelity approach has been shown in pilot studies to have equal transfer rates compared to high-fidelity while being much less resource-intensive, thus making it ideal for broadening the accessibility of VR. An AI to customize a procedure to a surgeon’s performance and background will provide targeted practice to hone procedure familiarity and surgical skill. Thus, the combination of VR and AI will show increased transfer rates compared to classic VR paradigms at a fraction of the cost. Practicing surgical techniques on-demand with direct quantitative feedback plays an essential part in developing the needed expertise to a) improve the quality of the outcomes for patients and b) improve efficiency in the surgical technique thereby reducing the operating time. The work proposed in this Phase I project will focus on developing a proof-of-concept AI-incorporated module for the treatment of hip fractures with a cephalomedullary fixation device as a proof-of-concept. The proposed system will allow orthopedic surgeons to enhance their training in a virtual environment and predict the outcome of interventional decisions before actual surgery without any risks to the patients. The work plan for this Phase I SBIR project will be accomplished by first establishing all key subject matter and technical needs for the cephalomedullary fixation procedure to determine key learning milestones for a pilot procedure; second, we will determine the parameters for and wireframe the AI; finally, we will build necessary technical components for the prototype training module to validate the pilot procedure. Osso VR is the current leader in the field, and the addition of an AI component to individualize each surgeon’s training experience will be invaluable to revolutionizing the surgical training paradigm. The proposed project is a purposefully low-fidelity virtual-reality-based surgical training curriculum that incorporates an artificial intelligence to adapt the session and curriculum to a trainee’s performance. This technology will provide new surgeons with targeted practice to hone their procedural familiarity and surgical skill to improve proficiency, thus reducing training costs and operating time, and improving surgical outcomes for patients.",Intelligent Virtual Reality Curriculum for Personalized Surgical Training,9778500,R43EB028203,"['Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Big Data', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Consult', 'Controlled Environment', 'Country', 'Custom', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Effectiveness', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Failure', 'Familiarity', 'Feedback', 'Healthcare', 'Hip Fractures', 'Industry', 'Intelligence', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Manuals', 'Methodology', 'Modality', 'Movement', 'Operating Rooms', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Orthopedics', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Preparation', 'Problem Solving', 'Procedures', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Surgeon', 'System', 'Task Performances', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Training Programs', 'Transferable Skills', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'cost', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'falls', 'improved', 'innovation', 'outcome prediction', 'pedagogy', 'prototype', 'rehearsal', 'sample fixation', 'simulation', 'skills', 'surgery outcome', 'tool', 'training opportunity', 'virtual reality']",NIBIB,"OSSO VR, INC.",R43,2019,215545,-0.012024630217092071
"Repurposing pyronaridine as a treatment for Chagas disease Summary Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) are a diverse group of diseases with distinct characteristics that thrive mainly among the poorest populations of the world. There are 17 NTDs prioritized by the World Health Organization which are endemic in 149 countries and affect more than 1.4 billion people globally, which costs these developing economies billions of dollars annually. The neglected tropical diseases result from four different causative pathogens: protozoa, bacteria, helminth and virus. The majority of the diseases lack effective treatments. For example, 6 to 7 million people in Latin America are infected with the eukaryotic parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease. This disease is gaining recognition as an emerging infection in the United States where an estimated 300,000 people may be infected. Chagas disease has a serious economic impact on the United States and the world. The cost of treatment in the United States alone, where the disease is not indigenous, is estimated to be $900 million annually, which includes hospitalization and medical devices such as pacemakers. The global cost is estimated at $7 billion. Unfortunately, there are no FDA approved treatments for Chagas disease and the two available treatments used outside the U.S. have toxic side effects. New therapeutics for Chagas disease and the other NTDs are desperately needed. Using a machine learning model based on published data for compounds tested against T. cruzi we have identified the EU-approved antimalarial pyronaridine as particularly active in vitro and in vivo with statistically significant efficacy in a 4-day mouse model of infection with a T. cruzi strain expressing firefly luciferase. Pyronaridine demonstrated 85.2% parasite reduction after 4 days treatment, and is known to have a long half-life in humans (13.2 days), promising toxicity profile (less toxic than chloroquine in malaria treatment) and may suggest a drug repurposing opportunity for further study. We propose in this project to determine the minimum effective dose (treatment regimen) for pyronaridine in the acute model of Chagas disease. We will also determine efficacy in the chronic phase of Chagas disease (sterile cure). We will pursue combination therapy DMPK profiling as well as performing combination therapy in vivo efficacy in chronic model of Chagas disease. The results will enable us to assess whether this EU approved drug is worthy of a clinical trial for Chagas disease in the UH3 stage. If successful we will design a clinical study and recruit patients for a phase II trial. This grant represents a unique opportunity to partner the Center for Discovery and Innovation in Parasitic Diseases (www.cdipd.org) at UCSD and the University of Sao Paulo in Brazil with Collaborations Pharmaceuticals Inc. Narrative Approximately 6 to 7 million people in Latin America are infected with the eukaryotic parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of the deadly Chagas disease. This disease is gaining recognition as an emerging infection in the United States where an estimated 300,000 people may be infected and there is no FDA approved treatment. The antimalarial pyronaridine was recently identified by our groups using computational Bayesian repurposing methods and was confirmed as active when tested in vitro and in vivo in the acute mouse model of Chagas disease. We now propose in the UH2 stage to determine: the minimum effective dose in the acute model of Chagas disease and efficacy in the chronic phase while also assessing potential for combination therapy.

"SCH: INT: MyPHA: Automatically generating personalized accounts of in-patient hospitalization A growing body of research has found that patients who actively manage their health have better outcomes, and patient engagement has become a central tenet in recent healthcare approaches. However, it has also been shown that many patients lack knowledge of their disease and medications, particularly as concerns chronic health conditions, whose exacerbation causes about two thirds of hospitalizations every year in the USA. Discharge instructions after hospitalization are a critical tool to engage patients in their self-care, but are often unsuccessful. Our hypothesis is that, to en9age patients at discharge, a personalized hospitalization summary should be provided, that integrates physician and nurse documentation, and is informed by the patient's level of engagement in self-care and their socio-cultural perspective. Our transformative pilot work on physician and nurse documentation has identified an additional obstacle to the effective flow of information from professionals to patients: vocabulary differences between physicians and nurses. By leveraging the Unified Medical Language System Metathesaurus, we found no common synonyms between physician and nurse documentations for 75% of patients. Further, 86% of terms patients use are simple compared to only 15% for physicians. The lack of common language among patients, physicians and nurses motivates including all perspectives to make instructions meaningful for patients. Our hypothesis is that a better informed patient population who understands the connections between their illness, hospital experience, and discharge instructions will be more empowered and more engaged in their chronic disease management. Our innovation is to automatically create an easy-to-understand, personalized hospitalization summary that integrates events described in the EHR; and that is responsive to the patient's needs and preferences, and their activation framework (PAF) level. We pursue four specific aims: 1. To investigate socio-cultural patterns of patient perceptions of illness via a socio linguistic analysis of patient interviews; 2. To integrate multi-faceted information about a patient, as provided by physicians and nurses; 3a. To develop MyPHA, a novel application program, which will automatically generate the personalized summaries and deliver them to the patient on a tablet. MyPHA will be informed by aims 1 and 2, and will be grounded in Natural Language Generation technology; 3b. To evaluate MyPHA with multiple cycles of formative evaluation with all stakeholders, and a summative evaluation with patients. Whereas our pilot work has focused on heart failure, the techniques we will develop can easily be adapted to the management of other chronic health conditions, in particular for patients with cancer and cancer survivors. In addition, cancer and heart failure can co-occur, especially in older patients, and several cancer treatments can lead to the development of heart failure. The software program MyPHA will be released open source to the research community to enable rapid customization to other chronic conditions. Patients who are engaged in their self-care have better outcomes, however discharge instructions often fail to activate them. This study plans to integrate nurse and physician documentation from the Electronic Health Record with the patient's needs and preferences to provide patients with a concise summary of their hospitalization, tailored to their current activation level. This contextual information should help improve the lives of patients living with chronic health conditions, such as cancer patients and survivors.",SCH: INT: MyPHA: Automatically generating personalized accounts of in-patient hospitalization,9748454,R01CA225446,"['Adherence', 'Appointment', 'Area', 'Asian Americans', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Survivor', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Charge', 'Chicago', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Confusion', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Documentation', 'Education', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emotional', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Faculty', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Health', 'Health Professional', 'Healthcare', 'Heart failure', 'Hispanic Americans', 'Home environment', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Illinois', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Instruction', 'Intention', 'Interdisciplinary Communication', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Investments', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Linguistics', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical Libraries', 'Medical Records', 'Minority', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Native Americans', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nurses', 'Outcome', 'Ownership', 'Pacific Island Americans', 'Participant', 'Patient Discharge', 'Patient Education', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Process', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Self Care', 'Self Efficacy', 'Self Management', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Students', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Time', 'Unified Medical Language System', 'Universities', 'Vocabulary', 'Woman', 'Work', 'biomedical informatics', 'cancer therapy', 'cardiogenesis', 'college', 'compliance behavior', 'computer science', 'design', 'doctoral student', 'efficacy trial', 'empowered', 'empowerment', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'formative assessment', 'health literacy', 'hospital readmission', 'illness perceptions', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'member', 'metathesaurus', 'natural language', 'novel', 'older patient', 'open source', 'patient engagement', 'patient population', 'patient portal', 'preference', 'programs', 'prototype', 'skills', 'social', 'sociolinguistics', 'tool', 'undergraduate student', 'urban school']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,R01,2019,363081,0.013843363694047933
"Enabling of a Wireless and Remotely Monitored Deep Brain Stimulation System through the Internet of Medical Things for Parkinson's Disease Patients Project Summary The objective of this project is to demonstrate feasibility of a novel platform technology using ultrasonic waves for wireless bidirectional real-time communication and powering of a Bilateral Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) system with remote patient monitoring. DBS has become an established neurosurgical procedure with over 160,000 patients treated worldwide. DBS has been shown to improve Parkinson's disease (PD) patient quality of life, increase long term tremor control, reduce dyskinesia, and reduce hyperdopaminergic behavioral symptoms. Some of the most common complications associated with this procedure are injury caused by wire/lead tunneling, erosions or infections of the tunneled wires, lead failure/migration, and tethering of extension cables. None of the current solutions are leadless and allow for remote monitoring due to limitations of wireless interconnected devices in the body. Bionet Sonar's software-defined UsWB proprietary technology is capable of transmitting energy and data via ultrasonic waves through tissue, bone, and fluids at penetration depths significantly higher than RF waves and with greater reliability. The Bionet platform includes: i) Reprogrammable wireless stimulation leads; ii) Rechargeable system controller to coordinate with, recharge, and reprogram other implantable elements of the network through the ultrasonic interface; iii) External recharging and communication patch to act as a power/data gateway to interconnect the intra-body network with the Internet. An intelligent DBS device that can be monitored by clinicians and provide feedback control to optimize therapy using remote continuous real-time data will lead to improved PD treatment options and informed treatment decisions individualized for each patient (point-of-care). In this Phase I study, feasibility for wireless power and remote monitoring with the Bionet system will be demonstrated by completing the following Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1. Demonstrate in vitro feasibility of controlled deep brain stimulation, recharging and remote monitoring components using ultrasonic waves at typical implantable tissue depths. Specific Aim 2. Demonstrate in vivo, data and energy transmission for the systems during controlled stimulation of the brain. In vivo experiments in minipig models (n=3) will be used to demonstrate the ability of the system to transmit data and energy from the subcutaneous controller to the pacing nodes using closed loop control based on real time electrical sensing. This proposal leverages the strengths of Bionet Sonar Inc. and the University of Louisville. Our long-term goal is to successfully translate the Bionet Sonar system into clinical practice. The core platform technology may also be applied to other networked systems for the treatment of diverse etiologies opening a new frontier in multimodal patient treatment and use of Artificial Intelligence for patient care. Project Narrative Through this proposal a wireless remotely monitored deep brain stimulation system will be developed using new core technology for the Internet of Medical Things. Ultrasonic wideband technology will be used to enable wireless communication and recharging of the different implantable elements, allowing for miniaturization and energy efficiency.

"APPLYING ERROR-CORRECTED SEQUENCING TO DETECT MINIMAL RESIDUAL IN THE AAML 1031 STUDY Abstract  Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) accounts for half of all pediatric leukemia deaths and is the leading cause of leukemia-related death in adulthood. One reason for worse outcomes is the inability to properly assess for minimal residual disease (MRD) following therapy. Unlike ALL, AML presents with multiple subclonal populations without a singular clonal surface marker, and surface markers can change during therapy. The current gold standard for AML MRD is multi-parameter flow cytometry (MPFC), which is predictive of outcomes to frequencies of 0.001, yet 30% of MPFC-MRD-negative patients still relapse. Alternatively, every AML case harbors leukemia-specific mutations that could be markers of disease, except that next-generation sequencing has high error rate of ~1%. In this proposal, we will implement a novel, validated error-corrected sequencing (ECS) strategy, developed by the Druley lab in collaboration with Illumina, to improve MRD assessment of AML subclonal heterogeneity in 990 pediatric de novo AML cases from the Children's Oncology Group AAML1031 study. We hypothesize that using a highly sensitive sequencing method will improve identification of residual AML, provide important insights on subclonal heterogeneity in pediatric AML, improve understanding of the role of germline variability and gene function on relapses or refractory disease and facilitate personalized medicine. To interrogate this hypothesis, we propose the following aims: 1. Define subclonal heterogeneity at diagnosis and end of Induction 1 (EOI1) in 990 pediatric de novo  AML patients (n=1890). By using the largest prospective study of pediatric AML that has ever been  performed, we will perform ECS on 94 genes that are the most frequently mutated genes in pediatric and  adult AML at diagnosis and EOI1 to identify patterns of mutation associated with relapsed disease, FAB  subtypes or other cytogenetic features. 2. Correlate ECS-MRD with existing EOI1 MPFC-MRD for all participants in the COG AAML1031 study.  A major question is whether the “different from normal” cell population identified as residual disease by  MPFC is actually the same population(s) identified by ECS. We will define residual disease by ECS and  compare results to MPFC status (positive/negative), actual MPFC percentages (<0.001) and the clinical  outcomes (relapse risk, disease-free survival and overall survival) of study participants. 3. Integrate germline variation and all subclonal mutations into mechanistic groups that are frequently  mutated in pediatric AML and correlate with outcomes using unbiased machine learning  algorithms. Preliminary data tells us that every patient will have multiple subclones at diagnosis and EOI1  as well as germline variants in AML-associated genes, which may be important for outcome. In this aim, we  will take these mutations into account as well as MPFC, clinical features and cytogenetics for probabilistic  risk assessment using unsupervised machine learning algorithms for improved outcome prognostication. Narrative We have developed Error-Corrected Sequencing (ECS) that enables the highly accurate detection of leukemia- specific mutations in heterogeneous DNA samples to a limit of 0.0001. We will perform ECS with a panel of 94 frequently mutated genes in adult and pediatric AML in matched diagnostic and end of Induction 1 bone marrow samples from 990 pediatric de novo AML patients enrolled on the Children's Oncology Group AAML1031 protocol, which is the largest pediatric AML trial ever performed in North America. With these data, we can truly understand subclonal heterogeneity in pediatric AML, significantly improve minimal residual disease testing in pediatric AML, and integrate these data into an unbiased multivariate probability platform taking into account individual sequencing, flow cytometry, cytogenetic and clinical features to provide truly personalized cancer care.",APPLYING ERROR-CORRECTED SEQUENCING TO DETECT MINIMAL RESIDUAL IN THE AAML 1031 STUDY,9606448,R01CA211711,"['Acute Myelocytic Leukemia', 'Adult', 'Adult Acute Myeloblastic Leukemia', 'Alleles', 'BAY 54-9085', 'Biological Markers', 'Bone Marrow', 'Bortezomib', 'Categories', 'Cessation of life', 'Childhood', 'Childhood Acute Myeloid Leukemia', 'Childhood Leukemia', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Cytogenetics', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Enrollment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Exons', 'FLT3 gene', 'Family', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hematology', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Normal Cell', 'North America', 'Oncogenes', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pediatric Oncology Group', 'Phase', 'Point Mutation', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protein Tyrosine Kinase', 'Protein phosphatase', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reagent', 'Recurrent disease', 'Refractory Disease', 'Relapse', 'Residual Neoplasm', 'Residual Tumors', 'Residual state', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk stratification', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Spliceosomes', 'Surface', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'analytical method', 'base', 'chemotherapy', 'cohesion', 'design', 'digital', 'falls', 'functional group', 'gene function', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'insight', 'leukemia', 'leukemia treatment', 'machine learning algorithm', 'next generation', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'nucleocytoplasmic transport', 'outcome prediction', 'pediatric patients', 'personalized cancer care', 'personalized medicine', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'randomized trial', 'relapse risk', 'response', 'specific biomarkers', 'subclonal heterogeneity', 'transcription factor', 'unsupervised learning']",NCI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,342009,-0.007027276349782184
"Stasys Medical: A Rapid, Microfluidic Blood Test Sensitive to Platelet Dysfunction PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Antiplatelet medications are a critical component to manage cardiovascular diseases (CVD), which is a prevalent affliction in the US. While monitoring platelet therapy is of increasing importance for the identification of hypo- or hyper-responsive patients, there is not a clear picture of the medical value of tailored antiplatelet therapy using currently available platelet function tests. Currently, US FDA cleared assays of platelet function designed to be near the patient measure platelet adhesion and aggregation. Stasys Medical is developing a system based on patented platelet contraction sensors to assay platelet contraction force as a biomarker for platelet dysfunction. In the current project, the Company will build on preliminary data to demonstrate that the force biomarker is sensitive to platelet inhibition via multiple pathways. Specifically, aims are designed to 1) correlate the platelet contractile force measurements to inhibition of platelet activation and adhesion pathways, and 2) benchmark the force assay to standard platelet function tests. The go/no-go criteria for moving to Phase II is demonstration that platelet force is sensitive to specific inhibitors and that the assay can identify platelet dysfunction currently missed by existing standard platelet function assays. In the Phase II project we will leverage data generated in the current project to develop an algorithm that can automatically identify antiplatelet medications. Clinically, this will be a valuable tool to identify medication non-responders. Taken together, the project will be used to support the Company’s 510(k) submission to FDA with claims directed at evaluating platelet function to assess clinical conditions, such as bleeding risk, associated with the use of antiplatelet drugs, and during and following cardiovascular surgery. PROJECT NARRATIVE Antiplatelet medications are a critical component to manage cardiovascular diseases (CVD), which is a prevalent affliction in the US. In the Phase I project, Stasys Medical will build on preliminary data to show that the platelet contraction force biomarker reflects platelet function as proof-of-concept that the force assay can identify platelet dysfunction missed by existing assays. The Phase II project will leverage Phase I results to develop an algorithm using machine learning techniques that can automatically identify antiplatelet medications to identify medication non-responders.","Stasys Medical: A Rapid, Microfluidic Blood Test Sensitive to Platelet Dysfunction",9681062,R43HL142318,"['Acute Coronary Event', 'Adhesions', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Agonist', 'Algorithms', 'Antiplatelet Drugs', 'Aspirin', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Platelets', 'Blood Tests', 'Blood Volume', 'Blood specimen', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular Surgical Procedures', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Catheterization', 'Clinical', 'Clot retraction', 'Consensus', 'Coronary', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Functional disorder', 'Generations', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hemostatic function', 'Impairment', 'Integrins', 'Lead', 'Legal patent', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Microfluidics', 'Monitor', 'Myosin ATPase', 'Optical Instrument', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Platelet Activation', 'Platelet Function Tests', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Randomized', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Risk', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Stents', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thromboxanes', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Whole Blood', 'base', 'design', 'flexibility', 'high risk population', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'injured', 'nanonewton', 'off-patent', 'operation', 'patient response', 'platelet function', 'point of care', 'response', 'sensor', 'success', 'tool', 'wound']",NHLBI,STASYS MEDICAL CORPORATION,R43,2019,224945,0.0061167089219329165
"Optimized identification of therapeutic bacterial strains in ulcerative colitis PROJECT SUMMARY Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic gut inflammatory condition thought to be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Therapeutic options are only partially effective in inducing and maintaining remission, and there is currently no cure for UC. Recent studies have found the microbiome of UC patients is distinct compared to that of healthy controls, suggesting that the microbiome could be a promising therapeutic target. Fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) has been extremely successful in the treatment of colitis caused by Clostridium difficile infection, further demonstrating the potential for bacterial therapeutics. The recently completed FOCUS (Faecal Microbiota Transplantation in Ulcerative Colitis) trial has demonstrated that FMT from healthy donors can induce clinical remission in 27% of UC patients compared to only 8% in the placebo group. However, we still lack an understanding of the exact mechanisms by which FMT is able to modulate disease pathogenesis. The overarching hypothesis of this proposal is that UC remission after FMT is induced by specific bacteria, and that accurate identification of bacterial strains will be paramount to develop microbial therapeutics for UC. To test this hypothesis, we will first develop a novel ensemble method to identify bacterial species and strains from deep metagenomic data. This method combines software tools using a voting algorithm that is weighted based on the accuracy of each tool. The accuracy of this method will be tested using microbial culture collections from UC patients, in silico simulations, and a bacterial mock community as gold standards. We will then apply this approach to metagenomic data generated from the FOCUS study in order to identify bacterial strains that are associated with UC remission. This will be performed by using established supervised learning techniques, as well as through a novel method based on co- occurrence network analysis that identifies clusters of bacteria that act synergistically. Based on these results, we will finally validate our findings using a gnotobiotic model of colitis. The prophylactic and/or therapeutic potential of candidate bacteria will be tested by inoculating them to gnotobiotic mice colonized with the microbiota of UC patients and with colitis induced through the transfer of naïve T cells. Our proposal will be the first to address the question of how specific bacteria modulate disease progression in a randomized trial of FMT in UC through the development of more sensitive and accurate methods for strain characterization that can be experimentally validated. The rational design of our strategy to identify therapeutic bacteria will produce highly translational results that can be used to guide future clinical trials in UC. PROJECT NARRATIVE Finding novel approaches to prevent and treat ulcerative colitis (UC) is a pressing clinical need. This project investigates the role of bacterial strains as predictors of UC remission after fecal microbiota transplant, and presents novel methods to identify therapeutic strains that will be tested in a mouse model of colitis.",Optimized identification of therapeutic bacterial strains in ulcerative colitis,9781704,R01DK114038,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Bacteria', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clostridium difficile', 'Colitis', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease remission', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Etiology', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Gnotobiotic', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Immune response', 'Incidence', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patients', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Probiotics', 'Property', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Shotguns', 'Societies', 'Software Tools', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Ulcerative Colitis', 'United States', 'Voting', 'bacterial community', 'base', 'clinical remission', 'cohort', 'design', 'fecal transplantation', 'improved', 'learning network', 'learning strategy', 'metagenome', 'metagenomic sequencing', 'method development', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'outcome prediction', 'placebo group', 'potential biomarker', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'probiotic therapy', 'prophylactic', 'randomized trial', 'response', 'simulation', 'supervised learning', 'therapeutic target', 'tool']",NIDDK,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2019,254179,0.008832193652388428
"The CRIT-ICU Biomarker Panel for Stratification of Mortality Risk in ARDS Patients PROJECT SUMMARY: Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is a devastatingly intense lung inflammatory disorder that annually afflicts more than 1 million individuals world-wide (200,000 cases/year in the U.S.) with an unacceptable mortality rate of 30-40%. Substantial clinical and biological heterogeneity within ARDS phenotypes has greatly impeded therapeutic developments to reduce mortality. All therapies currently employed in ARDS management are ge- neric. The critical care community suffers from a lack of tools that allow identification of ARDS sub-phenotypes and individuals most likely to benefit from novel therapies. Recently, the hyperinflammatory and low inflammatory ARDS sub-phenotypes were identified that markedly differ in natural histories, clinical and biological character- istics, biomarker profiles, responses to positive end-expiratory pressure, ventilator- and organ failure-free days and mortality. ARDS severity (PaO2/FiO2 ratio), the severity of renal or hepatic failure, or the extent of leukocy- tosis failed to distinguish the two phenotypes. As the mortality of the hyperinflammatory phenotype is 3-5 times greater than low inflammatory phenotype, this Phase I STTR will leverage substantial complementary expertise to: i) establish a novel panel of ARDS biomarkers (CRIT-ICU Panel) that stratifies subjects at risk for ARDS into high and low mortality sub-phenotypes; and ii) develop a quantitative platform to allow assessment of these validated biomarkers upon patient entry into the ER or ICU. Our preliminary biomarker data are strong and include 11 ARDS-relevant plasma biomarkers in >250 well-phenotyped ARDS subjects and 70 controls. The targeted biomarkers include cytokine-chemokines (IL-6, IL-8, IL-1b, IL-RA), dual-functioning cytozymes i.e. cy- tokine/intracellular enzymes (macrophage migration inhibitory factor, NAMPT), vascular injury markers (VEGF- A, S1PR3, angiopoietin 2), and the advanced glycosylation end product pathway (HMGB1, soluble RAGE). Spe- cific Aim #1 will apply standard biostatistical approaches as well as novel neural network artificial intelligence analysis of this existing dataset to identify an optimal plasma-derived CRIT-ICU Panel which predicts ICU mor- tality in patients with sepsis or trauma who are at risk for development of respiratory failure and ARDS. Specific Aim #2 will develop an optimized and highly standardized Predictive Platform for the CRIT-ICU biomarkers iden- tified to be used in the clinical care setting. Finally, Specific Aim #3 will conduct retrospective validation studies of the optimized CRIT-ICU Panel in biobanked samples from 2 large cohorts: an emergency room-ARDS cohort (PETAL Clinical Network, n=800) and a Spanish sepsis-ARDS cohort (n=200). We speculate that unique exper- tise within Aqualung Therapeutics Corp., PAI Life Sciences Inc., InBios International Inc. and the University of Arizona Health Sciences will drive future prospective validation of the CRIT-ICU Panel in patients at risk for ARDS (Phase II STTR) and lead to development of a true Point of Care test to accelerate clinical trial stratification strategies, and development of innovative ARDS therapeutics to reduce mortality in this devastating syndrome. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is a devastatingly intense lung inflammatory disorder that afflicts more than 1 million individuals world-wide each year (200,000 cases/year in the U.S.) with an unacceptable mortality rate of 30-40%. The tremendous heterogeneity of ARDS has greatly impeded therapeutic developments to address ARDS mortality and all therapies currently employed in ARDS management are generic. The critical care community suffers from a lack of empirical data and tools that would allow identification of ARDS sub- phenotypes and potentially identify individuals most likely to benefit from novel therapies. This Phase I STTR leverages substantial complementary expertise to establish a novel panel of ARDS biomarkers (CRIT-ICU Panel) that will be used to stratify subjects at risk for ARDS into high and low mortality sub-phenotypes and develop a predictive platform to allow assessment of these validated biomarkers upon entry into the ER or ICU.

"Advancing the Measurement and Classification of Lower Urinary Tract Dysfunction PROJECT SUMMARY Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) are common with high economic and social costs and significant effects on patients’ quality of life. Prevalence of LUTS increases with age, with estimates ranging from 45-70% of U.S. adults. It is clear from the range of conditions that produce LUTS, and the failure of current therapies to ameliorate symptoms in large segments of the population that have similar LUTS, that patients with LUTS are a heterogeneous population even when their symptoms are identical or overlap. Current LUTS treatment paradigms target narrow symptom groups, largely ignoring the heterogeneity in concomitant symptoms. Furthermore, clinicians have a limited understanding on how to integrate information from self-reported symptoms, clinical exam and laboratory results, and urodynamic testing into treatment decision-making. Improving treatment outcomes for patients with LUTS will require both (1) increased understanding of LUTS symptom clusters and underlying mechanisms behind the various subtypes and (2) comprehensive, validated, and responsive measurement tools for defining treatment efficacy. The Symptoms of Lower Urinary Tract Dysfunction Research Network (LURN) was assembled in 2012, the primary objective of which was to categorize patients with LUTS into distinct subgroups, a process known as ‘phenotyping’. The Network’s approach to defining patient subtypes was based on a probability-based consensus clustering approach using a myriad of patient data, resulting in the identification of novel LUTS-based clusters that are statistically and clinically distinct. Concurrently, the Network worked to improve the measurement of patient reports of LUTS through systematic development of a new, high-quality item bank based on qualitative input from patients, community participants, internists, urologists, urogynecologists, and clinical researchers. LURN II will build on the knowledge gained through multiple specific aims: to test and refine the original LURN clustering model in a new cohort including a wider range of symptom severity and a wider range of physical measures (n=1380 participants followed for 3 years); to identify a signature of proteins contained within plasma that can be used to identify specific subgroups of men and women with LUTS; to determine phenotypic characteristics of women with LUTS by measuring the functional components of the lower urinary tract; to validate a self-reported outcome tool for evaluating treatments, based on the comprehensive tool developed for phenotyping in LURN I; and to explore promising alternative analytic approaches to existing and future LURN data and characterize the broader experiences of patients with LUTS. This proposal brings together a multidisciplinary team of urologists, urogynecologists, bladder physiologists, data scientists, epidemiologists, and outcomes researchers. The proposed work has the potential to transform the diagnosis and treatment of LUTS.

"4D ventricle-valve model risk stratification for planning surgical treatment of ischemic mitral regurgitation Project Summary/Abstract Ischemic mitral regurgitation (IMR) is a disease where the normal mitral valve (MV) structure is dysfunctional due to left ventricular (LV) remodeling after a myocardial infarction (MI). IMR affects nearly 3 million Americans and the magnitude of this problem is expected to grow as the population ages. IMR has a substantial mortality rate that is associated with even mild MR severity. Mitral valve repair with undersized ring annuloplasty has been the preferred treatment strategy for IMR; however, the recurrence of moderate or severe IMR within 12 months of surgery is common. Recent high profile results from the Cardiothoracic Surgical Trials Network (CTSN) mul- ticenter randomized trials on IMR have confirmed a high incidence of early recurrent IMR. More importantly, these studies highlighted the adverse impact of recurrent IMR on LV remodeling and clinical outcomes. The CTSN trials demonstrated no significant difference in LV volume reduction or survival at 12 and 24 months between repair and replacement groups; however, subgroup analysis demonstrated that repair patients that developed recurrent IMR had no reduction in LV volume while repair patients without recurrence experienced LV volume reduction that was superior to patients having valve replacement. The results of the CTSN IMR trials indicate an unmet need for a pre-operative risk stratification tool that reliably predicts MV repair failure. Such a tool would significantly reduce the problem of recurrent IMR by performing valve repair only in patients likely to experience a durable result and performing valve replacement in patients with high risk of recurrence. The long term goal is to improve quality of surgical therapy in IMR by improving risk-stratification pre-operatively using image analysis tools. The overall objective of this proposal is to improve the prediction IMR recurrence by ex- panding this model to include the left ventricle (LV). The rationale is that while IMR manifests as MV malcoapta- tion, the root cause of the disease is LV remodeling. The central hypothesis is that features extracted from the integrated left ventricular and mitral valve (LVMV) model will predict recurrence more accurately than the current MV-only model. To fulfill this objective and test the central hypothesis by pursuing the following specific aims: 1) Develop the 4D integrated LVMV model and compare the accuracy of fitting this model to intraoperative 3DTE images to that of the existing MV-only model. 2) Assess the ability of biomarkers derived from the integrated LVMV model to predict IMR recurrence, and compare to the predictive value of the MV-only model. The project is significant because, if successful, the integrated LVMV model will be incorporated into the Gorman lab ongoing effort translating this technology to the operating room, thus improving survival rates, reducing the impending clinical burden and the number of repeated procedures. Project Narrative The proposed project tackles the high impact problem of ischemic mitral regurgitation (IMR) recurrence after surgical repair by developing a reliable real-time pre-operative risk stratification tool using image analysis of 3D transesophageal echocardiography. This will enable surgeons to optimize mitral surgical treatment in IMR on a case-by-case basis. If successful, the proposed research has the potential to virtually eliminate the problem of IMR recurrence, maximize long-term outcomes for millions of IMR patients and significantly decrease the im- pending clinical burden expected with an aging population.",4D ventricle-valve model risk stratification for planning surgical treatment of ischemic mitral regurgitation,9754718,F30HL142138,"['3-Dimensional', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anatomic Models', 'Anatomy', 'Atlases', 'Biological Markers', 'Cardiac', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Computational algorithm', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Failure', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Incidence', 'Label', 'Left', 'Left Ventricular Remodeling', 'Left ventricular structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Medial', 'Mentors', 'Mitral Valve', 'Mitral Valve Insufficiency', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Operating Rooms', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Partner in relationship', 'Patients', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Procedures', 'Recurrence', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk stratification', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Surgeon', 'Survival Rate', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Time', 'Transesophageal Echocardiography', 'Translating', 'Ventricular', 'aging population', 'case-by-case basis', 'clinically translatable', 'experience', 'high risk', 'imaging Segmentation', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'morphometry', 'mortality', 'muscular structure', 'papillary muscle', 'randomized trial', 'repaired', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'valve replacement', 'virtual']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,F30,2019,32081,0.015506791353876608
"Development of a novel medication adherability tool to improve cardiovascular disease management Nearly half of patients with heart disease become non-adherent to their prescribed therapies within a year of treatment initiation. This is a central and modifiable reason why cardiovascular disease remains a leading cause of death in the US. Despite numerous attempts to develop interventions aimed at improving adherence, these attempts have had varying and often limited success; one explanation could be that underlying barriers to adherence are not being addressed. Those interventions that have been successful often make medications easier to take but are frequently expensive to implement or deployed too late. Developing a novel provider- facing intervention that modifies medication “adherability”, defined as the properties of medications that make them difficult for patients to take, could be especially impactful and relatively inexpensive. For example, more than 30% of patients report difficulties swallowing prescribed medicines, yet little is known how this “adherability” affects long-term adherence and clinical outcomes, and few interventions focus on these issues.  To this end, Dr. Lauffenburger’s K01 proposal incorporates a novel prophylactic, patient-centric approach to provider behavior change for cardiovascular disease management. Providers often do not know what the medications they prescribe actually look like or what aspects of the medications are acceptable to or preferred by their patients. This study will uniquely incorporate patient perspectives about medication properties that lead to poor adherence in the design of a scalable provider-facing clinical decision support intervention.  The proposed aims are to: (1) develop a comprehensive framework of cardiovascular medication properties, such as appearance, side-effect profiles, or dosing, that may lead to poor adherence using patient focus groups; (2) rigorously evaluate their effects on adherence and clinical outcomes in large national data sources; (3) develop and externally validate a novel clinical prediction rule for medication adherability; and (4) develop and pilot test novel web- and electronic health record-based prescribing tools based on the prediction rule for providers. The expected overall impact of this innovative proposal is that it will fundamentally advance how to personalize medications for patients to ultimately improve adherence and health outcomes.  Dr. Lauffenburger has a unique background as a practicing pharmacist trained in epidemiology with a proven commitment to research. This proposal includes an educational plan that will address gaps in her training: expertise in behavioral sciences, prediction modeling, and implementation research. The mentorship team, led by Niteesh Choudhry, an expert in adherence and implementation, includes well-known experts in cardiovascular trials (Elliott Antman, co-mentor), biostatistics (Robert Glynn, co-mentor), and behavioral sciences (Daniel Solomon, co-mentor), and will ensure scientific success and training. By the conclusion of this program, she will be able to independently design, target, and evaluate behavioral interventions for heart diseases. The results of the proposed K01 will be invaluable pilot work for a planned R01-level application. We propose a novel strategy to address the epidemic of poor adherence to cardiovascular therapies: tailoring medications for vulnerable patients based on their “adherability”, or the properties of medication like dosing frequency, palatability, and side-effect profiles, that make them difficult to take regularly. To achieve the proposed research, we will conduct focus groups with at-risk patients, determine the effect of adherability on long-term adherence and cardiovascular outcomes, develop and validate a novel adherability clinical prediction rule, and pilot test a simple, scalable clinical decision support tool for providers. The overarching goal is to improve clinical outcomes by optimizing medications for patients at the time of prescribing, which is a central mission of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI).",Development of a novel medication adherability tool to improve cardiovascular disease management,9687744,K01HL141538,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Appearance', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Biometry', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cause of Death', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Color', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Deglutition', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Dose', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Focus Groups', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heart Diseases', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Palate', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacists', 'Property', 'Provider', 'Regimen', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Review Literature', 'Risk', 'Route', 'Shapes', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior change', 'cardiometabolism', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'design', 'health belief', 'implementation research', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'medication compliance', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'prophylactic', 'side effect', 'success', 'successful intervention', 'support tools', 'systematic review', 'theories', 'tool', 'virtual']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K01,2019,143581,-0.006428238251354111
"Michigan Hepatotoxicity Clinical Research Network Renewal 2018 Michigan Hepatotoxicity Research Network 2018 Renewal ABSTRACT In the past 5 years, the Drug Induced Liver Injury Network (DILIN) has increased cumulative enrollment to over 2000 adult and pediatric patients in the ongoing Prospective and Retrospective registry studies. In addition, an “Acute” DILI protocol with collection of serial early biological samples for mechanistic biomarker studies was developed and implemented. Other network aims included investigation of the role of genetic polymorphisms in DILI susceptibility and outcome, development of improved causality assessment methods, and expansion of the LiverTox website. The University of Michigan team led by Dr. Fontana has played an important role in the design, implementation, and analysis of the primary and ancillary DILIN studies since its inception in 2003. Michigan has not only been a leading enroller in all of the ongoing Registry studies but also provided important leadership in multiple DILIN committees and initiatives. The Michigan team now proposes a series of novel and feasible study aims for the DILIN renewal. The PRIMARY AIM of this proposal is to continue to recruit and enroll high causality adult and pediatric DILI cases into the registry studies for genetic, immunologic, biomarker and mechanistic studies. The Michigan Hepatotoxicity Network has specific plans to increase the enrollment of ethnic minorities via the engagement of hepatologists/ collaborators in southeastern Michigan and elsewhere that care for a large number of African American, Hispanic, and Asian patients. In addition, further development of natural language processing algorithms to search the EMR at the University of Michigan are proposed to facilitate enrollment. Qualitative, quantitative and toxicological studies of the chemical constituents in the herbal and dietary supplement (HDS) products implicated in a growing proportion of DILI cases will be expanded via an ongoing collaboration with the National Center for National Products Research. The SECOND AIM of this proposal is to conduct pilot/ feasibility clinical trials to improve the outcomes of patients with severe acute DILI and those at risk for developing chronic DILI. Proposed study designs include a 12 week course of a simple and safe, orally administered anti-inflammatory or anti-oxidant agent (e.g. budesonide, SAMe, vitamin E) in selected patients with severe acute DILI at risk for adverse outcomes. In addition, 12 to 24 week studies of a safe and effective orally administered anti- cholestatic agent such as an ileal apical bile salt transport inhibitor that may reduce serum bile acids are proposed for subjects at risk of chronic DILI. Lastly, prospective studies of magnetic resonance elastography and MRCP imaging are proposed to improve our understanding of the severity and natural history of DILI. The THIRD AIM of this proposal is to further expand the LiverTox website to include additional chapters on HDS DILI, develop and implement a computerized causality assessment instrument, and assemble working committees to insure that the website content remains up to date and pertinent. Finally, additional collaborations between DILIN and the US FDA and other regulatory agencies are proposed to enhance the pharmacovigilance capabilities of DILIN for new causes of DILI and temporal changes over time. PROJECT NARRATIVE The University of Michigan Hepatotoxicity Research Network proposes to improve our understanding of the etiologies, risk factors, and outcomes of DILI via the continued enrollment of adult and pediatric patients including targeted enrollment of ethnic minority patients that will help determine if there are racial differences in DILI susceptibility and outcomes via analysis of collected biological samples, DNA, liver tissue, and clinical data. Pilot/ feasibility clinical trials of simple, safe and mechanistically based treatments for patients with severe acute DILI and those at risk for developing chronic DILI are also proposed. Finally, further development and enhancement of the LiverTox website is proposed to include additional chapters on HDS DILI, development and implementation of a computerized diagnostic instrument, and expansion of the pharmacovigilance capabilities of DILIN.",Michigan Hepatotoxicity Clinical Research Network Renewal 2018,9769695,U01DK065184,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'African American', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Anti-inflammatory', 'Antioxidants', 'Apical', 'Asians', 'Assessment tool', 'Bile Acids', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Budesonide', 'Caring', 'Chemicals', 'Childhood', 'Chinese People', 'Cholestasis', 'Chronic', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Enrollment', 'Etiology', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic study', 'Hepatic', 'Hepatotoxicity', 'Herbal supplement', 'Hispanics', 'Hospitals', 'Human Resources', 'Image', 'Immunologic Factors', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Immunologics', 'International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10)', 'Intuition', 'Investigation', 'Leadership', 'Liver', 'Magnetic Resonance Elastography', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Monitor', 'Natural History', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Oxidants', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pediatrics', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Phenotype', 'Plasma', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Race', 'Recovery', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'S-Adenosylmethionine', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Serum', 'Severities', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Symptoms', 'Taiwan', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxicology', 'Transplantation', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Vitamin E', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'bile salts', 'clinical phenotype', 'computerized', 'design', 'ethnic minority population', 'hepatotoxin', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'industry partner', 'instrument', 'liver injury', 'meetings', 'member', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'outreach', 'pediatric patients', 'pharmacovigilance', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'racial difference', 'recruit', 'repository', 'sample collection', 'transcriptomics', 'transport inhibitor', 'web site']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U01,2019,256000,-0.0019564475488261374
"SCH: Leveraging Clinical Time Series to Learn Optimal Treatment of Acute Dyspnea  The ability to rapidly match the right patients to the right treatments at the right time is critical to ensuring patients  receive high quality care. The vast majority of machine learning applications in healthcare focus on diagnosing or  stratifying patients for a particular outcome. In contrast, reinforcement learning (RL) aims to learn how clinical states  (i.e., sets of signs, symptoms, and test results) respond to specific sequences of treatments, with the goal of optimizing clinical outcomes. RL does not aim to diagnose, but infers diagnosis based on a patient's response to  specific treatments--in many ways mimicking how clinicians operate in practice. This proposal will develop a novel  clinician-in-the-loop reinforcement learning (RL) framework that analyzes electronic health record (EHR) clinical time-series data to support physician decision making, iteratively providing physicians the estimated outcome of  potential treatment strategies. Our topic of focus for this work is the evaluation and treatment of patients hospitalized with acute dyspnea (shortness of breath) and signs of impending respiratory failure. Acute dyspnea is an ideal condition for an RL approach, since it can be due to three overlapping conditions: congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and pneumonia. Determining optimal treatment for these patients is clinically difficult, as a patient's presentation is frequently ambiguous, rapidly changing, and often due to multiple causes.  Inappropriate treatment may occur in up to a third of patients leading to increased mortality. While developing this  RL framework, we will also develop methods to learn more useful representations of high-dimensional clinical time-series data to improve the efficiency of RL model training. In addition, given the challenges of working with observational health data, we will develop new methods for evaluation of learned policies and develop new theory to better understand the limitations of RL using observational data. The project has four aims: 1) create a shareable, de-identified EHR time-series dataset of 35,000 patients with acute dyspnea, 2) develop techniques for exploiting invariances In tasks involving clinical time-series data to improve the efficiency of RL model training, 3) develop and evaluate an RL-based framework for learning optimal treatment policies for acute dyspnea, and 4) prospectively validate the learned treatment model. This research will result in new techniques for learning representations from time-series data and will study both the theoretical and practical limitations of RL using observational clinical data, leading to key advancements in ML and RL for clinical care. The tools developed for clinical decision support in this proposal have the potential for high impact because of their ability to generalize beyond the problem studied here to other conditions, laying the groundwork for clinical systems that directly impact society by aiding in the timely and appropriate treatment of patients. Hospitalization for sudden and severe shortness of breath (acute dyspnea) affects almost 2 million patients in the US each  year. Such patients can be difficult to treat, as their presentation may ambiguous, due to multiple causes that change over  time and require different types of therapies/treatments. In this proposal, we will develop novel reinforcement-learning  based approaches to quickly match patients to the best treatment based on his/her symptoms over time. The proposed  work could have a significant impact on health by shortening lhe time to appropriate treatments, leading to improved  patient outcomes.",SCH: Leveraging Clinical Time Series to Learn Optimal Treatment of Acute Dyspnea ,9927810,R01LM013325,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Congestive Heart Failure', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Dyspnea', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Instruction', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Patient Rights', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Pneumonia', 'Policies', 'Principal Investigator', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Quality of Care', 'Research', 'Respiratory Failure', 'Right to Treatments', 'Series', 'Shortness of Breath', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Societies', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision support', 'health data', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'mortality', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'patient response', 'patient stratification', 'programs', 'prospective', 'theories', 'tool', 'treatment strategy']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2019,238522,0.010842315510154488
"BAsIC - Brain-computer-interface practical Application in the Intensive Care unit: a pilot study Patients increasingly survive critical care, but for many the experience is psychologically tormenting in part because they lose all control over their environment. Patients with neurological injury in particular suffer from this major loss of autonomy which impacts their long term recovery. Brain-computer interface (BCI) technology transforms physiological changes associated with patient thoughts into actionable outputs. The technology is rapidly advancing and well established outside of the critical care setting. The goal of this project is to determine whether conscious and unconscious appearing ICU patients are able to communicate their basic needs, such as pain, hunger, and thirst, to health care providers using the BCI technology. We will apply a bedside BCI system in the ICU using a machine-learning algorithm that analyzes changes in routine EEG in response to standardized questions presented to the patient by headphones. The BCI system will provide immediate closed- loop feedback (auditory and/or visual) to patients about their performance. To achieve our goals, we will first test if conscious ICU patients are able to express basic needs, such as pain, to health care providers using the BCI technology. Patients will trigger the BCI system to then express their needs in response to specific questions (e.g., “Do you have pain?”). Secondly, we will determine whether basic communication is possible for patients with cognitive motor dissociation (i.e., patients who appear unconscious, but follow commands using EEG motor imagery paradigms). We will test if these patients are able to use the BCI system to respond to simple questions (i.e., “Activate the alarm”). Finally, we will assess the patient's experience using BCI technology as part of this study, as well as acceptance of using BCI technology in future clinical trials from patients, families, and health care providers involved in the study. The long-term goal of this proposal is to prepare a large clinical trial to test the benefits of BCI-assisted communication in brain-injured ICU patients. Patients in critical care suffer an almost complete loss of control over their most basic needs (e.g., they are unable to tell someone that they are hungry), which is stressful and impacts their long term recovery. This is a major problem for the many patients with acute brain injury. We propose to make technology available that would allow even some unresponsive‐appearing patients to communicate these needs with care givers and family members.",BAsIC - Brain-computer-interface practical Application in the Intensive Care unit: a pilot study,9808271,R03NS112760,"['Acute Brain Injuries', 'Affect', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Analgesics', 'Auditory', 'Base of the Brain', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Calibration', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Conscious', 'Coupled', 'Critical Care', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Diagnosis', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Dissociation', 'Electroencephalography', 'Environment', 'Experimental Designs', 'Eye', 'Family', 'Family health status', 'Family member', 'Fatigue', 'Feedback', 'Fever', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Health Personnel', 'Heart Rate', 'Hospitals', 'Hunger', 'Imagery', 'Imagination', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Label', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Neurologic', 'Output', 'Pain', 'Pain management', 'Patient Education', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Pilot Projects', 'Procedures', 'Recovery', 'Sedation procedure', 'Sensory', 'Series', 'Societies', 'Standardization', 'Stress', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Thirst', 'Time', 'Training', 'Unconscious State', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'brain computer interface', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'feeding', 'improved', 'injured', 'machine learning algorithm', 'member', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized strategies', 'practical application', 'psychologic', 'response', 'sound', 'willingness']",NINDS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R03,2019,81000,-0.04086473619584205
"Impact of Disparities Affecting Survival among Advanced Heart Failure Patients and Transplant Recipients DESCRIPTION: The current heart transplant allocation system and the newly recommended one prioritizes patients based on waitlist survival and does not take into account risk of death after transplant or likelihood of transplantation. Furthermore, it defines medical urgency for transplantation mainly by use of devices and not by objective evidence of medical illness. Unfortunately, many heart failure patients die on the waitlist, including a disproportionate number of women, Hispanics, and patients with certain heart diseases like restrictive cardiomyopathy. After transplantation there are also survival disparities. The long-term goal of this project is to optimize timing for advanced heart failure therapy in order to improve survival and minimize organ wastage. The objective of this research application is to identify risk factors for disparities in survival among heart transplant candidates and post-transplantation and to create tools that will improve outcome in therapy while minimizing organ wastage. The central hypothesis is that a better heart transplant allocation system requires knowledge of how population differences affect patient selection, waitlist mortality, and post-transplant mortality. The rationale for the proposed research is that there are known disparities (sex, race, and type of heart disease) in survival among advanced heart failure patients (pre- and post-transplantation) and creation of risk prediction models have successfully reduced waitlist mortality for lung, liver, and kidney transplantation. The specific aims of this research proposal are: 1) to identify risk factors for disparities in survival among heart transplant candidates and post-transplantation using the national transplant database 2) to develop a method to dynamically update risk of waitlist mortality across time using data from multiple transplant centers that includes potential prognistic risk factors not available in our national transplant database and 3) to create a mathematical model that simultaneous estimates waitlist and post-transplant mortality to optimize timing of transplantation. The approach is innovative because it utilizes new mathematical approaches and seeks to shift current heart failure research and clinical practice paradigms by taking into account population differences rather than basing decisions solely on ejection fraction, presence of coronary artery disease, and stages of disease. The proposed research is significant, because few studies have explored population differences in advanced heart failure to determine the factors associated with mortality on the waitlist and poor outcome post-transplantation. This proposal will evaluate the complex interplay of population differences (i.e sex, race, type of heart disease, laboratory measures of organ dysfunction, and influences of co-morbidities) as they relate to mortality on the waitlist, timing of transplantation, and mortality after transplantation. If the aims of our proposal are achieved, our research has the potential to empower clinicians and researchers to provide the right therapies for the right patient at the right time. There are disparities in survival among patients on the waiting list for a heart transplant, and post-transplantation. These differences are not recognized by the current and newly recommended heart transplant allocation system. Our proposal will identify the factors contributing to these population differences in order to improve survival and minimize organ wastage.",Impact of Disparities Affecting Survival among Advanced Heart Failure Patients and Transplant Recipients,9676904,R01HL141892,"['Affect', 'Albumins', 'American', 'Cardiac', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'EFRAC', 'Event', 'Fibrinogen', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health Personnel', 'Heart', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart Transplantation', 'Heart failure', 'Hispanics', 'Hypoalbuminemia', 'Individual', 'Insurance', 'Kidney Failure', 'Kidney Transplantation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Liver Failure', 'Lung Transplantation', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Rights', 'Patient Selection', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Population', 'Prostitution', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Renal function', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Restrictive Cardiomyopathy', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Sex Differences', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Transplantation', 'Treatment Failure', 'United Network for Organ Sharing', 'Update', 'Vibrissae', 'Waiting Lists', 'Woman', 'base', 'cardiac cachexia', 'cardiac device', 'clinical practice', 'cost effective', 'forest', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'liver transplantation', 'mathematical methods', 'mathematical model', 'men', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'novel', 'post-transplant', 'risk prediction model', 'sex', 'time use', 'tool', 'transplant centers', 'transplant database', 'transplant registry']",NHLBI,CLEVELAND CLINIC LERNER COM-CWRU,R01,2019,795898,0.010712787624919026
"Predicting Epilepsy Surgery Outcomes Using Neural Network Architecture Abstract Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is one of the most common forms of pharmacologically resistant epilepsy. The resection or ablation of medial temporal structures can be curative for many patients. Unfortunately, approximately one third of patients who undergo TLE surgery continue to have disabling seizures post- procedurally. The reasons for suboptimal outcomes are not well understood and therefore constitute a very important knowledge gap in epilepsy care. A better understanding of this difference in surgical response phenotype could be used to improve surgical planning, treatment, outcome prediction and counseling. Promising preliminary studies suggest that TLE surgical outcomes can be inferred by neuroimaging computational tools assessing the cumulative degree of abnormalities in the topological organization of structural networks involving limbic and extra-limbic regions. Nonetheless, network abnormalities are not routinely or systematically used and quantified in the pre-surgical evaluation of epilepsies, and their assessment requires refinement and further validation. The purpose of this proposal is to perform a prospective study to test the hypothesis that the degree of limbic and extra-limbic network abnormalities in TLE, systematically assessed using a connectome approach based on optimized diffusion MRI (dMRI), can be used to predict and better understand epilepsy surgery outcomes. This hypothesis builds on the well-defined basic science and neurobiological premises that epilepsy is associated with pathological alterations in networks that are related to seizure onset and seizure propagation. Importantly, network abnormalities are not visible on routine MRI, but their detection using connectomes constitutes a modern approach to quantifying the location and magnitude of “lesional epilepsy,” where broad computational network abnormalities imply worse outcomes. We will prospectively gather clinical and imaging data at six epilepsy centers using the NIH epilepsy common data elements. This project will be fundamentally based on standard of care data, thus minimizing the burden of extra data collection and ensuring feasibility. Furthermore, this project will be embedded in the ENIGMA-Epilepsy framework, which is a collaborative platform for clinical and neuromaging multi-center research. Specific Aim 1 will define the accuracy, reproducibility, and predictive values of the pre-surgical dMRI tractography connectome model towards surgical results in TLE. We will perform hypothesis-driven tests of specific limbic and extra-limbic networks in relationship with clinical data and surgical outcomes. Specific Aim 2 will test if the neuroimaging-clinical outcome model can be further improved with advanced diffusion methods (multi-shell diffusional kurtosis imaging), resting state functional MRI networks, or a multimodal approach. We believe that this research will have an important impact on our understanding of the mechanisms related to TLE treatment. NARRATIVE While some patients can become seizure free with epilepsy surgery, others persist with disabling seizures and the reasons for vastly dissimilar outcomes are not well understood. Increasing evidence suggests that epilepsy-related neuronal network reorganization is at the core of the mechanisms underlying epilepsy severity and seizure control. This project will use individualized mapping of white matter neural networks to better understand the pathophysiology of epilepsy, identify reasons for treatment success, and guide strategies to improve surgical treatment.",Predicting Epilepsy Surgery Outcomes Using Neural Network Architecture,9840235,R01NS110347,"['Ablation', 'Anterior Temporal Lobectomy', 'Area', 'Basic Science', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Common Data Element', 'Contralateral', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Detection', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Electrocoagulation', 'Electroencephalography', 'Ensure', 'Epilepsy', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Failure', 'Fiber', 'Freedom', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Predictive Value', 'Procedures', 'Prospective Studies', 'Prospective cohort', 'Publishing', 'Refractory', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Scalp structure', 'Seizures', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Structure', 'Temporal Lobe Epilepsy', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Tonic-Clonic Epilepsy', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'connectome', 'experience', 'gray matter', 'hippocampal atrophy', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'millimeter', 'multimodality', 'neural network', 'neural network architecture', 'neuroimaging', 'neuronal circuitry', 'novel strategies', 'organizational structure', 'outcome prediction', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'response', 'standard of care', 'success', 'surgery outcome', 'tractography', 'white matter']",NINDS,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,R01,2019,696066,0.0026633163917286944
"VIP:Visual-Valid Dietary Behavior Pattern Recognition for Local-National Trials PROJECT SUMMARY  Chronic diseases and conditions such as obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease are among the most common, costly, and preventable of all health problems in the United States. A healthy dietary pattern is paramount in disease risk reduction. Since 2010, the dietary pattern approach has been recommended to examine the relation of the totality of diet and health outcomes by U.S. Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committees; meanwhile longitudinal dietary data have become increasingly available. Yet, methods are underdeveloped for characterizing longitudinal diet-quality variations and even rudimentary for validating diet- quality patterns that describe these dynamic variations, therefore, leading to unclear evidence for assessing diet-health/disease relationships and formulating dietary guidelines. A noticeable gap exists between dietary pattern literature and the fast-growing statistical learning field. We propose to develop an innovative statistical learning tool for diet-quality trajectory pattern-recognition based on rich and highly-comparable longitudinal dietary datasets from randomized controlled trials (RCT) and observational studies (OS) pertaining to a variety of individuals, race/ethnicities, and geographical locations, and spanning up to 30 years, collected across 4 NIH- funded RCTs in Massachusetts, and 2 large-scale multi-site national RCT and OS studies as well as simulated dietary data based on these trials. Our project builds on PI Fang’s NIH-funded behavioral trajectory pattern-recognition tool (Multiple-Imputation based Fuzzy Clustering, MIFuzzy) which processes longitudinal trial data with missing and zero-inflated values, and identifies latent trajectory patterns that characterize patients’ complex engagement and cognitive response variations during multi-component RCTs and better explains the heterogeneity of treatment effects. This project will enhance and expand MIFuzzy to a Visual- Valid Dietary Behavior Pattern Recognition tool (VIP), adapted to diet-quality trajectory pattern analyses and chronic disease risk assessment. Our goal is to provide a new multi-view of diet-quality trajectory patterns and associated outcomes from longitudinal studies. Based upon high-quality and comparable RCT and OS longitudinal dietary data from NIDDK-, NHLBI-, and NIMH-funded studies, this VIP project will help grow more valid evidence for developing dietary guidelines and clarify our understanding of diet-disease relationships for a range of patient/individual types, potentially enabling better personalized, adaptive dietary strategies. Developing this evidence-based VIP tool will also contribute to the infrastructure for diet-related studies, advance pattern- recognition methods, help scientific communities and the lay public compare with local and national diet-quality guidelines, and assess dietary health risks. In the long run, this VIP project will contribute to creating a data management platform that support near-real-time pattern analyses and adaptive interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE / PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Evaluating diet quality and encouraging healthful dietary change is paramount for preventing, or managing, many chronic conditions and diseases, including obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Our innovative Visual-Valid Dietary Behavior Pattern-recognition (VIP) method will identify clusters of distinct diet-quality patterns in multiple longitudinal dietary datasets from local and national NIH-funded randomized controlled trials and observational studies. This work will help formulate stronger evidence for national dietary guidelines, deepen our understanding of diet quality trajectory patterns, and elucidate relationships between these patterns and chronic diseases for a range of patient/individual types; it can potentially enable personalized, adaptive dietary strategies. Open-access dissemination of our diet quality pattern recognition tool will contribute to the infrastructure of dietary-intervention studies, advance pattern recognition methodology, and help the scientific community and the public to compare individual dietary behaviors with local and national diet-quality patterns and associated health risks.",VIP:Visual-Valid Dietary Behavior Pattern Recognition for Local-National Trials,9907572,R56DK114514,"['Address', 'Advisory Committees', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Study', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diet', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Dietary Practices', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Eating', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Funding', 'General Population', 'Geographic Locations', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Imagery', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention Studies', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Longitudinal observational study', 'Machine Learning', 'Massachusetts', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nutrient', 'Obesity', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Physical activity', 'Process', 'Psychological Factors', 'Race', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Research Design', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Reduction', 'Site', 'Software Tools', 'Subgroup', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Visual Pattern Recognition', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'Work', 'adaptive intervention', 'base', 'cohort', 'cost', 'data management', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'dietary guidelines', 'disorder risk', 'evidence base', 'field study', 'good diet', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'longitudinal dataset', 'outcome prediction', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'simulation', 'social media', 'sociodemographics', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'user-friendly']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS DARTMOUTH,R56,2019,452178,-0.012513073030744412
"DFU Clinical Research Unit Abstract Diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) are a prevalent diabetes complications affecting up to 25% of patients and leading to ~80,000 Americans having non-traumatic amputations each year, with five-year mortality rates of up to 40%. Recent evidence suggests that non-traumatic lower extremity amputations are on the rise, after decades of decline, in spite of advances in targeted wound care products, establishment of interdisciplinary clinical and surgical teams, and improving diabetes medical care. Given the worldwide epidemic of diabetes, the burden associated with DFU are high, including high costs of $9 billion-$13 billion per year and besides those associated with high morbidity and mortality. Thus, the establishment of a Diabetic Foot Consortium comprised of experienced DFU Clinical Research Units (CRU) for reliable DFU biomarker discovery cannot be understated. The main objective of this proposal is to integrate the robust infrastructure at Michigan Medicine with our highly skilled clinical and translational team to establish a DFU CRU as a strong contender and contributor within the DFC network that will be uniquely poised to participate in all DFU biomarker discovery and related wound healing projects undertaken by the Consortium. Additional aims are to The aims are to : identify, recruit, and phenotype a broad spectrum of DFU participants from the large base of patients with these conditions who are currently being followed at Michigan Medicine, according to the Consortium requirements; implement standardized mechanisms and protocols for effective longitudinal sample collection and retention; and actively participate in the DFC intellectually and provide all available resources to develop and support clinical study protocols to validate DFU biomarkers, including complex quantifications of wound image features; single cell, genetic, molecular, metabolomics, and microbiome analyses; and assessing additive predictors of DFU healing beyond clinical markers alone using multi-modal approaches. The expected outcome of this work is that the Michigan Medicine DFU Clinical Center will be an integral part of the Consortia collaborative network, with a highly positive impact for the entire spectrum of biomarker discovery and future novel therapies projects. Narrative This project has major public health relevance because diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) remain one of the most common secondary complications of diabetes and are the leading cause of lower extremity amputation in the US. Current treatments are ineffective and given the recent surge in major lower extremity amputations in diabetic patients despite the previous decades of decline, identification of novel treatment avenues is of critical importance. The main objective of the Diabetic Foot Clinical Center at the University of Michigan is to use our robust infrastructure and highly skilled clinical and translational research team to generate a unique platform for investigating individual contributions to DFU wound healing from clinical samples, single cell genetic and molecular analyses from DFU samples, and image analyses.",DFU Clinical Research Unit,9782944,U01DK119083,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Affect', 'Age', 'American', 'Amputation', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Caring', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Markers', 'Clinical Research', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collection', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Databases', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic Foot', 'Diabetic Foot Ulcer', 'Disease', 'End stage renal failure', 'Engineering', 'Epidemic', 'European', 'FDA approved', 'Foot Ulcer', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Genetic', 'Heart failure', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'Label', 'Liquid substance', 'Location', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Marketing', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mental Depression', 'Methodology', 'Michigan', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Analysis', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Peripheral Nervous System Diseases', 'Peripheral arterial disease', 'Phenotype', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychosocial Factor', 'Publishing', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Self Care', 'Standardization', 'Sterile coverings', 'Surface', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Translational Research', 'Ulcer', 'Universities', 'Vision', 'Walking', 'Work', 'Wound Healing', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'clinical research site', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'cost', 'diabetic patient', 'experience', 'genetic analysis', 'healing', 'health care delivery', 'improved', 'ineffective therapies', 'interest', 'male', 'metabolomics', 'microbiome', 'microbiome analysis', 'mortality', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'personalized medicine', 'practice setting', 'precision medicine', 'prediction algorithm', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'sample collection', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment response', 'wound']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U01,2019,429000,-0.015479397361088084
"Combined Cardiopulmonary Failure in COPD: SPIROMICS HF The death rate and hospitalizations from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have doubled in the last 50 years. A third of COPD hospitalizations overlap with heart failure, mostly with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), yet no large COPD study has ascertained cardiac function. The Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) COPD Study was funded to test the endothelial hypothesis of emphysema and examine reduced RV dimensions (“cor pulmonale parvus”) in COPD. In the MESA COPD Study II, we found that associations of reduced pulmonary microvascular blood flow with emphysema do not appear to be confounded by hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction and that emphysema on CT predicted RV regression over 5 years. We also developed methods to further subtype emphysema and COPD and scaled them up to the SubPopulations and InteRmediate Outcome Measures In COPD Study (SPIROMICS). We used unsupervised machine learning to discover new emphysema subtypes that are common and have molecular origins. Separately, we found that 26% of adults have segmental airway variants, which are associated with COPD and the developmental genes FGF10 and RARA. Both genes affect right heart development. In pilot work, we found one dramatically altered RV strain and the other associated with cor pulmonale parvus. Finally, we found that bronchitic ‘symptomatic smokers,’ who have hyperinflation from gas trapping, may have increased LV diastolic dysfunction. Hence, cardiac alterations in COPD are complex but recent advances in COPD subtyping may allow their personalized diagnosis and treatment. SPIROMICS is an NHLBI-funded prospective study that recruited smokers with COPD and controls and is re-examining 2,000 participants with gold- standard lung phenotyping including full-lung CT. We propose to add comprehensive echocardiography (echo) with speckle-tracking for cardiac mechanics for 1,000 SPIROMICS participants, with exercise in 700 and cardiopulmonary MRI in 600, to test the following hypotheses: 1) machine-learned subtypes of emphysema on CT are associated with specific alterations in cardiac structure and function, which vary from cor pulmonale to LV diastolic dysfunction; 2) participants with segmental airway variants have abnormal RV structure and function; 3) symptomatic smokers have signs of increased LV afterload and LV diastolic dysfunction. Innovative aspects of the application include the use of novel echo and MRI measures in a large, well- characterized cohort of COPD patients. Confirmation of the hypotheses would define the mechanisms of HFpEF in COPD and identify subsets of patients for targeted treatment of cardiopulmonary dysfunction. The death rate and hospitalizations from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have doubled in the last 50 years. A third of COPD hospitalizations overlap with heart failure, mostly with preserved ejection fraction. The proposed study would be the first large study with gold-standard phenotyping of the heart and lungs and would test highly specific hypothesized based upon recent advances in lung subphenotyping to yield personalized approaches to combined cardiopulmonary disease in COPD.",Combined Cardiopulmonary Failure in COPD: SPIROMICS HF,9819260,R01HL093081,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Apical', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Output', 'Cardiopulmonary', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Code', 'Complex', 'DRD1 gene', 'Death Rate', 'Developmental Gene', 'Diffuse', 'Dimensions', 'Drops', 'EFRAC', 'Echocardiography', 'Endothelium', 'Exercise', 'FGF10 gene', 'Failure', 'Fibrosis', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Gases', 'Genes', 'Gold', 'Heart', 'Heart Atrium', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Hypoxia', 'Impairment', 'Kinetics', 'Lung', 'Lung CAT Scan', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis', 'Myocardial', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Outcome Measure', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Prospective Studies', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Pulmonary Fibrosis', 'Pulmonary Heart Disease', 'Pulmonary artery structure', 'RARA gene', 'Respiratory Failure', 'Right Ventricular Hypertrophy', 'Right ventricular structure', 'Sampling', 'Smoker', 'Structure', 'Suggestion', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Variant', 'Ventricular', 'Work', 'base', 'cardiogenesis', 'cohort', 'disorder control', 'disorder subtype', 'genetic variant', 'heart function', 'heart preservation', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'interstitial', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'patient subsets', 'personalized approach', 'personalized diagnostics', 'personalized medicine', 'preservation', 'pressure', 'receptor', 'recruit', 'targeted treatment', 'unsupervised learning', 'vasoconstriction']",NHLBI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2019,2391491,-0.027780444295170063
"Mitigating High Grade Radiation-Induced Lymphopenia through Pretreatment Autologous Lymphocyte Infusion PROJECT SUMMARY Radiation induced lymphopenia (RIL) is a common radiation-related toxicity that has been recognized for over a century but often ignored as clinically inconsequential. However, accumulating evidence has demonstrated strong association of high grade RIL (seen in 30-50% of patients) with poor prognosis. The pervasive role of radiotherapy in the curative management of solid tumors supports the need to develop mitigating strategies, particularly for patients with a high risk of developing grade 4 (G4) RIL. We have compelling evidence from both clinical and preclinical work that severe RIL impacts cancer control and therapy effectiveness, and methods to reduce RIL may improve treatment outcomes. To further develop these approaches for clinical translation, we have proposed 2 specific aims. In aim 1, we will build on our initial prediction model for G4 RIL and leverage our large database of esophageal cancer patients who have completed chemoradiation (CRT) to develop a better predictive model for G4 RIL so that we can rapidly and efficiently identify the highest risk patients for mitigating strategies. In aim 2, we will determine the feasibility and safety of raising the baseline lymphocyte levels by autologous lymphocyte infusion (ALI) prior to initiating CRT. Fundamentally, this research will allow us to develop the necessary computational tool capable of properly identifying patients at risk for developing severe RIL, and complete a small feasibility and safety study of using ALI as a way to raise the baseline pre-treatment lymphocyte levels so that the probability of developing G4 RIL could be possibly curtailed. By targeting the at-risk patients to receive RIL mitigating strategies, we will hopefully be able to improve the cancer outcomes of standard cancer therapies, and build on current innovative strategies of immunotherapy and radiation combinations. PROJECT NARRATIVE Radiation therapy, a key pillar in the management of cancers, causes a common yet ignored side effect of radiation induced lymphopenia (RIL). Severe RIL has been linked to poor outcomes of patients, presumably due to reduced immune surveillance thereby increasing disease recurrence after radiation therapy. We propose developing a prediction model to help identify who are most at risk for developing severe RIL, and conduct a pilot study to help reduce the impact of RIL so that clinical outcomes for these at-risk patients will improve in the future.",Mitigating High Grade Radiation-Induced Lymphopenia through Pretreatment Autologous Lymphocyte Infusion,9807793,R21CA240881,"['Applications Grants', 'Bayesian Prediction', 'Blood Component Removal', 'CD8B1 gene', 'Cancer Control', 'Cancer Patient', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Combination immunotherapy', 'Complication', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Distant', 'Effectiveness', 'Enrollment', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Future', 'Grant', 'Immunologic Surveillance', 'Immunotherapy', 'Incidence', 'Inferior', 'Infusion procedures', 'Link', 'Low Dose Radiation', 'Lymphocyte', 'Lymphocyte Count', 'Lymphopenia', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of esophagus', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nomograms', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Phase I Clinical Trials', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Probability', 'Proliferating', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation therapy', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recurrence', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'Statistical Models', 'Stem cell transplant', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Antigens', 'Tumor Escape', 'Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocytes', 'Validation', 'Work', 'autologous lymphocytes', 'base', 'cancer radiation therapy', 'cancer therapy', 'chemoradiation', 'clinical translation', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'disorder control', 'fundamental research', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'innovation', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized approach', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic value', 'radiation effect', 'response', 'safety and feasibility', 'safety study', 'side effect', 'tool', 'tumor']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,R21,2019,211410,-0.02737536069669706
"Data-Driven Shape Analysis for Quantitative Severity Stratification in Patients with Metopic Craniosynostosis Abstract Craniosynostosis affects close to one in 2000 newborns and causes growth restriction perpendicular to the affected suture. Metopic craniosynostosis is the second most common form of craniosynostosis. The metopic suture is an important sight of cranial growth as the brain rapidly expands in the ﬁrst year of life. Patients affected by metopic craniosynostosis will present in the ﬁrst few months of life with varying degrees of narrowing of the forehead and brow, a triangular shaped head, and an abnormal eye position. Surgery is recommended early in childhood to normalize the head shape and expand the restricted skull to prevent complications such as headaches, cognitive impairment, and visual disturbances including blindness.  Imaging with computed tomography (CT) is employed to conﬁrm new diagnoses of metopic craniosynostosis and, together with the physical exam, is used in a descriptive and qualitative manner to assess the degree of head shape abnormality. Several methods have been employed to interpret the information provided in the CT scans to allow surgeons to utilize data for surgical decision making. However, these indices reduce the complex three-dimensional skull dysmorphology into isolated measurements of angles or proportions, require detailed calculations to perform, and no universally accepted standard has emerged so far despite signiﬁcant research efforts and clinical motivation.  In this grant proposal, we aim to increase our understanding of the cranial dysmorphology in patients with metopic craniosynostosis by employing latest results from statistical shape modeling and deep learning. Specif- ically, we will build a statistical shape model of pediatric skulls from CT images of patients with metopic cran- iosynostosis as well as a group of normal controls capturing normal phenotypical shape variations. The distance of a new shape from the normative shape space will represent the proposed Shape Normality Metric (SNM). The SNM will be validated against ratings from experts in the surgical community (current standard of care) who will be asked to assess the dysmorphology of the skulls in our database. To avoid surgeons' subjective bias, we will aggregate their response using statistical methods that compensate for potential individual bias. Finally, to streamline data collection for future research we will develop a head-shape portal that will allow users to upload CT scans of their patients and the system will automatically calculate the SNM.  By developing a severity metric that encompasses the entire extent of dysmorphology in metopic craniosyn- ostosis and establishing a head-shape portal, we will improve our understanding of the spectrum of metopic craniosynostosis, aid in pre-operative and surgical decision making, enable future research, and help facilitate longitudinal outcomes assessments and multi-center communication and collaboration. Narrative This grant proposal aims to improve our understanding of the head shape anomaly associated with metopic craniosynostosis by using recent results from statistical shape analysis and deep learning, with the goal of developing an objective metopic cranioynostosis severity scale. Different from previously proposed metrics, our approach evaluates the entire shape as a whole. With this information, surgeons will be able to objectively determine how severely affected their patients are and will be better able to tailor their interventions to the needs of their individual patients. Additionally, surgeons will be able to better communicate with each other and study the effects of surgical intervention on their patients which will improve patient care in the long run.",Data-Driven Shape Analysis for Quantitative Severity Stratification in Patients with Metopic Craniosynostosis,9778826,R21EB026061,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Applications Grants', 'Blindness', 'Brain', 'Cephalic', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Craniosynostosis', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Deformity', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Dysmorphology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Eye Abnormalities', 'Forehead', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Graph', 'Growth', 'Head', 'Headache', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Ice', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Joint structure of suture of skull', 'Left', 'Letters', 'Life', 'MRI Scans', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Motivation', 'Newborn Infant', 'Normalcy', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome Assessment', 'Output', 'Pathologic', 'Patient Care', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reconstructive Surgical Procedures', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Socialization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stereophotogrammetries', 'Stratification', 'Supervision', 'Surgeon', 'Surgical sutures', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Trauma patient', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'clinical care', 'cranium', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'image processing', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'neural network', 'operation', 'patient stratification', 'power analysis', 'premature', 'prevent', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'self esteem', 'shape analysis', 'standard of care', 'surgery outcome', 'web-based tool']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R21,2019,307172,-0.004916160469185114
"The Vanderbilt Urologic Infection Repository, a Resource for Personalized Clinical Discovery SUMMARY - OVERALL In personalized medicine, the care of each patient is guided by his/her unique clinical circumstances. At its foundation, however, this paradigm holds a concurrent need for personalized science, in which technologies are developed and hypothesis explored in light of individual diversity. Critically, this diversity also includes unique microbial populations, which can augment the onset, progression, and treatment of disease. Within the field of benign urology, one of the most common pathologies—urinary tract infections (UTIs)—is also one of the most heterogenous, as the risk factors, symptomatology, and outcomes can vary significantly from patient to patient. Not surprisingly, the complexity of UTIs extends beyond the host, with tremendous genotypic and phenotypic diversity among the species/strains of microbes that elicit these infections. To better align the management of UTIs with the goals of precision care, our understanding of pathophysiology must become more nuanced, as we network in tandem the inherent diversity of host and microbe. To these ends, we propose a resource that provides an interconnected picture of both components, the Vanderbilt Urologic Infection Repository (VUIR). With our institution's unique foundation in medical informatics, we will create a searchable database of clinical parameters from bacteriuric patients (many thousands of cases annually), together with microbiologic data on the organisms. In parallel, the paired microbial strains will be stored permanently as a biobank for analysis and experimentation, together with linkage to anonymized versions of patient records within Vanderbilt's Synthetic Derivative (a filtered version of our electronic health data). The logistical infrastructure for clinical biobanking is also already in place at Vanderbilt via the institutionally-supported microVU initiative, in which microbial isolates from the diagnostic laboratory are repurposed as academic resources. As a basic expansion of these efforts, the VUIR will represent a first-in-kind tool for developing technologies to combat UTIs, while also investigating their underlying pathogenesis. In particular, it could facilitate functional genomic studies that bridge host and pathogen. Demonstrating the resource's value, we will conduct whole-genome sequencing of clinically underrepresented bacterial species, together with genome-wide association studies that focus on the infection phenotypes of the source-patients. In addition to novel virulence factors, we seek to identify elusive genomic determinants that distinguish cases of asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) and symptomatic UTI. The molecular basis of UTI-versus-ASB epitomizes a clinical challenge that requires integration of host and pathogen, as provided by the VUIR. Finally, to support the program and its discoveries, we propose an organizational structure of multidisciplinary content-area experts and dedicated support staff. Along with coordinating daily activities and assuring seamless dissemination of data/specimens, this Administrative Core (AdCore) will champion educational activities and additional pilot projects that build upon the resource. In sum, the VUIR stands to generate actionable discoveries from the human and microbial diversity of UTIs—not in spite of it. PROJECT NARRATIVE - OVERALL Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are not only a common urologic ailment, but one of the most widespread medical conditions facing women, men and children around the globe. In order for clinicians to better manage UTIs—and scientists to understand them more deeply—our clinical viewpoint must become personalized, as we study in tandem the afflicted patients and offending pathogens. To these ends, the Vanderbilt Urologic Infection Repository will provide a first-in-kind resource for the biomedical community, creating a massive network of patient-level clinical data and banked microbial strains from patients with real-world infections.","The Vanderbilt Urologic Infection Repository, a Resource for Personalized Clinical Discovery",9913350,P20DK123967,"['Acinetobacter baumannii', 'Advisory Committees', 'Antimicrobial susceptibility', 'Area', 'Bacteriuria', 'Benign', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Communities', 'Community Outreach', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Education and Outreach', 'Educational Activities', 'Educational workshop', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Escherichia coli', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genitourinary System Infection', 'Genitourinary system', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Genus staphylococcus', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Informatics', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Light', 'Link', 'Location', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Medical Informatics', 'Medical Records', 'Microbe', 'Microbiology', 'Molecular', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Published Comment', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Source', 'Specimen', 'Sum', 'Symptoms', 'Taxonomy', 'Technology', 'Urinary tract infection', 'Urine', 'Urologic Diseases', 'Urology', 'Uropathogen', 'Virulence Factors', 'Woman', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomedical resource', 'career development', 'clinical database', 'clinical infrastructure', 'clinical sequencing', 'combat', 'data mining', 'data space', 'data warehouse', 'demographics', 'functional genomics', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'health data', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'interest', 'member', 'men', 'microbial', 'microbial genome', 'microbiome', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'operation', 'organizational structure', 'outcome forecast', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic microbe', 'personalized care', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'programs', 'repository', 'symptomatology', 'tool', 'translational impact', 'urinary', 'urologic', 'whole genome', 'young woman']",NIDDK,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,P20,2019,340000,-0.01210367577274502
"Utility of Predictive Systems to identify Inpatient Diagnostic Errors: The UPSIDE Study PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  While much research has been conducted on patient safety since the Institute of Medicine published “To Err is Human” in 2000, there is a comparative dearth of research on diagnostic errors in the hospital setting. The broad, long-term objectives of the proposed research is to better understand the incidence, causes, and risk factors for diagnostic errors in the inpatient setting. This work will provide foundational research for the development of interventions to reduce these errors, including predictive tools, targets for intervention, and a methodology for outcome assessment in future trials of interventions. To achieve this overall goal, we will carry out the following specific aims: 1) To determine the incidence of diagnostic errors among patients who die in hospital or are transferred to the ICU two days or more after admission to a general medicine service through a structured, standardized adjudication process of patient records, 2) To combine adjudication data with data from Vizient to determine which specific factors contribute to risks for diagnostic errors, and to use risk estimates to calculate incidence and impact of factors contributing to those errors, and 3)To create machine- learning models that can be used to retrospectively identify patients in whom a diagnostic error was likely to have taken place. The research will involve a retrospective evaluation of 2000 patients admitted to general medicine units at 20 US hospitals participating in a national research collaborative and which also contribute data to a benchmarking and purchasing organization (Vizient). Using the Safer-Diagnosis (Safer-Dx) and Diagnostic Error Evaluation and Research (DEER) taxonomy tools, both adapted for the inpatient setting, adjudicators will review electronic medical record data and determine the presence or absence of diagnostic errors using a rigorous training and continuous review process to ensure reliability across sites, adjudicators, and time. Standard modelling techniques will be used to understand the population-attributable risk of each of the DEER process failure points to diagnostic error as well as the contributions of several patient, provider, and system-level risk factors. Lastly, advanced machine-learning methods will be used to create models that can identify patients in whom diagnostic error occurred, with superior performance to standard approaches such as logistic regression. Together, these approaches will provide a broad and representative picture of the incidence of diagnostic errors among hospitalized patients who have suffered harm, develop models of patient and system-based factors that make a diagnostic error more or less likely, and build advanced, efficient, and scalable tools needed to support future surveillance and improvement programs for a variety of institutions. This research will establish a foundation from which healthcare systems can assess and achieve excellence in diagnosis in the inpatient setting. PROJECT NARRATIVE  This study seeks to accurately define the incidence of diagnostic errors among patients suffering serious inpatient events in a large network of US hospitals. Without a reliable method for determining the presence of diagnostic errors across many organizations, it is not otherwise possible to understand the incidence, impact, predictors, and underlying causes of these errors, to create and optimize future solutions to reduce diagnostic errors, to directly test the effects of these solutions, or to teach physicians how to avoid diagnostic pitfalls in the future. Our study addresses these issues while being responsive to the RFA’s goals of developing robust estimates of incidence and risk and using approaches that leverage electronic data, and our approach represents a novel application of rigorous outcome adjudication and advanced modeling techniques to the problem of inpatient diagnostic errors.",Utility of Predictive Systems to identify Inpatient Diagnostic Errors: The UPSIDE Study,9938134,R01HS027369,[' '],AHRQ,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2019,497444,-0.00780900438649773
"Stanford Advanced Wound Care Center Clinical Research Unit SUMMARY   Approximately  25%  of  diabetic  patients  experience  diabetic  foot  ulcers  (DFUs).  This  is  a  significant  clinical  problem since there are no effective biomarkers for predicting outcomes, no drug candidates that have recently  been  FDA-­approved  and  no  therapies  that  are  widely  effective  in  treatment.  The  Stanford  Advanced  Wound  Care  Center  (AWCC)  was  opened  in  2014  with  the  sole  purpose  of  facilitating  clinical  trials,  conducting  translational  research  and  providing  care  for  patients  with  chronic  wounds.  Stanford  AWCC  receives  patients  from the University Healthcare Alliance, which spans 60 clinics and 2.5 million people in the San Francisco Bay  Area.  Despite  being  in  a  relatively  prosperous  area,  Stanford  AWCC  treats  patients  from  diverse  socio-­ demographics. In the past two years, Stanford has treated 6000 patients with wounds, of whom 705 had DFUs.  50%  of  the  patients  enroll  in  clinical  trials  and  there  is  a  very  low  dropout  rate  (less  than  5%).  Under  Dr.  Geoffrey  Gurtner’s  leadership,  the  Stanford  AWCC  has  conducted  over  25  clinical  trials,  where  we  have  measured biomarkers and tested novel therapeutic interventions (Aim 1).     It is known that wound healing trials experience a significantly higher failure rate in Phase III studies compared  to  any  other  drug  trial.  This  is  primarily  due  to  the  poorly  controlled  procedural  component  of  wound  care.  At  Stanford,  we  address  these  issues  by  (i)  practicing  a  multi-­disciplinary  approach  overseen  by  physicians,  (ii)  standardizing  the  measuring  and  reporting  of  healing  outcomes,  (iii)  emphasizing  rigorous  and  efficient  operational  processes  during  clinical  trial  conduct  and  (iv)  collaborating  with  other  major  academic  centers  (Aim  2).  Looking  forward,  it  is  critical  to  optimize  patient  engagement  during  their  treatment  regimens  and  inculcate  a  shared  decision-­making  process.  Clinical  studies  in  medical  fields  such  as  cancer  have  indicated  that  such  patient-­centered  approaches  lead  to  the  adherence  of  treatment  regimens  and  clinical  trials.  This  is  currently  lacking  in  with  patients  with  DFUs.  With  Dr.  Arden  Morris’s  expertise,  the  Stanford  AWCC  practices  new approaches that centers around the patient, with a focus on improvement in their quality of life (Aim 3).     Dr.  Nigam  Shah,  the  Director  of  Bioinformatics  at  Spectrum,  Stanford’s  Clinical  and  Translational  Sciences  Award  has  worked  with  the  Stanford  AWCC  and  developed  computational  tools  that  predict  wound  healing  outcomes. These models have been developed using data from the Healogics database, the country’s largest  network  of  wound  care  clinics  and  a  Stanford  AWCC  operational  partner.  Dr.  Shah  also  has  expertise  in  analyzing electronic health records of patients from large databases such as TRUVEN and OPTUM, which will  allow  for  the  determination  of  unique  biomarkers  for  wound  healing  through  computational  modeling.  These  models can be executed across the entire Diabetic Foot Consortium (Aim 4).    Narrative    The  Stanford  Advanced  Wound  Care  Center  (AWCC)  was  opened  in  October  2014  to  fill  both  a  clinical  and  academic  need  by  integrating  clinical  trials  and  research  in  wound  care.  Since  its  launch,  the  number  of  patients  with  DFUs  at  Stanford  AWCC  has  doubled  in  each  of  the  past  two  years  and  the  unit  has  been  financially  successful,  ensuring  its  long-­term  viability.  Here,  we  demonstrate  the  ability  of  Stanford  AWCC  to  serve  as  a  Clinical  Research  Unit  (CRU)  by  displaying  access  to  patients  with  DFUs  from  a  wide  sociodemographic, emphasizing quality of clinical research conducted, demonstrating ways of patient-­centered

"Employing the gut microbiome to accelerate effective initiation of rheumatoid arthritis therapy Title: Employing the gut microbiome to accelerate effective initiation of rheumatoid arthritis therapy ABSTRACT Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a complex, multifactorial, autoimmune disorder that affects ~1% of the worldwide population (~2 million adults in the US alone). It is characterized by chronic synovitis that, when left untreated, can result in irreversible joint destruction and deformity, leading to increased morbidity and all-cause mortality. The last three decades have witnessed impressive advances in the understanding of disease pathogenesis and therapeutic outcomes. In fact, the use of methotrexate first, and the subsequent incorporation of anti-TNF (TNFi) and other “biologics” have led to substantial improvements in RA clinical outcomes, enhancing the quality of life for millions of patients with inflammatory arthritis. Despite this progress, however, a significant question still remains unanswered: why do over 50% of RA patients with moderate to severe arthritis fail to respond appropriately to these agents? Pharmacomicrobiomics – an emerging field of study that investigates the effect of variations within the human gut microbiome on drugs – promises to overcome these barriers and facilitate precision medicine approaches in autoimmune disease.  Methotrexate (MTX), a dihydrofolate (DHF) reductase inhibitor, remains the anchor drug for the treatment of RA and is used widely throughout the world. While quite effective, oral MTX achieves significant results in less than 50% of patients and remission in only a quarter of them. It is well established that the inter-individual bioavailability of MTX is extremely variable, ranging from 10 to 80%. The reasons for this are presumably multifactorial. However, the intestinal microbiome and its enzymatic machinery are likely to play a significant role, based on our Preliminary Results and given that animals treated with antibiotics or kept under germ-free conditions show significant differences in MTX metabolism relative to control animals.  Our multidisciplinary team composed of rheumatologists, bioinformaticians, pharmacologists and microbiome researchers will address our overarching goal to study: a) if baseline intestinal microbiome, its genes, and associated metabolites can be used to predict the immunomodulatory responses to MTX in treatment-naïve, new-onset RA (NORA) patients; and b) if the gut microbiomes of MTX non-responders can be manipulated to modulate MTX metabolism and bioavailability. We believe that the results of our highly translational, innovative studies will directly influence therapeutic approaches for the treatment of RA and offer a more personalized approach in which the clinical efficacy response would be predicted early (and potentially improved by microbiome-targeted adjuvant therapies) in any given patient about to initiate MTX, limiting or preventing disease progression and ultimately avoiding wasteful health expenditures (estimated as ~$50,000/year/patient in direct costs). Importantly, we anticipate that our studies will establish generalizable approaches in rheumatology and autoimmunity that could be more broadly applied to the study and clinical maximization of other similar small molecules (e.g., JAK inhibitors) or even biologic agents (e.g., anti-TNF mAbs). NARRATIVE Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, autoimmune disease characterized by widespread musculoskeletal inflammation affecting 1% of the world’s population (including ~2 million adults in the US alone). While the use of methotrexate (MTX) has significantly improved the lives of many people with RA, over 50% of patients do not respond adequately to this drug. Successful completion of our proposed studies will provide key insights into the effects of the gut bacteria on MTX and the implications for prediction of clinical response, ultimately identifying patients that are either likely to improve even before this treatment is prescribed, or those that would benefit from microbiome-targeted interventions to improve MTX absorption and efficacy.",Employing the gut microbiome to accelerate effective initiation of rheumatoid arthritis therapy,9826831,R01AR074500,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adjuvant Therapy', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Animals', 'Antibiotics', 'Arthritis', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmunity', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Availability', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Products', 'Biological Response Modifier Therapy', 'Biometry', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Control Animal', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Deformity', 'Diagnosis', 'Dihydrofolate Reductase Inhibitor', 'Direct Costs', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease remission', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Engraftment', 'Excess Mortality', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genotype', 'Germ-Free', 'Goals', 'Health Expenditures', 'Human', 'Human Microbiome', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory Arthritis', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Metabolism', 'Metagenomics', 'Methotrexate', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Monoclonal Antibodies', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mus', 'Musculoskeletal', 'National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Rheumatology', 'Role', 'Series', 'Structural Genes', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Synovitis', 'TNF gene', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Transplantation', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'absorption', 'arthritis therapy', 'bacterial community', 'base', 'biomarker identification', 'chronic autoimmune disease', 'clinical efficacy', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'disability', 'drug disposition', 'drug metabolism', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'field study', 'follow-up', 'germ free condition', 'gut bacteria', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'immunoregulation', 'improved', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'insight', 'inter-individual variation', 'joint destruction', 'joint injury', 'metabolomics', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiome components', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple omics', 'novel', 'personalized approach', 'personalized medicine', 'polyglutamates', 'pre-clinical', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'rRNA Genes', 'recruit', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'rheumatologist', 'sample collection', 'small molecule', 'therapy outcome']",NIAMS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2019,734366,0.010796378923364306
"Multi-level modeling to inform interventions for control of multidrug-resistant organisms within healthcare networks Project Summary/Abstract Multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs), particularly carbapenem-resistant organisms (CROs), are a major cause of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs). Though studies have found multiple interventions addressing MDRO colonization and transmission to be effective at reducing HAIs, implementation has lagged due to questions regarding the most efficacious combination of interventions. As healthcare facilities (e.g., hospitals, long-term care facilities, or outpatient surgical centers and clinics) are part of an interconnected healthcare network, evaluation of an intervention’s impact on transmission and infection must consider the dynamics across the healthcare system. To address remaining knowledge gaps regarding the most effective combinations of intervention strategies, we will build a multi-level model that spans from individual patients to regionally interconnected healthcare facilities. The resulting framework will provide hospital administrators and infection control experts with tools for quantifying individual patient risk factors for colonization and infection and for comparing the potential effectiveness of interventions to control HAIs. The aims of the project are: (1) to develop models to estimate the underlying prevalence and incidence of CROs and predict which patients are at highest risk for colonization and infection with CROs using clinical samples collected during the normal course of care; (2) to utilize hospital-level models to quantify the combinatorial relationship between, and marginal impact of, additional interventions to reduce HAIs; and (3) to build a regional model of a healthcare system to examine the effectiveness of interventions across institutions. Models will start with the patient at the center, utilizing the rich covariate data stored in electronic medical records to develop prediction models based on advanced machine learning. These prediction models will be translatable tools that can be directly incorporated into clinical care to assist clinicians in preventing HAIs. In addition, they will form the foundation of hospital-level models that will allow for detailed examinations of the effectiveness of different combinations of interventions. Hospital-level models will then be embedded in a network of healthcare facilities that accounts for the differing incentives faced by geographically dispersed facilities with variable demographic populations. These models will directly inform CDC guidelines about MDRO prevention and aid clinicians in reducing the risk of HAIs. Project Narrative The models developed through this proposal will improve understanding of how biological factors associated with the transmission of multidrug-resistant organisms (MDRO) impact interventions to reduce hospital-associated infections (HAIs). This will aid predictions of patients’ risk for colonization and infection, as well as improve understanding of how interventions can most effectively be combined to reduce the likelihood that patients will suffer from these high-consequence pathogens.",Multi-level modeling to inform interventions for control of multidrug-resistant organisms within healthcare networks,9730300,U01CK000536,[' '],NCEZID,"CENTER/ DISEASE DYNAMICS, ECONOM/POLICY",U01,2019,646905,-0.011083845331110502
"Identification of postoperative infections using electronic health record and administrative claims data Project Summary/Abstract Surgical operations can put patients at high risk of infections and other complications. However, studies have shown that half or more of surgical infections are discovered after hospital discharge. The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS NSQIP) began in 2005 with the goal of assisting hospitals with identifying and preventing surgical complications. Each participating ACS NSQIP hospital assigns a surgical clinical nurse reviewer to collect preoperative through 30-day postoperative data on a sample of surgical patients in order to risk adjust postoperative complications so that they can be compared across participating hospitals. Although at large volume hospitals these samples might represent only 10-15% of all surgical cases, these data are considered to be the current gold standard for accurate identification and comparison of postoperative complications. Unfortunately, chart review is time-consuming and costly and, as a result, cannot be scaled up easily to cover all surgical patients. The goal of this project is to learn from the ACS NSQIP data in order to develop electronic algorithms for identifying postoperative infections that can be scaled up easily and inexpensively. Development of such algorithms will also permit evaluation of interventions that intend to impact large populations of patients at risk of postoperative infections. Considering the large number of available binary classification algorithms for data mining that are easy to implement, it is paramount to consider new methods for identifying surgical infections electronically. Furthermore, postoperative infections are rare, and occur in about 7% of operated patients; therefore, it is difficult to identify models that classify infections well. Sampling techniques are commonly used in conjunction with classification models in order to improve sensitivity and positive predictive value. We believe that modern statistical techniques for classification combined with strategic sampling, and the use of ICD9 and ICD10 codes and pharmacy data, will improve upon existing methods for electronically identifying postoperative infections. The aims of this proposal are (1a) to develop algorithms for identifying surgical infections using machine learning techniques, (1b) to develop models for specific types of postoperative infections collected in the ACS NSQIP data separately, which include SSI, urinary tract infection, pneumonia and sepsis and (2) to validate these models in prospective ACS NSQIP data. Project Narrative In this application, we propose to use outcomes data from the University of Colorado American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program combined with electronic health record and administrative claims data in order to develop models for identifying postoperative infections electronically. These infections are currently identified through manual chart review, and it is our hope that successful development of these models could replace costly, time-consuming manual chart review. We will use machine learning and sampling techniques to achieve better performance than models previously reported in the literature.",Identification of postoperative infections using electronic health record and administrative claims data,9681394,R03HS026019,[' '],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R03,2019,51181,0.01404661260482446
"SUpPress SSI - Single Use Negative Pressure Wound Therapy (NPWT) to Reduce Surgical Site Infections SUpPress SSI – Single Use Negative Pressure Wound Therapy (NPWT) to Reduce Surgical Site Infections The proposed work Specific Aim 1 is to evaluate the effect of single-use NPWT on SSI rates after C- section, abdominal hysterectomy, and colon procedures in at risk patients. To address this aim, we will conduct a multicenter, stepped-wedge, quasi-experimental trial evaluating use of the PrevenaTM with 125 mm Hg negative pressure for 7 days among obese (BMI >30) and/or diabetic patients undergoing the procedures of interest. This is an effectiveness trial evaluating the effect of single-use NPWT on SSI rates among high-risk patients using a randomized stepped wedge design. Six Epicenter hospitals will be included: University of Illinois Hospital (UIH), University of Iowa Hospital and Clinics (UIHC), University of Utah Hospital (UUH), Emory University Hospital Midtown (EUHM), Grady Memorial Hospital (GMH), and University of Maryland Medical Center (UMMC). If proposed improvement in SSI rates are demonstrated this will provide more clear guidance for the use of the NPWT. Specific Aim 2 is to investigate the patients’ experience of using the NPWT. A sub-set of patients will be surveyed to assess their knowledge of post-operative care, to identify complications associated with NPWT use, and to learn how patients evaluated the device’s ease of use, ease of removal, and comfort. This will identify barriers to implementation. Specific Aim 3 is to assess whether real-time decision support through machine-learning modeling can help surgeons identify patients at high risk of SSI who could benefit from NWPT or other post-surgical preventive measures. This will evaluate whether boosted tree modeling techniques can be used “at the bedside” via electronic medical record data feeds to tailor post-operative care and preventive care for specific patients. Participating hospitals will be surveyed to assess their readiness to submit data to the datamart. We will sequentially establish the data feed for each hospital. From the datamart a model will be built for SSIs that could be prevented by the NPWT. In this way, it will refine the predictive value of the model for this specific intervention. The use of this modeling will help provide more personalized care plans for patients at greatest risk of SSI. PROJECT NARRATIVE Our goal is to provide data that will give surgeons and hospitals clear recommendations on the use of NPWT for Cesarean section, abdominal hysterectomy and colon surgeries in patients with diabetes and/or obesity. We also want to understand the patient experience with the dressing so that we can provide information that will enable clinicians to remove barriers to NPWT use. Additionally, we are seeking to use automated electronic medical record decision support to identify patients that will benefit most from the NPWT.",SUpPress SSI - Single Use Negative Pressure Wound Therapy (NPWT) to Reduce Surgical Site Infections,9755271,U01CK000557,[' '],NCEZID,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,U01,2019,800379,0.004125257311025407
"VERITY: Value and Evidence in Rheumatology using bioInformaTics, and advanced analYtics PROJECT ABSTRACT  Pediatric and adult rheumatic and musculoskeletal (MSK) diseases challenge the clinical researcher: they affect the population across the lifespan, impact a broad range of patient-centered outcomes, are rarely cured, and often have multiple possible treatment strategies. If properly addressed, these factors present tremendous opportunities for improving patient care and outcomes of patients. The overarching goal of the Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH) CCCR is to facilitate advancements in the methodologic sciences supporting clinical research within the NIAMS pediatric and adult rheumatic and musculoskeletal (MSK) disease missions.  VERITY is organized around central scientific themes that can be applied to multiple rheumatic and MSK diseases. The Cores address the following cross-cutting areas: 1) including patients in clinical trial design, outcome selection, result interpretation, and dissemination; 2) integrating behavioral economics to enhance benefits of known interventions, i.e., adherence to medications, engagement in physical activity and weight loss; 3) extracting maximum information content from big data; 4) using smart technologies (mobile health) to advance clinical research; and 5) disseminating knowledge and mentoring of local and national rheumatic and MSK disease clinical researchers through distributed learning models. These scientific themes will be approached through several Cores described in the following Specific Aims. 1. To strategically direct, supervise, and provide financial accountability to VERITY and to train a broad group of local and national investigators for patient-oriented clinical research in pediatric and adult rheumatic and MSK diseases. (Administrative Core) 2. To develop and implement state of the art methods in innovative trials and longitudinal comparative effectiveness studies for rheumatic and MSK disease research. (Methodology Core) 3. To support bioinformatic approaches to enhance utilization of large databases for phenotyping relevant patients, and implementing biomarker, electronic medical record, and comparative effectiveness analyses. (Bioinformatics Resource Core) PROJECT NARRATIVE  The BWH CCCR, or “VERITY” (Value and Evidence in Rheumatology using bioInformaTics, and advanced analYtics) Cores will implement novel analytic methods and outcome measures that address existing and emerging needs in clinical research for preventing and treating rheumatic and musculoskeletal disorders. The pressing clinical research needs addressed by VERITY include: a) integration of patients’ point of view (patient-centeredness); b) facilitation of innovative trials; c) incorporation of state of the art comparative effectiveness research methods to determine optimal treatments; d) development and testing of innovative behavioral interventions; and e) identification of relevant phenotypes and sub-phenotypes of common and uncommon rheumatic and MSK diseases using electronic medical records (EMRs), registries, cohorts and insurance claims.","VERITY: Value and Evidence in Rheumatology using bioInformaTics, and advanced analYtics",9768189,P30AR072577,"['ARHGEF5 gene', 'Accountability', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Americas', 'Area', 'Arthritis', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Biosensor', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Communities', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Evolution', 'Faculty', 'Feeds', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Harvest', 'Health Technology', 'Hospitals', 'Infrastructure', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Longevity', 'Lupus', 'Measurable', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Musculoskeletal Diseases', 'National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Participant', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psoriasis', 'Psoriatic Arthritis', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rheumatism', 'Rheumatology', 'Science', 'Seeds', 'Services', 'Societies', 'Supervision', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Woman', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'behavioral economics', 'bioinformatics resource', 'care outcomes', 'clinical care', 'clinical research site', 'cohort', 'comparative effectiveness', 'design', 'distributed data', 'effectiveness research', 'feeding', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insurance claims', 'mHealth', 'medical schools', 'multidimensional data', 'next generation', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'patient engagement', 'patient oriented', 'prevent', 'programs', 'skills', 'tool', 'translational study', 'treatment strategy']",NIAMS,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,P30,2019,894906,-0.005333742539230938
"Comparative Effectiveness of Treat-To-Target Approach versus Routine Care in Management of Gout Gout is a highly prevalent, painful inflammatory arthritis, caused by crystallization of uric acid in joint tissues. Gout flares cause impaired quality of life and physical function, leading to lost work days, disability, high healthcare costs. Patients with gout are also known to be at an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVD), kidney disease, and mortality. Previous studies suggest a potential beneficial effect of urate-lowering therapy on the risk of CVD and renal function. Over the past decade, the American College of Rheumatology and the European League Against Rheumatism recommend a treat-to-target (TTT) approach that lowers serum uric acid (SUA) level below 6 mg/dl to reduce acute gout attacks, based on the upper limit of water solubility of uric acid under normal physiologic circumstances. However, the 2016 American College of Physicians (ACP)’ guidelines for gout management recommend use of urate-lowering therapy but support a ‘treat-to-avoid symptoms’ strategy without monitoring SUA rather than the TTT strategy because of ‘inconclusive’ evidence in the literature. Such discrepancies in treatment guidelines from various societies urge the need for comparative effectiveness research of the treatment strategies for gout.  Rigorous epidemiologic studies utilizing high-quality observational data from electronic health records (EHR) or insurance claims databases can be an important tool for comparative effectiveness research. The primary objective of this 3-year proposal is to provide high-quality, timely evidence on the comparative effectiveness of two different treatment strategies, TTT versus usual care, for management of gout. We will pursue this objective by utilizing the linked Partners’ EHR-Medicare database (2007-2016); this linked database includes all patients aged ≥65 years enrolled in Medicare Parts A/B/D who had ≥1 encounter at one of the Partners Healthcare hospitals. We will have longitudinal, clinically important data on patients’ demographics, body mass index, visit notes, laboratory results including SUA and serum creatinine, as well as all Medicare claims for inpatient and outpatient visits, procedures, and prescription drugs. The two specific aims of this 3-year proposal are: 1) to examine the effect of TTT strategy on the risk of gout flares versus usual care and 2) to assess the effect of TTT strategy on the risk of kidney disease and CVD versus usual care.  Given the substantial prevalence of gout, the suboptimal management of gout and lack of comparative trial of different treatment strategies, this proposed study will make an immediate, important contribution to the management of gout in clinical practice. This work will not only investigate the effects of different treatment strategies on gout flares but also on common comorbidities in patients with gout such as kidney and CVD. Furthermore, this proposed study will advance understanding of how to improve ascertainment of dynamic outcomes and control for time-varying confounding by utilizing sophisticated and innovative epidemiologic as well as bioinformatics methods in a large EHR database linked with Medicare claims. Narrative Gout is a common, painful inflammatory arthritis caused by crystallization of uric acid in joint tissues. Xanthine oxidase inhibitors, allopurinol and febuxostat, are the mainstay of urate-lowering treatment for gout. While rheumatology societies recommend a treat-to-target (TTT) approach that lowers serum uric acid below 6 mg/dl to reduce acute gout attacks, there is currently no clinical data whether TTT approach is better than urate- lowering therapy but no regular monitoring of uric acid levels (i.e., usual care); therefore, this 3-year research proposal examines the comparative effectiveness of the two different treatment strategies, TTT versus usual care, for management of chronic gout in a real-world setting.",Comparative Effectiveness of Treat-To-Target Approach versus Routine Care in Management of Gout,9659038,R01AR073314,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Allopurinol', 'American', 'American College of Physicians', 'Bioinformatics', 'Body mass index', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Practice Guideline', 'Comorbidity', 'Coronary', 'Creatinine', 'Crystallization', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiology', 'European', 'Flare', 'Glomerular Filtration Rate', 'Gold', 'Gout', 'Guidelines', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Insurance', 'Healthcare', 'Heart failure', 'High Prevalence', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hypertension', 'Hyperuricemia', 'Impairment', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Arthritis', 'Inpatients', 'Joints', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Medical Societies', 'Medicare', 'Medicare Part A', 'Medicare claim', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Physical Function', 'Physiological', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Prognostic Factor', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Renal function', 'Research Proposals', 'Rheumatism', 'Rheumatology', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Serum', 'Societies', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stroke', 'Symptoms', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Urate', 'Uric Acid', 'Visit', 'Work', 'active comparator', 'base', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'clinical practice', 'college', 'comparative effectiveness', 'comparative trial', 'cost', 'demographics', 'design', 'disability', 'drug efficacy', 'effectiveness research', 'efficacy study', 'electronic data', 'epidemiology study', 'febuxostat', 'human old age (65+)', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insurance claims', 'mortality', 'population based', 'rheumatologist', 'routine care', 'tool', 'treatment as usual', 'treatment guidelines', 'treatment strategy', 'water solubility', 'xanthine oxidase inhibitor']",NIAMS,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2019,492573,-0.04234489588868796
"Learning-Based Approach for Personalized Craniomaxillofacial Surgical Planning Abstract: Our main clinical objective for this project is to provide personalized precision care to patients with craniomaxillofacial (CMF) deformities by significantly improving the surgical planning method. CMF deformities involve congenital and acquired deformities of the jaws and face. A large number of patients in the US and around the world suffer from CMF deformities. The basic principles of CMF surgery involve the restoration of deformed CMF structures back to normal anatomy and functions with osteotomy, autologous, bone grafts, or vascularized free flaps. The success of CMF surgery depends on not only the technical aspects of the operation, but also, to a large extent, the precise formulation of a surgical plan. However, CMF surgical planning is extremely challenging due to the complex nature of CMF anatomy and deformity. During a routine CMF surgical planning, a surgeon first acquires a three-dimensional (3D) model of the patient's skull. He then performs 3D cephalometric analysis to quantify the deformity. Finally, the surgery is simulated by virtually cutting the 3D model into multiple bony segments. The surgeon then tries his best to move and rotate each segment individually to a desired position within the normal range of cephalometric values (the current standard of care). This is problematic as “normal” cephalometric values are the averageness of normal population, in which each value has a mean and a standard deviation. Due to the variation within the normal values, the surgeon must often guess what the exact value the patient's cephalometric measurement should be corrected to. In addition, cephalometry is a group of only linear and angular measurements, which certainly cannot represent the complex nature of human CMF structures. Therefore, surgical outcomes are often subjective and heavily dependent on the surgeons' experience and artistic talent. Because each human face is different, the average “normal values” cannot represent the complex morphology of each individual face. To this end, we hypothesize that if a surgeon can foresee what the normal CMF shape of the patient should be, the surgical plan will be objective and personalized. Therefore, in this project, we propose developing and validating a new surgical planning method of using patient-specific and anatomically-correct reference models. The feasibility of our approach has already been proven by our preliminary studies. The results of this project will significantly improve the quality of patient care by developing personalized and precise surgical plans for CMF surgery objectively. The results will be especially beneficial to patients with jaw deformities, syndromic and non-syndromic craniofacial deformities, trauma, and CMF cancer. In the future, our approach can also be used to design and print 3D patient-specific resorbable bone implants with tissue engineering capability for bone regeneration. Project Narrative:  The current standard of care of making treatment plan for patients with craniomaxillofacial (CMF)  deformities is cephalometric analysis, including a group of linear and angular measurements, which  cannot represent the complex morphology of human CMF facial structures.  We propose to develop and validate an innovative shape-based surgical planning method of using  patient-specific and anatomically-correct reference models, for replacing the current subjective  cephalometric method.  The results of this project will significantly improve the quality of patient care by developing  personalized and precise surgical plans for CMF surgery objectively, which is especially beneficial  to the patients with jaw deformities, syndromic and non-syndromic deformities, trauma, and CMF cancer.",Learning-Based Approach for Personalized Craniomaxillofacial Surgical Planning,9720682,R01DE027251,"['3-Dimensional', '3D Print', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Autologous', 'Back', 'Bilateral', 'Blood Vessels', 'Bone Regeneration', 'Bone Tissue', 'Bone Transplantation', 'Cephalometry', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computer Assisted', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Deformity', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Ensure', 'Face', 'Formulation', 'Future', 'Head', 'Human', 'Human Characteristics', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Jaw', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Motivation', 'Nature', 'Normal Range', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Orthodontics', 'Osteotomy', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Quality of Care', 'Research', 'Running', 'Shapes', 'Structure', 'Surgeon', 'Surgical Flaps', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Talents', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissue Engineering', 'Tissue Model', 'Trauma', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'bone', 'cone-beam computed tomography', 'craniofacial', 'craniomaxillofacial', 'cranium', 'deep learning', 'design', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'knowledge base', 'novel', 'operation', 'personalized approach', 'personalized care', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'psychologic', 'restoration', 'simulation', 'skull base', 'soft tissue', 'standard of care', 'success', 'surgery outcome', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'treatment planning', 'two-dimensional', 'usability', 'user-friendly', 'virtual']",NIDCR,METHODIST HOSPITAL RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2019,585464,0.005372292771257844
"Network for Cardiothoracic Surgical Investigations in Cardiovascular Medicine Project Summary Cardiac surgery has been a highly innovative field of medicine. The introduction of major innovations, and ongoing incremental change in existing ones, have extended survival and improved quality of life for many patients suffering from cardiac disease. A rapid pace of innovation requires a rigorous infrastructure for clinical evaluation that provides timely assessments of the value of new and modified treatments. The Cardiothoracic Surgical Trials Network (CTSN) was created to provide a rigorous evidence base tor the surgical treatment of cardiothoracic disease. The International Center for Health Outcomes and Innovation Research (InCHOIR) enthusiastically embraces the opportunity to continue to work in partnership with clinical investigators and the NIH as the CTSN DCC. The Network has developed a rich research agenda for the renewal that includes trials of novel neuroprotective agents, long-term antithrombotic strategies, new regenerative medicine therapies, and surgical approaches to valvular disease, heart failure and atrial fibrillation. Given our long-standing interest and experience in the design and analysis of cardiac surgery multicenter studies, we are in a strong position to serve as the coordinating center for this vital clinical research effort. In particular, we will provide leadership in designing novel trials that optimize sample size, include patient- centered as well as clinical endpoints, and collect data from a variety of sources, including electronic data capture systems, mobile apps and wearable sensors, registries and electronic health records. We have a strong track record of obtaining efficient regulatory approval for our trials from the FDA and Health Canada, training and monitoring sites nationally and internationally, ensuring robust enrollment and retention, data management and quality assurance, data sharing, and overall administrative coordination. We have the infrastructure to expand our trials to include mechanistic studies that use biospecimens collected and managed through the CTSN biorepository. Finally, the DCC plays an important role in the analysis, interpretation and dissemination of research findings. We will continue to support the process of publishing in high-impact journals that should lead to revision of practice guidelines and to surgical practice itself. This goal should be further optimized by incorporating Implementation Science approaches into Network trials, which should decrease the well-recognized gap between publication of trial results and adoption of findings into widespread practice. NARRATIVE Clinical trials are a critical step in translating discoveries into better treatments for people burdened by cardiac disorders. Such trials typically require cooperation and coordination among a broad range of investigators, patients, government agencies, and industry partners. The objective of the Cardiothoracic Surgical Trials Network (CTSN) is to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of clinical research through shared infrastructure for important trials that will advance therapy for patients suffering from cardiac disease.",Network for Cardiothoracic Surgical Investigations in Cardiovascular Medicine,9753639,U01HL088942,"['Address', 'Administrative Coordination', 'Adoption', 'Agreement', 'Ancillary Study', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Canada', 'Cardiac Surgery procedures', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Data Monitoring Committees', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Data Coordinating Center', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Event', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Government Agencies', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart failure', 'Industry', 'Information Technology', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Journals', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Link', 'Longterm Follow-up', 'Manuscripts', 'Mediation', 'Medicine', 'Monitor', 'Multicenter Studies', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neuroprotective Agents', 'Online Systems', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Practice Guidelines', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Regenerative Medicine', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Review Committee', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Sample Size', 'Secure', 'Serious Adverse Event', 'Site', 'Source', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'System', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visit', 'Work', 'adjudicate', 'adjudication', 'base', 'biobank', 'clinical infrastructure', 'clinical practice', 'clinical research site', 'data integrity', 'data management', 'data sharing', 'design', 'dissemination research', 'electronic data', 'electronic data capture system', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'implementation research', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'industry partner', 'innovation', 'interest', 'international center', 'meetings', 'mobile application', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient oriented', 'performance site', 'prospective', 'quality assurance', 'recruit', 'research clinical testing', 'research data dissemination', 'screening', 'tool', 'trial design', 'wearable device']",NHLBI,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,U01,2019,7220733,0.009599707395006967
"Improving Glycemic Management in Patients with Type 1 Diabetes Using a Context-aware Automated Insulin Delivery System Project Summary Automated insulin delivery (AID) systems offer substantial opportunities for helping people with type 1 diabetes (T1D) to improve glucose control and lower HbA1c. However, the AID has only shown a benefit during the nighttime when meals, exercise, and stress do not significantly challenge the AID. Furthermore, hypoglycemia (<70 mg/dL) remains a common occurrence in people with type 1 diabetes and continues to occur even in the setting of AID, particularly with exercise. Integrating context awareness into an AID has the potential to improve glycemic time in range (70-180 mg/dL) during the daytime and reduce and possibly eliminate hypoglycemia. Contextual information can include inferred food intake, insulin dosing, inferred exercise type and duration, as well as movement patterns. An AID can be designed to recognize contextual patterns that relate to poor glycemic responses to meals and hypoglycemia and then adjust insulin dosing in response to these patterns in advance and help mitigate these problems. In this grant, we will explore how contextual information may be used within an AID to help (1) avoid hypoglycemia and (2) reduce postprandial dysglycemia. We will first conduct a data gathering study whereby we will collect a rich data set from people with T1D who will use sensor augmented pump therapy to manage their glucose. Data will be collected from these 30 patients over 28 days; data will include multivariable contextual information including continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data, insulin data, food data, physical activity data (heart rate and accelerometry), as well as indoor/outdoor contextual movement patterns gathered using a novel beacon-based context-aware sensing system called MotioWear developed by our group in collaboration with our industry partner MotioSens. Next, we will utilize this contextual data set to construct a Bayesian glucose prediction algorithm. This will include a clustering algorithm that will group contextual sequences that are similar with each other and which lead to similar glycemic outcomes. This context-aware glucose prediction algorithm will be integrated into an adaptive, personalized, smartwatch-based context-aware AID (CA-AID) system. Contextual patterns that have a high likelihood of leading to hypoglycemia or postprandial dysglycemia will inform an insulin dosing aggressiveness factor to be adjusted for similar contextual sequences observed in the future (i.e. the CA-AID will reduce insulin for contextual sequences with high likelihood of hypoglycemia such as aerobic exercise). We expect that integrating context awareness into an AID will lead to significant improvements in time in target range during the day and will help reduce time in hypoglycemia. The CA-AID will be evaluated for safety in a small pilot study. We will then evaluate the CA-AID within a 6 week clinical study in 40 adults with type 1 diabetes on insulin pump therapy. Twenty will receive the CA-AID while the other 20 will receive a standard (non-context-aware) AID. The primary outcome measures of this study is the percent time in range. We hypothesize that the CA-AID will increase time in range by 10% as compared with a non-context aware AID. Project Narrative Diabetes is the leading cause of blindness, kidney failure, and non-traumatic amputations. While automated insulin delivery systems can help people with type 1 diabetes better manage their glucose levels during the night, improved glycemic control during the day has not been demonstrated and hypoglycemia continues to be a problem, especially during exercise. We propose to develop and evaluate in a clinical study a context-aware automated insulin delivery system that learns patterns of daily living, meal patterns, glucose patterns, insulin dosing patterns, and physical activity patterns that relate to dysglycemia and adapts the gains within the AID to improve postprandial time in target range (70-180 mg/dL) and reduce hypoglycemia.",Improving Glycemic Management in Patients with Type 1 Diabetes Using a Context-aware Automated Insulin Delivery System,9832864,R01DK122583,"['Accelerometer', 'Adult', 'Aerobic Exercise', 'Algorithms', 'Awareness', 'Beds', 'Behavior', 'Blindness', 'Calibration', 'Cellular Phone', 'Clinic', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Dose', 'Eating', 'Effectiveness', 'Engineering', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Food', 'Future', 'Glucose', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'Grant', 'Heart Rate', 'Home environment', 'Hyperglycemia', 'Hypoglycemia', 'Insulin', 'Insulin Infusion Systems', 'Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Kidney Failure', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Movement', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Outpatients', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Pilot Projects', 'Pump', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Restaurants', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Safety', 'Schedule', 'Stress', 'System', 'Tactile', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Wrist', 'arm', 'base', 'blood glucose regulation', 'cohort', 'design', 'expectation', 'fitbit', 'fitness', 'glucose monitor', 'glucose sensor', 'glycemic control', 'high risk', 'improved', 'industry partner', 'machine learning algorithm', 'novel', 'prediction algorithm', 'primary outcome', 'recruit', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'sensor', 'smart watch', 'two-arm study', 'usability', 'wearable device']",NIDDK,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,669616,-0.018868870128837915
"A Novel, Low-Cost Device to Guide Peripherally Inserted Central Catheter (PICC) Line Placement Abstract In the United States alone, more than three million peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) are placed each year to provide IV therapies, where navigation through the venous system is typically performed blind, or without navigation guidance. Improper PICC placement is relatively common, is costly, and has serious complications for critically-ill patients. Unfortunately, under blind placement 30-55% of PICC tips are not optimally placed on the first attempt and require repositioning, which has an average direct cost of $223 per patient and often necessitates the removal and reinsertion of the catheter line that carries a 4-6% risk of pneumothorax. Moreover, approximately 17% of these improperly positioned PICCs are placed into the right atrium, which is associated with a multitude of life-threatening complications. Improper placement of PICCs also often requires referral to an interventional radiologist for fluoroscopic-guided central line placement, which is expensive ($1,000) and requires more radiation exposure for the patient. Not surprisingly, over half of all PICCs are administered to patients over the age of 60. Therefore, safe and accurate PICC placement is critical for providing high-quality care to older Americans. Despite serious adverse events associated with blind placement of PICC lines, current vascular access systems have not been widely adopted. The Teleflex ARROW® G4 VPS and the Bard Sherlock 3CG® TCS are PICC guidance systems that employ ECG for positioning the PICC tip into the correct location: the region that includes the lower superior vena cava (SVC) and cavoatrial junction (CAJ). While these procedures often limit the need for a confirmatory X-ray, they have poor and variable successful placement rates (44-84%), are 30-70% more expensive than standard PICCs, require skilled staff, and have significantly longer procedure times as compared to standard, blind PICC placement. Additionally, these guidance systems rely on the use of ECG, which is ineffective for patients with cardiac arrhythmias, a condition that affects approximately 16% of all patients requiring a PICC line. To address the need for accurate, safe, and cost- effective PICC placement, Piccolo Medical has developed the Smart PICC™ system, a point-of-care catheter system that uses unique hemodynamic signatures of different vascular regions for real-time vascular access guidance into the SVC/CAJ. The goals of this Phase II proposal are to validate the accuracy of the Piccolo Smart PICC™ for navigation and placement of a PICC tip into the SVC or CAJ for adult patients with and without cardiac arrhythmias. First, we will verify the sensitivity of the Smart PICC™ system algorithm to identify correct PICC placement in adult patients with both normal and altered cardiac rhythms (Aim 1). Second, we will compare the accuracy of the Smart PICC™ system to the most widely used catheter navigation system (BD’s Sherlock 3CG® TCS) in a head-to-head superiority study (Aim 2).The data obtained will support FDA 510(k) clearance and will allow us to commercialize the system within ~2.5 years of the funding of this proposal. Narrative Peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) are widely used to provide life-sustaining intravenous therapies, where navigation through the venous system is typically performed blind, or without navigation guidance. Commercially available PICC navigation systems can be effective, but have limitations that have impeded adoption into the clinic. We propose an inexpensive, easily operated catheter system for real-time vascular access guidance that addresses the limitations of current systems.","A Novel, Low-Cost Device to Guide Peripherally Inserted Central Catheter (PICC) Line Placement",9919215,R44AG060793,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Area Under Curve', 'Arrhythmia', 'Automobile Driving', 'Blinded', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiac', 'Catheters', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Direct Costs', 'Distal', 'EKG P Wave', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Excision', 'Family suidae', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Heart Atrium', 'Heart Valves', 'Infusion procedures', 'Intervention', 'Intravenous', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Location', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'Myocardial', 'Navigation System', 'Nurses', 'Patients', 'Perforation', 'Performance', 'Peripheral', 'Phase', 'Pneumothorax', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Quality of Care', 'Radiation exposure', 'Randomized', 'Real-Time Systems', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Right atrial structure', 'Risk', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Savings', 'Serious Adverse Event', 'Signal Transduction', 'Superior vena cava structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Thermodilution', 'Thoracic Radiography', 'Thrombus', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Venous system', 'Work', 'base', 'blind', 'cohort', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'follow-up', 'heart rhythm', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'novel', 'point of care', 'pre-clinical', 'radiologist', 'sensor']",NIA,"PICCOLO MEDICAL, INC.",R44,2019,915143,0.0167845646202491
"Quantitative Histomorphometric Risk Classifier (QuHbIC) in HPV + Oropharyngeal Carcinoma SUMMARY: In 2016, nearly 50,000 adults in the US were diagnosed with oral and pharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), and nearly 10,000 died from the disease. Human papillomavirus (HPV) is now recognized as the most common cause of oropharyngeal (OP) SCC in the US. Although concomitant chemo- and radio-therapy is the most common treatment choice in patients with advanced OP-SCC, they have substantial short- and long- term morbidity and result in increased health care costs in patients who are cured of their cancers. These patients live with sometimes disabling morbidity for many years post-treatment. For these reasons, it has been suggested that therapy in lower risk patients might be de-escalated. There is also a higher risk cohort of patients in whom treatment with chemo-radiation may be insufficient, often resulting in distant metastatic failure. As such, these patients may require intensified therapies to improve outcomes. This is an agonizing choice for patients and their doctors, however. While patients do not want to be sickened by morbid treatments, they are obviously concerned about having the best chance at cure. Unfortunately, there currently are no companion diagnostic tools to identify which HPV + OPSCC patients are at (1) low risk of recurrence such that they can be treated safely to high cure rates with de-escalated therapy; (2) higher risk of failure despite aggressive high dose chemoradiation in whom treatment intensification strategies should be studied.  Recently, we developed a quantitative histomorphometric based image risk classifier (QuHbIC) that uses computerized measurements of tumor morphology (e.g. nuclear orientation, texture, shape, architecture) from digital images of H&E-stained tumor sections to predict progression in HPV+ OP-SCC patients; the current version of QuHbIC has already been validated in >400 patients and found to be superior to clinical variables in outcome prediction. In this Academic-Industry Partnership we seek to further improve predictive accuracy of QuHbIC by incorporating new classes of image features relating to stromal morphology, density and patterns of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, and tumor cell multi-nucleation, features now recognized as promising markers of unfavorable prognosis in HPV+ OP-SCC. We also seek to create a pre-commercial QuHbIC companion diagnostic test that is ready for clinical use in risk stratification in p16+ OP-SCC. QuHbIC will be trained on >700 retrospectively identified HPV + OP-SCC whole tissue slide images with associated long term outcome data and then validated on 440 cases from randomized, controlled, multi-institutional RTOG 0129 and 0522 clinical trials.  This partnership will leverage long-standing collaborations in (1) computational histomorphometry from the Madabhushi group at Case Western Reserve University, (2) surgical pathology and oncology expertise in HPV+ OPSCC from Vanderbilt University and the Cleveland Clinic and, (3) Inspirata Inc., a cancer diagnostics company that will bring quality management systems and production software standards to establish QuHbIC as an Affordable Precision Medicine (APM) solution for oropharyngeal cancers. Project Relevance: In this project we propose to optimize and validate a quantitative histomorphometric-based image classifier (QuHbIC) to better risk stratify survival among p16+ (Human papillomavirus (HPV)-related) OPSCC patients. The successful validation of QuHbIC could pave the way for its adoption as an Affordable Precision Medicine (APM) companion diagnostic tool, allowing for the identification of patients for whom therapies could be either ""de-escalated”, left as standard, or even potentially escalated, depending on risk status.",Quantitative Histomorphometric Risk Classifier (QuHbIC) in HPV + Oropharyngeal Carcinoma,9663910,R01CA220581,"['Adoption', 'Adult', 'Aftercare', 'American Joint Committee on Cancer', 'Architecture', 'Biological', 'Cancer Diagnostics', 'Categories', 'Cervical', 'Cessation of life', 'Chromosome abnormality', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Cooperative Group', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Distant', 'Distant Metastasis', 'Dose', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Epithelium', 'Failure', 'Foundations', 'HPV-High Risk', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining Method', 'Human Papillomavirus', 'Image', 'Indolent', 'International Union Against Cancer', 'Left', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphology', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Mutation', 'Nuclear', 'Oropharyngeal', 'Oropharyngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Production', 'Progressive Disease', 'Publishing', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Therapy Oncology Group', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials', 'Recurrence', 'Recurrent disease', 'Regimen', 'Regulatory Pathway', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retrospective cohort', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Slide', 'Smoking', 'Specimen', 'Squamous cell carcinoma', 'Stage Grouping', 'Stains', 'Stratification', 'Surgical Oncology', 'Surgical Pathology', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Tissue Stains', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Treatment Failure', 'Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocytes', 'Universities', 'Uterus', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'chemoradiation', 'chemotherapy', 'cohort', 'commercialization', 'common treatment', 'companion diagnostics', 'computerized', 'cost', 'density', 'digital imaging', 'digital pathology', 'disorder risk', 'economic need', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'industry partner', 'innovation', 'malignant oropharynx neoplasm', 'neoplastic cell', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'overtreatment', 'patient subsets', 'pharynx squamous cell carcinoma', 'power analysis', 'precision medicine', 'prognostic', 'prognostic assays', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment choice', 'treatment response', 'treatment risk', 'tumor', 'tumor behavior']",NCI,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,614169,0.0031722996768189645
"Machine learning for the automated identification and tracking of rare myocardial diseases PROJECT SUMMARY Although cardiac amyloidosis and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) are relatively rare causes of heart failure (HF), they are particularly challenging to detect and treat for several shared reasons: (1) on routine clinical imaging (i.e., echocardiography [echo]), they can be difficult to distinguish from superficially similar, more common forms of cardiac disease that cause left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy; (2) the diagnoses are often missed and thus patients can present late in the course of disease at a time when treatment is difficult; (3) objective, noninvasive metrics that reliably reflect disease progression have not been identified; and (4) the small number of known patients with these diseases can make epidemiology studies and clinical trials difficult to organize and conduct. For both cardiac amyloidosis and HCM, echo plays a critical role in both diagnosis and longitudinal monitoring given its ubiquitous clinical availability, safety, and low cost. More broadly, echo dominates the current landscape of routine cardiac imaging, with tens of millions of echos performed in the United States each year. However, the clinical challenges described above highlight several shortcomings of echo: it is limited in its ability to (1) diagnose disease at its early stages; (2) discriminate between morphologically similar diseases; and (3) quantify disease progression. This proposal seeks to address deficiencies in the current echo reading workflow, which is subjective and captures only a small fraction of the data available in each study. The overall objective of this application is to use advances in machine learning to develop and validate fully-automated echo image analytic approaches to diagnose and track rare cardiomyopathies, focusing on cardiac amyloidosis and HCM. Our proposal is centered on the hypothesis that highly scalable computer vision methods can be applied to echo studies to overcome limitations of the standard clinical echo reading workflow. Accordingly our aims are: (1) Apply an automated method for echo quantification and disease identification to detect and differentiate cardiac diseases that cause increased LV wall thickness; and (2) Characterize quantifiable echo measures of disease progression in cardiac amyloidosis and HCM and associate these with clinical outcomes. Our multidisciplinary team, which is composed of experts in cardiomyopathies, echocardiography, computer vision, and machine learning, will analyze echos and patient data from 2 large patient registries: the Multicenter Amyloid Phenotyping Study (MAPS) and the Sarcomeric Human Cardiomyopathy Registry (SHaRe) HCM Network, with validation using a repository of nearly 400,000 echos. The successful completion of our aims will result in an innovative tool for early diagnosis of myocardial diseases and tracking of disease progression. Importantly, our project will set the stage for conducting larger epidemiology studies of rare myocardial diseases by automating the identification of these patients, and thereby developing previously unattainable broad-based cohorts for these conditions. PROJECT NARRATIVE Rare heart diseases such as amyloidosis (due to abnormal deposition of a protein into the heart muscle) and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (due to a genetic mutation) are important causes of heart failure and sudden death in the general population. These heart diseases are difficult to diagnose, monitor, and treat because: (1) they appear superficially similar to more common forms of heart disease (e.g., high blood pressure) on imaging tests; (2) the optimal monitoring of disease progression over time has not been established; and (3) there is a lack of large-scale studies of patients with these diseases given their rarity. This project aims to use machine learning (artificial intelligence) of digital echocardiographic images to create a completely automated method for diagnosing and tracking these rare heart diseases with the ultimate goal of broad deployment of artificial intelligence algorithms in hospitals and clinics to help identify patients with these rare heart diseases earlier, better predict adverse outcomes, and increase the size and scope of patient registries to enhance research of these conditions.",Machine learning for the automated identification and tracking of rare myocardial diseases,9614825,R01HL140731,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithm Design', 'Algorithms', 'Amyloid', 'Amyloidosis', 'Arrhythmia', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiomyopathies', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinics and Hospitals', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Coronary heart disease', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Echocardiography', 'Face', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Left', 'Left Ventricular Hypertrophy', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Myocardium', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Sudden Death', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Two-Dimensional Echocardiography', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Ventricular', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'career', 'clinical care', 'clinical imaging', 'cohort', 'cost', 'digital', 'disease diagnosis', 'epidemiology study', 'heart imaging', 'hypertensive heart disease', 'image processing', 'innovation', 'interest', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel therapeutics', 'particle', 'patient registry', 'repository', 'response', 'tool']",NHLBI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2018,826025,0.022701095297248224
"Electronic Health Record Data and Predictive Analytic Methods for HF The goal of this proposal is to develop accurate, generalizable and interpretable predictive models based on electronic health records (EHR) that detect heart failure (HF) in primary care patients one to two years before a clinical diagnosis and to translate the models for use in clinical care. Case-control datasets from two large US health systems (i.e., >13,000 incident HF cases and >120,000 controls) will be created and used to address two of the three study aims. For Aim 1 (Improve prediction of pre-diagnostic HF and model generalizability), recursive neural network (RNN) models will be used to improve prediction accuracy when compared to prior work that was based on traditional machine learning models (e.g., random forest, lasso logistic regression). It is expected that RNN models will perform better because temporality of EHR events can be captured. Aim 1 will also focus on improving model generalizability (i.e., among patients within and across health systems) by leveraging RNN models and by addressing challenges caused by variation in patient level EHR data (e.g., density of data) that are independent of a patient's actual health status. Aim 2 (Identify and clinically validate pre-diagnostic HF phenotypes) will focus on the identification of pre-diagnostic HF phenotypes and the use of content from RNN models derived under Aim 1. Three levels of analysis will be completed. First, we will focus on pathophysiologic heterogeneity that is represented, in part, by HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) and HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). But, HFpEF is considered to be more heterogeneous than HFrEF. New methods will be developed to reliably identify pre-diagnostic HF phenotypes. Second, phenotypes will be clinically validated for reliability and coherence and compared to clinical judgement based on a review of the patient's record. Third, we will address a challenge with RNN models, as they generate “black box” solutions that are seemingly uninterpretable. We propose to develop new methods to extract and represent the content from RNN models. We hypothesize that when phenotype status is combined with information extracted from Aim 1 RNN models it will be judged by expert clinician reviews to be superior for prevention care to phenotype status when it is combined with information extracted from traditional machine learning models or to a direct review of the patient's EHR. Finally, we will prospectively validate the phenotype and RNN models using a large primary care cohort being created by Sutter and related serial biobanked blood samples. For aim 3 we will determine how accurately the models predict elevated biomarker levels that are known to be sensitive and specific indicators of HF disease progression.   The proposed research will contribute valuable knowledge that will assist doctors to identify patients who are at high-risk of incident heart failure 12 to 24 months before the actual diagnosis and that exceed what is possible when relying on traditional signs, symptoms or risk factors. Doctors will be able to provide a more targeted approach to reduce the future risk of heart failure and the risks of morbidity and accelerated mortality that high risk patients face. Moreover, the methods that are developed for the early detection of heart failure in this study will help other researchers in creating more accurate and generalizable predictive models when using electronic health records data and when applying these models for use in clinical care.  ",Electronic Health Record Data and Predictive Analytic Methods for HF,9779100,R56HL116832,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood specimen', 'Cardiac', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease Progression', 'EFRAC', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Evidence based intervention', 'Face', 'Feeds', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health Status', 'Health system', 'Heart failure', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lasso', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Muscle Cells', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Patient Care', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Prevention', 'Primary Health Care', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Stretching', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Troponin T', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'adjudicate', 'analytical method', 'base', 'biobank', 'case control', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical care', 'cohort', 'density', 'expectation', 'feeding', 'forest', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'mortality', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'predictive modeling', 'pressure', 'prospective', 'recurrent neural network', 'recursive neural network']",NHLBI,CALIFORNIA PACIFIC MED CTR RES INSTITUTE,R56,2018,761303,-0.037487926621255586
"Leveraging modern analytic approaches to improve diabetes outcomes ABSTRACT Diabetic patients are at risk of developing diabetic heart disease, which may lead to complications in care. Diabetic heart disease patients not only have exceptionally high healthcare expenditures and resource utilization but also are likely to have poor patient outcomes. Studies have shown that early intervention of patients likely to develop diabetic heart disease is cost-effective and yields favorable health outcomes. Therefore, early identiﬁcation of diabetic patients at high-risk of developing diabetic heart disease is crucial to provide effective interventions. The commonly accepted methodology for diabetic heart disease risk prediction is the use of one or more risk scoring systems. However, these risk functions may not generalize well for the diabetes patient and may suffer from poor calibration when used on different cohorts. Moreover, the scoring systems have only been studied on coronary heart disease, one variant of diabetic heart disease while heart failure and diabetic cardiomyopathy remain important, yet insufﬁciently studied problems. Machine learning offers the ability to perform accurate predictive analytics and has been proposed as a way to identify and manage high-risk patients. The primary goal of this proposal is to develop a high-impact and practical risk prediction model that can be used to per- form early identiﬁcation of high-risk diabetic heart disease patients. Given the heterogeneity and complexity of patient information in electronic health records, the model needs to capitalize on the multi-dimensional temporal nature of pa- tient records to extract identifying characteristics of patients that will develop diabetic heart disease. To accomplish this, we will leverage modern machine learning approaches such as tensor factorization and natural language processing to model complex patient characteristics, provide a more complete representation of the patient, and uncover excellent predictors of diabetic heart disease risk. An existing dataset that contains the de-identiﬁed electronic health records of approximately 4,100 diabetic patients from the Emory Healthcare System to compare the predictive power of machine learning-based algorithms with the standard risk scoring systems. These algorithms will be evaluated on calibration, discrimination, and ease of interpretability. The results of this work will provide insight as to how to develop a machine learning–based prediction system that can identify high-risk diabetic heart disease patients. The study may also shed light on the best approaches for fusing data from multiple heterogeneous sources to build a better predictive model and potentially identify novel indicators of high- risk diabetic heart disease factors. Moreover, the work will help inform a larger multi-site study of diabetic heart disease risk prediction and develop methods to generalize the results to a broader spectrum of comorbidities. This project is consistent with the National Library of Medicine's mission to translate biomedical research into practice. PROJECT NARRATIVE Diabetic patients are risk of developing diabetic heart disease which can lead to high healthcare expenditure, high resource utilization, and poor patient outcomes. Existing diabetic risk prediction models can suffer from poor calibration and predictive accuracy.

"Machine learning of physiological variables to predict diagnose and treat cardiorespiratory instability Project Summary/Abstract: If one could accurately predict who, when and why patients develop cardiorespiratory instability (CRI), then effective preemptive treatments could be given to improve outcome and better use care resources. However, CRI is often unrecognized until it is well established and patients are more refractory to treatment, or progressed to organ injury. We have shown that an integrated monitoring system alert obtained from continuous noninvasively acquired monitoring parameters and coupled to a care algorithm improved step-down unit (SDU) patient outcomes. We also showed that advanced HR variability analysis (sample entropy) identified SDU patients at CRI risk within 2 minutes, and if monitored for 5 minutes differentiated between patients who would develop CRI or remain stable over the next 48 hours. We also applied machine learning (ML) modeling to our clinically-relevant porcine model of hemorrhagic shock to characterize responses to hypovolemia, hemorrhage, and resuscitation, predict which animals would or would not collapse during hypovolemia, and identify occult bleeding 5 minutes earlier than with traditional monitoring. We now propose to apply our work to vulnerable and invasively monitored ICU patients. We will develop multivariable models through ML data-driven classification techniques such as regression, Fourier and principal component analysis, artificial neural networks, random forest classification, etc. as well as more novel approaches (temporal rule learning developed by our team; Bayesian Aggregation) to predict CRI in ICU patients. We will first use our existing annotated high fidelity waveform MIMIC II clinical data set (4200 patients) to develop predictive models and differential signatures for various CRI drivers. We will also use our high-density data collection and processing platform (Bernoulli) to prospectively collect data from ICUs in three institutions: Univ. Pittsburgh (PITT), Univ. California (UC) Irvine and UC San Diego (initial algorithm development conducted at PITT and validated in the UC systems). We will identify the number and type of independent measures, sampling frequency, and lead time necessary to create robust algorithms to: 1) predict impending CRI, 2) select the most effective treatments, 3) monitor treatment response, and 4) determine when treatment has restored physiologic stability and can be stopped. We will also determine the smallest number and types of parameters coupled to the longest CRI lead time to achieve the above four targets with the best sensitivity and specificity (a concept we call Monitoring Parsimony).We will simultaneously iteratively design and test a graphical user interface (GUI) and clinical decision support system (CDSS) driven by these parsimoniously derived predictive smart alerts and functional hemodynamic monitoring treatment approaches in two human simulation environments (PITT & UC Irvine).We envision a basic monitoring surveillance that identifies patients most likely to develop CRI to apply focused clinician attention and targeted treatments to deliver highly personalized medical care. Public Health Narrative If one could accurately predict who, when and why patients develop shock then effective preemptive treatments could be given to improve outcome and more effectively use healthcare resources. But signs of shock often occur late once organ injury is already present. The purpose of this study is to first develop multivariable models through data-driven classification techniques to parsimoniously predict cardiovascular insufficiency, etiology and response to treatment. We will do this first in our existing MIMIC II clinical data sets of 4200 ICU patients as to timing and types of instability. Then we will prospectively collect real time high- density data on patients admitted to our trauma intensive care units of University of Pittsburgh, UC Irvine and UC San Diego. We will create and test in simulators of ICU care bedside user interfaces to drive recognition and treatment algorithms based on these models in all three medical centers.",Machine learning of physiological variables to predict diagnose and treat cardiorespiratory instability,9459930,R01GM117622,"['Acute', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Attention', 'California', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Entropy', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Exposure to', 'Family suidae', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hemorrhagic Shock', 'Homeostasis', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Hypovolemia', 'Injury', 'Institution', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Normal Range', 'Organ', 'Organ failure', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perioperative', 'Physiologic Monitoring', 'Physiological', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Recommendation', 'Refractory', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sepsis', 'Shock', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Stream', 'Stress', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'Triage', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Weaning', 'Work', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'cardiovascular insufficiency', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision support', 'clinically relevant', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'database structure', 'density', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'early onset', 'effective therapy', 'fitness', 'forest', 'graphical user interface', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual response', 'insight', 'iterative design', 'mortality', 'novel strategies', 'patient population', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'response', 'simulation', 'support tools', 'treatment response']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2018,601883,0.025043752917854736
"Deep Learning and Streaming Analytics for Prediction of Adverse Events in the ICU ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)     Critical care medicine in the United States costs over 80 billion dollars annually. Over the past decade the rate of intensive care unit (ICU) use has been increasing, with a recent study reporting almost one in three Medicare beneficiaries experiencing an ICU visit during the last month of their lives. Every year, sepsis, a medical condition characterized by whole-body inflammation, strikes between 800,000 and 3.1 million Americans, killing approximately one in four patients affected. There is currently no definite treatment for sepsis in spite of many clinicl trials. However, early detection of sepsis and timely initiation of interventions are widely considered as important determinants of patient survival. However, basic care tasks (such as microbiological sampling and antibiotic delivery within 1 h, fluid resuscitation, and risk stratification using serum lactate or alternative), which are known to benefit most patients, are not performed in a timely manner. Previous literature suggests that high-resolution vital signs (such as heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, etc.), and other sequential measurements within the electronic medical records (EMRs), can be dynamically integrated using Machine Learning techniques to help with early detection of sepsis. With the ubiquity of inexpensive high- capacity storage and high-bandwidth streaming technology it is now possible to monitor patients' vital signs continuously (for instance, the research application developed by the Emory hospital ICU uses IBM's streaming analytics platform to transmit over 100,000 real-time data points per 100 beds, per second). Despite this continuous feed of data, commonly used acuity scores, such as APACHE and SAPS, are based on snapshot values of these vital signs (typically the worst values during a 24 hours period). This limitation is partially due to unavailability of computationally efficient and robust algorithms capable of finding predictive features in multivariate, nonlinear and nonstationary sequential data, which may reveal inter- organ communication and disintegration of causal couplings with critical illnesses such as sepsis.  We have recently developed a novel Machine Learning algorithm to discover automatically a collection of predictive multivariate dynamical patterns in a database of patient time-series, which can be used to classify patients or to monitor progression of disease in a given patient. The primary goal of this proposal is to apply our method to assess the predictive power of high- resolution multivariate time-series of vital signs and sequentially recorded EMR data in the ICU for early detection of sepsis and risk stratification of septic patient. To accomplish this, we aim to benchmark our technique on a large ICU cohort (the MIMIC II database with over 60,000 patients), as well as simulated data from a multiscale mathematical model of influence of inflammatory mediators on dynamical patterns of vital signs. Next, the technique will be externally validated on two separate ICU sepsis cohorts (the Emory Sepsis dataset and the Mayo Clinic Metric dataset). Finally, we will provide a real-time implementation of the proposed algorithm in an streaming environment (such as the IBM streaming analytics), in order to address the Big Data challenge of harnessing real-time, streaming sensor data from bedside monitors within the ICU, while enabling advanced pattern recognition and real-time forecasting. Ultimately we believe these methods can change the current standard of care through faster recognition and initiation of basic care, as well as guiding interventional strategis based on severity of illness and mechanisms underlying physiological deterioration. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    The proposed project is making use of computers to analyze data from sickest patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). We want to develop methods to identify patterns in the patient data which predict who is at risk for mortality and who might respond to various medications which could make them better. We have a very strong team of doctors and researchers who work closely together, covering all aspects of the proposed research, which we hope will help us improve the lives of the sickest patients in the ICU.",Deep Learning and Streaming Analytics for Prediction of Adverse Events in the ICU,9538699,K01ES025445,"['Address', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Antibiotics', 'Antihypertensive Agents', 'Beds', 'Benchmarking', 'Big Data', 'Blood Pressure', 'Caring', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computers', 'Critical Care', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Trees', 'Deterioration', 'Differential Equation', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Goals', 'Heart Rate', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Intravenous', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Medicare', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Nature', 'Organ', 'Pathologic', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk stratification', 'SCAP2 gene', 'Sampling', 'Sepsis', 'Series', 'Serum', 'Severity of illness', 'Stream', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telemedicine', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'beneficiary', 'cohort', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'feeding', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'mathematical model', 'mortality', 'multi-scale modeling', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'parallel computer', 'patient safety', 'physiologic model', 'portability', 'prognostic', 'public health relevance', 'respiratory', 'safety practice', 'sensor', 'septic patients', 'simulation', 'standard of care', 'time use']",NIEHS,EMORY UNIVERSITY,K01,2018,190216,0.010009238545341649
"HEART: Adding Memory to Reasoning: macHine lEArning tailoRed drug Titration Hypertension (HTN) affects 73 million Americans, with an annual hospitalization cost of $113 billion/year. Clinical trial outcomes of optima4BP (O4BP), a clinical reasoning artificial intelligence (AI) system, determined that the success/failure of past anti-HTN medication treatments can be utilized to improve O4BP predictive performance. Our objective for this Phase I proposal is to investigate the feasibility of building a past treatment success/failure “memory” function into O4BP. O4BP, an innovation of Optima Integrated Health, is functional at UC San Francisco Medical Center (UCSF MC), the clinical collaborating partner. O4BP AI safely optimizes HTN medication treatment independent of in-office visits. It collects and analyzes current patient health information from multiple sources to determine if a medication optimization is required. O4BP then alerts the physician of a need for a medication change by providing a clinically supported treatment recommendation action. In this Phase I, we propose the development and validation of O4BP's “memory” by using the principles of Instance Based Learning (IBL). Known for its flexibility and intuitive logic, the IBL theory will be adapted to enhance the predictive treatment efficacy power of O4BP. It will lead to incorporating the patient response (success/failure) from past treatments to rank the efficacy of candidate treatments identified by O4BP for HTN medication optimization. Clinical resources [e.g., Electronic Health Record (EHR)] provide incomplete patient information, insufficient to build the “memory” functionality using retrospective datasets. Therefore, in Aim 1, a clinical trial (n=50) will be conducted to collect complete patient datasets that will be used to build the “memory” function: (a) BP data from remotely monitored BP; (b) EHR updates to the patient's profile since last cycle data dump; and (c) personalized online surveys for patient reporting of medication adherence, side- effects (SEs), and cardiovascular symptoms. Aim 2 will utilize the datasets to develop an efficacy proximity map 2x/month of candidate treatments to past treatments using IBL theory. The proximity map will be based on scored past treatment(s) efficacy, defined as a combination of success in BP lowering, reducing of SEs, and targeting minimum number of drugs with maximum BP lowering power. The treatment recommendation alert will be sent to the physician, for consideration. This study design allows immediate clinical adjudication of the IBL “memory” through physician's choice to implement/reject the treatment action alert, made available 2x/month for each patient. “Memory” enhanced O4BP is expected to lead to a systolic BP (SBP) reduction ≥10mmHg by the end of the scheduled 12 months treatment optimization period. Successful development and validation will position the “memory” enhanced O4BP for deployment at UCSF MC that serves approximately 20,000 patients with an SBP >160mmHg, poorly controlled, and at high risk for primary or recurrent stroke, heart failure or myocardial infarction. Our long-term objective is to transform the reactive and punctuated nature of HTN medication treatment management into a proactive and ongoing component of patient care. Our goal is to simplify the medication management of high blood pressure (BP) for the treating physician while improving the quality of care of patients and reducing the associated costs. We will develop an artificial processing intelligence that will allow our current product, optima4BP, to enhance its efficacy evaluation of candidate medication treatments as a function of past treatments performance. optima4BP is a decision support clinical reasoning artificial intelligence designed to safely optimize medication treatment by a physician, independent of in-office visits in patients with poorly controlled BP.",HEART: Adding Memory to Reasoning: macHine lEArning tailoRed drug Titration,9461180,R43HL140624,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'American', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automobile Driving', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood Pressure Monitors', 'Cardiology', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Confidential Information', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Failure', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'Heart failure', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospitalization', 'Hypertension', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Intelligence', 'Intuition', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life Style', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medical center', 'Medication Management', 'Medicine', 'Memory', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Nature', 'Office Visits', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of Care', 'Recommendation', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Research Design', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'San Francisco', 'Schedule', 'Series', 'Site', 'Source', 'Stroke', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Titrations', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Update', 'Validation', 'adjudication', 'base', 'blood pressure reduction', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical efficacy', 'college', 'commercial application', 'cost', 'data exchange', 'design', 'efficacy evaluation', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'hypertension treatment', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'medication compliance', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'patient response', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'profiles in patients', 'response', 'stroke incidence', 'success', 'system architecture', 'theories', 'treatment optimization', 'vector']",NHLBI,"OPTIMA INTEGRATED HEALTH, INC.",R43,2018,224090,0.0037938201704730296
"A Protocol-Driven, Digital Conversational Agent at the Hospital Bedside to Support Nurse Teams and to Mitigate Delirium and Falls Risk Abstract About 700,000 to 1 million falls per year occur during hospital stays in the US, costing hospitals $3 billion to $7 billion each year to treat. These costs are not reimbursed by the Centers of Medicare and Medicaid, resulting in significant financial losses for hospitals. Delirium, a major cause of falls, is highly prevalent (29%-64%) among hospitalized elders. Even without causing a fall, the average case of delirium increases the length of stay by 7.78 days, disrupting throughput and significantly reducing net hospital revenues. Including the common sequelae of post-discharge functional decline, delirium costs the national healthcare system over $130 billion per year. Due to the high cost and significant psychosocial needs of certain hospitalized patients, a widely-used intervention to mitigate risk is to assign hospital staff & nurses to serve as “patient sitters” at the bedside, at a cost of $1 million/year for a typical hospital. However, despite the workforce burden and expense, patient sitters often do not reliably execute risk-mitigating protocols, and the literature does not support their efficacy in preventing adverse events. In this SBIR Fast-Track proposal, we seek to develop an advanced, human-in-the-loop artificial intelligence (AI) avatar system to enhance the wellbeing of hospitalized patients, avoid adverse events including delirium and falls, and improve workforce efficiency by supporting nursing staff to work at the top of their license, potentially generating savings of $2,000,000 each year for a typical 300-bed hospital. This proposal aligns with NINR’s cross-cutting focus areas of Promoting Innovation and 21st Century Nurse Scientists, while applying the principles of patient self-management and wellness to the acute care environment, where the outcomes driven by our patient engagement and support platform will have an outsized, immediate cost benefit to enable rapid scaling and dissemination.

"Using clinical treatment data in a machine learning approach for sepsis detection Abstract Significance: In this SBIR project, we propose to develop novel software, “HindSight”, that will improve InSight, a machine-learning based clinical decision support (CDS) system for sepsis prediction and detection. HindSight will identify clinicians’ sepsis-related decisions in the records of former patients; it will then use these events to supply InSight with labeled examples of sepsis cases, incorporating clinicians’ judgement to demonstrate appropriate and inappropriate alarms. Together with an online training module that accordingly refines InSight’s predictors, this capability will enable InSight to quickly adapt to the idiosyncrasies of a particular clinical deployment, reduce false or irrelevant alarms, and do both without explicit human supervision. Research Question: Can a machine-learning-based, retrospective labeler learn to autonomously label sepsis and sepsis treatments by integrating the total clinical record, thereby providing many high-quality examples and labels for training a sepsis CDS? In concert with an online learning algorithm, can this labeler facilitate online, supervised learning without explicit human intervention? Prior Work: We have developed InSight for application in a number of sepsis prediction settings. Existing InSight classifiers attain an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.88 for sepsis detection, and 0.74 for 4-hour early sepsis prediction. Specific Aims: To identify patients who were evaluated for sepsis, treated for sepsis, or who actually had sepsis using the retrospective clinical patient record and label them accordingly (Aim 1); to use these labels with an online learning algorithm to implement autonomous, supervised learning of alert behavior which reflects clinician judgement (Aim 2). Methods: We will identify evaluated, treated, and septic patients using a machine learning labeler trained on retrospective data from patients’ electronic health records (EHR) at time of discharge. Using a set of 100 test cases (≥ 20 septic) hand-annotated by our clinician investigators, we will assess the labeler’s performance. Labeling AUROC ≥ 0.95 will constitute success in Aim 1. We will develop an online learning algorithm which enables InSight to continuously retrain during deployment. With Aim 1’s labeler, we will simulate a deployment with online learning, producing a learning curve of predictive AUROC on a held-out test set versus number of observed patients. Aim 2 will be successful if the online training results in superior area under the learning curve versus the initial model and periodic retraining. All experiments will be executed using the MIMIC-III data set. Future Directions: Following the proposed work, the InSight system with an online, HindSight-based retraining module will be deployed at partner hospitals for prospective studies. Narrative Clinical decision support (CDS) systems present critical information to medical professionals by examining patient data and providing alerts. Machine learning is a powerful method for creating CDS tools, but it requires labels which reflect the desired alert behavior. We will develop software that examines discharged patients’ electronic health records (EHR), identifies clinicians’ sepsis treatment decisions and patient outcomes, and passes these labeled examples to an online algorithm for retraining InSight, our machine-learning-based CDS tool for real-time sepsis prediction.",Using clinical treatment data in a machine learning approach for sepsis detection,9557659,R43TR002309,"['Algorithms', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Drops', 'E-learning', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Fatigue', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Hand', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Immune response', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Judgment', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Nature', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Periodicity', 'Phase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prospective Studies', 'Pythons', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sepsis', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Specificity', 'Supervision', 'Surgical Oncology', 'Survival Rate', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'TensorFlow', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Treatment outcome', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'cost', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'falls', 'improved', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'prospective', 'recurrent neural network', 'research clinical testing', 'septic', 'septic patients', 'software development', 'success', 'support tools']",NCATS,"DASCENA, INC.",R43,2018,324971,-0.024327058514203973
"Pediatric sepsis prediction: a machine learning solution for patient diversity Abstract  Significance:  In  this  SBIR  project,  we  propose  to  predict  and  detect  pediatric  severe  sepsis  by  developing  a  machine-­learning-­based  clinical  decision  support  system  for  electronic  health  record  (EHR)  pediatric  sepsis  screening. The pediatric population is underserved, with fundamental research and understanding of pediatric  sepsis  syndromes  lagging  behind  that  of  the  adult  population.  The  proposed  work  will  develop  machine  learning sepsis predictions on the highly heterogeneous pediatric population, by combining multi-­task learning  methods with expert clinical knowledge of how pediatric sepsis presentation is dependent on age and on pre-­ existing  conditions.  The  multi-­task  learning  approach  will  use  age  or  comorbidities  to  define  “tasks,”  each  one  associated  with  prediction  on  a  particular  subpopulation,  and  then  link  the  learning  process  together  between  tasks. Research Questions: Which methods of using these task-­defining parameters are most effective? How  can  we  most  effectively  learn  the  degree  of  similarity  between  pediatric  subpopulations  and  leverage  this  to  improve classification performance? Prior Work: InSight was originally developed to predict sepsis and septic  shock from adult EHR data. After retraining on pediatric cases, in preliminary experiments with a retrospective  set  of  pediatric  (2-­17  yr)  inpatient  encounters  (n  =  11,127;;  103  [0.9%]  severely  septic),  at  the  University  of  California  San  Francisco  (UCSF),  InSight  achieved  an  AUROC  0.912  and  0.727  for  the  detection  and  4-­hour  pre-­onset  prediction  of  sepsis.  This  performance  can  be  improved  for  better  pediatric  sepsis  prediction.  Specific  Aims:  To  empirically  evaluate  different  learning  schemes  using  age  with  and  without  multi-­task  methods,  within  the  UCSF  pediatric  severe  sepsis  data  set  (Aim  1).  To  exploit  an  expert-­proposed  network  graph  structure  for  comorbidity-­described  pediatric  subpopulations  that  provides  superior  predictive  performance  over  naïve  methods  and  graphs,  both  for  the  overall  population  and  for  underserved  subpopulations  (Aim  2).  Methods:  We  propose  to  use  multi-­task  methods  that  penalize  deviations  between  classifiers  on  neighboring  tasks  and  that  iteratively  learn  the  strength  of  these  links.  These  methods  will  be  compared with total task independence, or passing age into classifier training as an ordinary input. Criteria for  Success:  Success  will  be  shown  by  4-­hour  pre-­onset  AUROC  gains  of  0.02  (overall  population)  and  0.03  for  the previously weakest of three age subpopulations (2-­5, 6-­12, and 13-­17 yrs;; 4-­hour pre-­onset prediction, p <  0.05, McNemar’s test, 4-­fold cross-­validation). The best structure for mapping similarities between comorbidity  tasks will improve the overall AUROC by 0.03 (p < 0.05) and by 0.07 for ≥ 2 comorbidity subpopulations of ≥ 100 patients (p < 0.05). Outcome: These improvements will enable InSight to deliver strong sepsis predictive  performance across the widely heterogeneous pediatric population.         Narrative  Pediatric  sepsis  can  be  difficult  to  diagnose,  in  part  because the  pediatric  population  is  highly

"Reliable Seizure Prediction Using Physiological Signals and Machine Learning ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): For most individuals living with epilepsy, seizures are relatively infrequent events occupying a small fraction of their life. Despite spending as little a 0.01% of their lives having seizures (typically only minutes per month), people with epilepsy take anti-epileptic drugs (AED) daily, suffer AED related side effects, and spend their lives dreading when the next seizure will strike. The apparent randomness of seizures is associated with significant psychological consequences. In addition, despite daily AED approximately 1/3 of patients continue to have seizures. We hypothesize that epilepsy can be more effectively treated, both the seizures and their psychological impact, by providing patients with real-time seizure forecasting. Periods of low seizure probability would not require AEDs, or at least lower doses of AEDs, thus reducing AED exposure and their side effects. Periods of high seizure probability may respond to acute AED and patients could alter their activities to avoid injury. Patients would be empowered to manage their medications and life activities using reliable seizure forecasts. In this grant we investigate the hypothesis that seizures are predictable events, and pursue accurate, clinically relevant seizure forecasting using recent advances in support vector machines (SVM), data-analytic models, and Universum-SVM applied to continuous intracranial EEG (iEEG) in focal canine epilepsy. This is an initial step in establishin a new treatment paradigm for focal epilepsy, whereby the probability of seizure occurrence is continuously tracked for patient warning and intelligent responsive therapies. Naturally occurring focal canine epilepsy is an excellent model for investigation of seizure forecasting because of the clinical and electrophsyiological similarity to focal human epilepsy. This study provides a unique opportunity to study seizure forecasting in naturally occurring canine epilepsy under uniform conditions (the same environment). Importantly, dogs are large enough to accommodate devices designed for human use. The hypotheses driving this proposal are that focal seizures are not random events and there are brain states associated with low or high probability of seizure occurrence, and that these states can be reliably classified using machine learning approaches (SVM & Universum-SVM) that combine features from iEEG, behavioral state tracking, and electrocardiogram (ECG) heart rate variability. The goal of this proposal is to develop reliable seizure forecasting (when possible) and improved understanding (data characterization) when good forecasting is not possible. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This grant proposes to develop the capability for accurate, reliable seizure forecasting using recent advances in support vector machines, data-analytic models, and Universum-SVM applied to continuous intracranial EEG canines with naturally occurring epilepsy. Naturally occurring focal canine epilepsy is an excellent model for investigation of seizure forecasting because of the clinical and electrophsyiological similarity to focal human epilepsy.

"PRECEDE: PREsurgical Cognitive Evaluation via Digital clockfacEdrawing ABSTRACT Preoperative cognitive impairment is common among older adults preparing for surgery. Despite growing evidence that preoperative cognitive/neuronal integrity is a risk factor for perioperative insults and post- operative adverse outcomes, health care systems do not systematically pre-operatively screen for cognition. Clinical researchers have yet to identify a pragmatic approach to pre-operative cognitive screening. Our team members have developed the digital Clock Drawing Test (dCDT), a tool that captures subtle behavioral variables during a rapid (5-minute) clock drawing assessment. The data and benefit afforded by this tool have yet to be considered across perioperative contexts. We will apply the dCDT within a large number of pre- surgical patients (n=5,000 per year) coupled with novel machine learning algorithms to address three specific aims. Aim 1: examine range and distribution of preoperative neurocognitive impairment with older adult preoperative patients relative to non-surgical older adult demographically matched peers (available n=2,400 via NIH/Boston University Framingham Heart Study) using novel previously unobserved dCDT graphomotor and decision making variables; Aim 2: examine the predictive validity of presurgical dCDT variables on postoperative, clinician reported/hospital recorded events; Aim 3: examine pre to postoperative 6-week, 3- month, and 1-year change in dCDT and NIH PROMIS metrics for thoracic (n=70), orthopedic (n=70), major abdominal-pelvic patients (n=70), and non-surgery peers (n=70). For the observational studies (Aim 1 and 2), individuals > 65 years presenting to the UFHealth presurgical clinic will complete the dCDT as well as a three- word memory test and frailty assessment as part of the standard clinical evaluation. Surgical and anesthetic details will be acquired via the electronic medical record. Clinically-relevant outcomes will include complications, length of stay, cost of care, functional capacity, and mortality. Outcomes will be supplemented by a separate longitudinally-studied subgroup (Aim 3) completing NIH PROMIS metrics at 6 weeks, 3 months, and 1year after surgery. Analyses will focus on stratifying distributions and clusters of dCDT characteristics across numerous sociodemographic, surgical, and anesthetic factors. The predictive value of the dCDT will be modeled relative to clinical outcomes. Changes in dCDT and baseline NIH PROMIS domains will be compared pre- and post-operatively and examined for interactions with longitudinal perioperative events. Subaims: We will apply `deep learning' approaches to drawings to identify novel features of pre-surgical patients relative to a large sample of demographically equated dCDT data points available through the Framingham Heart Study. Symbolic aggregate approximation (SAX)-based machine learning approaches will characterize interactions between preoperative dCDT features and intraoperative anesthetic sensitivities.  PROJECT NARRATIVE Assessing cognition prior to surgery has relevance for a number of reasons, but has yet to be applied due to pragmatic issues associated with assessment complexities and time. Here, we will leverage a modernized digital version of a well-known cognitive screening tool (the Clock Drawing Test) to examine 1) pre-operative cognitive abilities in adults > 65 years attending a tertiary academic medical hospital pre-operative clinic; 2) how pre-operative cognitive abilities predict post-operative hospital/clinical reported outcomes (i.e., length of stay, hospital cost) and 3) how pre-operative cognitive abilities interact with perioperative events to predict post-operative cognitive change and patient reported outcomes. The study will result in improved ability to appreciate cognition in older adults electing surgery and optimize their perioperative experience.",PRECEDE: PREsurgical Cognitive Evaluation via Digital clockfacEdrawing,9535033,R01AG055337,"['Abdomen', 'Academic Medical Centers', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'American College of Surgeons', 'Anesthetics', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Boston', 'Cardiac', 'Characteristics', 'Chest', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complication', 'Comprehension', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Elderly', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Face', 'Framingham Heart Study', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospital Records', 'Hospitals', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Length of Stay', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Memory', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'Neurons', 'Observational Study', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Orthopedics', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patients', 'Pelvis', 'Perioperative', 'Postoperative Pain', 'Postoperative Period', 'Predictive Value', 'Price', 'Psyche structure', 'Recovery', 'Regression Analysis', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Secondary to', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Societies', 'Subgroup', 'Suggestion', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'adverse outcome', 'age effect', 'base', 'care costs', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive change', 'cognitive process', 'cognitive testing', 'deep learning', 'digital', 'executive function', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'frailty', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'member', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient subsets', 'peer', 'performance tests', 'prospective', 'research clinical testing', 'screening', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,R01,2018,460052,-0.028550355129379014

"Automating Real-Time Localization of Target Sites in Catheter Ablation of Ventricular Tachycardia Project Summary Ventricular tachycardia (VT) is an important cause of mortality and morbidity in patients with heart diseases. The majority of life-threatening VT episodes are caused by an electrical ""short circuit” that travels through narrow strands of surviving tissue inside myocardial scar. Catheter ablation treats scar-related VT by “blocking” the surviving channel that forms the circuit, commonly at the site the circuit exits from the scar. To localize a VT exit, however, remains a significant challenge. A common approach, known as pace-mapping, utilizes the principle that the VT exit serves as the origin of ventricular activation and determines the QRS morphology on 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs). It thus involves repetitive electrical simulation at various sites of the heart, until locating the site that reproduces the QRS of the VT on all 12 ECG leads. While the principle behind pace- mapping is time tested, the current practice is of a ""trial-and-error"" nature and requires rapid qualitative interpretation of the ECG by clinicians, which can be time-consuming and inaccurate. This research proposes to leverage modern machine learning techniques to reform the way the principle behind pace-mapping is used. It aims to learn the relationship between the origin of ventricular activation and ECG morphology, and then use it to directly predict the exit of a VT from its ECG data. To this end, this project will include the following activities: 1) to develop a population-based model to provide pre-procedural initial localizations of VT exits using standard 12-lead ECG; 2) to integrate the population-based model with a patient-specific model in clinically-usable software to provide intra-procedural real-time guidance for localizing the exit site of a clinical VT; and 3) to assess the ability of the proposed software to improve the efficiency and accuracy of pace- mapping in a prospective clinical study. This project will be carried out by a multidisciplinary team of computational and clinical scientists with a fruitful record of collaboration. The software delivered by this project will provide real-time assistance to clinicians for narrowing down a VT exit with a minimum amount of time and localization errors. This will substantially reduce the workload for ablating multiple VTs, potentially allowing clinicians to ablate more or even all VTs seen in a procedure. This may reduce the duration of an ablation procedure while improving its outcome. The development and deployment of the software also adds minimal cost or distractions to routine workflow. With a low barrier to clinical implementation, it will have a real potential to challenge and improve the standard practice of catheter ablation. Project Narrative Catheter ablation treats ventricular arrhythmia by destroying the culprit tissue responsible for the arrhythmia. To localize the culprit tissue, however, remains a tedious process with limited success in current practice. This project will develop inexpensive software to guide clinicians towards the culprit tissue in real time during the procedure, helping narrow down the ablation target with a minimum amount of time and localization errors.",Automating Real-Time Localization of Target Sites in Catheter Ablation of Ventricular Tachycardia,9590857,R15HL140500,"['Ablation', 'Arrhythmia', 'Attention', 'Cardiac ablation', 'Cicatrix', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'EKG QRS Complex', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Encapsulated', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hybrids', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphology', 'Myocardial', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Population Database', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Travel', 'Variant', 'Ventricular', 'Ventricular Arrhythmia', 'Ventricular Tachycardia', 'Workload', 'clinical implementation', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'design', 'distraction', 'improved', 'interest', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'population based', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'simulation', 'software development', 'success', 'sudden cardiac death', 'usability']",NHLBI,ROCHESTER INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R15,2018,419810,0.0006628183113339153
"Novel Atrial Fibrillation Phenotypes Defined by Functional-Anatomical, Machine-Learned Classifications Abstract Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a pervasive disease which affects over 30 million individuals worldwide, in whom it is associated with morbidity and mortality, yet for which therapeutic outcomes are suboptimal. One major limitation to mechanistic and clinical advances in AF is its taxonomy, which is based on number of days of detected AF rather than increasingly reported functional and personalized mechanisms. I reasoned that a digital and scalable AF taxonomy, based on interactions of anatomic and functional factors and clinical features, may better guide existing therapy and catalyze future mechanistic and therapeutic advances. I set out to create a predictive tool to guide therapy in AF patients using machine learning of rich mechanistic data from a large multicenter registry of patients undergoing ablation. I hypothesized that clinically actionable AF phenotypes can be defined by statistical clustering between electrophysiologic features, anatomic regions and clinical indices, that can be uncovered by physiological and statistical quantification and machine learning. I have two Specific Aims: 1) To construct a multimodal digital atlas of atrial fibrillation which registers functional indices at absolute and relative spatial locations in both atria from a multicenter registry, and make this atlas available as an open-source software resource. This deliverable will uniquely map the probability that specific mechanisms will be relevant to AF in a specific patient of given clinical characteristics. Novel pathophysiological phenotypes will be defined via probabilistic interactions in these individual components. 2) To develop a predictive tool using machine learning to estimate the likelihood that ablation at any site(s) will contribute to success tailored to individual characteristics, by learning clusters of electrophysiologic features, clinical indices, and anatomic regions in a training population and applying it to a validation cohort from a large multicenter registry. This project uses state-of-the-art computational tools and statistical methods that may reconcile divergent AF mechanistic hypotheses to define novel functional AF phenotypes and guide therapy. In the process, I will be mentored by world leading mentors, in an extraordinary training environment to facilitate this development into an independent physician-scientist in bioengineering-heart rhythm medicine. Project Narrative This research provides an avenue to define atrial fibrillation in an actionable classification rooted in pathophysiologic and mechanistic observations. Such a classification scheme would further our understanding and refine our conversation about complex arrhythmia in cardiac tissue. Only an understanding at this level is will provide truly effective and safe treatments of each individual patient’s arrhythmic condition.","Novel Atrial Fibrillation Phenotypes Defined by Functional-Anatomical, Machine-Learned Classifications",9611012,F32HL144101,"['Ablation', 'Affect', 'Anatomy', 'Anti-Arrhythmia Agents', 'Applications Grants', 'Arrhythmia', 'Atlases', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Cardiac', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Classification Scheme', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Faculty', 'Foundations', 'Freedom', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Heart Atrium', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Mission', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Obstructive Sleep Apnea', 'Patients', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Pulmonary veins', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Taxonomy', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapy trial', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translations', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'base', 'clinically actionable', 'cohort', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'deep learning', 'digital', 'disease classification', 'health care service utilization', 'heart rhythm', 'improved outcome', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'mortality', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'open source', 'patient registry', 'patient response', 'patient stratification', 'predictive tools', 'success', 'therapy outcome', 'tool', 'trial design']",NHLBI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,F32,2018,63034,0.007208569005037275
"Deep learning enhanced seizure monitoring from wearable sensors Deep learning enhanced seizure monitoring from wearable sensors Over 1 million patients in the United States have uncontrolled epilepsy despite ongoing medical therapy. When seizures are prolonged or violent, there is significant risk of injury or even Sudden Unexpected Death of Epilepsy (SUDEP) which occurs in approximately 1 in 500 patients per year. Novel seizure monitoring could help alleviate this burden. Our research team has created a software application, EpiWatch, to capture different sensor measurements related to seizure activity such as convulsions (accelerometers), heart rate increases (photo- plethysmography-PPG), and unresponsiveness to behavioral prompting (interactive user interface). Our hope is to offer accurate seizure detection with improved false positive performance to encourage usage. Our team proposes to develop multi-modal sensor analysis driven by deep learning technology to enhance seizure monitoring. We are uniquely positioned to accelerate development by leveraging our team’s prior EpiWatch IRB approved study which generated over 6,000 hours of sensor data. In Phase I, we will teach EpiWatch how to read time series sensor data and how to discriminate seizure activity. EpiWatch will employ a convolutional neural network, a technique rooted in deep learning, to self-characterize seizure features from labeled sensor data. In order to infer additional information from vast amounts of unlabeled sensor data from US epilepsy patients, EpiWatch will incorporate a deconvolutional neural network technique to increase predictive performance. A pilot study of EpiWatch will test its ability to identify the presence of seizures in a prospective new cohort of epilepsy patients. If we are successful, we envision a Phase II proposal which is focused on clinical translation of the technology and assessment of its impact. Our goal is to combine recent advances in deep learning and scalable parallel computing to create EpiWatch. In the long term, we hope this monitoring technology will aid epilepsy patient management and improve outcomes. PROJECT NARRATIVE Recurring seizures are disabling, dangerous, and often limit independence. We are developing novel seizure detection using a consumer friendly device with wearable sensors (EpiWatch) to enable monitoring and emergency alerting for seizures that occur without warning (~50% of all seizures) and without witnesses, especially when they are prolonged (> 5 min) or accompanied by cardiac arrhythmias responsible for SUDEP (Sudden Unexpected Death with Epilepsy), a 1 in 500 annual risk for patients with uncontrolled seizures. If emergency care can be summoned under these circumstances, patients can live more safely and independently, in turn encouraging app usage. When integrated with current disease monitoring activities, EpiWatch will have the long range impact of providing a unique platform for individualized epilepsy care.",Deep learning enhanced seizure monitoring from wearable sensors,9622338,R43NS108905,"['Accelerometer', 'Apple', 'Arrhythmia', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biosensor', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Computer software', 'Consent', 'Convulsions', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Electroencephalography', 'Emergency Care', 'Emergency Situation', 'Epilepsy', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Heart Rate', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Injury', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Network-based', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neurologist', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Photoplethysmography', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Plant Roots', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Refractory', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Seizures', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Supervision', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Technology Assessment', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States', 'Violence', 'Work', 'clinical translation', 'cohort', 'computing resources', 'deep learning', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'insight', 'novel', 'parallel computer', 'prospective', 'response', 'sensor', 'wearable device']",NINDS,"VIGILANT MEDICAL, INC.",R43,2018,238872,0.01884406476088742
"Novel Non-Invasive Coronary Flow Patterning to Predict Early Coronary Microvascular Disease PROJECT SUMMARY  Coronary microvascular disease (CMD) is notoriously difficult to diagnose non-invasively, and current methods of assessing CMD utilize only the peak velocity of the coronary flow pattern. While new imaging techniques such as cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have improved the assessment coronary perfusion, there are currently no non-invasive methods that incorporate the coronary flow pattern over a complete cardiac cycle to definitively assess and predict the development of CMD.  Coronary blood flow (CBF) reflects the summation of flow in the coronary microcirculation, and our lab has begun to harness the full CBF pattern under varying flow and disease conditions (e.g. type 2 diabetes) to determine whether it might harbor novel clues leading to the early detection of CMD. Our past and preliminary data indicate an early onset of CMD in both type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and metabolic syndrome (MetS) that occurs prior to the onset of macrovascular complications and that are characterized by blood flow impairments and alterations in coronary resistance microvessel (CRM) structure, function, and biomechanics. Our data also uncovered innovative correlations between CRM structure/biomechanics and our newly-defined features of the coronary flow pattern, some of which were unique to normal or diabetic mice. We have initially utilized these CBF features, in the presence and absence of other factors such as cardiac function, to develop a mathematical model in collaboration with Drs. Christopher Bartlett and William Ray that to date demonstrated that 6 simple factors can predict a normal vs. diabetic coronary flow pattern with 85% predictive accuracy. Utilizing a multidisciplinary approach, these preliminary data strongly suggest that the coronary flow pattern and physiological modulators of it (e.g. coronary micovascular structure/function/biomechanics, cardiac function, etc), may be useful in directly diagnosing early CMD. Therefore, we hypothesize that dissecting the elements that influence coronary flow patterning will be critical determinants in the direct assessment of coronary microvascular disease using computational modeling. Using our previous publications and our preliminary data as guides, the hypothesis will be tested by addressing two specific aims: 1) Determine whether unique time-dependent CBF patterning in normal and T2DM is dictated by a combination of CRM remodeling and biomechanics, coronary flow pattern dynamics, and cardiac function, permitting the development of a computational model to accurately predict CMD; 2) Determine the reproducibility and robustness of the machine learning model in predicting CMD in a diet-induced obesity/diabetes mouse model. If successful, these studies will be the first to simultaneously examine the influence of CRMs, CBF, and cardiac structure/function on the distinct pattern of coronary flow, and it will determine whether a mathematical model may be useful in establishing a direct assessment of CMD to eventually enable clinicians to conduct a more direct non-invasive diagnosis of CMD for the prevention and/or treatment of heart disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) is the leading cause of heart disease and is associated with hypertension, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome. Coronary Microvascular Disease (CMD) is comprised of structural and functional deficits of the tiny coronary arteries that may be an earlier indicator of disease prior to the onset of overt CAD. The proposed multidisciplinary research aims to develop a computational artificial intelligence model that will accurately predict CMD based on a non-invasive coronary flow pattern obtained by Doppler echocardiography.",Novel Non-Invasive Coronary Flow Patterning to Predict Early Coronary Microvascular Disease,9584176,R21EB026518,"['Address', 'Age', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biomechanics', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiac', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Simulation', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary artery', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic mouse', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Doppler Echocardiography', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Echocardiography', 'Elements', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hyperemia', 'Hypertension', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impairment', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Methods', 'Microcirculation', 'Microvascular Dysfunction', 'Modeling', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Publications', 'Reproducibility', 'Resistance', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'base', 'coronary perfusion', 'db/db mouse', 'diabetic', 'disorder prevention', 'early onset', 'experimental study', 'heart function', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'macrovascular disease', 'mathematical model', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'novel', 'pressure', 'prevent']",NIBIB,RESEARCH INST NATIONWIDE CHILDREN'S HOSP,R21,2018,190000,-0.021043077235998506
"Improving the measurement and analysis of long-term, patient-centered outcomes following acute respiratory failure PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This Pathway to Independence Award application is submitted by a pulmonary and critical care epidemiologist committed to improving the quality of patient-oriented research for patients experiencing acute respiratory failure (ARF). Worldwide, millions of patients develop ARF annually. In the U.S., nearly one million patients with ARF require mechanical ventilation annually, accounting for a quarter of all intensive care unit (ICU) admissions. As improvements in ICU care reduce such patients’ in-hospital mortality rates, attention has shifted to the challenges ARF survivors face in regaining their prior cognitive, physical, and psychosocial functioning. However, there is a key barrier for randomized clinical trials (RCTs) testing new interventions to improve ARF survivorship – that is, the current lack of an endpoint that (1) captures long-term patient dispositions, (2) incorporates patient preferences and perspectives, and (3) is able to be analyzed without concern for statistical biases. The overarching goal of this research is to support clinical innovation by developing new approaches to measure and report long-term patient-centered outcomes that overcome the methodological barriers currently limiting ARF RCTs. The applicant will accomplish his goals under the mentorship of established researchers in critical care, patient-centered outcomes research, statistics, and informatics to assure his transition to a tenure-track faculty position in the R00 phase and his emergence as a leading pulmonary and critical care epidemiologist. First, the applicant will use an innovative combination of qualitative and quantitative research methods to elicit and integrate ARF survivors’ and their caregivers’ perspectives into a new patient-centered, long-term composite outcome measure (K99 phase). During the R00 phase, the applicant will recruit ARF survivors to participate in a prospective cohort, and follow these patients to describe the burden of ARF survivorship over 1-year using the new endpoint developed during the K99 phase. This endeavor will also provide key data that will facilitate sample size calculations in future ARF RCTs. Data from this cohort will additionally be used to develop an electronic health record (EHR)-based algorithm to predict risks for adverse long-term outcomes among ARF patients early in their ICU stays. Thus, this K99/R00 will augment ARF research by establishing a new outcome measure anchored in patient perspectives, improving the understanding and clinical prognostication of post-ICU morbidity following ARF, and facilitate the efficiency and clinical relevance of future ARF RCTs by enabling measurement of patients’ baseline risks for different outcomes. Concurrently, the didactic work, individual study, and hands-on learning in mixed-methods research, natural language processing, and predictive analytics will fill key training gaps for the applicant, thereby positioning him for a successful, independently-funded research career advancing the science of outcomes measurement and analysis for ARF RCTs. PROJECT NARRATIVE Randomized trials testing strategies to improve long-term outcomes for survivors of acute respiratory failure (ARF) are hampered by the lack of valid, patient-centered endpoints. Using interviews with ARF survivors and their caregivers, statistical simulation, consensus building among stakeholders, and a prospective cohort study, the applicant will develop, describe the epidemiology of, and predict a new patient-oriented outcome that will support trials of innovative approaches to improve ARF survivorship outcomes.","Improving the measurement and analysis of long-term, patient-centered outcomes following acute respiratory failure",9505095,K99HL141678,"['Accounting', 'Acute respiratory failure', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Competence', 'Consensus', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emotional', 'Enrollment', 'Environmental air flow', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Face', 'Faculty', 'Financial Support', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Outcomes Research', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Preferences', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Process', 'Property', 'Prospective Studies', 'Prospective cohort', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Provider', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Rogaine', 'Sample Size', 'Science', 'Statistical Bias', 'Structure', 'Survivors', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'care outcomes', 'career', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'design', 'experience', 'hands-on learning', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'novel strategies', 'outcome prediction', 'patient oriented', 'patient oriented research', 'prediction algorithm', 'prognostic', 'psychosocial', 'randomized trial', 'recruit', 'residence', 'simulation', 'statistics', 'survivorship', 'tenure track']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K99,2018,105743,0.0023292454512018304
"Identification of Patients with Low Life Expectancy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is increasingly recognized that optimal treatment is not the same for every patient - it depends on the individual patient's circumstances. One important factor that determines the optimal clinical management is the patient's life expectancy, which determines the temporal horizon within which medical decisions have to operate. For example, while adding an extra diabetes medication may save a 40-year-old individual from going blind or developing kidney failure 20 years later, it will not bring any benefits to an 80-yer old with a metastatic malignancy who is expected to live only a few months.  Consequently, it is critical that when we measure quality of care, suggest treatment options to clinicians through clinical decision support or compare different treatment strategies, we take into account the patient's life expectancy. However, currently there are no methods available that can do this with sufficient accuracy.  Most commonly used techniques to assess a patient's mortality risk draw primarily on administrative data and other structured data fields in electronic medical records. This approach leaves out a large amount of information that is only available in narrative documents such as provider notes, radiology reports, etc. In this project we propose to test the hypothesis that application of two novel technologies - artificial intelligence technique Dynamic Logic and natural language processing (NLP) - could leverage the information in narrative electronic documents to significantly improve the accuracy of identification of patients with low life expectancy.  Dynamic Logic allows to circumvent the challenge of combinatorial complexity that limits the number of variables and their combinations that can be considered as predictors of an outcome by most currently used analytical methods. Dynamic Logic makes use of a limited number of iterative approximations to reduce the complexity of a problem with multiple predictor variables from exponential to approximately linear. Utilization of Dynamic Logic will allow us to greatly increase the richness of the models for identification of patients with low life expectancy and ultimately improve their accuracy.  Information such as the patient's functional status that is usually only found in narrative documents may be critical to improving accuracy of identifying frail patients at high mortality risk. Modern NLP techniques can effectively identify key concepts in medical text but until now analytical methods allowed consideration of only a few of pre-selected concepts in prediction models. Combining NLP with Dynamic Logic will allow us to greatly expand the number of concepts from narrative text that could be included in the life expectancy prediction model, likely leading to a considerable improvement in accuracy.  In the proposed translational multidisciplinary project our team that will include experts on artificial intelligence, natural language processing, analysis of data in electronic medical records, and geriatrics will test whether a combination of Dynamic Logic and NLP improves identification of patients at high risk of death. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Identification of patients with limited life expectancy is important for accurate measurement of quality of care delivered by clinicians, clinical decision support in electronic medical records and research that compares different treatment options for patients. However, currently available methods suffer from low accuracy or use information that is not widely available. In this project we propose to combine two advanced computational technologies - artificial intelligence technique Dynamic Logic and natural language processing - to improve accuracy of identification of patients with low life expectancy.",Identification of Patients with Low Life Expectancy,9481256,R01HS024090,[' '],AHRQ,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2018,227899,-0.01872139474717315
"Integrate Dynamic System Model and Machine Learning for Calibration-Free Noninvasive ICP Project Summary  No clinical device exists for noninvasive intracranial pressure (nICP) assessment. Past attempts have focused on identifying ICP-related signals that are noninvasively measureable, but have done little to address the calibration problem. Without calibration, only ICP trending can be inferred at the best. However, noninvasive calibration is not trivial. A universal calibration will fail because individual patients require different calibration to obtain accurate results. On the other hand, the use of plain regression for individualized calibration is infeasible because ICP cannot be obtained noninvasively for a de novo patient to begin with.  Invasive ICP monitoring remains a standard of care and this can be leveraged to continuously grow a database of ICP, noninvasive signals, and different calibration equations, e.g., each built from a pair of invasive ICP and noninvasive signal in the database. Then nICP becomes feasible by selecting from a rich set of calibration equations the optimal choice for a de novo patient. In this project, we will pursue three aims that will lead to the development of an accurate noninvasive ICP system based on Transcranial Doppler. These aims are: 1) To implement and validate core algorithms needed for achieving accurate nICP; 2) To test if estimated nICP is sensitive to variations in ultrasound probe placement; 3) To test the generalizability of the proposed nICP approach.  Large epidemiologic surveys reveal that ICP is monitored in only about 58% of US patients when ICP monitoring is indicated. It is a smaller percentage (37%) in European patients and even fewer in developing countries. The proposed nICP approach does not have the high risks associated with invasive ICP, requires no onsite neurosurgical expertise, and can be economically deployed and readily practiced. Therefore, its potential impact is enormous. Project Narrative  No clinically accepted device exists for noninvasive intracranial pressure (ICP) assessment.

"QuBBD: Geometric Time-Frequency Methods for Multi-modal Physiological Monitoring Modern health monitoring devices at hospitals and wearable sensors in households generate a large amount of time series data at high rate, capturing the physiological status of patients in a real-lime fashion. The premise is that these technology advances enable a data-driven healthcare system that starts making fast, accurate, objective and inexpensive decisions based upon data, in addition to an individual physician's experience and preference. However, there is a significant gap in the mathematical theory and computational tools to promptly extract actionable information from multi-modal non-stationary time series data in a robust and tractable manner, which has become a serious roadblock to further utilize bigger data for better healthcare monitoring. The goal of this research program is to develop a mathematical framework for extracting time-frequency and geometric representations of multi-modal physiological data, in an online and robust manner, and use them to design machine learning algorithms to improve real-lime health monitoring. Specifically, we hypothesize that the development of time-series and geometric methods for large streaming multi-modal monitoring data will lead to more accurate diagnosis on various physiological monitoring applications, including detection and prediction of rare events such as seizure and arrhythmia, classification of sleep stages for newborns and children, and real-time artifact removal of physiological data. To achieve our goal, we plan to develop novel theoretical and computational tools for analyzing non-stationary multi-modal time series data with noise, corruption and missing data as well as real-time algorithms for filtering and event detection from such data. The tools and algorithms will be applied on clinical tasks at the Nationwide Children's Hospital. In addition, the real-time workflow will be implemented on Hadoop clusters with a mission of public sharing of both data and software. The development from the interdisciplinary team composed of mathematicians, biomedical informaticians as well as the hospital will not only transform the frontiers of mathematics knowledge, but also significantly impact clinical applications, data science education, and the development of the $11 O billion emerging market of wireless health. The goal of this project is to develop a series of novel computational theory and software to extract physiological information from the large multi-modal data streams generated by modern health monitoring devices. The tools will be applied to various clinical tasks such as detection and prediction of seizure and arrhythmia and classification of sleep stages for newborns and children, aiming for more accurate diagnosis.",QuBBD: Geometric Time-Frequency Methods for Multi-modal Physiological Monitoring,9568758,R01EB025018,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Arrhythmia', 'Behavior', 'Big Data', 'Breathing', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Education', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Excision', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitals', 'Household', 'Human body', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Knowledge', 'Limes', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Nature', 'Newborn Infant', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Physicians', 'Physiologic Monitoring', 'Physiological', 'Property', 'Public Domains', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Seizures', 'Series', 'Sleep Stages', 'Stream', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Wireless Technology', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'biological systems', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'experience', 'frontier', 'geometric methodologies', 'graduate student', 'heart rate variability', 'improved', 'insight', 'mathematical theory', 'monitoring device', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'preference', 'programs', 'science education', 'signal processing', 'student training', 'theories', 'tool', 'wearable device']",NIBIB,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,258070,-0.02994871533427717
"Identifying Electronic Phenotypes associated with Patient Health Outcomes of Interhospital Transfer Patients Project Summary/Abstract Approximately 1.6 million patients undergo interhospital transfer (IHT) each year in the United States. Of those IHTs, approximately 550,000 are conducted by air (i.e., helicopters or jets), or roughly one every 60 seconds, at an estimated annual cost of $6 billion. Contrary to common belief, patients who undergo IHT experience worse outcomes, which include double the length of stay, twice the cost, and higher mortality than non- transferred patients. While worse outcomes are not necessarily due to higher severity of illness, factors contributing to unfavorable outcomes have yet to be identified. For about 30% of the patients experiencing an immediately life-threatening condition such as trauma or heart attack, immediate IHT by air is beneficial; but for the other 70% of patients not experiencing a life-threatening condition, the benefit is less clear.  The current decision-making process regarding who should be transferred and how (air vs. ground) is rarely guided by evidence or guidelines. Furthermore, patients and families rarely have input regarding how a patient is transferred. Empirical evidence is needed to identify meaningful indicators for IHT and to guide the decision regarding mode of transfer. Previous research efforts relied almost exclusively on data from the post- transport phase of illness, a major limitation when investigating what leads up to a patient needing transfer to another hospital. To investigate the factors that lead to IHT, we developed a data repository for patients who are transported from one hospital to another. This repository includes the electronic medical record of helicopter and jet transfers, as well as the sending and receiving hospital EMR data.  The purpose of this study is to model complex patient-centered data that may predict those patients that will benefit from IHT by identifying pre-transport electronic phenotypes, and to determine who will benefit from air versus ground transfer. To fully leverage the data repository, this study will employ a data science approach that leverages statistical learning techniques to achieve the following aims: 1) Identify and rank specific combinations of comorbidities, active medical problems, and physiologic instability indicators according to frequency and impact on post-IHT mortality, and 2) Identify electronic phenotypes of IHT patients that benefit from air transfer according to health outcomes (hospital discharge status and functional status). After conducting exploratory data analysis and reducing variables with repeated measures, we will employ Association Rules to identify significant combinations of covariates to include in final model development (Aim 1). Then in Aim 2 we will use Random Forest to identify the most impactful variables from all of the available variables that will be analyzed via Classification and Regression Tree to identify distinct subgroups of patients that benefit from IHT by air transport. The individual characteristics identified from this data driven approach will provide the evidence needed to support future applications to develop clinical decision support for use by clinicians, patients, and families when making transfer decisions. Project Narrative Air Medical Transport (AMT), the use of helicopters and jets to transfer patients from one hospital to another, has been shown to save lives for patients with immediately life threatening conditions such as trauma or heart attack; for patients not experiencing an emergency, the impact of using AMT and transferring is unknown. To increase our understanding of the impact that AMT has for patients not experiencing an emergency, we will identify the patient characteristics and transport factors that improve patient survival after transport. Our study will be the first to provide evidence to support informed conversations between patients, families, and providers to guide those making the difficult decisions of if and how to transfer to another hospital.",Identifying Electronic Phenotypes associated with Patient Health Outcomes of Interhospital Transfer Patients,9515376,R15NR017792,"['Address', 'Air', 'Behavioral Model', 'Belief', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Emergency Situation', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Helicopter', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hypotension', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Length of Stay', 'Life', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Outcome', 'Patient Transfer', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Research', 'School Nursing', 'Severity of illness', 'Stroke', 'Students', 'Support System', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'Trees', 'United States', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'cost', 'data warehouse', 'design', 'experience', 'faculty support', 'forest', 'functional status', 'health care delivery', 'improved', 'member', 'model development', 'mortality', 'novel strategies', 'patient oriented', 'patient subsets', 'repository', 'support tools']",NINR,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,R15,2018,150000,0.013306709911011013
"Multiparametric Prediction of Vasospasm after Subarachnoid Hemorrhage ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (SAH) affects an estimated 14.5 per 100,000 persons in the United States, and is a substantial burden on health care resources, because it can cause long-term functional and cognitive disability. Much of this is due to delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) from vasospasm (VSP). VSP refers to the reactive narrowing of cerebral blood vessels due the unusual presence of blood surrounding the vessel. In its extreme, severe VSP precludes blood flow to brain tissue, resulting in stroke.  SAH is one of the most common disease entities treated in the Neurointensive Care Unit (NICU). Currently, resource planning is scripted around the Modified Fisher Scale, which predicts the odds ratio of developing DCI based on the volume and pattern of blood on initial brain computed tomography (CT). It does not, however, allow for further individualized risk assessments. The first 14 days are occupied by efforts to detect preclinical or early VSP and arrange timely interventions to prevent permanent injury. The only noninvasive tool supported by guidelines to potentially identify preclinical VSP is the transcrania Doppler (TCD), which has an unreliable range of sensitivity and negative predictive values, and is at the mercy of technician availability. If not identified preclinically, VSP must be detected once it is symptomatic and is then dependent on quality and availability of expertise in the complex and diurnal environment of the ICU.  Promisingly, electronic medical record (EMR) data and continuous physiology monitors offer abundant opportunities to risk stratify for future events as well as reveal events in real-time in the acutely brain injured patient. A methodical approach to feature engineering will be performed over a large set of potentially discriminatory data-driven and knowledge-based features. Meta-features representing variations and trends in time series variables will be extracted using a variety of quantitative and symbolic abstraction techniques. Predictive modeling will be performed using Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine.  This project will result in a prediction tool that improves timeliness and precision in VSP classification. It will fill an important gap in the understanding of the potentia of underutilized EMR and physiological data to predict neurological decline. Generating accurate and timely prediction rules from already collected clinical data would be cost effective and have implications not only for SAH patients, but also for almost any monitored patient in any ICU. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    This project will explore the optimal methods for creating a prediction tool that improves timeliness and precision of diagnosis. It will fill an important gap in the understanding of the underutilized potential of electronic medical record and high frequency device monitor data.

"Novel Techniques for Evaluating and Assessing Symptoms, Affect. Heart Rhythm and Functional Status in Patients with Atrial Fibrillation: miAfib Project Project Summary/Abstract Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most prevalent, major arrhythmia in the United States. It leads to an increased risk of stroke, congestive heart failure, and overall mortality. AF is also characterized by symptoms in a majority of patients that can result in significant decreases in health related quality of life and functional status, which are strong predictors of all-cause and cardiovascular hospitalizations in patients with AF. Therefore, improvement in symptoms is an important therapeutic goal in the management of patients with AF along with reducing the risk of stroke and mortality. However, previous studies evaluating symptoms in AF have been limited by their retrospective assessment of symptoms that limits our ability to assess the relationship between heart rhythm, symptoms, affect and functional status in real time. To address all of these gaps, we propose an innovative study that will intensively examine 100 patients with paroxysmal AF using a continuous heart rhythm recorder and a novel mobile application to collect data on symptom and affect ratings during multiple occasions across a day for three weeks. We will then be able to examine the relationship between symptoms, affect, heart rhythm as well as additional features within the ECG recording and assess their effect on functional status in patients with AF. We hypothesize that 1) some symptoms will be much more specifically indicative of being in AF (e.g. palpitations) than others (e.g. fatigue) 2) ECG features derived from signal processing and machine learning algorithms (especially those that serve as surrogates for autonomic function) will be more sensitive and specific for determining the presence and severity of symptoms compared to average heart rate 3) there will be a strong relationship between affect, and both symptoms and functional status . The overarching goal of this proposal is for candidate (Hamid Ghanbari, MD, MPH) to develop an independent research program examining symptoms and associated decline in functional status in patients with paroxysmal AF. The candidate will build upon his previous training by partnering with a team of mentors who are experts in ecological momentary assessment methodology, signal processing and machine learning, affect, and functional status to acquire expertise in evaluation of repeated, real-time assessments of symptoms and to explore novel ECG features that predict symptoms beyond the presence or absence of AF. In concert with the proposed study, the candidate will also pursue didactic training and one-on-one mentoring related to his research aims. This proposal will more clearly characterize symptoms and their physiological and psychological correlates and their subsequent influence on functional status in patients with AF. The insights obtained through this proposal could eventually lead to individualized behavioral and medical interventions that best address these symptoms and associated dysfunction. Project Narrative - Public Health Relevance Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most prevalent arrhythmia in the United States and is associated with an increase in the risk of stroke, congestive heart failure and overall mortality. Despite the importance of AF, our understanding of symptoms associated with AF is limited by studies that rely on evaluation of symptoms based on a single clinical visit. The overarching goal of this proposal is to explore the complex relationship between symptoms, heart rhythm, and affect and assess their influence on day-to-day functioning using wearable sensors and a smartphone based mobile application.","Novel Techniques for Evaluating and Assessing Symptoms, Affect.

"Instrumental screening for dysphagia by combining high-resolution cervical auscultation with advanced data analysis tools to identify silent dysphagia and silent aspiration ABSTRACT Dysphagia (disordered swallowing) causes nearly 150,000 annual hospitalizations and over 220,000 additional hospital days, and prolongs hospital lengths of stay by 40%. Dysphagia risk is typically identified through subjective screening methods and those identified through screening undergo gold standard imaging testing such as videofluoroscopy (VF). However, screening methods over- or underestimate risk, and completely fail to identify patients with silent dysphagia (e.g., silent aspiration) that can cause pneumonia and other adverse events. Pre-emptive detection of silent or near-silent aspiration is essential. The long term goal is to develop an instrumental dysphagia screening approach based on high-resolution cervical auscultation (HRCA) in order to early predict dysphagia-related adverse events, and initiate intervention measures to mitigate them. The overall objective here is to develop accurate, advanced data analysis approaches to translate HRCA signals to swallowing events observed in VF images. Our strong preliminary data has led us to our central hypothesis: advanced data analytics tools are suitable approaches for the analysis of HRCA in order to automate dysphagia screening. The rationale is that a reliable, robust early-warning instrumental dysphagia screening approach will reduce adverse events in patients with silent aspiration/dysphagia, shorten length of stay and improve overall clinical outcomes. Guided by strong preliminary data, we will pursue the following three specific aims: (1) develop machine learning algorithms to differentiate HRCA signals produced by swallowing physiologic events from similar, non-swallow related signals produced during swallowing; (2) translate HRCA swallowing-signal signatures to actual swallow physiologic events to detect abnormal swallowing physiology; and (3) discriminate normal from abnormal airway protection and swallow physiology via machine-learning analysis of HRCA signals with similar accuracy as VF. Under the first aim, a machine learning approach will be used to detect pharyngeal swallowing events and differentiate them from speech, cough and other non- swallow events, with 90% accuracy, when compared to a human expert’s interpretation of our VF data sets. Under the second aim, objective swallowing physiology observations from VF will be matched to swallowing events observed with HRCA in order to show that abnormal swallow physiology and airway protection will produce distinctive HRCA signal signatures that predict the same events identified with VF. Under the third aim, analytical algorithms will be used to detect signs of disordered airway protection in HRCA signal signatures with 90% accuracy when compared to a human expert’s airway protection ratings from VF images. The approach is innovative, as it will produce analysis tools that will infer about dysphagia and aspiration based on the analysis of HRCA with unprecedented accuracy, before patients are placed in harm’s way. Our work is significant, because it will translate to an early-warning HRCA screening tool that predicts dysphagia- related adverse events in asymptomatic patients reducing medical adverse events, and length of stay. The proposed research is relevant to public health because dysphagia is related to nearly 150,000 annual hospitalizations and over 220,000 additional hospital days, it increases pneumonia incidence, prolongs hospital stays by 40% for patients with many diseases, and is prevalent in acute care hospitals and nursing homes. Choking (airway obstruction) and pneumonia due to aspiration (inhalation of swallowed food and liquids), are common results of dysphagia, and both are preventable when dysphagia is identified before patients are offered oral food, liquids or medications. The proposed research is relevant to the part of NIH’s mission that pertains to enhancing health, lengthening life and reducing illnesses, as we will develop new data analytics tools to be used along with high-resolution cervical auscultation in order to instrumentally screen for dysphagia and predict dysphagia-related adverse events before they can harm patients with dysphagia.",Instrumental screening for dysphagia by combining high-resolution cervical auscultation with advanced data analysis tools to identify silent dysphagia and silent aspiration,9540043,R01HD092239,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Adult', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Aspirate substance', 'Aspiration Pneumonia', 'Auscultation', 'Biomechanics', 'Caring', 'Cervical', 'Choking', 'Clinical', 'Coughing', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Deglutition', 'Deglutition Disorders', 'Dehydration', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Device Designs', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disabled Persons', 'Disease', 'Equipment', 'Event', 'Food', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Group Homes', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Health', 'Hospital Nursing', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Inhalation', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Length of Stay', 'Life', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Malnutrition', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nature', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Nursing Homes', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Pneumonia', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Screening procedure', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speech', 'Stroke', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Water', 'Work', 'airway obstruction', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'clinical practice', 'clinically significant', 'image processing', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'kinematics', 'mortality', 'patient safety', 'predictive signature', 'predictive tools', 'screening', 'tool', 'translational impact', 'vibration']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2018,304104,0.007657351215185782
"FAST platform for same-shift, complete antibiotic menu antibiotic susceptibility testing The goal of this Phase I SBIR proposal is to demonstrate utility to all major pathogenic bacterial strains of SeLux’s rapid, low-cost, phenotypic antibiotic susceptibility test (AST) system (fast-AST or FAST). Utilizing existing optical detectors and standard dried antibiotic microplates, and avoiding pitfalls of metabolic probes, FAST will potentially transform therapy of infections by significantly accelerating AST, thereby facilitating treatment with the optimal antibiotic. Aim 1 will apply FAST to hundreds of samples of pathogenic bacterial strains, while developing and optimizing a predictive algorithm for clinical utility. Aim 2 will extend the FAST platform to slow-growing strains and species as well. SeLux has demonstrated FAST to exceed FDA 510(k) requirements for minimum inhibitory concentration determinations for 25+ strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli with full antibiotic panels. Completion of the proposed aims will expand FAST to all major clinically-relevant, non-fastidious bacterial pathogens. SeLux’s interdisciplinary team has expertise in nanosensing, microbiology, and algorithm design and is buttressed by distinguished experts in Clinical Microbiology, Infectious Disease, and Machine Learning. The new paradigm in clinical medicine is value-based healthcare, which requires rapid and accurate diagnoses leading to optimal patient treatment. Nowhere is this more important than in treating infections, where doctors are currently forced to overprescribe broad-spectrum antibiotics during an agonizing 48+ hour wait for antibiotic susceptibility test (AST) results. The novel, rapid, low-cost AST platform described in this proposal promises to reduce this delay in treatment by as much as 30 hours. This advance would be transformative for the treatment of infections because current over-use of broad-spectrum antibiotics not only harms individual patients but is a primary contributor to the growing epidemic of antibiotic resistance.","FAST platform for same-shift, complete antibiotic menu antibiotic susceptibility testing",9464993,R43AI136125,"['Agreement', 'Algorithm Design', 'Algorithms', 'Amplifiers', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotic susceptibility', 'Antibiotics', 'Bacterial Antibiotic Resistance', 'Biological Assay', 'Blinded', 'Blood', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Microbiology', 'Combating Antibiotic Resistant Bacteria', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnostic', 'End Point Assay', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Epidemic', 'Escherichia coli', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Healthcare', 'Hour', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Infection', 'Institutes', 'Invaded', 'Laboratories', 'Length of Stay', 'Machine Learning', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Minimum Inhibitory Concentration measurement', 'Optics', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Plague', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Privatization', 'Quality of Care', 'Reagent', 'Recovery', 'Regulatory Affairs', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Scientist', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Speed', 'Staphylococcus aureus', 'System', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Vancomycin', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'combat', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'cost effectiveness', 'design', 'detector', 'individual patient', 'instrument', 'nanosensors', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'pathogen', 'performance tests', 'prediction algorithm', 'prototype', 'rapid diagnosis']",NIAID,"SELUX DIAGNOSTICS, INC.",R43,2018,298851,0.006606326100973454
"Towards automated phenotyping in epilepsy Over 5 million children and adults in the United States have had a diagnosis of epilepsy or a seizure disorder. However, treatment options for the epilepsies remain inadequate, because many patients suffer from uncontrolled seizures and from the negative side effects of treatment. A major obstacle to the faster development of new anti-convulsant therapies is the fact that rigorous preclinical epilepsy research typically requires labor-intensive and expensive 24/7 video-EEG monitoring of seizures that rests on the subjective scoring of seizure phenotypes by human observers (as exemplified by the widely used Racine scale of behavioral seizures). We propose to test if it is possible to perform objective, inexpensive and automated phenotyping of mice in various mouse models of acquired and genetic epilepsies. The approach rests on the recent recognition that mouse behaviors are structured in stereotyped modules at sub-second timescales that are arranged according to specific rules. These characteristic behavioral modules, and the transitions between them, can be identified without observer bias by combined 3D imaging and machine learning (ML) -assisted analytic methods. We propose to adopt this novel ML-assisted 3D video analysis technology to epilepsy research, in order to test if it can be used to identify mice with chronic temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) during inter-ictal and ictal periods in two distinct experimental TLE models, and under various experimental conditions. In addition, we will also test whether the approach is able to automatically detect not only the overtly epileptic mice in a genetic model of severe childhood epilepsy (homozygous voltage-gated sodium channel β-subunit SCN1B-/- knock-out mice), but also distinguish the seemingly normal, non-epileptic, SCN1B+/- heterozygous mice from the wild-type controls. We anticipate that these results will have a potentially transformative effect on the field by demonstrating the feasibility and power of automated, objective, user-independent, inexpensive analysis of acquired and genetic epilepsy phenotypes. There is an urgent need for new therapies for patients with uncontrolled epilepsy. The project will test if it is possible to objectively characterize epileptic phenotypes in mice using a breakthrough technology involving machine learning-assisted analysis of 3-dimensional video data of behavior.

"Non-invasive device to assist selecting the level-of-amputation in patients with peripheral arterial disease 1 Abstract  2  3 This is a Phase I SBIR proposal to develop a non-contact and non-invasive imaging device for assisting clinicians  4 in selecting the appropriate level-of-amputation (LOA) in limbs with peripheral arterial disease (PAD). Surgeons  5 prefer to salvage as much limb tissue as possible during amputation to increase patient mobility while decreasing  6 morbidity and mortality. However, clinicians must balance this preference against the likelihood of primary wound  7 healing at a given level of amputation (LOA), which decreases with more distal amputations. There are no gold-  8 standard tests to aid clinicians in selecting the LOA in patients with PAD, therefore reported rates of re-  9 amputation in current practice are substantial. Up to 20% percent of above-the-knee amputations to 35% of 10 foot amputations require revision to a more proximal level. Furthermore, physician awareness of the risk for 11 re-amputation may lead to overly aggressive selection of LOA to more proximal levels in some cases. Indeed, 12 certain patients may receive amputations at a level more proximal than is necessary because their surgeon could 13 not confidently predict a high likelihood of healing at a more distal level. 14 15 In current practice, selection of LOA is determined qualitatively by clinical judgment of the surgeon using patient 16 history and physical exam. Others have developed quantitative tests that assess local microcirculation. These 17 technologies have not superseded clinical judgement. To address this critical problem, SpectralMD is 18 developing an imaging device that integrates multispectral imaging with a machine learning algorithm 19 to provide a quantitative assessment of the healing potential of a selected LOA whereas current clinical 20 practice is only capable of qualitative assessment. 21 22 We have proof-of-concept of our technology’s ability to characterize microvascular blood flow changes in a 23 patient with critical limb ischemia. In this proposal, we intend to establish the utility of our device for predicting 24 the healing potential of a clinician selected LOA by demonstrating the effectiveness of DeepView assessment 25 on a large set of pre-amputation images. To this end we will conduct a Phase I pilot study for the use of our 26 device in predicting the healing potential of a clinician selected LOA. This clinical study will develop a data set 27 for training the algorithm, and deliver a clear demonstration of feasibility for completing the development on an 28 algorithm that has high accuracy in predicting the healing potential of the proposed amputation site. Following 29 this work, we will apply for a Phase II proposal intended to finalize algorithm training, validate the algorithm 30 developed in Phase I, and establish a successful regulatory and commercialization pathway. Narrative In patients with peripheral arterial disease, reported rates of re-amputation due to non-healing of a primary amputation are very significant—approximately 20% of below-the-knee amputations require eventual revision, with even higher rates established for amputations at the level of the foot. There are no gold-standard tests for selection of level of amputation (LOA) to aid clinical judgment. To address this critical problem, SpectralMD is developing the DeepView-Gen2 imaging device that integrates multispectral imaging and a machine learning algorithm to quantitatively measure microvascular blood flow and tissue healing potential to assist in the clinical selection of LOA and minimize the incidence of re-amputation and its associated morbidity and mortality.",Non-invasive device to assist selecting the level-of-amputation in patients with peripheral arterial disease,9622035,R43HL142428,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Amputation', 'Ankle', 'Architecture', 'Awareness', 'Blood flow', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Contracts', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Distal', 'Effectiveness', 'Elements', 'Equilibrium', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Incidence', 'Investigation', 'Ischemia', 'Judgment', 'Knee', 'Lead', 'Limb structure', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical History', 'Microcirculation', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Peripheral arterial disease', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Postoperative Period', 'Practice Guidelines', 'Quality of life', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Secondary to', 'Site', 'Skin Tissue', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Specificity', 'Standardization', 'Surgeon', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Work', 'Wound Healing', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'clinical risk', 'commercialization', 'design', 'foot', 'healing', 'indexing', 'mortality', 'non-invasive imaging', 'patient mobility', 'phase 1 study', 'preference', 'standard of care', 'success', 'wound']",NHLBI,"SPECTRAL MD, INC.",R43,2018,196561,-0.00701081160159953
"Tailored Drug Titration through Artificial Intelligence Optima Integrated Health Inc. (Optima) proposes to demonstrate the clinical efficacy of the decision support technology for medication treatment optimization it validated in a pilot clinical trial, optima4BP. optima4BP is designed as a physician decision/action support aid in timely and safely optimizing medication treatment independent of in-office visits, for patients with uncontrolled hypertension (HTN). optima4BP is designed to reduce preventable hospitalizations and the associated incidence of stroke, heart failure (HF) or myocardial infarction (MI) events resulting from high blood pressure (BP) above goal. Uncontrolled HTN affects 34 million Americans. The cost of HTN-associated hospitalizations is $113 billion, or 15% of all hospital costs, with >135 million Emergency Dptm. (ED) visits. optima4BP will improve the quality of life for uncontrolled HTN patients, and reduce this massive burden on the US healthcare system. Our long term objective is to help drive the transformation from the reactive pay-for-service healthcare paradigm to one that emphasizes preventative care through personalized health surveillance, assessment, and action via timely and safely optimized medication treatment. Our specific aims include: Aim (1) demonstrating the efficacy of optima4BP in a randomized clinical trial (n=300 patients) deployed at UC San Francisco Medical Center. Patients will be randomized to an enhanced care (EC) arm or an optima4BP arm (O4BP). All patients will use Omron10 BP arm cuff to remotely measure their BP. For the patients in the EC arm, physicians will be provided with a monthly summary of the Omron10 data. For patients in the O4BP arm, aside from the BP monthly summary, physicians will receive (a) a risk stratified patient roster, (b) next step actions in medication optimization for each patient, and (c) access to optima4BP's secure web-service medication treatment modeling to investigate how changing current patient data could affect medication choice (e.g., change in medication choice if BP goal is lowered). We will then examine the BP value reduction between arms (success:>7 mmHg decreased systolic; >4 mmHg decreased diastolic of O4BP vs. EC), along with secondary outcomes between O4BP and EC: medication treatment action frequency; ED admissions due to HTN-related symptoms and associated hospitalizations for stroke, HF or MI; and overall cost of HTN management. Aim (2) optima4BP data processing steps will be optimized to scale-up its capability to >1000/day patient cases processing power. 3 specific optimization processing tools will be developed: Optima Extract, Transform, and Load (OETL); Optima Survey Generator (OSG), and Optima Message Builder (OMB). OETL will provide streamlined scheduling logic to extracting data from Epic® EMR (electronic medical record), optimize data mapping scripts within optima4BP, and optimize data uploading protocols. OSG will optimize the current generation protocol for patient surveys, patient response, and assignment of patient responses to specific processing modules. OMB will ensure streamlined scheduling of risk stratification updates and scheduled delivery to physician In-Basket messaging system within Epic® EHR. Our goal is to simplify the management of high blood pressure (BP) while improving the quality of care of patients and reducing the associated costs. We will investigate the benefits of a novel surveillance- assessment-medication treatment action artificial intelligence (optima4BP) as a physician decision support aid in timely and safely optimizing medication treatment independent of in-office visits, with the goal of reducing preventable hospitalizations and the associated incidence of stroke, heart failure or heart attack events.",Tailored Drug Titration through Artificial Intelligence,9494417,R44HL132622,"['Admission activity', 'Adoption', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Age', 'American', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Blood Pressure', 'Businesses', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Comorbidity', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Emergency Situation', 'Emergency department visit', 'Ensure', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Gender', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart failure', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospitalization', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Hypertension', 'Intelligence', 'Intervention Studies', 'Laboratories', 'Life Style', 'Logic', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Modeling', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Office Visits', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Preventive care', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of Care', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'San Francisco', 'Schedule', 'Secure', 'Site', 'Stroke', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Titrations', 'Update', 'Visit', 'arm', 'base', 'blood pressure reduction', 'blood pressure regulation', 'care coordination', 'clinical efficacy', 'cloud based', 'commercial application', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'design', 'health care delivery', 'health care service', 'health data', 'hypertension control', 'hypertension treatment', 'improved', 'innovative technologies', 'medication compliance', 'novel', 'patient response', 'patient stratification', 'primary outcome', 'scale up', 'secondary outcome', 'stroke incidence', 'stroke risk', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment optimization', 'web services']",NHLBI,"OPTIMA INTEGRATED HEALTH, INC.",R44,2018,649649,-0.009399215652487521
"Developing Classification Criteria for the Uveitides ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The uveitides are a collection of ~30 distinct diseases characterized by intraocular infection. Each disease has its own features, course, treatment, and prognosis. Traditionally, the uveitides have been grouped by the primary anatomic site of inflammation as anterior uveitis, intermediate uveitis, posterior uveitis, and panuveitis. However, there are substantial limitations to this ""lumping"" of diseases. For example, among the posterior uveitides, some (e.g. toxoplasmic retinitis and cytomegalovirus retinitis) are infectious and require treatment with antimicrobial/antiviral agents, some are chronic, presumed immune-mediated diseases that require immunosuppression (e.g. birdshot chorioretinitis, multifocal choroiditis, serpiginous choroiditis), and a few are self-limited, spontaneously-remitting diseases with a good prognosis (e.g. acute posterior multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy and multiple evanescent white dot syndrome). As such precise diagnosis is critical for research, including epidemiology, translational pathogenesis research, outcomes research, and disease specific clinical trials. Classification criteria are a type of ""diagnostic"" criteria used for reserch purposes. Although classification criteria seek to optimize sensitivity and specificity, when a trade-off is required, they emphasize specificity in order to ensure that a homogeneous group of patients is being studied. A precise phenotype is required particularly for genomic risk factor studies of complex disorders and translational pathogenesis research, as inclusion of other diseases with different risk factors and disease mechanisms would confound the results. Currently there are no widely-accepted and validated classification criteria for any of the uveitides. Preliminary data indicate ""fair to moderate"" agreement at best on the independent diagnosis of any one case by uveitis experts (κ's 0.27-0.40), but the ability of committees to reach agreement on the diagnosis of >98% of cases. The goal of the ""Developing Classification Criteria for the Uveitides"" project is for the Standardization of Uveitis Nomenclature (SUN) Working Group to develop classification criteria for the 25 leading uveitides using a formal, rigorous approach. There are 4 phases to the project: 1) informatics, to develop a standardized terminology; 2) case collection, to develop a preliminary database of ~250 cases of each disease; 3) case selection, to select at least 150-200 cases of each disease that are generally accepted to be the disease (using formal consensus techniques) from the preliminary database into a final database; and 4) data analysis, using machine learning approaches, of the final database to develop a parsimonious set of criteria for each disease that minimizes misclassification. The informatics and case collection phases of the Project are complete. The case selection phase is well underway and uses online voting and consensus conference calls to achieve supermajority acceptance on all cases included in the final database. The goals of this application are to complete case selection and data analysis and develop classification criteria for the 25 of the major uveitides. These results are crucial to future clinical research i the field of uveitis. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Collectively, the uveitides are the 5th leading cause of blindness in the U.S., and the cost of treating them is estimated to be similar to that of treating diabetic retinopathy. Because uveitis occurs in all age groups, including children and working-age adults, there is a greater potential for years of vision lost than with age- related diseases. Clinical research in the field of uveitis has been hampered by diagnostic imprecision and a lack of widely-accepted and validated classification criteria, the development of which is the goal of this application; these criteria are needed urgently to advance epidemiology, genomic research, translational pathogenesis research, outcomes research, and disease-specific clinical trials.",Developing Classification Criteria for the Uveitides,9472335,R01EY026593,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior uveitis', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Blindness', 'Child', 'Choroiditis', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'Cytomegalovirus Retinitis', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Future', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Immune', 'Immunosuppression', 'Infection', 'Inflammation', 'Informatics', 'Intermediate Uveitis', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Nomenclature', 'Outcomes Research', 'Panuveitis', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Pigments', 'Posterior Uveitis', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Retinitis', 'Risk Factors', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specificity', 'Standardization', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Terminology', 'United States', 'Uveitis', 'Vision', 'Visual impairment', 'Voting', 'age group', 'age related', 'aging population', 'antimicrobial', 'birdshot chorioretinitis', 'cost', 'outcome forecast', 'public health relevance', 'symposium', 'tool', 'web page', 'working group']",NEI,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2018,418408,0.0029789358284465343
"Detecting and Monitoring Tardive Dyskinesia to Improve Patient Outcomes Tardive dyskinesia (TD) is a common debilitating side effect of antipsychotic use. Characterized most notably by involuntary facial movements such as grimacing, involuntary lip, mouth, and tongue movements, and eye blinking, TD is difficult to treat and potentially irreversible. Psychiatrists and other mental health professionals are acutely aware of the impairment and disability experienced by patients who develop TD. Early detection of TD is critical so that appropriate interventions can be instituted. Unfortunately, despite professionals’ best efforts, it is often too late in the process and the involuntary movements are permanent. Antipsychotic prescriptions exceeded 50 million in 2011 and the reported incidence of TD is between 13% and 24%. Risk grows with advancing age, off-label uses, and chronic exposure to antipsychotics. Therefore, prevention and early detection are key to managing TD. However, current methods for monitoring patients require observation of patients at infrequent in-person visits or self-reporting by vigilant patients and their families. Therefore strong market potential exists for an automated detection system. This Phase I project proposes to leverage existing telepsychiatry and video interview data gathering technologies available commercially to efficiently collect and analyze one hundred ten (110) 5-minute video interviews with individuals taking anti-psychotic medications. Half of the interviews will be with individuals living with diagnosed TD and the other without a diagnosis of TD. The participants in the study will be recruited to ensure an equal distribution of females and males as well as an ethnically and racially representative sample. The proposed data gathering strategy will provide the source material necessary to create a powerful supervised machine learning derived video and audio analysis tool to detect TD. The detection tool will be created using 80% of the collected video data as a training set and validated on the remaining 20% reserved as the control set. Based on industry experience with other supervised machine learning training sets and the amount of data to be collected, we set a goal of a 90% success rate in identifying TD positive and TD negative participants in the control set. Once the detection tool is complete the project will conclude by incorporating access to the tool into an existing smartphone app, iRxReminder, that is used for data gathering and monitoring of medication adherence. The iRxReminder system links patients directly to researchers’ and healthcare professionals’ electronic records. The modified app will be tested in the laboratory to ensure the interface can be easily used. The addendum request includes additional funding to participate in the I-Corp training. Participants in the training will include CEO and PI/PD Anthony Sterns PhD, C-level executive Fred Pollock serving as iRxReminder’s CBO, and Industry Expert Fred Ma, MD PhD, who serves as iRxReminder’s regulatory consultant. In Phase II the iRxReminder system will be validated for use in supporting the self-management and symptom monitoring of medication taking by individuals living with chronic mental illnesses. Once feasibility is established, we propose a year-long RCT where participants will be monitored for early detection of TD along with goals for high adherence, improved control of symptoms and side effects, and more aggressive and frequent treatment responses by the healthcare team. A recent study reported that TD rates among newly treated elderly ranged from 7.2% for those taking Risperidone to 11.1% for those taking olanzapine after 2 years of treatment. Earlier meta-analyses estimate TD frequency in women to be 26.6% and in men 21.6%. Ethnically Chinese and Malaysian mental health patients were studied in Singapore and patients taking anti-psychotic medications were found to have TD in 40% and 29% of cases respectively. Regardless of prevalence, TD is a threat to patient adherence and quality of life. TD only remits in a minority of cases and can be permanent. With 50 million prescriptions for anti-psychotics written annually, more than 10 million persons living with a chronic mental illness are at risk of developing TD. There are likely over 6 million patients living with TD and the number of patients with TD is expected to grow with the aging population and increasing off- label use of antipsychotics.!",Detecting and Monitoring Tardive Dyskinesia to Improve Patient Outcomes,9660614,R43MH114763,"['Acute', 'Addendum', 'Adherence', 'Adverse effects', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Awareness', 'Blinking', 'Chinese People', 'Chronic', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Ensure', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Family', 'Female', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health Professional', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Involuntary Movements', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Lip structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Malaysian', 'Medical Care Team', 'Mental Health', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'Oral cavity', 'Participant', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patient observation', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Psychiatrist', 'Quality of life', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risperidone', 'Sampling', 'Self Management', 'Singapore', 'Source', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Tardive Dyskinesia', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tongue', 'Training', 'Visit', 'Woman', 'aging population', 'base', 'compliance behavior', 'disability', 'experience', 'improved', 'male', 'medication compliance', 'men', 'olanzapine', 'racial and ethnic', 'recruit', 'severe mental illness', 'smartphone Application', 'success', 'symptom management', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NIMH,"CREATIVE ACTION, LLC",R43,2018,50000,0.004800152845802893
"Sepsis Early Prediction and Subphenotype Illumination Study (SEPSIS) PROJECT SUMMARY Sepsis, defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction in response to infection, is a devastating condition that contributes to up to half of hospital deaths and over $24 billion in healthcare costs in the U.S. annually. Over 750,000 patients develop sepsis in the U.S. each year, and survivors suffer long-term cognitive impairment and physical disability. Historically, sepsis research has focused on patients who are already critically ill. However, up to 50% of patients with sepsis receive their care on the inpatient wards, and only 10% of patients with sepsis are initially diagnosed in the intensive care unit (ICU). Because early intervention improves outcomes in sepsis, it is important to optimize the detection and treatment of sepsis outside the ICU.  The current sepsis paradigm has several problems. The first problem is that early identification of infection relies on clinician intuition, and caregivers often disagree regarding which patients are infected. This leads to delays in therapy and increased mortality in some patients and unnecessary therapies and adverse medication side effects in others. A second problem is that there is a lack of accurate tools to risk stratify infected patients outside the ICU after they are identified. Some patients with infection are treated outside the ICU and are later discharged home, while others develop life-threatening complications and die in the hospital. Accurate risk stratification of infected patients would bring additional critical care resources to the bedside of the high-risk patients that need them most. A third problem with the current sepsis paradigm is that it is often treated as a one-size-fits-all syndrome. However, patients with sepsis have a wide range of clinical presentations and outcomes due to the complex interactions between patient risk factors, the infectious organism, and the host immune response. These data suggest that the impact of timely and more aggressive interventions on outcomes may differ based on a patient's clinical phenotype. Identifying important subphenotypes of infected patients is critical to delivering more personalized care at the bedside.  The purpose of this project is to use data from the electronic health record and statistical modeling techniques to identify high-risk infected patients and important new subphenotypes of this syndrome. In Aim 1, we will develop a novel tool for identifying infected patients outside the ICU using modern machine learning techniques. In Aim 2, we will develop a tool for risk stratifying infected patients outside the ICU using machine learning methods. Finally, in Aim 3 we will use cluster analysis techniques to determine whether the benefit of early and more aggressive interventions varies based on clinical phenotype. Our project will provide clinicians with powerful new tools to identify high-risk infected patients and important new subphenotypes of this common and deadly syndrome. This work will help to deliver early, life-saving care to the bedside of septic patients and lead to future interventional trials aimed at decreasing preventable death.

"Automated quantitative CT imaging of epicardial adipose tissue and risk of cardiac events PROJECT SUMMARY Coronary artery disease remains the leading cause of death worldwide, and more than half of the individuals suffering acute myocardial infarction have no prior symptoms. Coronary calcium scoring with non-contrast CT is increasingly used for cardiovascular risk stratification in the asymptomatic population. Epicardial adipose tissue (EAT), a local visceral fat depot surrounding the heart, has been recently reported as a significant imaging biomarker for cardiovascular risk stratification. Despite being routinely imaged noninvasively by non-contrast cardiac CT for coronary calcium scoring, EAT features are currently not measured or reported, primarily due to the absence of robust, automated quantification methods.  We propose to employ novel image processing algorithms to achieve fully automated, robust quantification of EAT features from cardiac CT, and to apply machine learning methods to efficiently combine patient clinical data, coronary calcium and EAT features into a new integrated risk score to predict future cardiac events. We will evaluate this risk score in two existing, prospective registries of asymptomatic patients with available coronary calcium scans, clinical data, and followup for cardiac events (myocardial infarction, cardiac death, late revascularization). These rich resources are: the Early Identification of Subclinical Atherosclerosis Using Non-Invasive Imaging Research [EISNER] registry (2614 patients) and the St. Francis Heart Study (4613 patients). We propose three specific aims: 1) To develop and evaluate the accuracy and reproducibility of new computational algorithms for automated quantification of EAT measures; 2) To evaluate the prognostic value of automatically-quantified EAT features, relative to atherosclerotic plaque burden and measures of obesity, for the prediction of future cardiac events in asymptomatic patients in the EISNER registry and the St. Francis Heart Study; 3) To derive and evaluate a new, integrated risk score—combining standard risk factors, coronary calcium score and EAT measures using machine learning—for the prediction of future cardiac events in the EISNER registry, and further, to additionally evaluate this risk score externally in the St. Francis Heart Study patient cohort.  This work in this proposal will provide a novel, personalized paradigm that will objectively and accurately identify asymptomatic patients undergoing coronary calcium scanning who are at increased risk for future cardiac events, without any additional imaging or risk to the patient. PROJECT NARRATIVE (lay language) CT scanning of the heart for coronary calcium scoring is a simple, widely-used, low-cost test with low radiation dose. Using these scans, the researchers propose to establish automated analysis of fat which surrounds the heart, as well as novel computerized scores that identify the patients who are at highest risk of suffering a heart attack.

"Application of Data Sciences in Traumatic Brain Injury ABSTRACT Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality, and patients with moderate-severe traumatic brain TBI often require urgent/emergent surgical and anesthesia care. Patients with TBI who have surgery have poor outcomes, attributed to a high (>50%) prevalence of perioperative second insults such as hypotension and hypocarbia, which reduce cerebral perfusion and cause cerebral ischemia. Anesthesiologists provide analgesia, sedation, immobility, and amnesia, and aim to confer physiological stability, expected patient response, real-time physiological data, and professional judgement but are unfortunately unable to accurately predict in real time which patients with TBI will have hypotension and hypocarbia. Yet, avoidance of these second insults increases discharge survival among patients with TBI. Predicting and preventing hypotension and hypocarbia during TBI care is, therefore, vital, and avoidance of hypotension and hypocarbia are key performance indicators for perioperative TBI care. Small data science studies suggest that machine learning (ML) techniques can model and predict TBI pathophysiology and help reduce unwanted second insults after TBI. The project goal is to use ML methods to prevent second insults (hypotension and hypocarbia) during urgent/emergent perioperative TBI care. In response to PA-16-161, we propose 2 Specific Aims: 1) To construct and identify the TBI physiological ML model that most accurately predicts perioperative hypotension and hypocarbia, and 2) To develop ML derived personalized prescriptions for prevention of perioperative hypotension and hypocarbia. This project is innovative and will be impactful because the approach is grounded in strong data science, and acute care, and implementation science frameworks, because it develops ML derived prescriptions to prevent hypotension and hypocarbia, and because we use ML solutions to improve care quality and outcomes after TBI. NARRATIVE Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death and disability, and patients with moderate- severe traumatic brain TBI often require urgent/emergent surgical and anesthesia care. Anesthesia care for TBI is high risk and associated with low blood pressure and hypocarbia which can cause cerebral ischemia. The project goal is to use machine learning methods to develop a prescription that prevents second insults (hypotension and hypocarbia) during urgent/emergent perioperative TBI care.",Application of Data Sciences in Traumatic Brain Injury,9685513,R21LM012922,"['Absence of pain sensation', 'Acute', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Amnesia', 'Anesthesia procedures', 'Anesthesiology', 'Anesthetics', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Blood Pressure', 'Brain', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Cerebral Ischemia', 'Cerebrum', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Dose', 'Epilepsy', 'Event', 'Fibrinogen', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Hour', 'Hypotension', 'Hypoxemia', 'Image', 'Injury', 'Intracranial Pressure', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nature', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Perioperative', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Postoperative Care', 'Postoperative Period', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Preventive', 'Public Health', 'Quality of Care', 'Risk', 'Sedation procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'TBI Patients', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Treatment Factor', 'Treatment outcome', 'base', 'care outcomes', 'comparative', 'computer based statistical methods', 'disability', 'high risk', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'mortality', 'neurosurgery', 'patient response', 'prevent', 'response', 'sex', 'vasoactive agent']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R21,2018,201642,0.0013668074873558907
"Prediction of Clinical Deterioration Using a Bayesian Belief System Project Summary/Abstract Approximately 5-10% of hospitalized patients suffer significant clinical deterioration after admission, resulting in either transfer to the intensive care unit (ICU) or a ""code"" event (i.e., cardiac or pulmonary arrest). Delayed identification of these events result in increased morbidity and mortality. Unfortunately, existing prediction models result in multiple false alarms for every true positive alarm that they generate. In addition with every passing year, new monitoring systems are introduced that generate more false alarms, resulting in alarm fatigue which has been associated with patient deaths. The objective of this mentored career development proposal is to develop and assess novel computational algorithms that can predict the clinical deterioration of hospitalized patients earlier and more accurately than clinicians or conventional early warning systems, thereby allowing for timely intervention. Building upon our experience in the hematologic malignancy subpopulation of hospitalized patients, this new effort: 1) provides a foundation upon which to combine newer machine learning (ML) methods and clinical informatics to improve the capabilities of the model for an individual patient or specific subgroup; 2) assesses the impact and value of different variables from the electronic medical record (EMR) as part of the predictive model; and 3) broadens the evaluation of this approach to additional real-world patient populations, enabling insight into the translation of the models to clinical usage. The specific aims of this project are thus: Specific Aims Aim 1 To identify and extract model variables (features) from the EMR, evaluating different feature selection  methods to optimize different predictive criterion and their impact on ML algorithms. Aim 2 To develop an ML approach that handles multiple asynchronous data streams of longitudinal  information from the EMR, providing predictions on clinical deterioration in real-time. Aim 3 To explore clinician and rapid response team responses to early prediction of clinical deterioration. With successful completion of this proposal, the prediction model will be integrated into the EMR system. Future direction as part of a R01 proposal will involve external validation at other institutions and assessment of clinical impact on patient care. Relevance to Public Health Clinical deterioration in the hospital is often unexpected and is associated with increased mortality and morbidity, with the CDC reporting 17.2 million hospital admissions through the emergency department in 2010 suggesting that approximately 1 million people annually are at risk of clinical deterioration during their hospitalization. Existing early warning systems have not been able to accurately predict these events without creating an overwhelming amount of additional false positive alarms, resulting in alarm fatigue and potential harm. Our project, utilizing machine learning techniques with the large amount of available clinical data, will serve to develop a predictive model that can predict clinical deterioration earlier with a higher positive predictive value than current algorithms/models which, when implemented, will be able to provide hospitalized patients with an additional safety net.",Prediction of Clinical Deterioration Using a Bayesian Belief System,9504995,K01LM012873,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Admission activity', 'Algorithms', 'Belief System', 'Cardiac', 'Caring', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical assessments', 'Code', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Coupled', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Deterioration', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Fatigue', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Health Personnel', 'Heart Arrest', 'Hematologic Neoplasms', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Inpatients', 'Institution', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nature', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Science', 'Specificity', 'Stream', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'United Kingdom', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Workload', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'burnout', 'career development', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'clinical predictors', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'computer science', 'experience', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'mental state', 'mortality', 'novel', 'patient population', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'response', 'safety net', 'skills']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,K01,2018,205524,-0.03648379550607712
"APPLYING ERROR-CORRECTED SEQUENCING TO DETECT MINIMAL RESIDUAL IN THE AAML 1031 STUDY Abstract  Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) accounts for half of all pediatric leukemia deaths and is the leading cause of leukemia-related death in adulthood. One reason for worse outcomes is the inability to properly assess for minimal residual disease (MRD) following therapy. Unlike ALL, AML presents with multiple subclonal populations without a singular clonal surface marker, and surface markers can change during therapy. The current gold standard for AML MRD is multi-parameter flow cytometry (MPFC), which is predictive of outcomes to frequencies of 0.001, yet 30% of MPFC-MRD-negative patients still relapse. Alternatively, every AML case harbors leukemia-specific mutations that could be markers of disease, except that next-generation sequencing has high error rate of ~1%. In this proposal, we will implement a novel, validated error-corrected sequencing (ECS) strategy, developed by the Druley lab in collaboration with Illumina, to improve MRD assessment of AML subclonal heterogeneity in 990 pediatric de novo AML cases from the Children's Oncology Group AAML1031 study. We hypothesize that using a highly sensitive sequencing method will improve identification of residual AML, provide important insights on subclonal heterogeneity in pediatric AML, improve understanding of the role of germline variability and gene function on relapses or refractory disease and facilitate personalized medicine. To interrogate this hypothesis, we propose the following aims: 1. Define subclonal heterogeneity at diagnosis and end of Induction 1 (EOI1) in 990 pediatric de novo  AML patients (n=1890). By using the largest prospective study of pediatric AML that has ever been  performed, we will perform ECS on 94 genes that are the most frequently mutated genes in pediatric and  adult AML at diagnosis and EOI1 to identify patterns of mutation associated with relapsed disease, FAB  subtypes or other cytogenetic features. 2. Correlate ECS-MRD with existing EOI1 MPFC-MRD for all participants in the COG AAML1031 study.  A major question is whether the “different from normal” cell population identified as residual disease by  MPFC is actually the same population(s) identified by ECS. We will define residual disease by ECS and  compare results to MPFC status (positive/negative), actual MPFC percentages (<0.001) and the clinical  outcomes (relapse risk, disease-free survival and overall survival) of study participants. 3. Integrate germline variation and all subclonal mutations into mechanistic groups that are frequently  mutated in pediatric AML and correlate with outcomes using unbiased machine learning  algorithms. Preliminary data tells us that every patient will have multiple subclones at diagnosis and EOI1  as well as germline variants in AML-associated genes, which may be important for outcome. In this aim, we  will take these mutations into account as well as MPFC, clinical features and cytogenetics for probabilistic  risk assessment using unsupervised machine learning algorithms for improved outcome prognostication. Narrative We have developed Error-Corrected Sequencing (ECS) that enables the highly accurate detection of leukemia- specific mutations in heterogeneous DNA samples to a limit of 0.0001. We will perform ECS with a panel of 94 frequently mutated genes in adult and pediatric AML in matched diagnostic and end of Induction 1 bone marrow samples from 990 pediatric de novo AML patients enrolled on the Children's Oncology Group AAML1031 protocol, which is the largest pediatric AML trial ever performed in North America. With these data, we can truly understand subclonal heterogeneity in pediatric AML, significantly improve minimal residual disease testing in pediatric AML, and integrate these data into an unbiased multivariate probability platform taking into account individual sequencing, flow cytometry, cytogenetic and clinical features to provide truly personalized cancer care.",APPLYING ERROR-CORRECTED SEQUENCING TO DETECT MINIMAL RESIDUAL IN THE AAML 1031 STUDY,9395904,R01CA211711,"['Acute Myelocytic Leukemia', 'Adult', 'Adult Acute Myeloblastic Leukemia', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'BAY 54-9085', 'Biological Markers', 'Bone Marrow', 'Bortezomib', 'Categories', 'Cessation of life', 'Childhood', 'Childhood Acute Myeloid Leukemia', 'Childhood Leukemia', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Cytogenetics', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Enrollment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Exons', 'FLT3 gene', 'Family', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Normal Cell', 'North America', 'Oncogenes', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pediatric Oncology Group', 'Phase', 'Point Mutation', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protein Tyrosine Kinase', 'Protein phosphatase', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reagent', 'Recurrent disease', 'Refractory Disease', 'Relapse', 'Residual Neoplasm', 'Residual Tumors', 'Residual state', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk stratification', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Spliceosomes', 'Surface', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'analytical method', 'base', 'chemotherapy', 'cohesion', 'design', 'digital', 'falls', 'functional group', 'gene function', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'insight', 'leukemia', 'leukemia treatment', 'next generation', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'nucleocytoplasmic transport', 'outcome prediction', 'pediatric patients', 'personalized cancer care', 'personalized medicine', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'randomized trial', 'relapse risk', 'response', 'specific biomarkers', 'subclonal heterogeneity', 'transcription factor', 'unsupervised learning']",NCI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,352587,-0.007027276349782184
"Real-time Monitoring of Zebrafish ECG with Automated Aberrant Pattern Detection Abstract Sensoriis, Inc is a company that, develops evidence-based sensing solutions to support biological investigations and address health care problems. The goal of this NIH STTR grant with University of Washington (UW) is to provide a flexible system to assess cardiac electrical activities in zebrafish models, supporting heart disease studies and drug screening. Unlike humans, zebrafish hearts can fully regenerate following cardiac injury, thereby providing a tractable model system to study endogenous heart regeneration. Zebrafish have also proven to be an ideal vertebrate model system for phenotype-based screening owing to their physiological similarity to mammals. Further, zebrafish model enables a forward genetic approach to reveal the genetic basis and underlying molecular mechanisms of numerous heart diseases. The conventional setup for cardiac phenotype acquisition in zebrafish (i.e. electrocardiogram – ECG) involves sedation causing variation in functionality. To date, there is no system which can offer cardiac phenotype monitoring in freely-swimming zebrafish, not to mention for multiple fish simultaneously. In this context, we propose and develop 1) a wireless flexible “jacket” to be worn by zebrafish for real-time assessment of electrical cardiac phenotypes, namely ECG; and 2) a simple-yet-novel apparatus to collect ECG of multiple awake fish. Our devices provide pivotal platforms for cardiac phenotype-related investigations. The obtained data will be processed by smart algorithms to detect aberrant ECG patterns in real time. The proposed systems will facilitate related studies using zebrafish models. Further, the success of this platform also paves the avenue for regenerative medicine and developmental biology studies as well as stem cell-based therapies for cardiac repair. In Phase I of this STTR grant, we will develop i) a polymer-based microelectrode array (MEA) jacket that could be comfortably worn by the zebrafish and provide wireless ECG acquisition; and ii) a 4-chamber apparatus for simultaneous recording of ECG in awake fish. Machine learning-based programs with embedded algorithms will be developed to distinguish ECG patterns such as heart rate, ST and QT intervals, thus can identify anomalies, such as arrhythmias or prolonged QTs. For proof of concept, the system will be validated and compared. PROJECT NARRATIVE In this Phase I STTR grant, Sensoriis, Inc and the University of Washington will develop 1) a world-first wireless flexible membrane for zebrafish with a micro-electrode array (MEA) for ECG measurement and electronics for wireless powering and communication with an external unit; 2) a simple-yet-novel 4-chamber apparatus to acquire ECG of 4 awake fish; and 3) Machine learning-based programs to process the data and detect desired patterns. The goal is to facilitate and reduce cost and time of cardiac phenotype-based screening in the zebrafish models, supporting numerous studies.

"Magnetic Resonance Imaging Based Calf Muscle Perfusion To Assess Patients with Symptomatic Peripheral Artery Disease Abstract: Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is associated with impaired leg function, possible limb loss and an increased risk of cardiovascular events. Intermittent claudication (IC) is a classic PAD symptom occurring in 40% of symptomatic patients, and is associated with 5-, and 15-year mortality rates of 30% and 70%, respectively. PAD is a debilitating illness affecting more than 8.5 million Americans of age 40 and older and 202 million people globally. Despite the high prevalence, PAD patients are less likely to receive appropriate treatment for their atherosclerotic risk factors than patients with coronary artery disease. Advances in endovascular therapy have reduced risks associated with intervention, enabling revascularization as a routine procedure in patients with lower extremity ischemia. However, revascularization success rates vary substantially and numerous PAD patients do not improve at 1-year despite technically good revascularization. Previous findings suggest that alterations in the microcirculation due to a paucity of collateralization may contribute to functional impairment in PAD patients. We hypothesize that the change in microvascular perfusion can identify PAD patients who do not improve at 12-months after revascularization. We will utilize contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (CE-MRI) to assess skeletal muscle perfusion in PAD patients. The CE-MRI measures will be associated with hemodynamics and symptoms. The early identification of individuals with a likely poor prognosis post intervention could help to improve surgical treatment strategies. We will investigate the association of microvascular perfusion (Aim 1) and measures of arterial hemodynamics (Aim 2) with leg function and PAD symptoms. We will utilize machine learning methodologies to identify predictors of poor leg function and symptoms (Aim 3). Given the high incidence of PAD and the associated high risk of cardiovascular events, it is paramount to identify individuals who are less likely to improve following lower extremity revascularization. The data of this clinical imaging study will provide novel information on the etiology of microvascular blood flow in PAD. Relevance: The proposed research study is of considerable public health importance given that patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) have an increased risk of atherothrombotic cardiovascular events and mortality. The development of improved non-invasive imaging techniques to assess PAD may enable optimized treatment for individuals who are at an increased risk of future cardiovascular events.",Magnetic Resonance Imaging Based Calf Muscle Perfusion To Assess Patients with Symptomatic Peripheral Artery Disease,9534732,R01HL137763,"['Affect', 'Age', 'American', 'Ankle', 'Arteries', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical assessments', 'Comorbidity', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Development', 'Disease Outcome', 'Early identification', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'High Prevalence', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Intermittent Claudication', 'Intervention', 'Ischemia', 'Leg', 'Legal patent', 'Limb structure', 'Literature', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Methodist Church', 'Methodology', 'Microcirculation', 'Muscle', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Oxygen', 'Partial Pressure', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perfusion', 'Peripheral arterial disease', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Pilot Projects', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Reference Values', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skeletal Muscle', 'Standardization', 'Superficial Femoral Artery', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Toes', 'Treadmill Tests', 'Ultrasonography', 'Validation', 'Veterans', 'Walking', 'atherosclerosis risk', 'base', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'contrast enhanced', 'contrast imaging', 'functional disability', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'post intervention', 'recruit', 'regional difference', 'research study', 'skeletal', 'success', 'successful intervention', 'symptomatic improvement', 'treadmill', 'treatment optimization', 'treatment strategy', 'two-dimensional']",NHLBI,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2018,550853,0.0056565213224430665
"Predicting Diabetic Retinopathy from Risk Factor Data and Digital Retinal Images Abstract Diabetic retinopathy is the leading cause of blindness among US adults between the ages of 20 and 74 years. Laser photocoagulation surgery has been established as an effective way of treating retinopathy if it is detected early. Yearly retinal screening examinations are a potent tool in the battle to reduce the incidence of blindness from diabetic retinopathy because they provide diabetic patients with timely diagnoses and consequently, the potential for timely treatment. Primary care safety net clinics provide monitoring and other services for diabetic patients but they are often not equipped to provide specialty care services such as retinal screenings. Access to specialists who can provide retinal screenings can be increased through the use of telemedicine, which has shown great promise as a means of screening for diabetic retinopathy in the US and internationally. A pilot study by Charles Drew University investigators had a total of 2,876 teleretinal screenings performed for diabetic retinopathy, with 2,732 unique diabetic patients from six South Los Angeles safety net clinics screened. The present study aims to build on this prior work by: (a) developing novel software that utilizes information from clinical records to detect latent diabetic retinopathy in diabetic patients who have not yet received an annual eye examination, and (b) devising methods to speed up the diabetic retinopathy detection process for diabetic patients who have had digital retinal images taken by partially automating the process using image processing and machine learning techniques. Specifically, we propose to: 1. Develop predictive models for diabetic retinopathy using risk factors collected from patient clinical records. 2. Develop predictive models for automated diabetic retinopathy assessment using a combination of patient  risk factor data and data from digital retinal images previously evaluated by experts. 3. Evaluate the predictive accuracy of: a) the models developed for specific aim 2, and, b) the assessments of  optometrist readers against standard of care dilated retinal examinations by board certified  ophthalmologists for 300 diabetic patients utilizing a new Los Angeles County reading center. 4. Create web-based software tools based on the predictive models developed in specific aim 1 that can be  used to initiate outreach to high-risk patients in under-resourced settings, boosting detection rates for those  patients who are most at risk for diabetic retinopathy. 5. Establish targeted outreach methods to promote screening for patients that the predictive models from  specific aim 1 identify as potentially having undetected diabetic retinopathy. Narrative Diabetic retinopathy is the leading cause of blindness among US adults between the ages of 20 and 74 years. Although previous studies within the US and internationally have shown that teleretinal screening can increase access to eye examinations for detecting retinopathy, few studies have focused on the US urban safety net, which has ophthalmic screening rates that are well below the US average and a preponderance of diabetic patients who are from ethnic minority groups. Building on a previous teleretinal screening study that assessed 2,732 South Los Angeles patients for retinopathy, this study deploys machine learning and image processing techniques to detect latent retinopathy in unscreened diabetic patients and partially automate the diabetic retinopathy detection process for teleretinal screening.",Predicting Diabetic Retinopathy from Risk Factor Data and Digital Retinal Images,9566291,R01LM012309,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alaska Native', 'American Indians', 'Asian Americans', 'Blindness', 'Blood Circulation', 'Blood Vessels', 'Caring', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Computer software', 'County', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Diagnosis', 'Eye', 'Glucose', 'Health Care Reform', 'Health Insurance', 'Health care facility', 'Hispanics', 'Incidence', 'International', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Minority Groups', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Online Systems', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Ophthalmic examination and evaluation', 'Ophthalmologist', 'Optometrist', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retina', 'Retinal', 'Retinal Diseases', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Rural', 'Services', 'Software Tools', 'Specialist', 'Speed', 'Techniques', 'Telemedicine', 'Time', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Work', 'aged', 'base', 'care systems', 'diabetic', 'diabetic patient', 'digital', 'digital imaging', 'ethnic minority population', 'high risk', 'image processing', 'inner city', 'laser photocoagulation', 'medical specialties', 'medically underserved', 'mortality', 'novel', 'outreach', 'patient screening', 'predictive modeling', 'primary care setting', 'racial minority', 'randomized trial', 'retinal imaging', 'safety net', 'screening', 'standard of care', 'statistics', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'trend']",NLM,CHARLES R.

"Automated detection and prediction of atrial fibrillation during sepsis 7. ABSTRACT / PROJECT SUMMARY We propose the “Automated detection and prediction of atrial fibrillation during sepsis” study to develop automated technologies capable of accurate atrial fibrillation (AF) detection and prediction during sepsis. Sepsis is a life-threatening, dysregulated response to infection and the most common illness leading to hospitalization in the United States, affecting ~1 million Americans yearly, and is associated with 50% of all hospital deaths. With the exception early antibiotic and fluid use, few therapies improve outcomes among septic patients; new treatment strategies are greatly needed to improve survival. New-onset AF is a common dysrhythmia among critically ill patients with sepsis, affecting up to 1 in 3 septic patients and conferring increased short- and long-term risks stroke, heart failure, and death. Prevention of AF or its complications may improve sepsis outcomes by reducing AF-related morbidity and mortality. Although several evidence-based treatments have shown efficacy in treating and preventing AF in certain high-risk subgroups (e.g., AF prevention following cardiac surgery), studying application of these therapies among critically ill patients with sepsis has been hampered by two major factors: 1) we lack validated automated mechanisms to detect AF and facilitate real-world AF research in large clinical databases, and 2) we cannot presently predict which patients with sepsis will develop AF. Our project will leverage the unique resources of the recently released Multiparameter Intelligent Monitoring in Intensive Care (MIMIC III) database. MIMIC III links continuous ECG and pulse plethysmographic waveforms to a wealth of time-varying clinical and hemodynamic data. Our project will develop and validate state-of-the art automated AF detection algorithms using waveform data from critically ill patients. Automated AF detection would enable expedited clinical treatment of AF, identification of subclinical AF, and will catalyze the study of AF in emerging electronic health record waveform databases. We will develop innovative automated AF prediction capabilities using state-of-the-art waveform analysis algorithms and machine learning methods in critically ill patients. Automated algorithms that identify patients at high risk for developing AF in the near-term would enable targeting of preventative therapies and potentially usher in a new era of AF prevention for critically ill patients. AF prevention and treatment facilitated through our project will allow targeting of novel, AF-based mechanisms of poor outcomes during and following sepsis. 8. Project Narrative Sepsis is a dysregulated response to infection that causes life-threatening organ dysfunction that affects nearly 1 million Americans each year. Atrial fibrillation is a form of cardiac dysfunction that occurs during sepsis characterized by abnormal heart rhythm, loss of normal atrial contraction, rapid heart rates, heart failure, shock and increased risk for stroke. Our proposal seeks to develop automated methods for the detection and prediction of atrial fibrillation during sepsis, methods that will enhance our future ability to prevent and treat atrial fibrillation to avoid its life-threatening consequences.",Automated detection and prediction of atrial fibrillation during sepsis,9418100,R01HL136660,"['Affect', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Antibiotics', 'Arrhythmia', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Big Data', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Surgery procedures', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Comorbidity', 'Complication', 'Computer Assisted', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electrolytes', 'Electromagnetics', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Heart Abnormalities', 'Heart Atrium', 'Heart Rate', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Infection', 'Intensive Care', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Myocardial dysfunction', 'Noise', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Prevention', 'Preventive therapy', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sepsis', 'Shock', 'Stroke', 'Stroke Volume', 'Subgroup', 'Technology', 'Telemetry', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'base', 'clinical predictors', 'data warehouse', 'electronic data', 'heart rhythm', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'mortality', 'novel', 'portability', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive signature', 'prevent', 'response', 'septic patients', 'therapeutic target', 'time use', 'tool', 'treatment strategy']",NHLBI,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,R01,2018,551823,0.004906682862551036
"Statistical methods for healthcare in complex patients with diabetes ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Diabetes affects 8.3% of the US population, and lead to costly adverse healthcare outcomes. Unfortunately, there may be a quality gap in the care of complex diabetes patients, that is, older patients (age>65 years) and those with comorbid conditions. Current practices, relying primarily on the presence of several factors, are not effective in capturing the risk of poor prognosis, i.e., multiple hospitalization and/or emergency department visits, and death. Hence, little evidence exists so far to help prioritize care for thes patients. The diabetes guidelines recognize that tight control of glycosylated hemoglobin (A1c) may not be appropriate for complex patients, and recommend individualizations in tight A1c control. However, neither the outcomes of tight A1c control, nor the effects of the typical treatment regimens used to achieve tight A1c control can be evaluated in clinical trials, with minimal, if any, enrollment of complex diabetes patients due to either their restrictive inclusion criteria or lack of encouragement of the patient and/or clinical investigator to consider the RCT. In order to deliver more effective, efficient and accountable health cares, it is important to help clinicians to examine the relationship between patient complexity and patients' A1c control level, and to modify guideline appropriately with an evidence base. The proposed research will analyze a cohort of 8,304 Medicare beneficiaries with diabetes who were cared for by one of the country's 10 largest physician group practices, the University of Wisconsin Medical Foundation during 2003-2011 to address the following aims: (1) to conduct risk prediction incorporating longitudinal outcomes, (2) to inform guidelines for complex diabetes patients, and (3) to create a patient-centered surveillance tool for detecting short-term negative outcomes. Our analytic approach involves the use of state- of-the-art statistics and machine learning methods to take advantage of the large electronic health records data. The proposed methods and results will help clinicians to identify and quantify risks of tight A1c control in complex diabetes patients an potentially lead to improved patient experiences, and reduce medical expenditures from excess adverse events. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Sub-optimal glycosylated hemoglobin (A1c) control recommendations and treatment recommendations for diabetes patients can result in adverse events, and increased health care utilization. Unfortunately, current guidelines on the care for complex and/or older patients with diabetes are inadequate. We propose to develop an effective and patient-centered health care delivery system for complex diabetes patients, focusing on accurate prediction of adverse events, development of potential guidelines on targeting tight control of A1c and treatment regimens, and real-time monitoring of health conditions.",Statistical methods for healthcare in complex patients with diabetes,9547377,R01DK108073,"['Address', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biometry', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Comorbidity', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency department visit', 'Enrollment', 'Exclusion Criteria', 'Expenditure', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Glean', 'Glycosylated Hemoglobin', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'Goals', 'Group Practice', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Long-Term Care', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical History', 'Medicare', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient observation', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Privatization', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recommendation', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sampling', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Time', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Trees', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Wisconsin', 'Work', 'base', 'beneficiary', 'care outcomes', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'cost', 'data resource', 'design', 'diabetes management', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'health care delivery', 'health care quality', 'health care service utilization', 'high risk', 'improved', 'inclusion criteria', 'learning strategy', 'longitudinal dataset', 'mortality', 'older patient', 'optimal treatments', 'outcome forecast', 'patient oriented', 'patient population', 'population health', 'public health relevance', 'real time monitoring', 'statistics', 'tool', 'treatment guidelines', 'treatment planning', 'user friendly software']",NIDDK,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2018,285285,0.015090805922151238
"A Novel Probabilistic Methodology for Prediction of Emerging Diseases in Patients with Multiple Chronic Conditions ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Treatment for people living with multiple chronic conditions (MCC) currently accounts for an estimated 66 percent of the Nation's health care costs and will continue to grow. This mounting challenge has become a major public health issue since MCC is linked to suboptimal health outcomes and rising health care costs. However, it now known how MCC emerge among individuals or in the general population. Traditional epidemiological approaches have led to important findings of disease links and comorbidity associations. However, they are limited in their ability to characterize how patients acquire new chronic conditions and predict/personalize the emergence of MCC for individual patients. Objectives: This study will develop approaches that can be used to identify the most likely combinations of comorbidity within a population. These approaches can be tailored to examine MCC patterns in specific sub- populations or at the level of the individual patient. We will also study the effect of a large set of risk factors on MCC combinations emergence. Furthermore, we will use data mining approaches to predict and monitor the development of MCC combinations in at the population and individual levels. Hypotheses: We hypothesize that the emergence and progression of comorbidities in MCC patients form patterns that can be predicted and which are associated with prior medical conditions, demographic, and socio-economic characteristics. We further hypothesize that these methods can predict the timing and emergence of new chronic diseases more accurately by personalizing the records for individual patients. Aims and methodology: in Aim1, we will characterize how MCC emerge and progress in distinct patterns and how these patterns transition between different combinations of diseases over time. We will then identify and group major MCC transitions using the Markov clustering (MCL) algorithm, which is a novel, efficient graphical approach to handle big data. In Aim 2, we will identify which risk factors are associated with MCC emergence using a machine learning approach that can handle the complex heterogeneity of comorbidity patterns. Risk factors include age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, economic status, marital status, and prior medical conditions. In Aim 3, we will use a similarity learning approach to develop models that can predict if MCC will emerge in individual patients or among populations and we will be able to use these models to monitor MCC emergence over time. Conclusion: Our findings will provide a foundation for future research that will evaluate specific treatment patterns associated with progression in MCC patterns and ultimately identify optimal time points of intervention for those with, or at risk for multiple chronic conditions. These findings will also provide information that can be used at the community level to manage healthcare resources to improve continuity and accessibility of care.

"A Novel, Patient-Centered Prognostic Tool for Adults with Critical Illness Project Summary/Abstract:  A growing number of older adults in the United States who are near the end of life are admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) with acute critical illness and receive invasive medical treatments. The use of prolonged life-sustaining treatments such as mechanical ventilation for older adults near death is common and increasing over time. However, most older adults report end-of-life care preferences to prioritize their comfort and quality of life near death over burdensome life-sustaining treatments. To make medical treatment decisions that are aligned with end-of-life-care preferences, patients and their surrogates require meaningful prognostic information in the setting of an acute illness. However, traditional prognostic tools for critically ill patients have focused on estimating patients' risk of death. Patients and surrogates often struggle to interpret or use mortality estimates for decision making, and the dichotomous outcome of mortality fails to describe the longitudinal trajectory of a patient's illness. We hypothesize that a novel tool that incorporates longitudinal prognostic information and a more descriptive account of potential outcomes will help patients, surrogates, and ICU physicians make treatment decisions that are aligned with end-of-life care preferences.  The central goals of this NRSA Individual Fellowship are to (1) facilitate the candidate's career development into an independent, successful health services researcher in critical care medicine and (2) address the disparity between end-of-life medical care that is delivered in the United States and patients' goals values, and preferences. The candidate and her mentors have designed a training plan to accomplish these goals that includes two specific research objectives. First, we aim to create a novel, longitudinal predictive model for critically ill adults that characterizes the expected trajectory of medical treatments over time and a description of the patient's likely outcome. To accomplish our first objective, we will apply the innovative tools of predictive analytics from the field of engineering (i.e. robust machine learning) to a large EHR-derived clinical database of all admissions to an adult medical ICU over 3 years (N ≈ 3,000 patients). The predictive model will characterize discrete, temporal patterns of patients' exposure to medical treatments during an ICU stay (“illness trajectories”) and describe the outcomes of patients who follow each trajectory. Second, we plan to use the output of our predictive model to design a user-centered prognostic tool for clinical use. Using both real and hypothetical output from our predictive model, we will engage critically ill patients (if able to participate), their surrogate decision-makers, and critical care clinicians to design and iteratively revise a prognostic tool that presents longitudinal data. The stakeholders will participate in qualitative interviews and focus groups to provide feedback about the content, format, and usability of the tool for treatment decisions in the ICU. This study will lead to the prototype of a novel, patient-centered prognostic tool that is designed to better align treatment decisions in the ICU with patients' end-of-life care preferences. Project Narrative Many critically ill patients and their families are confronted with a decision between life-prolonging but burdensome treatments or comfort-focused medical care that may lead to an earlier death. These decisions can be very difficult when there is uncertainty about whether the patient can recover and what the patient's life will be like during the illness and recovery. To help with these difficult decisions, we propose a study to design a new tool to help patients, families, and ICU clinicians predict the range of possible outcomes for an individual patient.","A Novel, Patient-Centered Prognostic Tool for Adults with Critical Illness",9467697,F32HL140824,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Adult', 'American', 'Award', 'Big Data', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Communication Tools', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Critical Care', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Exposure to', 'Family', 'Feedback', 'Fellowship', 'Focus Groups', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Group Interviews', 'Health Services', 'Health Status', 'Hospitals', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Interview', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Research Service Awards', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patient Preferences', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Recovery', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Sampling', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Uncertainty', 'United States', 'Visual', 'base', 'care preference', 'career', 'career development', 'design', 'end of life', 'end of life care', 'experience', 'functional status', 'human old age (65+)', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'overtreatment', 'patient oriented', 'post-doctoral training', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'preference', 'prognostic', 'prognostic tool', 'prototype', 'skills', 'surrogate decision maker', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'usability', 'user centered design']",NHLBI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,F32,2018,59886,-0.008037851313040769
"Efficient Statistical Learning Methods for Personalized Medicine Using Large Scale Biomedical Data Project Summary/Abstract  Current medical treatment guidelines largely rely on data from randomized controlled trials that study av- erage effects, which may be inadequate for making individualized decisions for real-world patients. Large-scale electronic health records (EHRs) data provide unprecedented opportunities to optimize personalized treatment strategies and generate evidence relevant to real-world patients. However, there are inherent challenges in the use of EHRs, including non-experimental nature of data collection processes, heterogeneous data types with complex dependencies, irregular measurement patterns, multiple dynamic treatment sequences, and the need to balance risk and beneﬁt of treatments. Using two high-quality EHR databases, Columbia University Medical Center's clinical data warehouse and the Indiana Network for Patient Care database, and focusing on type 2 diabetes (T2D), this proposal will develop novel and scalable statistical learning approaches that overcome these challenges to discover optimal personalized treatment strategies for T2D from real-world patients. Speciﬁcally, under Aim 1, we will develop a uniﬁed framework to learn latent temporal processes for feature extraction and dynamic patient records representation. Our approach will accommodate large-scale variables of mixed types (continuous, binary, counts) measured at irregular intervals. They extract lower-dimensional components to reﬂect patients' dynamic health status, account for informative healthcare documentation processes, and characterize similarities between patients. Under Aim 2, we will develop fast and efﬁcient multi-category machine learning methods, in order to evaluate treatment propensities and adaptively learn optimal dynamic treatment regimens (DTRs) among the extensive number of treatment options observed in the EHRs. The methods will provide se- quential decisions that determine the best treatment sequence for a T2D patient given his/her EHRs. Under Aim 3, we will develop statistical learning methods to assist multi-faceted treatment decision-making, which balances risks versus beneﬁts when evaluating a DTR. Our approach will ensure maximizing beneﬁt to the greatest extent while controlling all risk outcomes under the safety margins. For all aims, we will develop efﬁcient stochastic resampling algorithms to scale up the optimization for massive data sizes. We will identify optimal DTRs for T2D using the extracted information from patients' comorbidity conditions, medications, and laboratory tests, as well as records-collection processes. Our methodologies will be applied and cross-validated between the two EHR databases. The treatment strategies learned from the representative EHR databases with a diverse patient pop- ulation will be beneﬁcial for individual patient care, assisting clinicians to adaptively choose the optimal treatment for a patient. Finally, we will disseminate our methods and results through freely available software and outreach to the informatics and clinical experts at our Centers for Translational Science and elsewhere. Project Narrative  This proposal aims to develop novel and scalable statistical learning methods to analyze electronic health records (EHRs) and use two real-world, high-quality EHR databases for personalized medicine research. The methods will handle the non-experimental nature of data collection processes, along with heterogeneous data types, dynamic treatment sequences, and the trade-off between benefit and risk outcomes.

"Predictive Personalized Public Health (P3H): A Novel Paradigm to Treat Infectious Disease Challenge, Innovation and Impact: In recent years, we have demonstrated that it is feasible to predict epidemic disease outbreaks from retrospective seasonal and geographical case data and to show that we can take climate factors into account in our predictive models. We are moving closer to real-time prediction at the population level. But we have never used prediction at point-of-care for treating the individual patient.  Presently, personalized medicine uses delayed results of laboratory testing of individuals. For infectious disease, most of such testing has targeted the pathogen in the host-pathogen interaction. The role of laboratory testing is to modify therapy after a variable period of time delay. Personalized medicine today is reactive. Complicating matters further, many infectious epidemic diseases are strongly dependent on environmental factors and climate. Lastly, we want to name the pathogens we are fighting, but we really need to know the resistance characteristics to select therapy for patients effectively. Both speciation and resistance can now be determined from molecular data, which can be integrated into point-of-care treatment predictions.  We here propose a radically different approach to the treatment of infectious diseases. Our hypothesis is that the alternative to time-delayed and expensive laboratory analysis of specimens from individual patients, is to use predictive modeling to forecast point-of-care treatment. Time-delayed personalized testing can be conducted as surveillance, and that data used for real-time prediction to guide point-of-care treatment.  We will introduce predictive personalized public health (P3H) policy at the individual patient level, with the potential to substantially improve patient outcomes compared with our present reactive approaches. Our key rationale is to expand population infectious disease predictive modeling in order to achieve prediction for treatment at point-of-care. Our primary insight is that we can reposition the delayed reactive personalized testing from the urgent medical decision-making process, and into a predictive modeling framework. The gaps and opportunities in technology that we will address are four-fold. First, we will employ individual case geospatial mapping at a fine scale to take into account infection spread and environmental factors. Second, our ability to perform pan-microbial analysis using molecular techniques is now feasible. Third, modeling our novel fusion of data has no simple low-dimensional solution – but machine learning technologies are now capable of handling such big data assimilation, model discovery and prediction. Fourth, our proposal is not an academic exercise. We have a partnership with the economic planners within a developing country to design and implement our new methods. We will prospectively tune and validate our algorithms in real-time. Our deliverable will be an open-source framework ready for clinical trials testing and adaptation to the public health infrastructure in any country. Project Narrative We have made substantial progress in our abilities to track and predict infectious disease epidemics at the population level, but prediction has never been used at the individual level to guide treatment at point-of-care. The individual treatment for all infectious disease syndromes at point-of-care is presently empirical, because laboratory testing is reactive and time delayed. We here propose a novel framework to use rigorous prediction strategies to guide point-of-care treatment for infectious diseases, and to validate this approach under real-world conditions.",Predictive Personalized Public Health (P3H): A Novel Paradigm to Treat Infectious Disease,9566413,R01AI145057,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Antigens', 'Assimilations', 'Bacterial Meningitis', 'Bacteriology', 'Big Data', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Cholera', 'Climate', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complex', 'Country', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Developed Countries', 'Developing Countries', 'Diagnostic', 'Diarrhea', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Economics', 'Engineering', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemic', 'Equilibrium', 'Exanthema', 'Exercise', 'Fever', 'Frequencies', 'Genus staphylococcus', 'Geography', 'HIV', 'Hand', 'Health Policy', 'Hospitals', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infection', 'Investments', 'Laboratories', 'Leadership', 'Leptospirosis', 'Machine Learning', 'Malaria', 'Measles', 'Medical', 'Medical emergency', 'Melioidosis', 'Meningitis', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Names', 'Newborn Infant', 'Paralysed', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Preventive', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Reaction', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sepsis', 'Specimen', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Uganda', 'Work', 'acute infection', 'antimicrobial', 'authority', 'climate data', 'cost', 'cost outcomes', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'fighting', 'flu', 'global health', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'infectious disease model', 'infectious disease treatment', 'innovation', 'insight', 'microbial', 'mortality', 'novel', 'open source', 'pathogen', 'personalized medicine', 'personalized predictions', 'point of care', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'resistance gene', 'spreading factor', 'surveillance data']",NIAID,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIV HERSHEY MED CTR,R01,2018,1527723,-0.005601090842643359
"Systems Level Causal Discovery in Heterogeneous TOPMed Data SYSTEMS LEVEL CAUSAL DISCOVERY IN HETEROGENEOUS TOPMED DATA ABSTRACT The advent of new technologies for collecting and analyzing multiple heterogeneous data streams from the same individual makes possible the detailed phenotypic characterization of diseases and paves the way for the development of individualized precision therapies. A major bottleneck in this process is the lack of robust, efficient and truly integrative analytic methods for such multi-modal data. This proposal builds on the ongoing efforts of our group in the area of causal learning in biomedicine. The objective of this application is to extend, modify and tailor our causal probabilistic graphical models to data typically collected by TOPMed projects, such as –omics data (SNPs, metabolomics, RNA-seq, etc), imaging, patients' history, and clinical data. COPDGene® is one of the TOPMed projects and has generated datasets with those modalities for 10,000 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), the third leading cause of death and a major cause of disability and health care costs in the US. The prevailing view is that COPD is a syndrome, consisting of multiple diseases with different characteristics. There is currently no satisfactory method for COPD subtyping or prediction of disease progression. In this project we will apply, test and validate our approaches on COPDGene® and another large independent COPD cohort. The extension and application of our methods to cross-sectional and longitudinal data will also allow us to investigate a number of important questions and aspects related to COPD. Mechanistically, we will investigate how SNPs, genes and their networks are causally linked to disease phenotypes. In pathology, we will identify conditional biomarkers, which will lead to disease sub-classification and identification of causal components in each subtype. In pathophysiology, we will identify features that are directly linked to lung function decline and outcome. We will make all our algorithms and results available to the community through web and public cloud interfaces. The deliverables will be (1) new probabilistic approaches for integration and analysis of multi-modal cross-sectional and longitudinal data, including SNPs, blood biomarkers, CT scans and clinical data; (2) new cloud-based server to make these approaches available to the research community; (3) results on the mechanism, pathology and pathophysiology of COPD facilitation and progression. To guarantee the success of the project we have assembled a team of experts in genomics, machine learning, cloud computing and COPD. This cross- disciplinary team project will have a positive impact beyond the above deliverables, since the generality of our approaches makes them applicable to any disease. We expect that during this U01 we will have the opportunity to collaborate with other teams in the TOPMed consortium to help them investigate the causes of their corresponding disease phenotypes. We do believe that data integration in a single probabilistic framework will be in the heart of precision medicine strategies in the future, when massive high-throughput data collection will become a routine diagnostic and prognostic procedure in all hospitals. PROJECT NARRATIVE Current technologies for high-throughput biomedical data collection allow the interrogation of multiple modalities from a single patient. New promising analytical methods started emerging, which can analyze those multi-modal data in a holistic way. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) constitutes the third leading cause of death and a major cause of disability and health care costs in the US. The prevailing view is that COPD is a syndrome, consisting of multiple diseases with their own characteristics. There is currently no satisfactory method for COPD subtyping. We will apply, test and validate new probabilistic approaches on two cohorts of COPD patients. We will investigate the mechanisms of disease facilitation; we will identify patient cohorts with specific characteristics (disease subtypes); and investigate risk factors and causal variants for the disease progression in each subtype.  ",Systems Level Causal Discovery in Heterogeneous TOPMed Data,9473087,U01HL137159,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Models', 'Blood', 'Cause of Death', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cloud Computing', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease model', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Health Care Costs', 'Heart', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Learning', 'Lifting', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Assessment', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Pulmonology', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Stream', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Tissues', 'Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'analytical method', 'base', 'clinical imaging', 'clinically relevant', 'cloud based', 'cohort', 'computer science', 'cost effective', 'data integration', 'disability', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder subtype', 'graphical user interface', 'high throughput technology', 'innovation', 'longitudinal dataset', 'medical schools', 'metabolomics', 'mortality', 'multimodality', 'new technology', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'patient subsets', 'precision genomic medicine', 'precision medicine', 'prognostic', 'repository', 'success', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'user-friendly']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,U01,2018,601486,-0.0055436967047008965
"Long non-coding RNA signatures to distinguish fibromyalgia syndrome from rheumatic diseases No other group of diseases encompasses a greater pathophysiology than do the rheumatic diseases. Spanning multiple organ systems, clinical decisions often rely on coordinated efforts from primary care providers and rheumatologists to rule in or rule out differential diagnoses when treating inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). RA is a symmetric, inflammatory, peripheral polyarthritis leading to deformity of joints via erosion of bone and surrounding cartilage. SLE can affect virtually any organ leading to fatigue, fever, myalgia, weight change and complications associated with renal, central nervous system, and hematologic systems can be life-threatening. RA and SLE are diagnosed through clinical judgment after excluding alternative diagnoses. In the case of both diseases, individual laboratory tests are effective only in a portion of the disease population. Across these analyses, the sensitivity and specificity for these laboratory measurements may have high specificity to rule in SLE but lack sensitivity as these diagnostic markers can be found in other disorders. As a physician colleague pointed out, “it is difficult to diagnose a negative”. Diagnostic approaches for both RA and SLE often rely on multiple, independent laboratory tests combined with clinical observation. Distinguishing between these diseases is important since treatment procedures for these diseases are different. Time is a factor in diagnosis of these diseases and tools are required to facilitate earlier diagnosis as treatment for autoimmune diseases are highly effective and early initiation of therapy leads to the best outcomes. Misdiagnosis of these conditions is not uncommon. Another common disease seen by rheumatologists is fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS). FMS is a common cause of widespread musculoskeletal pain that affects tendons, ligaments, and muscle. FMS is difficult to diagnose and treat and a critical clinical point is that FMS is not explained by another rheumatic or systemic disorder. Thus, FMS is a diagnosis of exclusion once other etiologies have been considered and excluded. RA and SLE are two diseases that must be eliminated from the differential diagnosis. Given the complicated diagnostic process these patients are often forced to endure, recent studies have also suggested that healthcare dollars are saved post-diagnosis and patient outcomes improve. To date, there is no laboratory test that can determine presence or absence of these three conditions from a single blood sample.  The question of whether or not disease classifiers capable of providing clinically useful information could be built based upon disease-specific expression levels of mRNAs in whole blood has been a subject of research for several years. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA) are recently discovered regulatory RNA molecules that do not code for proteins but influence a vast array of biological processes. It is also thought that lncRNAs drive biologic complexity observed in vertebrates that may also be reflected by the greater array of complex idiopathic diseases that humans develop. As such, our data obtained in the phase 1 portion of this work, support the notion that disease-associated lncRNAs exhibit far greater differences in expression than disease-associated mRNAs. In this application, we propose to explore the hypothesis that lncRNAs are better biomarkers of human disease than mRNAs. Here, we will focus on FMS and the rheumatic diseases as disease categories and have identified and validated FMS and rheumatic disease-associated associated differentially expressed lncRNAs. Study of lncRNAs in human autoimmune disease is in its infancy and exploration of lncRNAs as biomarkers of autoimmune disease has not been previously addressed. We propose to determine expression levels of target lncRNAs in blood obtained from larger cohorts of subjects that include 1) subjects with fibromyalgia syndrome, 2) healthy controls, 3) rheumatoid arthritis, 4) systemic lupus erythematosus, and 5) peripheral autoimmune disease controls obtained from various sites in the U.S. and Europe to establish a wide geographic distribution and to identify optimum machine learning classifiers to distinguish fibromyalgia syndrome and rheumatic diseases from healthy and disease control cohorts with greatest overall accuracy. Diagnosis of fibromyalgia syndrome and other rheumatic diseases can be a difficult, long and costly process and misdiagnosis of these diseases is not uncommon. Biomarkers to aid and accelerate diagnosis is an area of active investigation. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are newly discovered classes of RNAs with an array of regulatory functions. Our hypothesis to test, and supported by our phase 1 studies, is that classifiers can be built based upon differential expression of lncRNAs in blood.

However, it has also been shown that many patients lack knowledge of their disease and medications, particularly as concerns chronic health conditions, whose exacerbation causes about two thirds of hospitalizations every year in the USA. Discharge instructions after hospitalization are a critical tool to engage patients in their self-care, but are often unsuccessful. Our hypothesis is that, to en9age patients at discharge, a personalized hospitalization summary should be provided, that integrates physician and nurse documentation, and is informed by the patient's level of engagement in self-care and their socio-cultural perspective. Our transformative pilot work on physician and nurse documentation has identified an additional obstacle to the effective flow of information from professionals to patients: vocabulary differences between physicians and nurses. By leveraging the Unified Medical Language System Metathesaurus, we found no common synonyms between physician and nurse documentations for 75% of patients. Further, 86% of terms patients use are simple compared to only 15% for physicians. The lack of common language among patients, physicians and nurses motivates including all perspectives to make instructions meaningful for patients. Our hypothesis is that a better informed patient population who understands the connections between their illness, hospital experience, and discharge instructions will be more empowered and more engaged in their chronic disease management. Our innovation is to automatically create an easy-to-understand, personalized hospitalization summary that integrates events described in the EHR; and that is responsive to the patient's needs and preferences, and their activation framework (PAF) level. We pursue four specific aims: 1. To investigate socio-cultural patterns of patient perceptions of illness via a socio linguistic analysis of patient interviews; 2. To integrate multi-faceted information about a patient, as provided by physicians and nurses; 3a. To develop MyPHA, a novel application program, which will automatically generate the personalized summaries and deliver them to the patient on a tablet. MyPHA will be informed by aims 1 and 2, and will be grounded in Natural Language Generation technology; 3b. To evaluate MyPHA with multiple cycles of formative evaluation with all stakeholders, and a summative evaluation with patients. Whereas our pilot work has focused on heart failure, the techniques we will develop can easily be adapted to the management of other chronic health conditions, in particular for patients with cancer and cancer survivors. In addition, cancer and heart failure can co-occur, especially in older patients, and several cancer treatments can lead to the development of heart failure. The software program MyPHA will be released open source to the research community to enable rapid customization to other chronic conditions. Patients who are engaged in their self-care have better outcomes, however discharge instructions often fail to activate them. This study plans to integrate nurse and physician documentation from the Electronic Health Record with the patient's needs and preferences to provide patients with a concise summary of their hospitalization, tailored to their current activation level. This contextual information should help improve the lives of patients living with chronic health conditions, such as cancer patients and survivors.",SCH: INT: MyPHA: Automatically generating personalized accounts of in-patient hospitalization,9488582,R01CA225446,"['Adherence', 'Appointment', 'Area', 'Asian Americans', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Survivor', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Charge', 'Chicago', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Confusion', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Documentation', 'Education', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emotional', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Faculty', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Health', 'Health Professional', 'Healthcare', 'Heart failure', 'Hispanic Americans', 'Home environment', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Illinois', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Instruction', 'Intention', 'Interdisciplinary Communication', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Investments', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Linguistics', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical Libraries', 'Medical Records', 'Minority', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Native Americans', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nurses', 'Outcome', 'Ownership', 'Pacific Island Americans', 'Participant', 'Patient Discharge', 'Patient Education', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Process', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Self Care', 'Self Efficacy', 'Self Management', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Students', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Time', 'Unified Medical Language System', 'Universities', 'Vocabulary', 'Woman', 'Work', 'biomedical informatics', 'cancer therapy', 'cardiogenesis', 'college', 'compliance behavior', 'computer science', 'design', 'efficacy trial', 'empowered', 'empowerment', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'formative assessment', 'health literacy', 'hospital readmission', 'illness perceptions', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'member', 'metathesaurus', 'natural language', 'novel', 'older patient', 'open source', 'patient engagement', 'patient population', 'patient portal', 'preference', 'programs', 'prototype', 'skills', 'social', 'sociolinguistics', 'tool', 'undergraduate student', 'urban school']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,R01,2018,375284,0.013843363694047933
"Repurposing pyronaridine as a treatment for Chagas disease Summary Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) are a diverse group of diseases with distinct characteristics that thrive mainly among the poorest populations of the world. There are 17 NTDs prioritized by the World Health Organization which are endemic in 149 countries and affect more than 1.4 billion people globally, which costs these developing economies billions of dollars annually. The neglected tropical diseases result from four different causative pathogens: protozoa, bacteria, helminth and virus. The majority of the diseases lack effective treatments. For example, 6 to 7 million people in Latin America are infected with the eukaryotic parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease. This disease is gaining recognition as an emerging infection in the United States where an estimated 300,000 people may be infected. Chagas disease has a serious economic impact on the United States and the world. The cost of treatment in the United States alone, where the disease is not indigenous, is estimated to be $900 million annually, which includes hospitalization and medical devices such as pacemakers. The global cost is estimated at $7 billion. Unfortunately, there are no FDA approved treatments for Chagas disease and the two available treatments used outside the U.S. have toxic side effects. New therapeutics for Chagas disease and the other NTDs are desperately needed. Using a machine learning model based on published data for compounds tested against T. cruzi we have identified the EU-approved antimalarial pyronaridine as particularly active in vitro and in vivo with statistically significant efficacy in a 4-day mouse model of infection with a T. cruzi strain expressing firefly luciferase. Pyronaridine demonstrated 85.2% parasite reduction after 4 days treatment, and is known to have a long half-life in humans (13.2 days), promising toxicity profile (less toxic than chloroquine in malaria treatment) and may suggest a drug repurposing opportunity for further study. We propose in this project to determine the minimum effective dose (treatment regimen) for pyronaridine in the acute model of Chagas disease. We will also determine efficacy in the chronic phase of Chagas disease (sterile cure). We will pursue combination therapy DMPK profiling as well as performing combination therapy in vivo efficacy in chronic model of Chagas disease. The results will enable us to assess whether this EU approved drug is worthy of a clinical trial for Chagas disease in the UH3 stage. If successful we will design a clinical study and recruit patients for a phase II trial. This grant represents a unique opportunity to partner the Center for Discovery and Innovation in Parasitic Diseases (www.cdipd.org) at UCSD and the University of Sao Paulo in Brazil with Collaborations Pharmaceuticals Inc. Narrative Approximately 6 to 7 million people in Latin America are infected with the eukaryotic parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of the deadly Chagas disease. This disease is gaining recognition as an emerging infection in the United States where an estimated 300,000 people may be infected and there is no FDA approved treatment. The antimalarial pyronaridine was recently identified by our groups using computational Bayesian repurposing methods and was confirmed as active when tested in vitro and in vivo in the acute mouse model of Chagas disease. We now propose in the UH2 stage to determine: the minimum effective dose in the acute model of Chagas disease and efficacy in the chronic phase while also assessing potential for combination therapy.

"Autoimmunity as a Mechanism for Atherosclerosis in COPD ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project will facilitate the development of the principal investigator into an independent translational researcher investigating systemic vascular injury in Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This will be accomplished in the rich academic environment at the University of Pittsburgh, under the guidance of a highly accomplished team of mentors, and in the conduct of multidisciplinary research project that will develop autoimmunity as a novel mechanism for atherosclerosis in COPD. The increased risk of atherosclerosis in COPD is not explained by smoking, age, hypertension, and other established vascular disease risk factors. Chronic inflammation has recently been implicated as an atherogenic mechanism in COPD. We and others have reported that chronic inflammation in COPD may be propagated by humoral autoimmunity. Specifically, smokers with COPD have greatly increased levels of circulating autoantibodies that demonstrate in vitro pathogenic effects. Our subsequent studies also show that these autoantibodies target at least 50 different autoantigens and consistently target glucose regulated protein 78 (GRP78), particularly in patients with parenchymal lung destruction, i.e. emphysema. GRP78 is present in the endoplasmic reticulum, where it regulates the unfolded protein response, and is also a multifunction cell surface receptor. Studies in cancer patients suggest that ligation of the N-terminus of cell surface GRP78 by anti-GRP78 IgG transduces pro-inflammatory and pro-proliferative signals by activation of the AKT pathway, followed by NFκB activation. Additional in vivo studies have identified anti-GRP78 IgG with affinity for the C-terminus of cell surface GRP78 that produce counteracting anti-inflammatory effects by suppressing AKT activation. Our preliminary work shows that circulating anti-GRP78 IgG in COPD patients binds to macrophages and leads to increased NFκB activation and production of atherogenic inflammatory mediators by them. The macrophage is critical in the development of both atherosclerosis and COPD. Also, cross-sectional studies in our cohort find that levels of circulating anti-GRP78 IgG are strongly associated with carotid atherosclerosis in patients with emphysema, independent of established vascular risk factors. Therefore, we hypothesize that autoimmune responses against GRP78 are a mechanism for atherosclerosis in COPD. During this award, we will: (1) Test the hypothesis that elevated levels of circulating anti-GRP78 IgG predict progression of carotid atherosclerosis in patients with emphysema independent of established risk factors over 4 year follow up; (2) Test the hypothesis that anti-GRP78 IgG binds to the N-terminus of cell surface GRP78 and activates the AKT pathway followed by NFκB activation and production of inflammatory mediators using a variety of cell function assays, and provide proof of concept for two potential therapeutic strategies; (3) Test the hypothesis that there are other antigen-specific immune responses associated with atherosclerosis in COPD by using machine learning to analyze high-throughput data on a large number of circulating autoantibody levels. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a lung disease caused by smoking that kills more and more Americans each year, and is now the third leading cause of death in the US. Although it is largely viewed as a disease of the lungs, the most common cause of death in patients with COPD are blockages in blood vessels. This research project will investigate why patients with COPD are so prone to develop these blood vessel blockages.",Autoimmunity as a Mechanism for Atherosclerosis in COPD,9460547,K23HL126912,"['Affinity', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Antibodies', 'Antigens', 'Antiinflammatory Effect', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Autoantibodies', 'Autoantigens', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmune Responses', 'Autoimmunity', 'Award', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cancer Patient', 'Carotid Artery Plaques', 'Carotid Atherosclerotic Disease', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Surface Receptors', 'Cell physiology', 'Cell surface', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum', 'Environment', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Immune response', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'In Vitro', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Inflammatory', 'Injury', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Ligation', 'Link', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphorylation', 'Principal Investigator', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Reporting', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Western Blotting', 'Work', 'atherosclerosis risk', 'cancer clinical trial', 'cohort', 'follow-up', 'glucose-regulated proteins', 'in vitro testing', 'in vivo', 'macrophage', 'novel', 'peptidomimetics', 'predictive marker', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'targeted treatment', 'translational scientist', 'vascular risk factor']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,K23,2018,166104,-0.014786607415129915

"The Next Frontier in Diabetes Communication: Promoting Health Literacy in the Era of Secure Messaging ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Limited health literacy (HL) places individuals at greater risk of type 2 diabetes (DM2) and its complications, is a marker of vulnerability, and presents a critical clinical and public health problem. To be health literate in the 21st century, patients will need a certain level of linguistic facility, in combination with technical skills, to access services via online patient portals. Our research has shown that DM2 patients with limited HL are actively using patient portals. However, as healthcare becomes increasingly dependent on electronic communications (e.g., secure messages via internet-based patient portals), patients with limited HL may have difficulty communicating electronically with their clinician or understanding their clinician's secure message responses or instructions. For clinicians to electronically provide meaningful and actionable information and support, their secure messages must be written in an easily comprehended style. Few studies have examined how patients with limited HL interact with their healthcare providers via patient portals. This trans-disciplinary proposal, involving a team of health services researchers, health communication scientists, and computational linguists, will focus on a population of ethnically diverse DM2 patients and their primary care providers from 1) a large, integrated group model HMO with a well-developed patient portal and 2) a county-run, integrated public (safety net) delivery system with a newly launched electronic health record and patient portal. Our study is designed around a conceptual framework promoted most recently by the Institute of Medicine: overcoming the challenges LHL patients face in managing DM2 requires that healthcare systems, and their clinicians, make accommodations to meet patients' communication needs. The degree of linguistic ""mismatch"" observed in secure message exchanges between DM2 patients and their providers, measured using computational linguistics, will serve as one indicator of the extent to which providers are, or are not, making such accommodations. Our specific aims are to (Aim 1) develop and validate a novel, automated linguistic complexity profile (LCP) to assess secure message content generated by DM2 patients and their providers via patient portals. We will employ natural language processing (NLP) to develop and validate the LCP, based on secure messages and data from >200,000 DM2 patients. The LCP will demonstrate construct validity with patient HL and patient reports of provider communication, and will be associated with DM2 outcomes; (Aim 2) examine whether concordance between provider and patient LCP is associated with adherence among DM2 patients newly prescribed insulin or antidepressants; (Aim 3) characterize the collaborative nature of exchanges between providers and low LCP patients, using mixed methods, to enhance our understanding of communication in the critical period surrounding initiation of insulin or antidepressants; (Aim 4) create an automated, LCP-based prototype to provide real-time feedback to providers while writing secure messages to reduce linguistic complexity and better accommodate DM2 patients' linguistic skills and HL. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Limited health literacy places individuals at greater risk of type 2 diabetes and its complications, making limited health literacy a critical clinical and publi health problem. As healthcare becomes increasingly dependent on electronic communications, patients with limited health literacy may have difficulty communicating by email with their clinician or understanding the clinician's emailed replies or instructions.

"4D ventricle-valve model risk stratification for planning surgical treatment of ischemic mitral regurgitation Project Summary/Abstract Ischemic mitral regurgitation (IMR) is a disease where the normal mitral valve (MV) structure is dysfunctional due to left ventricular (LV) remodeling after a myocardial infarction (MI). IMR affects nearly 3 million Americans and the magnitude of this problem is expected to grow as the population ages. IMR has a substantial mortality rate that is associated with even mild MR severity. Mitral valve repair with undersized ring annuloplasty has been the preferred treatment strategy for IMR; however, the recurrence of moderate or severe IMR within 12 months of surgery is common. Recent high profile results from the Cardiothoracic Surgical Trials Network (CTSN) mul- ticenter randomized trials on IMR have confirmed a high incidence of early recurrent IMR. More importantly, these studies highlighted the adverse impact of recurrent IMR on LV remodeling and clinical outcomes. The CTSN trials demonstrated no significant difference in LV volume reduction or survival at 12 and 24 months between repair and replacement groups; however, subgroup analysis demonstrated that repair patients that developed recurrent IMR had no reduction in LV volume while repair patients without recurrence experienced LV volume reduction that was superior to patients having valve replacement. The results of the CTSN IMR trials indicate an unmet need for a pre-operative risk stratification tool that reliably predicts MV repair failure. Such a tool would significantly reduce the problem of recurrent IMR by performing valve repair only in patients likely to experience a durable result and performing valve replacement in patients with high risk of recurrence. The long term goal is to improve quality of surgical therapy in IMR by improving risk-stratification pre-operatively using image analysis tools. The overall objective of this proposal is to improve the prediction IMR recurrence by ex- panding this model to include the left ventricle (LV). The rationale is that while IMR manifests as MV malcoapta- tion, the root cause of the disease is LV remodeling. The central hypothesis is that features extracted from the integrated left ventricular and mitral valve (LVMV) model will predict recurrence more accurately than the current MV-only model. To fulfill this objective and test the central hypothesis by pursuing the following specific aims: 1) Develop the 4D integrated LVMV model and compare the accuracy of fitting this model to intraoperative 3DTE images to that of the existing MV-only model. 2) Assess the ability of biomarkers derived from the integrated LVMV model to predict IMR recurrence, and compare to the predictive value of the MV-only model. The project is significant because, if successful, the integrated LVMV model will be incorporated into the Gorman lab ongoing effort translating this technology to the operating room, thus improving survival rates, reducing the impending clinical burden and the number of repeated procedures. Project Narrative The proposed project tackles the high impact problem of ischemic mitral regurgitation (IMR) recurrence after surgical repair by developing a reliable real-time pre-operative risk stratification tool using image analysis of 3D transesophageal echocardiography. This will enable surgeons to optimize mitral surgical treatment in IMR on a case-by-case basis. If successful, the proposed research has the potential to virtually eliminate the problem of IMR recurrence, maximize long-term outcomes for millions of IMR patients and significantly decrease the im- pending clinical burden expected with an aging population.",4D ventricle-valve model risk stratification for planning surgical treatment of ischemic mitral regurgitation,9541444,F30HL142138,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anatomic Models', 'Anatomy', 'Atlases', 'Biological Markers', 'Cardiac', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Computational algorithm', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Failure', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Incidence', 'Label', 'Left', 'Left Ventricular Remodeling', 'Left ventricular structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Medial', 'Mentors', 'Mitral Valve', 'Mitral Valve Insufficiency', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Operating Rooms', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Partner in relationship', 'Patients', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Procedures', 'Recurrence', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk stratification', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Surgeon', 'Survival Rate', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Time', 'Transesophageal Echocardiography', 'Translating', 'Ventricular', 'aging population', 'case-by-case basis', 'clinically translatable', 'experience', 'high risk', 'imaging Segmentation', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'morphometry', 'mortality', 'muscular structure', 'papillary muscle', 'randomized trial', 'repaired', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'valve replacement', 'virtual']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,F30,2018,49524,0.015506791353876608
"Michigan Hepatotoxicity Clinical Research Network Renewal 2018 Michigan Hepatotoxicity Research Network 2018 Renewal ABSTRACT In the past 5 years, the Drug Induced Liver Injury Network (DILIN) has increased cumulative enrollment to over 2000 adult and pediatric patients in the ongoing Prospective and Retrospective registry studies. In addition, an “Acute” DILI protocol with collection of serial early biological samples for mechanistic biomarker studies was developed and implemented. Other network aims included investigation of the role of genetic polymorphisms in DILI susceptibility and outcome, development of improved causality assessment methods, and expansion of the LiverTox website. The University of Michigan team led by Dr. Fontana has played an important role in the design, implementation, and analysis of the primary and ancillary DILIN studies since its inception in 2003. Michigan has not only been a leading enroller in all of the ongoing Registry studies but also provided important leadership in multiple DILIN committees and initiatives. The Michigan team now proposes a series of novel and feasible study aims for the DILIN renewal. The PRIMARY AIM of this proposal is to continue to recruit and enroll high causality adult and pediatric DILI cases into the registry studies for genetic, immunologic, biomarker and mechanistic studies. The Michigan Hepatotoxicity Network has specific plans to increase the enrollment of ethnic minorities via the engagement of hepatologists/ collaborators in southeastern Michigan and elsewhere that care for a large number of African American, Hispanic, and Asian patients. In addition, further development of natural language processing algorithms to search the EMR at the University of Michigan are proposed to facilitate enrollment. Qualitative, quantitative and toxicological studies of the chemical constituents in the herbal and dietary supplement (HDS) products implicated in a growing proportion of DILI cases will be expanded via an ongoing collaboration with the National Center for National Products Research. The SECOND AIM of this proposal is to conduct pilot/ feasibility clinical trials to improve the outcomes of patients with severe acute DILI and those at risk for developing chronic DILI. Proposed study designs include a 12 week course of a simple and safe, orally administered anti-inflammatory or anti-oxidant agent (e.g. budesonide, SAMe, vitamin E) in selected patients with severe acute DILI at risk for adverse outcomes. In addition, 12 to 24 week studies of a safe and effective orally administered anti- cholestatic agent such as an ileal apical bile salt transport inhibitor that may reduce serum bile acids are proposed for subjects at risk of chronic DILI. Lastly, prospective studies of magnetic resonance elastography and MRCP imaging are proposed to improve our understanding of the severity and natural history of DILI. The THIRD AIM of this proposal is to further expand the LiverTox website to include additional chapters on HDS DILI, develop and implement a computerized causality assessment instrument, and assemble working committees to insure that the website content remains up to date and pertinent. Finally, additional collaborations between DILIN and the US FDA and other regulatory agencies are proposed to enhance the pharmacovigilance capabilities of DILIN for new causes of DILI and temporal changes over time. PROJECT NARRATIVE The University of Michigan Hepatotoxicity Research Network proposes to improve our understanding of the etiologies, risk factors, and outcomes of DILI via the continued enrollment of adult and pediatric patients including targeted enrollment of ethnic minority patients that will help determine if there are racial differences in DILI susceptibility and outcomes via analysis of collected biological samples, DNA, liver tissue, and clinical data. Pilot/ feasibility clinical trials of simple, safe and mechanistically based treatments for patients with severe acute DILI and those at risk for developing chronic DILI are also proposed. Finally, further development and enhancement of the LiverTox website is proposed to include additional chapters on HDS DILI, development and implementation of a computerized diagnostic instrument, and expansion of the pharmacovigilance capabilities of DILIN.",Michigan Hepatotoxicity Clinical Research Network Renewal 2018,9608453,U01DK065184,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'African American', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Anti-inflammatory', 'Antioxidants', 'Apical', 'Asians', 'Assessment tool', 'Bile Acids', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Budesonide', 'Caring', 'Chemicals', 'Childhood', 'Chinese People', 'Cholestasis', 'Chronic', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Enrollment', 'Etiology', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic study', 'Hepatic', 'Hepatotoxicity', 'Herbal supplement', 'Hispanics', 'Hospitals', 'Human Resources', 'Image', 'Immunologic Factors', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Immunologics', 'International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10)', 'Intuition', 'Investigation', 'Leadership', 'Liver', 'Magnetic Resonance Elastography', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Monitor', 'Natural History', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Oxidants', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pediatrics', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Phenotype', 'Plasma', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Race', 'Recovery', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'S-Adenosylmethionine', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Serum', 'Severities', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Symptoms', 'Taiwan', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxicology', 'Transplantation', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Vitamin E', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'bile salts', 'clinical phenotype', 'computerized', 'design', 'ethnic minority population', 'hepatotoxin', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'industry partner', 'instrument', 'liver injury', 'meetings', 'member', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'outreach', 'pediatric patients', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'racial difference', 'recruit', 'repository', 'sample collection', 'transcriptomics', 'transport inhibitor', 'web site']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U01,2018,295209,-0.0019564475488261374
"Development of a novel medication adherability tool to improve cardiovascular disease management Nearly half of patients with heart disease become non-adherent to their prescribed therapies within a year of treatment initiation. This is a central and modifiable reason why cardiovascular disease remains a leading cause of death in the US. Despite numerous attempts to develop interventions aimed at improving adherence, these attempts have had varying and often limited success; one explanation could be that underlying barriers to adherence are not being addressed. Those interventions that have been successful often make medications easier to take but are frequently expensive to implement or deployed too late. Developing a novel provider- facing intervention that modifies medication “adherability”, defined as the properties of medications that make them difficult for patients to take, could be especially impactful and relatively inexpensive. For example, more than 30% of patients report difficulties swallowing prescribed medicines, yet little is known how this “adherability” affects long-term adherence and clinical outcomes, and few interventions focus on these issues.  To this end, Dr. Lauffenburger’s K01 proposal incorporates a novel prophylactic, patient-centric approach to provider behavior change for cardiovascular disease management. Providers often do not know what the medications they prescribe actually look like or what aspects of the medications are acceptable to or preferred by their patients. This study will uniquely incorporate patient perspectives about medication properties that lead to poor adherence in the design of a scalable provider-facing clinical decision support intervention.  The proposed aims are to: (1) develop a comprehensive framework of cardiovascular medication properties, such as appearance, side-effect profiles, or dosing, that may lead to poor adherence using patient focus groups; (2) rigorously evaluate their effects on adherence and clinical outcomes in large national data sources; (3) develop and externally validate a novel clinical prediction rule for medication adherability; and (4) develop and pilot test novel web- and electronic health record-based prescribing tools based on the prediction rule for providers. The expected overall impact of this innovative proposal is that it will fundamentally advance how to personalize medications for patients to ultimately improve adherence and health outcomes.  Dr. Lauffenburger has a unique background as a practicing pharmacist trained in epidemiology with a proven commitment to research. This proposal includes an educational plan that will address gaps in her training: expertise in behavioral sciences, prediction modeling, and implementation research. The mentorship team, led by Niteesh Choudhry, an expert in adherence and implementation, includes well-known experts in cardiovascular trials (Elliott Antman, co-mentor), biostatistics (Robert Glynn, co-mentor), and behavioral sciences (Daniel Solomon, co-mentor), and will ensure scientific success and training. By the conclusion of this program, she will be able to independently design, target, and evaluate behavioral interventions for heart diseases. The results of the proposed K01 will be invaluable pilot work for a planned R01-level application. We propose a novel strategy to address the epidemic of poor adherence to cardiovascular therapies: tailoring medications for vulnerable patients based on their “adherability”, or the properties of medication like dosing frequency, palatability, and side-effect profiles, that make them difficult to take regularly. To achieve the proposed research, we will conduct focus groups with at-risk patients, determine the effect of adherability on long-term adherence and cardiovascular outcomes, develop and validate a novel adherability clinical prediction rule, and pilot test a simple, scalable clinical decision support tool for providers. The overarching goal is to improve clinical outcomes by optimizing medications for patients at the time of prescribing, which is a central mission of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI).",Development of a novel medication adherability tool to improve cardiovascular disease management,9502161,K01HL141538,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adopted', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Appearance', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Biometry', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cause of Death', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Color', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Deglutition', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Dose', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Focus Groups', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heart Diseases', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Palate', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacists', 'Property', 'Provider', 'Regimen', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Review Literature', 'Route', 'Shapes', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior change', 'cardiometabolism', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'design', 'health belief', 'implementation research', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'medication compliance', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'prophylactic', 'success', 'successful intervention', 'support tools', 'systematic review', 'theories', 'tool', 'virtual']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K01,2018,143581,-0.006428238251354111
"Partelligence Abstract Halo Labs proposes to develop “Partelligence” a particle ID technique that enables accurate and rapid identification of contaminating particles in biopharmaceutical formulations. Protein therapeutics currently represent between 15 and 30% of the overall pharmaceutical market. The primary concern for this class of therapeutics is that they can elicit an immune response from patients who develop anti- drug antibodies. The drug’s effect is therefore eliminated between 1 and 10 percent of patients who return to their original disease state. The presence of particulate matter in these therapeutics (e.g. shed glass from a syringe or a protein aggregate) can enhance this immune response and, due to the patient safety risk the FDA regulates the amount of particles that can be present. There are always some number of particles in each injected sample, and although their presence can be detected, they don’t know what the particles actually are. A QC tool that can identify the particles would help manufactures trace them back to their source (e.g. a bad lot of syringes) and eliminate them. Partelligence aims to make particle identification routine in biopharma QC. The technology builds off our current instrument, Horizon, which was launched in mid-2017 and already sold to some of the world’s largest pharmaceutical companies. The technique works by analyzing several combinatorial features including size, morphology, optical contrast, and intrinsic fluorescence, and in this proposal we will test which features are key to enable the most accurate and rapid particle recognition. To date, we have performed feasibility experiments validating our ability to identify a few commonly found particles in biopharma solutions. Given this, our goals in Phase I are to expand on these studies by building a comprehensive training set and by testing a number of different algorithms. We will first start with reference samples, and then move to real biopharmaceutical samples provided by our pharma collaborators. At the end of the study, we will do a feasibility analysis to determine if the throughput, specificity and reliability meets the needs of the industry. Narrative We propose to evaluate a particle recognition technique to enable accurate and rapid identification of unwanted contaminating particles in biopharmaceutical formulations. Successful development of this analytical technique would improve bioprocess control by identifying dangers early on in development and throughout the manufacturing process, resulting in safer protein drugs, reduced recalls and shortened time to market.",Partelligence,9679781,R43GM132995,"['Adverse effects', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Allergic Reaction', 'Alpha Particles', 'Anaphylaxis', 'Antibodies', 'Back', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biological Products', 'Cessation of life', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Industry', 'Effectiveness', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Fluorescence', 'Forensic Medicine', 'Formulation', 'Generations', 'Glass', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Industrialization', 'Industry', 'Investigation', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Membrane', 'Morphology', 'Optics', 'Particulate', 'Particulate Matter', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Raman Spectrum Analysis', 'Regulation', 'Resistance development', 'Risk', 'Rubber', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Shapes', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared', 'Syringes', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'bioprocess', 'combinatorial', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'fluorescence imaging', 'forest', 'imaging modality', 'immunogenicity', 'improved', 'instrument', 'manufacturing process', 'microscopic imaging', 'particle', 'patient response', 'patient safety', 'predictive modeling', 'pressure', 'protein aggregate', 'small molecule', 'therapeutic protein', 'tool', 'trend']",NIGMS,"OPTOFLUIDICS, INC.",R43,2018,203830,-0.04171432447879378
"A Novel Device for Optimal and Personalized Fluid Therapy in Septic Shock Patients Abstract Septic shock is a severe condition resulting in a critical reduction of organ perfusion with consequential and common stage 2 and 3 acute kidney injury (AKI) occurring in as many as 60% of patients and with an alarmingly high in-hospital co-morbid mortality rate of up to 70%. Current Surviving Sepsis Guidelines recommend early aggressive fluid resuscitation targeting mean arterial pressure (MAP≥ 65 mmHg); however aggressive resuscitation commonly results in hypervolemia. Elevated intra-abdominal pressure (IAP), which occurs frequently in critically ill patients, is recognized as a vital parameter reflecting venous outflow that has wide-ranging physiologic effects including an association with AKI. Thus, abdominal perfusion pressure (APP=MAP-IAP) may provide the optimal target to guide hemodynamic support as it reflects both inflow (MAP) and outflow (IAP) perfusion. However, current methods of IAP measurement limit the validation of APP as a hemodynamic target as they are prone to (1) human error, limiting the reproducibility of measurements and (2) contamination resulting in catheter-associated urinary tract infections. Potrero Medical, Inc. has developed the Accuryn Monitoring System, which accurately, automatically and digitally extracts physiological data in real-time from the bladder, without the need for external equipment or manual manipulation. Accuryn received formal 510(k) clearance from the FDA for measurement of IAP, urine output and core temperature in April of 2016. In combination with MAP acquired through standard of care, Accuryn will enable APP-targeted hemodynamic resuscitation in septic shock patients. In this grant, the use of Accuryn to improve clinical outcomes in septic shock patients via both IAP monitoring and APP-targeted hemodynamic resuscitation will be validated. We plan to conduct a 24-month clinical trial with 200 septic shock patients divided among three groups: (1) Monitoring (normal IAP receiving MAP-targeted resuscitation), (2) Standard of Care MAP group (elevated IAP receiving MAP-targeted resuscitation), and (3) APP group (elevated IAP receiving APP≥ 60 mmHg targeted resuscitation. The primary endpoint for comparison will be incidence or progression (defined by peak severity in creatinine and UO compared to baseline levels) of stage 2 and 3 AKI. Secondary endpoints include ICU- and hospital mortality, frequency and duration of RRT, urinary biomarker data, days on mechanical ventilation, mean duration of vasopressor support, and adverse events. Independent comparisons between these groups will (1) verify that elevated IAP during fluid resuscitation is correlated with AKI in septic shock patients and (2) validate that APP-guided fluid resuscitation reduces the incidence or progression of stage 2 and 3 AKI in septic shock patients compared to MAP-guided resuscitation. With this clinical study, we will validate the need for the Accuryn device to continuously measure IAP and target APP during resuscitation. The data collected from this grant will enable the design of a pivotal phase III clinical study defining APP- targeted hemodynamic support as the new standard of care for septic shock. Narrative Improving the resuscitation procedures in septic shock by (1) better gauging the patient’s volume status and (2) guiding hemodynamic support to individualized patient needs by a balanced, precision approach involving vasopressor support and targeted fluid expansion, may dramatically improve clinical outcomes including acute kidney injury. Potrero Medical intends use our Accuryn Monitoring System, to continuously measure intra- abdominal pressure (IAP) and apply the measure to target abdominal perfusion pressure (APP) during resuscitation to (1) verify the importance of IAP in the development of AKI in septic shock patients and (2) validate that APP-guided fluid resuscitation reduces the incidence or progression of AKI in septic shock patients compared to current standard care.",A Novel Device for Optimal and Personalized Fluid Therapy in Septic Shock Patients,9554957,R44GM123799,"['Abdomen', 'Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Adverse effects', 'Adverse event', 'Awareness', 'Biological Markers', 'Bladder', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood Volume', 'Catheters', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Comorbidity', 'Computer Simulation', 'Consequentialism', 'Creatinine', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Equation', 'Equipment', 'Failure', 'Fluid Therapy', 'Fluid overload', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hospitals', 'Hypertension', 'Incidence', 'Intra-abdominal', 'Joints', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Marketing', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Mississippi', 'Monitor', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reproducibility', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Sepsis', 'Septic Shock', 'Severities', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'Vasoconstrictor Agents', 'Venous', 'Work', 'abdominal pressure', 'catheter associated UTI', 'design', 'digital', 'hemodynamics', 'human error', 'improved', 'monitoring device', 'mortality', 'novel', 'patient population', 'personalized approach', 'pressure', 'primary endpoint', 'prospective', 'secondary endpoint', 'standard care', 'standard of care', 'urinary']",NIGMS,"POTRERO MEDICAL, INC.",R44,2018,1224065,-0.026739790677194043
"Optimized identification of therapeutic bacterial strains in ulcerative colitis PROJECT SUMMARY Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic gut inflammatory condition thought to be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Therapeutic options are only partially effective in inducing and maintaining remission, and there is currently no cure for UC. Recent studies have found the microbiome of UC patients is distinct compared to that of healthy controls, suggesting that the microbiome could be a promising therapeutic target. Fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) has been extremely successful in the treatment of colitis caused by Clostridium difficile infection, further demonstrating the potential for bacterial therapeutics. The recently completed FOCUS (Faecal Microbiota Transplantation in Ulcerative Colitis) trial has demonstrated that FMT from healthy donors can induce clinical remission in 27% of UC patients compared to only 8% in the placebo group. However, we still lack an understanding of the exact mechanisms by which FMT is able to modulate disease pathogenesis. The overarching hypothesis of this proposal is that UC remission after FMT is induced by specific bacteria, and that accurate identification of bacterial strains will be paramount to develop microbial therapeutics for UC. To test this hypothesis, we will first develop a novel ensemble method to identify bacterial species and strains from deep metagenomic data. This method combines software tools using a voting algorithm that is weighted based on the accuracy of each tool. The accuracy of this method will be tested using microbial culture collections from UC patients, in silico simulations, and a bacterial mock community as gold standards. We will then apply this approach to metagenomic data generated from the FOCUS study in order to identify bacterial strains that are associated with UC remission. This will be performed by using established supervised learning techniques, as well as through a novel method based on co- occurrence network analysis that identifies clusters of bacteria that act synergistically. Based on these results, we will finally validate our findings using a gnotobiotic model of colitis. The prophylactic and/or therapeutic potential of candidate bacteria will be tested by inoculating them to gnotobiotic mice colonized with the microbiota of UC patients and with colitis induced through the transfer of naïve T cells. Our proposal will be the first to address the question of how specific bacteria modulate disease progression in a randomized trial of FMT in UC through the development of more sensitive and accurate methods for strain characterization that can be experimentally validated. The rational design of our strategy to identify therapeutic bacteria will produce highly translational results that can be used to guide future clinical trials in UC. PROJECT NARRATIVE Finding novel approaches to prevent and treat ulcerative colitis (UC) is a pressing clinical need. This project investigates the role of bacterial strains as predictors of UC remission after fecal microbiota transplant, and presents novel methods to identify therapeutic strains that will be tested in a mouse model of colitis.",Optimized identification of therapeutic bacterial strains in ulcerative colitis,9521026,R01DK114038,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Bacteria', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clostridium difficile', 'Colitis', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease remission', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Etiology', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Gnotobiotic', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Immune response', 'Incidence', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patients', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Probiotics', 'Property', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Shotguns', 'Societies', 'Software Tools', 'Supervision', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Ulcerative Colitis', 'United States', 'Voting', 'bacterial community', 'base', 'clinical remission', 'cohort', 'design', 'fecal transplantation', 'improved', 'learning network', 'learning strategy', 'metagenome', 'metagenomic sequencing', 'method development', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'outcome prediction', 'placebo group', 'potential biomarker', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'probiotic therapy', 'prophylactic', 'randomized trial', 'response', 'simulation', 'therapeutic target', 'tool']",NIDDK,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2018,253287,0.008832193652388428
"Impact of Disparities Affecting Survival among Advanced Heart Failure Patients and Transplant Recipients DESCRIPTION: The current heart transplant allocation system and the newly recommended one prioritizes patients based on waitlist survival and does not take into account risk of death after transplant or likelihood of transplantation. Furthermore, it defines medical urgency for transplantation mainly by use of devices and not by objective evidence of medical illness. Unfortunately, many heart failure patients die on the waitlist, including a disproportionate number of women, Hispanics, and patients with certain heart diseases like restrictive cardiomyopathy. After transplantation there are also survival disparities. The long-term goal of this project is to optimize timing for advanced heart failure therapy in order to improve survival and minimize organ wastage. The objective of this research application is to identify risk factors for disparities in survival among heart transplant candidates and post-transplantation and to create tools that will improve outcome in therapy while minimizing organ wastage. The central hypothesis is that a better heart transplant allocation system requires knowledge of how population differences affect patient selection, waitlist mortality, and post-transplant mortality. The rationale for the proposed research is that there are known disparities (sex, race, and type of heart disease) in survival among advanced heart failure patients (pre- and post-transplantation) and creation of risk prediction models have successfully reduced waitlist mortality for lung, liver, and kidney transplantation. The specific aims of this research proposal are: 1) to identify risk factors for disparities in survival among heart transplant candidates and post-transplantation using the national transplant database 2) to develop a method to dynamically update risk of waitlist mortality across time using data from multiple transplant centers that includes potential prognistic risk factors not available in our national transplant database and 3) to create a mathematical model that simultaneous estimates waitlist and post-transplant mortality to optimize timing of transplantation. The approach is innovative because it utilizes new mathematical approaches and seeks to shift current heart failure research and clinical practice paradigms by taking into account population differences rather than basing decisions solely on ejection fraction, presence of coronary artery disease, and stages of disease. The proposed research is significant, because few studies have explored population differences in advanced heart failure to determine the factors associated with mortality on the waitlist and poor outcome post-transplantation. This proposal will evaluate the complex interplay of population differences (i.e sex, race, type of heart disease, laboratory measures of organ dysfunction, and influences of co-morbidities) as they relate to mortality on the waitlist, timing of transplantation, and mortality after transplantation. If the aims of our proposal are achieved, our research has the potential to empower clinicians and researchers to provide the right therapies for the right patient at the right time. There are disparities in survival among patients on the waiting list for a heart transplant, and post-transplantation. These differences are not recognized by the current and newly recommended heart transplant allocation system. Our proposal will identify the factors contributing to these population differences in order to improve survival and minimize organ wastage.",Impact of Disparities Affecting Survival among Advanced Heart Failure Patients and Transplant Recipients,9500664,R01HL141892,"['Affect', 'Albumins', 'American', 'Cardiac', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'EFRAC', 'Event', 'Fibrinogen', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health Personnel', 'Heart', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart Transplantation', 'Heart failure', 'Hispanics', 'Hypoalbuminemia', 'Individual', 'Insurance', 'Kidney Failure', 'Kidney Transplantation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Liver Failure', 'Lung Transplantation', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Rights', 'Patient Selection', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Population', 'Prostitution', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Renal function', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Restrictive Cardiomyopathy', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Sex Characteristics', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Transplantation', 'Treatment Failure', 'United Network for Organ Sharing', 'Update', 'Vibrissae', 'Waiting Lists', 'Woman', 'base', 'cardiac cachexia', 'cardiac device', 'clinical practice', 'cost effective', 'forest', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'liver transplantation', 'mathematical methods', 'mathematical model', 'men', 'mortality', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'sex', 'time use', 'tool', 'transplant centers', 'transplant database', 'transplant registry']",NHLBI,CLEVELAND CLINIC LERNER COM-CWRU,R01,2018,708656,0.010712787624919026
"DFU Clinical Research Unit Abstract Diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) are a prevalent diabetes complications affecting up to 25% of patients and leading to ~80,000 Americans having non-traumatic amputations each year, with five-year mortality rates of up to 40%. Recent evidence suggests that non-traumatic lower extremity amputations are on the rise, after decades of decline, in spite of advances in targeted wound care products, establishment of interdisciplinary clinical and surgical teams, and improving diabetes medical care. Given the worldwide epidemic of diabetes, the burden associated with DFU are high, including high costs of $9 billion-$13 billion per year and besides those associated with high morbidity and mortality. Thus, the establishment of a Diabetic Foot Consortium comprised of experienced DFU Clinical Research Units (CRU) for reliable DFU biomarker discovery cannot be understated. The main objective of this proposal is to integrate the robust infrastructure at Michigan Medicine with our highly skilled clinical and translational team to establish a DFU CRU as a strong contender and contributor within the DFC network that will be uniquely poised to participate in all DFU biomarker discovery and related wound healing projects undertaken by the Consortium. Additional aims are to The aims are to : identify, recruit, and phenotype a broad spectrum of DFU participants from the large base of patients with these conditions who are currently being followed at Michigan Medicine, according to the Consortium requirements; implement standardized mechanisms and protocols for effective longitudinal sample collection and retention; and actively participate in the DFC intellectually and provide all available resources to develop and support clinical study protocols to validate DFU biomarkers, including complex quantifications of wound image features; single cell, genetic, molecular, metabolomics, and microbiome analyses; and assessing additive predictors of DFU healing beyond clinical markers alone using multi-modal approaches. The expected outcome of this work is that the Michigan Medicine DFU Clinical Center will be an integral part of the Consortia collaborative network, with a highly positive impact for the entire spectrum of biomarker discovery and future novel therapies projects. Narrative This project has major public health relevance because diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) remain one of the most common secondary complications of diabetes and are the leading cause of lower extremity amputation in the US. Current treatments are ineffective and given the recent surge in major lower extremity amputations in diabetic patients despite the previous decades of decline, identification of novel treatment avenues is of critical importance. The main objective of the Diabetic Foot Clinical Center at the University of Michigan is to use our robust infrastructure and highly skilled clinical and translational research team to generate a unique platform for investigating individual contributions to DFU wound healing from clinical samples, single cell genetic and molecular analyses from DFU samples, and image analyses.",DFU Clinical Research Unit,9627190,U01DK119083,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Affect', 'Age', 'American', 'Amputation', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Caring', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Markers', 'Clinical Research', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collection', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Databases', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic Foot', 'Diabetic Foot Ulcer', 'Disease', 'End stage renal failure', 'Engineering', 'Epidemic', 'European', 'FDA approved', 'Foot Ulcer', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Genetic', 'Heart failure', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Institutes', 'Label', 'Liquid substance', 'Location', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Marketing', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mental Depression', 'Methodology', 'Michigan', 'Modality', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Analysis', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Peripheral Nervous System Diseases', 'Peripheral arterial disease', 'Phenotype', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychosocial Factor', 'Publishing', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Self Care', 'Standardization', 'Sterile coverings', 'Surface', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Translational Research', 'Ulcer', 'Universities', 'Vision', 'Walking', 'Work', 'Wound Healing', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'clinical research site', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'cost', 'diabetic patient', 'experience', 'genetic analysis', 'healing', 'health care delivery', 'improved', 'ineffective therapies', 'interest', 'male', 'metabolomics', 'microbiome', 'microbiome analysis', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'personalized medicine', 'practice setting', 'precision medicine', 'prediction algorithm', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'sample collection', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment response', 'wound']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U01,2018,423400,-0.015479397361088084
"Using epigenomic subtyping to understand the racial differences in lymphoma PROJECT SUMMARY Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), the most common aggressive type of lymphomas, is characterized by marked clinical and pathological heterogeneity that is reflected at the molecular level. It is well known that although the incidence rates for DLBCL were lower for African Americans (AA) than for European Americans (EA), AA patients were diagnosed at a significantly younger age and have worse 5-year survival compared with EA patients. The reason for this apparent racial/ethnic difference is unclear and cannot be fully explained by social stressors or access to care. We speculate that epigenetic variations could underlie the racial/ethnic differences because the pathogenesis of DLBCL is strongly linked to perturbation of epigenetic mechanisms, and population-specific cytosine modifications are a fundamental feature between human populations. In addition, greater epigenetic heterogeneity is linked with more aggressive DLBCL and poorer survival outcomes. Most prior studies of DLBCL epigenetics have assessed 5-methylcytosines (5mC) in predominantly EA patients. No studies have evaluated 5-hydroxymethylcytosines (5hmC), an emerging stable and abundant modification with distinct gene regulatory and cellular functions, due mainly to technical limitations. Most importantly, no studies have assessed concurrently 5mC and 5hmC in both EA and AA DLBCL patients. Without an effective technique to obtain the complete landscape of modified cytosines, development of targeted epigenetic approaches to improve DLBCL disparities is unlikely. The objective of this Exploratory/Developmental study is to distinguish 5hmC from 5mC at the time of DLBCL diagnosis between AA and EA patients and evaluate their clinical significance. Our hypothesis is that the 5mC/5hmC signatures in tumor tissues differ between AA and EA patients and that these differences contribute to the well-known racial/ethnic differences in DLBCL risk and outcomes. The Specific Aims are to 1) distinguish 5hmC from 5mC in EA and AA patients and evaluate population-specific 5mC/5hmC loci; and 2) determine therapeutic response-associated 5hmC/5mC loci. Specifically, we will obtain tissues for 120 patients with DLBCL (60 AA and 60 EA) from the University of Chicago Lymphoma Biobank. We will combine an innovative technique, the Tet-assisted Bisulfite Sequencing (TAB-Seq) and the new Illumina EPIC array to accurately distinguish 5hmC from 5mC. We will perform an epigenome-wide scan to assess differences in 5hmC/5mC modification levels between AA and EA patients at presentation and also integrate both modifications to predict therapeutic response, defined as relapse within 24 months after treatment. This proposal addresses a critical research question in a highly innovative, cost-efficient, and timely manner, providing important data for the first time on the complete landscape of modified cytosines for racial/ethnic differences in DLBCL. The results are expected to have positive impact because it is possible that the identified epigenetic loci/biomarkers will provide new targets for individualized preventive and therapeutic interventions to decrease mortality and burden of DLBCL. PROJECT NARRATIVE PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: African Americans were diagnosed of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), the most aggressive lymphoma in adults, at a significantly younger age (54 years vs. 65 years) and have worse 5-year survival (45% vs. 54%) compared with European American patients. This work seeks to understand the biological bases of the racial/ethnic differences by identifying complete DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation signatures at the time of diagnosis between African American and European American patients with DLBCL. Successful completion of this study will lead to a much better understanding of epigenetic factors that underlie the apparent racial/ethnic differences in DLBCL, which should accelerate the development of race-based individualized preventive and therapeutic interventions to substantially reduce the disparities observed in DLBCL among patients from different ethnic groups.",Using epigenomic subtyping to understand the racial differences in lymphoma,9572405,R21MD011439,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'African', 'African American', 'Aftercare', 'Age', 'American', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Breast', 'Cell physiology', 'Chicago', 'Clinical', 'Colon', 'Cytosine', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Endometrium', 'Enhancers', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Ethnic group', 'European', 'Exploratory/Developmental Grant', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Link', 'Liver', 'Lymphoma', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Prevention approach', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Prostate', 'Protocols documentation', 'Race', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'Specificity', 'Techniques', 'Tetanus Helper Peptide', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'biobank', 'bisulfite sequencing', 'clinically significant', 'cost efficient', 'disparity reduction', 'epigenetic marker', 'epigenetic variation', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'ethnic difference', 'health disparity', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'large cell Diffuse non-Hodgkin&apos', 's lymphoma', 'member', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'public health relevance', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial difference', 'social', 'stressor', 'survival outcome', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor initiation']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R21,2018,200434,-0.061621631513487325
"Data-Driven Shape Analysis for Quantitative Severity Stratification in Patients with Metopic Craniosynostosis Abstract Craniosynostosis affects close to one in 2000 newborns and causes growth restriction perpendicular to the affected suture. Metopic craniosynostosis is the second most common form of craniosynostosis. The metopic suture is an important sight of cranial growth as the brain rapidly expands in the ﬁrst year of life. Patients affected by metopic craniosynostosis will present in the ﬁrst few months of life with varying degrees of narrowing of the forehead and brow, a triangular shaped head, and an abnormal eye position. Surgery is recommended early in childhood to normalize the head shape and expand the restricted skull to prevent complications such as headaches, cognitive impairment, and visual disturbances including blindness.  Imaging with computed tomography (CT) is employed to conﬁrm new diagnoses of metopic craniosynostosis and, together with the physical exam, is used in a descriptive and qualitative manner to assess the degree of head shape abnormality. Several methods have been employed to interpret the information provided in the CT scans to allow surgeons to utilize data for surgical decision making. However, these indices reduce the complex three-dimensional skull dysmorphology into isolated measurements of angles or proportions, require detailed calculations to perform, and no universally accepted standard has emerged so far despite signiﬁcant research efforts and clinical motivation.  In this grant proposal, we aim to increase our understanding of the cranial dysmorphology in patients with metopic craniosynostosis by employing latest results from statistical shape modeling and deep learning. Specif- ically, we will build a statistical shape model of pediatric skulls from CT images of patients with metopic cran- iosynostosis as well as a group of normal controls capturing normal phenotypical shape variations. The distance of a new shape from the normative shape space will represent the proposed Shape Normality Metric (SNM). The SNM will be validated against ratings from experts in the surgical community (current standard of care) who will be asked to assess the dysmorphology of the skulls in our database. To avoid surgeons' subjective bias, we will aggregate their response using statistical methods that compensate for potential individual bias. Finally, to streamline data collection for future research we will develop a head-shape portal that will allow users to upload CT scans of their patients and the system will automatically calculate the SNM.  By developing a severity metric that encompasses the entire extent of dysmorphology in metopic craniosyn- ostosis and establishing a head-shape portal, we will improve our understanding of the spectrum of metopic craniosynostosis, aid in pre-operative and surgical decision making, enable future research, and help facilitate longitudinal outcomes assessments and multi-center communication and collaboration. Narrative This grant proposal aims to improve our understanding of the head shape anomaly associated with metopic craniosynostosis by using recent results from statistical shape analysis and deep learning, with the goal of developing an objective metopic cranioynostosis severity scale. Different from previously proposed metrics, our approach evaluates the entire shape as a whole. With this information, surgeons will be able to objectively determine how severely affected their patients are and will be better able to tailor their interventions to the needs of their individual patients. Additionally, surgeons will be able to better communicate with each other and study the effects of surgical intervention on their patients which will improve patient care in the long run.",Data-Driven Shape Analysis for Quantitative Severity Stratification in Patients with Metopic Craniosynostosis,9669833,R21EB026061,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Applications Grants', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Blindness', 'Brain', 'Cephalic', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Craniosynostosis', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Deformity', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Dysmorphology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Eye Abnormalities', 'Forehead', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Graph', 'Growth', 'Head', 'Headache', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Ice', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Joint structure of suture of skull', 'Left', 'Letters', 'Life', 'MRI Scans', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Motivation', 'Newborn Infant', 'Normalcy', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome Assessment', 'Output', 'Pathologic', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reconstructive Surgical Procedures', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Socialization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stereophotogrammetries', 'Stratification', 'Supervision', 'Surgeon', 'Surgical sutures', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Trauma patient', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'clinical care', 'cranium', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'image processing', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'operation', 'patient stratification', 'power analysis', 'premature', 'prevent', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'self esteem', 'shape analysis', 'standard of care', 'surgery outcome', 'web-based tool']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R21,2018,317513,-0.004916160469185114
"Reducing the incidence of febrile neutropenia in cancer patients treated with chemotherapy with PointCheck: a portable non-invasive neutropenia analyzer Every year in the US, 650,000 cancer patients are treated with chemotherapy. As a side effect,  their neutrophil counts (number of white blood cells that aid in fighting infections) become low  (referred to as neutropenia) and expose them to febrile neutropenia (FN) which are episodes  of serious infection that entail costly hospitalization and sometimes death. If  neutropenia is detected early, FN can be avoided through timely delivery of  prophylactic antibiotics or growth stimulating factors. Currently, neutrophil measurements require  visits to healthcare centers. This increases infection risk (as measurements are taken infrequently  and low counts may not be detected before infections ensue) and reduces chemotherapy efficacy (as  chemotherapy levels are kept at the lower end of frequency and dose for safety). We aim to overcome  this limitation with PointCheck, a noninvasive neutrophil test that can be used frequently in  local health centers or at home, enabling physicians to minimize infections and  personalize chemotherapy planning. The basis for our technology is noninvasive optical imaging of  microcirculation in nailfold capillaries. We conducted a pilot clinical study where trained   nurses used PointCheck to acquire data from 46 chemotherapy patients. By manually analyzing  a training dataset (N=38 measurements from 16 patients), we built a labeled dataset of flow gaps in  the microcirculation that can be considered proxies of neutrophils and demonstrated their number  can be used to distinguish baseline patients (>500 neutrophils/mm3) from grade IV neutropenic ones  (<500/mm3). However, the need for manual analysis makes the technology inaccessible to patients on  its current status. With support from SBIR Phase I, we will (a) develop algorithms that automatize  the manual data processing workflow employed on our training set, (b) test those algorithms on our  acquired and unanalyzed testing database (N=103 measurements from 30 patients) and (c) generate  additional performance data including further intermediate neutrophil ranges (>500 and <1,500  neutrophils/mm3), thus fulfilling the requirements for a minimum viable product. The consecution of  these milestones will enable, in Phase II, using PointCheck in a multi-site diagnostic validation  trial to confirm, under clinical conditions, that the management of FN can be improved with this  new paradigm. Development of a portable optical imaging device that can noninvasively  detect neutropenia-related immunosuppression, to enable more frequent monitoring of  chemotherapy patients so that timely medical interventions can be staged before  life-threatening infections develop.",Reducing the incidence of febrile neutropenia in cancer patients treated with chemotherapy with PointCheck: a portable non-invasive neutropenia analyzer,9622596,R43CA228920,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Adverse effects', 'Algorithms', 'Antibiotics', 'Area', 'Autologous Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Blinded', 'Blood capillaries', 'Blood specimen', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnostic', 'Dose', 'FPS-FES Oncogene', 'Fever', 'Fingers', 'Frequencies', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hematology', 'Home environment', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Imaging Device', 'Immunosuppression', 'Incidence', 'Infection', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Label', 'Letters', 'Leukocytes', 'Life', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Microcirculation', 'Monitor', 'Neutropenia', 'Nurses', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Process', 'Proxy', 'ROC Curve', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Triage', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'base', 'chemotherapy', 'cohort', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'fighting', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'man', 'mortality', 'movie', 'neutrophil', 'non-invasive\xa0optical imaging', 'oncology', 'optical imaging', 'personalized chemotherapy', 'point of care', 'portability', 'prophylactic', 'prototype']",NCI,"LEUKO LABS, INC.",R43,2018,213919,0.019081749363117302

"Stanford Advanced Wound Care Center Clinical Research Unit SUMMARY   Approximately  25%  of  diabetic  patients  experience  diabetic  foot  ulcers  (DFUs).  This  is  a  significant  clinical  problem since there are no effective biomarkers for predicting outcomes, no drug candidates that have recently  been  FDA-­approved  and  no  therapies  that  are  widely  effective  in  treatment.  The  Stanford  Advanced  Wound  Care  Center  (AWCC)  was  opened  in  2014  with  the  sole  purpose  of  facilitating  clinical  trials,  conducting  translational  research  and  providing  care  for  patients  with  chronic  wounds.  Stanford  AWCC  receives  patients  from the University Healthcare Alliance, which spans 60 clinics and 2.5 million people in the San Francisco Bay  Area.  Despite  being  in  a  relatively  prosperous  area,  Stanford  AWCC  treats  patients  from  diverse  socio-­ demographics. In the past two years, Stanford has treated 6000 patients with wounds, of whom 705 had DFUs.  50%  of  the  patients  enroll  in  clinical  trials  and  there  is  a  very  low  dropout  rate  (less  than  5%).  Under  Dr.  Geoffrey  Gurtner’s  leadership,  the  Stanford  AWCC  has  conducted  over  25  clinical  trials,  where  we  have  measured biomarkers and tested novel therapeutic interventions (Aim 1).     It is known that wound healing trials experience a significantly higher failure rate in Phase III studies compared  to  any  other  drug  trial.  This  is  primarily  due  to  the  poorly  controlled  procedural  component  of  wound  care.  At  Stanford,  we  address  these  issues  by  (i)  practicing  a  multi-­disciplinary  approach  overseen  by  physicians,  (ii)  standardizing  the  measuring  and  reporting  of  healing  outcomes,  (iii)  emphasizing  rigorous  and  efficient  operational  processes  during  clinical  trial  conduct  and  (iv)  collaborating  with  other  major  academic  centers  (Aim  2).  Looking  forward,  it  is  critical  to  optimize  patient  engagement  during  their  treatment  regimens  and  inculcate  a  shared  decision-­making  process.  Clinical  studies  in  medical  fields  such  as  cancer  have  indicated  that  such  patient-­centered  approaches  lead  to  the  adherence  of  treatment  regimens  and  clinical  trials.  This  is  currently  lacking  in  with  patients  with  DFUs.  With  Dr.  Arden  Morris’s  expertise,  the  Stanford  AWCC  practices  new approaches that centers around the patient, with a focus on improvement in their quality of life (Aim 3).     Dr.  Nigam  Shah,  the  Director  of  Bioinformatics  at  Spectrum,  Stanford’s  Clinical  and  Translational  Sciences  Award  has  worked  with  the  Stanford  AWCC  and  developed  computational  tools  that  predict  wound  healing  outcomes. These models have been developed using data from the Healogics database, the country’s largest  network  of  wound  care  clinics  and  a  Stanford  AWCC  operational  partner.  Dr.  Shah  also  has  expertise  in  analyzing electronic health records of patients from large databases such as TRUVEN and OPTUM, which will  allow  for  the  determination  of  unique  biomarkers  for  wound  healing  through  computational  modeling.  These  models can be executed across the entire Diabetic Foot Consortium (Aim 4).    Narrative    The  Stanford  Advanced  Wound  Care  Center  (AWCC)  was  opened  in  October  2014  to  fill  both  a  clinical  and  academic  need  by  integrating  clinical  trials  and  research  in  wound  care.  Since  its  launch,  the  number  of  patients  with  DFUs  at  Stanford  AWCC  has  doubled  in  each  of  the  past  two  years  and  the  unit  has  been  financially  successful,  ensuring  its  long-­term  viability.  Here,  we  demonstrate  the  ability  of  Stanford  AWCC  to  serve  as  a  Clinical  Research  Unit  (CRU)  by  displaying  access  to  patients  with  DFUs  from  a  wide  sociodemographic, emphasizing quality of clinical research conducted, demonstrating ways of patient-­centered

"Validation of Survey Questions to Distinguish Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes Among Adults With Diabetes PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes are distinct clinical conditions with different etiologies, ages of onset, management strategies, risk factors, and outcomes. Currently, the data sources that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) relies upon to monitor trends in diabetes prevalence and incidence are unable to reliably distinguish between types of diabetes. Most of the large federal surveys used for diabetes surveillance have not included questions on diabetes type, and few studies have reported survey-based algorithms for identifying diabetes type. None have compared survey-based identification algorithms with a gold standard case ascertainment in order to validate survey-based assignment of diabetes type. Methods for distinguishing between diabetes types in electronic health records (EHR) data have been tested for children and adults, but additional validation work is needed. Our approach to improving diabetes surveillance in these two areas is based on an integrated study design whereby survey data for diabetes patients are linked with data from their EHR and a gold standard case ascertainment derived from chart review. We will select a diverse sample of diabetes patients that is designed and powered to assess algorithm validity for subpopulations defined by age, sex, and race/ethnicity. We will use rigorous questionnaire development methods to build on items used in previous surveys, cognitively test the new survey module to optimize wording and question order, field the survey using data collection methods similar to established CDC surveys, and analyze the responses relative to a gold standard classification of diabetes type. In addition, we will develop and validate against the gold standard EHR-based algorithms, including a modeling approach that produces a parsimonious rule-based algorithm for determining diabetes type based on the most important clinical variables, and a machine learning approach that uses the gold standard dataset as a starting point to identify implicit patterns that distinguish T1DM and T2DM. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed project will result in a set of validated survey questions for distinguishing Type 1 diabetes (T1DM) and Type 2 diabetes (T2DM). It will also produce validated survey-based and EHR-based algorithms for identifying diabetes type. T1DM and T2DM are distinct clinical conditions with different etiologies, ages of onset, management strategies, risk factors, and outcomes. Currently, the data sources that CDC relies upon to monitor trends in diabetes prevalence and incidence are unable to reliably distinguish between types of diabetes. It is important for surveillance systems to be able to distinguish diabetes type to support type-specific analyses of morbidity, mortality, medical care costs, and health-related quality of life. Improved surveillance data by diabetes type can help guide and monitor federal, state, and local diabetes programs, enrich diabetes research, and support people with diabetes.",Validation of Survey Questions to Distinguish Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes Among Adults With Diabetes,9542094,U01DP006327,[' '],NCCDPHP,"WESTAT, INC.",U01,2018,499828,-0.02116101778126373
"Multi-level modeling to inform interventions for control of multidrug-resistant organisms within healthcare networks Project Summary/Abstract Multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs), particularly carbapenem-resistant organisms (CROs), are a major cause of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs). Though studies have found multiple interventions addressing MDRO colonization and transmission to be effective at reducing HAIs, implementation has lagged due to questions regarding the most efficacious combination of interventions. As healthcare facilities (e.g., hospitals, long-term care facilities, or outpatient surgical centers and clinics) are part of an interconnected healthcare network, evaluation of an intervention’s impact on transmission and infection must consider the dynamics across the healthcare system. To address remaining knowledge gaps regarding the most effective combinations of intervention strategies, we will build a multi-level model that spans from individual patients to regionally interconnected healthcare facilities. The resulting framework will provide hospital administrators and infection control experts with tools for quantifying individual patient risk factors for colonization and infection and for comparing the potential effectiveness of interventions to control HAIs. The aims of the project are: (1) to develop models to estimate the underlying prevalence and incidence of CROs and predict which patients are at highest risk for colonization and infection with CROs using clinical samples collected during the normal course of care; (2) to utilize hospital-level models to quantify the combinatorial relationship between, and marginal impact of, additional interventions to reduce HAIs; and (3) to build a regional model of a healthcare system to examine the effectiveness of interventions across institutions. Models will start with the patient at the center, utilizing the rich covariate data stored in electronic medical records to develop prediction models based on advanced machine learning. These prediction models will be translatable tools that can be directly incorporated into clinical care to assist clinicians in preventing HAIs. In addition, they will form the foundation of hospital-level models that will allow for detailed examinations of the effectiveness of different combinations of interventions. Hospital-level models will then be embedded in a network of healthcare facilities that accounts for the differing incentives faced by geographically dispersed facilities with variable demographic populations. These models will directly inform CDC guidelines about MDRO prevention and aid clinicians in reducing the risk of HAIs. Project Narrative The models developed through this proposal will improve understanding of how biological factors associated with the transmission of multidrug-resistant organisms (MDRO) impact interventions to reduce hospital-associated infections (HAIs). This will aid predictions of patients’ risk for colonization and infection, as well as improve understanding of how interventions can most effectively be combined to reduce the likelihood that patients will suffer from these high-consequence pathogens.",Multi-level modeling to inform interventions for control of multidrug-resistant organisms within healthcare networks,9535814,U01CK000536,[' '],NCEZID,"CENTER/ DISEASE DYNAMICS, ECONOM/POLICY",U01,2018,649871,-0.011083845331110502
"Identification of postoperative infections using electronic health record and administrative claims data Project Summary/Abstract Surgical operations can put patients at high risk of infections and other complications. However, studies have shown that half or more of surgical infections are discovered after hospital discharge. The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS NSQIP) began in 2005 with the goal of assisting hospitals with identifying and preventing surgical complications. Each participating ACS NSQIP hospital assigns a surgical clinical nurse reviewer to collect preoperative through 30-day postoperative data on a sample of surgical patients in order to risk adjust postoperative complications so that they can be compared across participating hospitals. Although at large volume hospitals these samples might represent only 10-15% of all surgical cases, these data are considered to be the current gold standard for accurate identification and comparison of postoperative complications. Unfortunately, chart review is time-consuming and costly and, as a result, cannot be scaled up easily to cover all surgical patients. The goal of this project is to learn from the ACS NSQIP data in order to develop electronic algorithms for identifying postoperative infections that can be scaled up easily and inexpensively. Development of such algorithms will also permit evaluation of interventions that intend to impact large populations of patients at risk of postoperative infections. Considering the large number of available binary classification algorithms for data mining that are easy to implement, it is paramount to consider new methods for identifying surgical infections electronically. Furthermore, postoperative infections are rare, and occur in about 7% of operated patients; therefore, it is difficult to identify models that classify infections well. Sampling techniques are commonly used in conjunction with classification models in order to improve sensitivity and positive predictive value. We believe that modern statistical techniques for classification combined with strategic sampling, and the use of ICD9 and ICD10 codes and pharmacy data, will improve upon existing methods for electronically identifying postoperative infections. The aims of this proposal are (1a) to develop algorithms for identifying surgical infections using machine learning techniques, (1b) to develop models for specific types of postoperative infections collected in the ACS NSQIP data separately, which include SSI, urinary tract infection, pneumonia and sepsis and (2) to validate these models in prospective ACS NSQIP data. Project Narrative In this application, we propose to use outcomes data from the University of Colorado American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program combined with electronic health record and administrative claims data in order to develop models for identifying postoperative infections electronically. These infections are currently identified through manual chart review, and it is our hope that successful development of these models could replace costly, time-consuming manual chart review. We will use machine learning and sampling techniques to achieve better performance than models previously reported in the literature.",Identification of postoperative infections using electronic health record and administrative claims data,9505567,R03HS026019,[' '],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R03,2018,48771,0.01404661260482446
"SUpPress SSI - Single Use Negative Pressure Wound Therapy (NPWT) to Reduce Surgical Site Infections SUpPress SSI – Single Use Negative Pressure Wound Therapy (NPWT) to Reduce Surgical Site Infections The proposed work Specific Aim 1 is to evaluate the effect of single-use NPWT on SSI rates after C- section, abdominal hysterectomy, and colon procedures in at risk patients. To address this aim, we will conduct a multicenter, stepped-wedge, quasi-experimental trial evaluating use of the PrevenaTM with 125 mm Hg negative pressure for 7 days among obese (BMI >30) and/or diabetic patients undergoing the procedures of interest. This is an effectiveness trial evaluating the effect of single-use NPWT on SSI rates among high-risk patients using a randomized stepped wedge design. Six Epicenter hospitals will be included: University of Illinois Hospital (UIH), University of Iowa Hospital and Clinics (UIHC), University of Utah Hospital (UUH), Emory University Hospital Midtown (EUHM), Grady Memorial Hospital (GMH), and University of Maryland Medical Center (UMMC). If proposed improvement in SSI rates are demonstrated this will provide more clear guidance for the use of the NPWT. Specific Aim 2 is to investigate the patients’ experience of using the NPWT. A sub-set of patients will be surveyed to assess their knowledge of post-operative care, to identify complications associated with NPWT use, and to learn how patients evaluated the device’s ease of use, ease of removal, and comfort. This will identify barriers to implementation. Specific Aim 3 is to assess whether real-time decision support through machine-learning modeling can help surgeons identify patients at high risk of SSI who could benefit from NWPT or other post-surgical preventive measures. This will evaluate whether boosted tree modeling techniques can be used “at the bedside” via electronic medical record data feeds to tailor post-operative care and preventive care for specific patients. Participating hospitals will be surveyed to assess their readiness to submit data to the datamart. We will sequentially establish the data feed for each hospital. From the datamart a model will be built for SSIs that could be prevented by the NPWT. In this way, it will refine the predictive value of the model for this specific intervention. The use of this modeling will help provide more personalized care plans for patients at greatest risk of SSI. PROJECT NARRATIVE Our goal is to provide data that will give surgeons and hospitals clear recommendations on the use of NPWT for Cesarean section, abdominal hysterectomy and colon surgeries in patients with diabetes and/or obesity. We also want to understand the patient experience with the dressing so that we can provide information that will enable clinicians to remove barriers to NPWT use. Additionally, we are seeking to use automated electronic medical record decision support to identify patients that will benefit most from the NPWT.",SUpPress SSI - Single Use Negative Pressure Wound Therapy (NPWT) to Reduce Surgical Site Infections,9659740,U01CK000557,[' '],NCEZID,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,U01,2018,941762,0.004125257311025407
"VERITY: Value and Evidence in Rheumatology using bioInformaTics, and advanced analYtics PROJECT ABSTRACT  Pediatric and adult rheumatic and musculoskeletal (MSK) diseases challenge the clinical researcher: they affect the population across the lifespan, impact a broad range of patient-centered outcomes, are rarely cured, and often have multiple possible treatment strategies. If properly addressed, these factors present tremendous opportunities for improving patient care and outcomes of patients. The overarching goal of the Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH) CCCR is to facilitate advancements in the methodologic sciences supporting clinical research within the NIAMS pediatric and adult rheumatic and musculoskeletal (MSK) disease missions.  VERITY is organized around central scientific themes that can be applied to multiple rheumatic and MSK diseases. The Cores address the following cross-cutting areas: 1) including patients in clinical trial design, outcome selection, result interpretation, and dissemination; 2) integrating behavioral economics to enhance benefits of known interventions, i.e., adherence to medications, engagement in physical activity and weight loss; 3) extracting maximum information content from big data; 4) using smart technologies (mobile health) to advance clinical research; and 5) disseminating knowledge and mentoring of local and national rheumatic and MSK disease clinical researchers through distributed learning models. These scientific themes will be approached through several Cores described in the following Specific Aims. 1.

"Learning-Based Approach for Personalized Craniomaxillofacial Surgical Planning Abstract: Our main clinical objective for this project is to provide personalized precision care to patients with craniomaxillofacial (CMF) deformities by significantly improving the surgical planning method. CMF deformities involve congenital and acquired deformities of the jaws and face. A large number of patients in the US and around the world suffer from CMF deformities. The basic principles of CMF surgery involve the restoration of deformed CMF structures back to normal anatomy and functions with osteotomy, autologous, bone grafts, or vascularized free flaps. The success of CMF surgery depends on not only the technical aspects of the operation, but also, to a large extent, the precise formulation of a surgical plan. However, CMF surgical planning is extremely challenging due to the complex nature of CMF anatomy and deformity. During a routine CMF surgical planning, a surgeon first acquires a three-dimensional (3D) model of the patient's skull. He then performs 3D cephalometric analysis to quantify the deformity. Finally, the surgery is simulated by virtually cutting the 3D model into multiple bony segments. The surgeon then tries his best to move and rotate each segment individually to a desired position within the normal range of cephalometric values (the current standard of care). This is problematic as “normal” cephalometric values are the averageness of normal population, in which each value has a mean and a standard deviation. Due to the variation within the normal values, the surgeon must often guess what the exact value the patient's cephalometric measurement should be corrected to. In addition, cephalometry is a group of only linear and angular measurements, which certainly cannot represent the complex nature of human CMF structures. Therefore, surgical outcomes are often subjective and heavily dependent on the surgeons' experience and artistic talent. Because each human face is different, the average “normal values” cannot represent the complex morphology of each individual face. To this end, we hypothesize that if a surgeon can foresee what the normal CMF shape of the patient should be, the surgical plan will be objective and personalized. Therefore, in this project, we propose developing and validating a new surgical planning method of using patient-specific and anatomically-correct reference models. The feasibility of our approach has already been proven by our preliminary studies. The results of this project will significantly improve the quality of patient care by developing personalized and precise surgical plans for CMF surgery objectively. The results will be especially beneficial to patients with jaw deformities, syndromic and non-syndromic craniofacial deformities, trauma, and CMF cancer. In the future, our approach can also be used to design and print 3D patient-specific resorbable bone implants with tissue engineering capability for bone regeneration. Project Narrative:  The current standard of care of making treatment plan for patients with craniomaxillofacial (CMF)  deformities is cephalometric analysis, including a group of linear and angular measurements, which  cannot represent the complex morphology of human CMF facial structures.  We propose to develop and validate an innovative shape-based surgical planning method of using  patient-specific and anatomically-correct reference models, for replacing the current subjective  cephalometric method.  The results of this project will significantly improve the quality of patient care by developing  personalized and precise surgical plans for CMF surgery objectively, which is especially beneficial  to the patients with jaw deformities, syndromic and non-syndromic deformities, trauma, and CMF cancer.",Learning-Based Approach for Personalized Craniomaxillofacial Surgical Planning,9518812,R01DE027251,"['3D Print', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Autologous', 'Back', 'Bilateral', 'Blood Vessels', 'Bone Regeneration', 'Bone Tissue', 'Bone Transplantation', 'Cephalometry', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computer Assisted', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Deformity', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Ensure', 'Face', 'Formulation', 'Future', 'Head', 'Human', 'Human Characteristics', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Jaw', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Motivation', 'Nature', 'Normal Range', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Orthodontics', 'Osteotomy', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Quality of Care', 'Research', 'Running', 'Shapes', 'Structure', 'Surgeon', 'Surgical Flaps', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Talents', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissue Engineering', 'Tissue Model', 'Trauma', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'bone', 'cone-beam computed tomography', 'craniofacial', 'craniomaxillofacial', 'cranium', 'deep learning', 'design', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'knowledge base', 'novel', 'operation', 'personalized approach', 'personalized care', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'psychologic', 'restoration', 'simulation', 'skull base', 'soft tissue', 'standard of care', 'success', 'surgery outcome', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'treatment planning', 'two-dimensional', 'usability', 'user-friendly', 'virtual']",NIDCR,METHODIST HOSPITAL RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2018,574725,0.005372292771257844
"Human nasal epithelial organoids as a non-invasive, personalized model for predicting effectiveness of CFTR modulators in cystic fibrosis patients Project Summary  The discovery of the single gene (CFTR) responsible for cystic fibrosis (CF) has been transformational in focusing treatment efforts on the development and approval of drugs that restore the function of the CFTR protein. Excellent clinical response for CF patients with “gating” mutations is observed following treatment with the CFTR modulator drug ivacaftor (VX-770); however, for the remaining ~95% of patients, no effective treatments exist. More than two thousand different CFTR mutations, combined with other genetic and environmental factors, result in significant variability in response among individuals to a single therapy. To improve the clinical outcome for all CF patients, it is important that patient-specific in vivo features of CF are faithfully reproduced in vitro for predictive screening assays. To meet that need we have developed a novel organoid-based screening platform, Sphera™, using cells derived from a patient’s nasal epithelia. Sphera couples patient-specific organoids with an integrated assessment of CFTR function, including organoid morphology and viscoelastic characterization of luminal mucus using our proprietary microrheology analytics. In Phase I we developed the Sphera platform and validated its utility in measuring organoid response to CFTR rescue. During Phase II we will define the efficiency and sensitivity of the Sphera platform and scale it for high throughput use in a cross-sectional clinical study. A multi-disciplinary, industry-academic partnership with expertise in all areas essential to the successful accomplishment of these aims has been assembled, including investigators with expertise in microfluidics, advanced mathematics, CF lung physiology, and clinical studies. Sphera will be commercialized as a full service platform marketed to clinical and drug development clients. The primary endpoint of this work is to develop a novel tool with dual utility in both CFTR modulator development and precision treatment for individuals with CF. Project Narrative  Individuals with cystic fibrosis face two realities: the extreme diversity in known CFTR mutations and the unpredictable response of CFTR modulator therapies in individual patients. This project expands the development of a comprehensive screening platform to rapidly identify the most promising therapy for individuals with cystic fibrosis.","Human nasal epithelial organoids as a non-invasive, personalized model for predicting effectiveness of CFTR modulators in cystic fibrosis patients",9533194,R44HL130189,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Bicarbonates', 'Biological Assay', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Client', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Drug Development', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Couples', 'Cystic Fibrosis', 'Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Databases', 'Dehydration', 'Development', 'Drug Approval', 'Effectiveness', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epithelial', 'Face', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Inflammation', 'Institutes', 'Liquid substance', 'Lung', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Membrane', 'Methodology', 'Microfluidics', 'Morphology', 'Mucous Membrane', 'Mucous body substance', 'Mutation', 'Nasal Epithelium', 'Nose', 'Organoids', 'Other Genetics', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Procedures', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Pulmonary Fibrosis', 'Pulmonary Function Test/Forced Expiratory Volume 1', 'Quality Control', 'Regulator Genes', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Services', 'Sputum', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Traction', 'Transportation', 'VX-770', 'Work', 'airway obstruction', 'base', 'biobank', 'chronic infection', 'clinical efficacy', 'clinical predictors', 'combinatorial', 'commercialization', 'cystic fibrosis patients', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'functional restoration', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'lifestyle factors', 'multidisciplinary', 'mutant', 'novel', 'particle', 'phase 1 testing', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'primary endpoint', 'prototype', 'response', 'screening', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'viscoelasticity']",NHLBI,"PATH BIOANALYTICS, INC.",R44,2018,799989,-0.012532346021617378
"Quantitative Histomorphometric Risk Classifier (QuHbIC) in HPV + Oropharyngeal Carcinoma SUMMARY: In 2016, nearly 50,000 adults in the US were diagnosed with oral and pharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), and nearly 10,000 died from the disease. Human papillomavirus (HPV) is now recognized as the most common cause of oropharyngeal (OP) SCC in the US. Although concomitant chemo- and radio-therapy is the most common treatment choice in patients with advanced OP-SCC, they have substantial short- and long- term morbidity and result in increased health care costs in patients who are cured of their cancers. These patients live with sometimes disabling morbidity for many years post-treatment. For these reasons, it has been suggested that therapy in lower risk patients might be de-escalated. There is also a higher risk cohort of patients in whom treatment with chemo-radiation may be insufficient, often resulting in distant metastatic failure. As such, these patients may require intensified therapies to improve outcomes. This is an agonizing choice for patients and their doctors, however. While patients do not want to be sickened by morbid treatments, they are obviously concerned about having the best chance at cure. Unfortunately, there currently are no companion diagnostic tools to identify which HPV + OPSCC patients are at (1) low risk of recurrence such that they can be treated safely to high cure rates with de-escalated therapy; (2) higher risk of failure despite aggressive high dose chemoradiation in whom treatment intensification strategies should be studied.  Recently, we developed a quantitative histomorphometric based image risk classifier (QuHbIC) that uses computerized measurements of tumor morphology (e.g. nuclear orientation, texture, shape, architecture) from digital images of H&E-stained tumor sections to predict progression in HPV+ OP-SCC patients; the current version of QuHbIC has already been validated in >400 patients and found to be superior to clinical variables in outcome prediction. In this Academic-Industry Partnership we seek to further improve predictive accuracy of QuHbIC by incorporating new classes of image features relating to stromal morphology, density and patterns of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, and tumor cell multi-nucleation, features now recognized as promising markers of unfavorable prognosis in HPV+ OP-SCC. We also seek to create a pre-commercial QuHbIC companion diagnostic test that is ready for clinical use in risk stratification in p16+ OP-SCC. QuHbIC will be trained on >700 retrospectively identified HPV + OP-SCC whole tissue slide images with associated long term outcome data and then validated on 440 cases from randomized, controlled, multi-institutional RTOG 0129 and 0522 clinical trials.  This partnership will leverage long-standing collaborations in (1) computational histomorphometry from the Madabhushi group at Case Western Reserve University, (2) surgical pathology and oncology expertise in HPV+ OPSCC from Vanderbilt University and the Cleveland Clinic and, (3) Inspirata Inc., a cancer diagnostics company that will bring quality management systems and production software standards to establish QuHbIC as an Affordable Precision Medicine (APM) solution for oropharyngeal cancers. Project Relevance: In this project we propose to optimize and validate a quantitative histomorphometric-based image classifier (QuHbIC) to better risk stratify survival among p16+ (Human papillomavirus (HPV)-related) OPSCC patients. The successful validation of QuHbIC could pave the way for its adoption as an Affordable Precision Medicine (APM) companion diagnostic tool, allowing for the identification of patients for whom therapies could be either ""de-escalated”, left as standard, or even potentially escalated, depending on risk status.",Quantitative Histomorphometric Risk Classifier (QuHbIC) in HPV + Oropharyngeal Carcinoma,9543057,R01CA220581,"['Adoption', 'Adult', 'Aftercare', 'American Joint Committee on Cancer', 'Architecture', 'Biological', 'Cancer Diagnostics', 'Categories', 'Cervical', 'Cessation of life', 'Chromosome abnormality', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Cooperative Group', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Distant', 'Distant Metastasis', 'Dose', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Epithelium', 'Failure', 'Foundations', 'HPV-High Risk', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining Method', 'Human Papillomavirus', 'Image', 'Indolent', 'International Union Against Cancer', 'Left', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphology', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Mutation', 'Nuclear', 'Oropharyngeal', 'Oropharyngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Production', 'Progressive Disease', 'Publishing', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Therapy Oncology Group', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials', 'Recurrence', 'Recurrent disease', 'Regimen', 'Regulatory Pathway', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retrospective cohort', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Slide', 'Smoking', 'Specimen', 'Squamous cell carcinoma', 'Stage Grouping', 'Stains', 'Stratification', 'Surgical Oncology', 'Surgical Pathology', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Tissue Stains', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Treatment Failure', 'Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocytes', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'chemoradiation', 'chemotherapy', 'cohort', 'commercialization', 'common treatment', 'companion diagnostics', 'computerized', 'cost', 'density', 'digital imaging', 'digital pathology', 'disorder risk', 'economic need', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'industry partner', 'innovation', 'malignant oropharynx neoplasm', 'neoplastic cell', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'overtreatment', 'patient subsets', 'pharynx squamous cell carcinoma', 'power analysis', 'precision medicine', 'prognostic', 'prognostic assays', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment choice', 'treatment response', 'tumor']",NCI,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,671111,0.0031722996768189645
"Adaptive Prediction of Blood Glucose Levels using Wearable Physiological Sensors ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Type 1 diabetes is a chronic disease, which presently cannot be prevented or cured. It is treated with insulin therapy and actively managed through blood glucose (BG) control. To avoid serious diabetic complications, patients must monitor their BG levels throughout the day, striving to avoid both hyperglycemia (high BG levels) and hypoglycemia (low BG levels). While continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) sensors and insulin pumps with ﬂexible dosing may aid in achieving good BG control, management of diabetes is still difﬁcult and laborious for patients and physicians. It is complicated by a wide variability among individual patients in terms of physiological responses to treatment as well as to life events such as stress, exercise, or changes in schedule and sleep. New portable sensing technologies have been recently developed for providing almost continuous measure- ments of an array of physiological parameters that include heart rate, skin conductance, skin temperature, and properties of body movements such as acceleration. The main research objective of this project is to leverage data acquired from wearable physiological sensors to build accurate, personalized blood glucose level prediction models for diabetes management. Predicting BG control problems before they occur would give patients time to intervene and prevent these problems. This would enhance patient safety and contribute to improved overall control, with its concomitant reduction in costly complications. Blood glucose level prediction is  very complex problem. Recent advances in unsupervised feature learning and deep learning have made it possible to learn complex models from data using simple algorithms. Inspired by these signiﬁcant developments in Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI), we propose to employ unsupervised feature learn- ing and deep learning techniques in order to build an architecture for modeling blood glucose behavior that can seamlessly incorporate data coming from any number of physiological sensors. A recurrent neu- ral network (RNN) will be trained to capture dependencies among the input physiological parameters that are relevant to BG prediction. To account for individual patient differences, a predictive model will be developed for each patient by training on the features discovered by the RNN. The primary impact of this work would be to improve the overall health and quality of life for the 1.25 million Americans with type 1 diabetes. Accurate prediction models would enable practical applications ranging from alerts of impending problems to decision support tools for evaluating the effects of different food or lifestyle choice. Additionally, the wealth of patient and sensor data collected for this work will lead to the creatin of de-identiﬁed datasets to be used by the research community in evaluating approaches to blood glucose prediction. The new approaches developed for this complex domain may aid in the development of time series forecasting models for a broad array of sensor-enabled applications in other health and wellness domains. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: To aid in diabetes management, machine learning models will be built to predict future blood glucose levels based on wearable sensor data from commercially available fitness bands in addition to blood glucose, insulin and meal data. These models could help the over one million Americans with type 1 diabetes to anticipate and prevent blood glucose control problems before they occur. This would enhance patient safety and contribute to improved overall blood glucose control, with its associated reduction in costly complications.",Adaptive Prediction of Blood Glucose Levels using Wearable Physiological Sensors,9272400,R21EB022356,"['Acceleration', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Amputation', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Blindness', 'Blood Glucose', 'Carbohydrates', 'Chronic Disease', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Dependency', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Dose', 'Engineering', 'Equation', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Expenditure', 'Food', 'Future', 'Galvanic Skin Response', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Heart Rate', 'Hyperglycemia', 'Hypoglycemia', 'Individual', 'Insulin', 'Insulin Infusion Systems', 'Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Intelligence', 'Intervention', 'Kidney Failure', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Life Style', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Patient Education', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Property', 'Quality of life', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Schedule', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin Temperature', 'Sleep', 'Speed', 'Stress', 'Stroke', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'blood glucose regulation', 'collected works', 'cost', 'data modeling', 'diabetes management', 'direct application', 'fitness', 'flexibility', 'glucose monitor', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel strategies', 'patient safety', 'physiologic model', 'portability', 'practical application', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'sensor', 'speech recognition', 'support tools', 'technology development', 'treatment response']",NIBIB,OHIO UNIVERSITY ATHENS,R21,2017,188594,0.011932684234495006
"Rule-based Semantics and Big Data Based Methods for Effective Clinical Decision Support (CDS): A Pediatric Severe Sepsis Case Study using ICU Data The recognition, diagnosis, and management of sepsis remain among the greatest challenges in pediatric critical care medicine. The diagnosis of pediatric severe sepsis is particularly challenging since it is time-critical and frequently must rely on clinician interpretation of an equivocal, non-specific, age-dependent constellation of clinical signs and symptoms that occur in association with an infection or other inciting events. Currently available EMR data screening tools designed to identify pediatric severe sepsis using consensus-based guidelines criteria have poor sensitivity/specificity and/or positive predictive value that can result in poor perceived usability. Recent studies show that, in general, sepsis CDS alert fatigue is common, either in the form of false positives or false negatives (e.g. alerting focused on the most severely ill with unequivocal signs of sepsis). As a result such tools are, at best, modestly clinically effective in improving early detection of unrecognized pediatric sepsis and, in infants, can result in antibiotic administration to large numbers of uninfected newborns. We believe significant improvement in CDS usability can only be achieved with a significant improvement in sensitivity/specificity and positive predictive value (PPV) operating at a clinician-specified level of risk. This will require alerting algorithms that leverage the combined analytic power of computerized semantic models (rules, natural language processing) embodied in consensus pediatric sepsis guidelines, pediatric critical care clinician expertise, and retrospective analytics over existing large repositories of clinical encounter data using machine learning algorithms. Late last year we were awarded a SBIR Phase 1 NIH research grant focused on the use of advanced ontological models combined with “big data” predictive analytics/machine learning (ML) techniques over ICU data as a foundation for an adult sepsis CDS. We demonstrated an AUC of 98% and PPV in excess of 85% for our sepsis detection tool for a patient sample of 15,811. We will leverage these results to establish exceptionally sensitive and specific tool that monitors PICU data to accurately predict pediatric patients at risk for impending acute clinical deterioration due to severe sepsis/septic shock. Our goal is to commercially deploy highly useable technology that achieves high levels of clinician acceptance and demonstrably influences timely treatment and pediatric patient outcomes. Our product development concept will employ human factors engineering to achieve highly synchronicity with clinical workflows, combined with a clinician-centered design of the interfaces between our CDS and the institutional pediatric sepsis protocols and EMR data sources. Our product vision is an early sepsis detection CDS with actionable accuracy and usability, compatible with any modern EMR in use at a client hospital, that is effective in reducing pediatric sepsis mortality in both critical and non-critical care settings. Even with the advent of powerful computer system technologies and modern antibiotics/antivirals used in hospitals, one-third of children who die in U.S. tertiary care pediatric intensive care units have severe sepsis. The goal of this research is to develop and validate a real-time pediatric severe sepsis surveillance software system that can be routinely used in conjunction with electronic medical record systems in hospitals to detect early stages of this syndrome. Our approach uses modern artificial intelligence techniques including cognitive reasoning, machine learning and natural language processing to dramatically reduce preventable mortality in hospitalized neonates and children.",Rule-based Semantics and Big Data Based Methods for Effective Clinical Decision Support (CDS): A Pediatric Severe Sepsis Case Study using ICU Data,9254171,R43GM122154,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Antibiotics', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Big Data', 'Case Study', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Client', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Computer Systems', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Consensus', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Discrimination', 'Disease Progression', 'Dysuria', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Engineering', 'Event', 'Exanthema', 'Fatigue', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Immune response', 'Infant', 'Infection', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Records', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Newborn Infant', 'Onset of illness', 'Ontology', 'Organ', 'Organism', 'Parents', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Intensive Care Units', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Predictive Factor', 'Predictive Value', 'Premature Infant', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Semantics', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sepsis', 'Septic Shock', 'Shock', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Supervision', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Vision', 'adverse outcome', 'age related', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'comparative', 'comparative effectiveness', 'computerized', 'design', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'disorder risk', 'improved', 'knowledge base', 'mortality', 'neonate', 'patient stratification', 'pediatric patients', 'predictive modeling', 'product development', 'prototype', 'repository', 'screening', 'software systems', 'symposium', 'tertiary care', 'tool', 'trend', 'usability']",NIGMS,"COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATES, INC.",R43,2017,147475,-0.015646255714850427
"Machine learning of physiological variables to predict diagnose and treat cardiorespiratory instability Project Summary/Abstract: If one could accurately predict who, when and why patients develop cardiorespiratory instability (CRI), then effective preemptive treatments could be given to improve outcome and better use care resources. However, CRI is often unrecognized until it is well established and patients are more refractory to treatment, or progressed to organ injury. We have shown that an integrated monitoring system alert obtained from continuous noninvasively acquired monitoring parameters and coupled to a care algorithm improved step-down unit (SDU) patient outcomes. We also showed that advanced HR variability analysis (sample entropy) identified SDU patients at CRI risk within 2 minutes, and if monitored for 5 minutes differentiated between patients who would develop CRI or remain stable over the next 48 hours. We also applied machine learning (ML) modeling to our clinically-relevant porcine model of hemorrhagic shock to characterize responses to hypovolemia, hemorrhage, and resuscitation, predict which animals would or would not collapse during hypovolemia, and identify occult bleeding 5 minutes earlier than with traditional monitoring. We now propose to apply our work to vulnerable and invasively monitored ICU patients. We will develop multivariable models through ML data-driven classification techniques such as regression, Fourier and principal component analysis, artificial neural networks, random forest classification, etc. as well as more novel approaches (temporal rule learning developed by our team; Bayesian Aggregation) to predict CRI in ICU patients. We will first use our existing annotated high fidelity waveform MIMIC II clinical data set (4200 patients) to develop predictive models and differential signatures for various CRI drivers. We will also use our high-density data collection and processing platform (Bernoulli) to prospectively collect data from ICUs in three institutions: Univ. Pittsburgh (PITT), Univ. California (UC) Irvine and UC San Diego (initial algorithm development conducted at PITT and validated in the UC systems). We will identify the number and type of independent measures, sampling frequency, and lead time necessary to create robust algorithms to: 1) predict impending CRI, 2) select the most effective treatments, 3) monitor treatment response, and 4) determine when treatment has restored physiologic stability and can be stopped. We will also determine the smallest number and types of parameters coupled to the longest CRI lead time to achieve the above four targets with the best sensitivity and specificity (a concept we call Monitoring Parsimony).We will simultaneously iteratively design and test a graphical user interface (GUI) and clinical decision support system (CDSS) driven by these parsimoniously derived predictive smart alerts and functional hemodynamic monitoring treatment approaches in two human simulation environments (PITT & UC Irvine).We envision a basic monitoring surveillance that identifies patients most likely to develop CRI to apply focused clinician attention and targeted treatments to deliver highly personalized medical care. Public Health Narrative If one could accurately predict who, when and why patients develop shock then effective preemptive treatments could be given to improve outcome and more effectively use healthcare resources. But signs of shock often occur late once organ injury is already present. The purpose of this study is to first develop multivariable models through data-driven classification techniques to parsimoniously predict cardiovascular insufficiency, etiology and response to treatment. We will do this first in our existing MIMIC II clinical data sets of 4200 ICU patients as to timing and types of instability. Then we will prospectively collect real time high- density data on patients admitted to our trauma intensive care units of University of Pittsburgh, UC Irvine and UC San Diego. We will create and test in simulators of ICU care bedside user interfaces to drive recognition and treatment algorithms based on these models in all three medical centers.",Machine learning of physiological variables to predict diagnose and treat cardiorespiratory instability,9247214,R01GM117622,"['Acute', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Attention', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'California', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Entropy', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Family suidae', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hemorrhagic Shock', 'Homeostasis', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Hypovolemia', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Institution', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Normal Range', 'Organ', 'Organ failure', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perioperative', 'Physiologic Monitoring', 'Physiological', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Recommendation', 'Refractory', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sepsis', 'Shock', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Stream', 'Stress', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'Triage', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Weaning', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinically relevant', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'database structure', 'density', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'early onset', 'effective therapy', 'fitness', 'forest', 'graphical user interface', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'insight', 'iterative design', 'mortality', 'novel strategies', 'patient population', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'response', 'simulation', 'support tools', 'treatment response']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2017,598066,0.025043752917854736
"Mechanistic Machine Learning PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The goal of this project is to combine empirical data with mechanistic physiologic knowledge to produce personalized, quantitative predictions that can lead to improved treatments. In normal practice, physicians reason by analogy from generic physiologic principles, but the technology exists to exploit even imperfect physiologic models make treatment personalized and quantitatively grounded in physiology, and to improve learning from empirical data. We will apply data assimilation (DA), mechanistic mathematical modeling, machine learning, and control theory, which have revolutionized space travel, weather forecasting, transportation and flight, and manufacturing. Data assimilation and control theory have seen very limited use in medicine, usually applied in data-rich circumstances like continuous glucose monitoring or packemakers. Our previous work demonstrated use of data assimilation with glucose-insulin models to predict glucose in the outpatient type 2 diabetes setting. We will extend data assimilation and control theory using, for example, a constrained ensemble Kalman filter and an offline Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm, to better handle sparse, short training sets on rapidly changing patients, and we will apply it in the setting of glucose management in the intensive care unit (ICU). Moreover, we will develop DA for phenotyping applications by exploiting the parameter estimation capabilities of DA. Data assimilation can be used to estimate measureable and unmeasureable physiologic states and parameters, and we will use these estimates to create higher definition phenotypes. While we are focusing on glucose management in the ICU, we will develop methods that are likely to generalize, beginning the effort to develop DA in the context of healthcare more broadly. The work we propose is a necessary step toward being able to use mechanism-driven DA to test, validate and optimize personalized short-term treatment strategies, long-term health forecasts, and mechanistic physiologic understanding. We will carry out the following aims: AIM 1—forecast—extend the DA methodology to allow forecasting, personalization, model evaluation, and model selection in the ICU context, relating treatment input to physiologic outcome; AIM 2—phenotype—extend the DA framework to state and parameter estimation to allow for mechanism-based phenotyping, careful uncertainty quantification, and inference of difficult or impossible-to-measure physiology; AIM 3—control—extend the DA to include a controller that begins with desired clinical outcomes, e.g., glucose range, and estimates the inputs, e.g., insulin or nutrition, required to achieve the outcomes. Narrative The goal of this project is to develop better ways to combine data about individual patients with knowledge about physiology to create personalized forecasts and recommendations about a patient's health. We specifically address the management of glucose in the intensive care unit, an area of high importance that could benefit from improved forecasts and recommendations.",Mechanistic Machine Learning,9427058,R01LM012734,"['Address', 'Admission activity', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Assimilations', 'Carbohydrates', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Depressed mood', 'Early Intervention', 'Eating', 'Endocrine Physiology', 'Evaluation', 'Fingers', 'Food', 'Future', 'Generic Drugs', 'Glomerular Filtration Rate', 'Glucose', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hepatic', 'Hour', 'Insulin', 'Insulin Infusion Systems', 'Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Markov chain Monte Carlo methodology', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Minor Planets', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Power Plants', 'Property', 'Publishing', 'Recommendation', 'Renal function', 'Running', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transportation', 'Treatment outcome', 'Uncertainty', 'Validity of Results', 'Weather', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical phenotype', 'computerized', 'control theory', 'fly', 'glucose metabolism', 'glucose monitor', 'glucose production', 'health record', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'insulin secretion', 'interstitial', 'mathematical model', 'nutrition', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'personalized learning', 'personalized medicine', 'physiologic model', 'reduced food intake', 'space travel', 'treatment strategy']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2017,698661,0.006111509366166106
"Reliable Seizure Prediction Using Physiological Signals and Machine Learning ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): For most individuals living with epilepsy, seizures are relatively infrequent events occupying a small fraction of their life. Despite spending as little a 0.01% of their lives having seizures (typically only minutes per month), people with epilepsy take anti-epileptic drugs (AED) daily, suffer AED related side effects, and spend their lives dreading when the next seizure will strike. The apparent randomness of seizures is associated with significant psychological consequences. In addition, despite daily AED approximately 1/3 of patients continue to have seizures. We hypothesize that epilepsy can be more effectively treated, both the seizures and their psychological impact, by providing patients with real-time seizure forecasting. Periods of low seizure probability would not require AEDs, or at least lower doses of AEDs, thus reducing AED exposure and their side effects. Periods of high seizure probability may respond to acute AED and patients could alter their activities to avoid injury. Patients would be empowered to manage their medications and life activities using reliable seizure forecasts. In this grant we investigate the hypothesis that seizures are predictable events, and pursue accurate, clinically relevant seizure forecasting using recent advances in support vector machines (SVM), data-analytic models, and Universum-SVM applied to continuous intracranial EEG (iEEG) in focal canine epilepsy. This is an initial step in establishin a new treatment paradigm for focal epilepsy, whereby the probability of seizure occurrence is continuously tracked for patient warning and intelligent responsive therapies. Naturally occurring focal canine epilepsy is an excellent model for investigation of seizure forecasting because of the clinical and electrophsyiological similarity to focal human epilepsy. This study provides a unique opportunity to study seizure forecasting in naturally occurring canine epilepsy under uniform conditions (the same environment). Importantly, dogs are large enough to accommodate devices designed for human use. The hypotheses driving this proposal are that focal seizures are not random events and there are brain states associated with low or high probability of seizure occurrence, and that these states can be reliably classified using machine learning approaches (SVM & Universum-SVM) that combine features from iEEG, behavioral state tracking, and electrocardiogram (ECG) heart rate variability. The goal of this proposal is to develop reliable seizure forecasting (when possible) and improved understanding (data characterization) when good forecasting is not possible. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This grant proposes to develop the capability for accurate, reliable seizure forecasting using recent advances in support vector machines, data-analytic models, and Universum-SVM applied to continuous intracranial EEG canines with naturally occurring epilepsy.

"Deep Learning and Streaming Analytics for Prediction of Adverse Events in the ICU ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)     Critical care medicine in the United States costs over 80 billion dollars annually. Over the past decade the rate of intensive care unit (ICU) use has been increasing, with a recent study reporting almost one in three Medicare beneficiaries experiencing an ICU visit during the last month of their lives. Every year, sepsis, a medical condition characterized by whole-body inflammation, strikes between 800,000 and 3.1 million Americans, killing approximately one in four patients affected. There is currently no definite treatment for sepsis in spite of many clinicl trials. However, early detection of sepsis and timely initiation of interventions are widely considered as important determinants of patient survival. However, basic care tasks (such as microbiological sampling and antibiotic delivery within 1 h, fluid resuscitation, and risk stratification using serum lactate or alternative), which are known to benefit most patients, are not performed in a timely manner. Previous literature suggests that high-resolution vital signs (such as heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, etc.), and other sequential measurements within the electronic medical records (EMRs), can be dynamically integrated using Machine Learning techniques to help with early detection of sepsis. With the ubiquity of inexpensive high- capacity storage and high-bandwidth streaming technology it is now possible to monitor patients' vital signs continuously (for instance, the research application developed by the Emory hospital ICU uses IBM's streaming analytics platform to transmit over 100,000 real-time data points per 100 beds, per second). Despite this continuous feed of data, commonly used acuity scores, such as APACHE and SAPS, are based on snapshot values of these vital signs (typically the worst values during a 24 hours period). This limitation is partially due to unavailability of computationally efficient and robust algorithms capable of finding predictive features in multivariate, nonlinear and nonstationary sequential data, which may reveal inter- organ communication and disintegration of causal couplings with critical illnesses such as sepsis.  We have recently developed a novel Machine Learning algorithm to discover automatically a collection of predictive multivariate dynamical patterns in a database of patient time-series, which can be used to classify patients or to monitor progression of disease in a given patient. The primary goal of this proposal is to apply our method to assess the predictive power of high- resolution multivariate time-series of vital signs and sequentially recorded EMR data in the ICU for early detection of sepsis and risk stratification of septic patient. To accomplish this, we aim to benchmark our technique on a large ICU cohort (the MIMIC II database with over 60,000 patients), as well as simulated data from a multiscale mathematical model of influence of inflammatory mediators on dynamical patterns of vital signs. Next, the technique will be externally validated on two separate ICU sepsis cohorts (the Emory Sepsis dataset and the Mayo Clinic Metric dataset). Finally, we will provide a real-time implementation of the proposed algorithm in an streaming environment (such as the IBM streaming analytics), in order to address the Big Data challenge of harnessing real-time, streaming sensor data from bedside monitors within the ICU, while enabling advanced pattern recognition and real-time forecasting. Ultimately we believe these methods can change the current standard of care through faster recognition and initiation of basic care, as well as guiding interventional strategis based on severity of illness and mechanisms underlying physiological deterioration. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    The proposed project is making use of computers to analyze data from sickest patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). We want to develop methods to identify patterns in the patient data which predict who is at risk for mortality and who might respond to various medications which could make them better. We have a very strong team of doctors and researchers who work closely together, covering all aspects of the proposed research, which we hope will help us improve the lives of the sickest patients in the ICU.",Deep Learning and Streaming Analytics for Prediction of Adverse Events in the ICU,9322197,K01ES025445,"['Address', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Antibiotics', 'Antihypertensive Agents', 'Beds', 'Benchmarking', 'Big Data', 'Blood Pressure', 'Caring', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computers', 'Critical Care', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Trees', 'Deterioration', 'Differential Equation', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Employee Strikes', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Goals', 'Heart Rate', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Intravenous', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Medicare', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Nature', 'Organ', 'Pathologic', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk stratification', 'SCAP2 gene', 'Sampling', 'Sepsis', 'Series', 'Serum', 'Severity of illness', 'Stream', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telemedicine', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'beneficiary', 'cohort', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'experience', 'feeding', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'killings', 'mathematical model', 'mortality', 'multi-scale modeling', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'parallel computer', 'patient safety', 'physiologic model', 'portability', 'prognostic', 'public health relevance', 'respiratory', 'safety practice', 'sensor', 'septic', 'simulation', 'standard of care', 'time use']",NIEHS,EMORY UNIVERSITY,K01,2017,190216,0.010009238545341649
"Interpretable Deep Learning Model for Longitudinal Electronic Health Records and Applications to Heart Failure Prediction   PROJECT  SUMMARY  Heart failure (HF) is a highly disabling and costly disease with a high mortality rate. In the pre­diagnostic phase  (i.e.,  12­36  months  before  diagnosis),  HF  is  difficult  to  detect  given  the  insidious  signs  and  symptoms.  After  diagnosis,  where  it  is not possible to reverse disease progression, efforts are made to avoid hospital admission  and  re­admission,  but  with  limited  capabilities  to  stratify  patients  by  risk.  We  propose  to  develop  interpretable  deep learning models applied to large­scale electronic health record (EHR) data to detect HF related events on  two  different  time  scales.  One  set  of  models will be developed to detect HF diagnosis one to two years before  actual  documented  diagnosis.  Separately,  we  propose  to  identify  HF  patients  who  are  at  risk  of  hospital  admission  and  readmission . The project focuses on developing deep learning models that offer the potential for  greater  accuracy,  clinical  interpretability,  and  utility  than  alternatives.  The  expected  deliverables  include  comprehensive  software  for  creating  deep  learning  algorithms  that  predict  HF  outcomes  and  related  software  tools  for  model  visualization.           PROJECT NARRATIVE Deep learning has shown tremendous success in many domains but is yet to have similar impact in health care.

"PRECEDE: PREsurgical Cognitive Evaluation via Digital clockfacEdrawing ABSTRACT Preoperative cognitive impairment is common among older adults preparing for surgery. Despite growing evidence that preoperative cognitive/neuronal integrity is a risk factor for perioperative insults and post- operative adverse outcomes, health care systems do not systematically pre-operatively screen for cognition. Clinical researchers have yet to identify a pragmatic approach to pre-operative cognitive screening. Our team members have developed the digital Clock Drawing Test (dCDT), a tool that captures subtle behavioral variables during a rapid (5-minute) clock drawing assessment. The data and benefit afforded by this tool have yet to be considered across perioperative contexts. We will apply the dCDT within a large number of pre- surgical patients (n=5,000 per year) coupled with novel machine learning algorithms to address three specific aims. Aim 1: examine range and distribution of preoperative neurocognitive impairment with older adult preoperative patients relative to non-surgical older adult demographically matched peers (available n=2,400 via NIH/Boston University Framingham Heart Study) using novel previously unobserved dCDT graphomotor and decision making variables; Aim 2: examine the predictive validity of presurgical dCDT variables on postoperative, clinician reported/hospital recorded events; Aim 3: examine pre to postoperative 6-week, 3- month, and 1-year change in dCDT and NIH PROMIS metrics for thoracic (n=70), orthopedic (n=70), major abdominal-pelvic patients (n=70), and non-surgery peers (n=70). For the observational studies (Aim 1 and 2), individuals > 65 years presenting to the UFHealth presurgical clinic will complete the dCDT as well as a three- word memory test and frailty assessment as part of the standard clinical evaluation. Surgical and anesthetic details will be acquired via the electronic medical record. Clinically-relevant outcomes will include complications, length of stay, cost of care, functional capacity, and mortality. Outcomes will be supplemented by a separate longitudinally-studied subgroup (Aim 3) completing NIH PROMIS metrics at 6 weeks, 3 months, and 1year after surgery. Analyses will focus on stratifying distributions and clusters of dCDT characteristics across numerous sociodemographic, surgical, and anesthetic factors. The predictive value of the dCDT will be modeled relative to clinical outcomes. Changes in dCDT and baseline NIH PROMIS domains will be compared pre- and post-operatively and examined for interactions with longitudinal perioperative events. Subaims: We will apply `deep learning' approaches to drawings to identify novel features of pre-surgical patients relative to a large sample of demographically equated dCDT data points available through the Framingham Heart Study. Symbolic aggregate approximation (SAX)-based machine learning approaches will characterize interactions between preoperative dCDT features and intraoperative anesthetic sensitivities.  PROJECT NARRATIVE Assessing cognition prior to surgery has relevance for a number of reasons, but has yet to be applied due to pragmatic issues associated with assessment complexities and time. Here, we will leverage a modernized digital version of a well-known cognitive screening tool (the Clock Drawing Test) to examine 1) pre-operative cognitive abilities in adults > 65 years attending a tertiary academic medical hospital pre-operative clinic; 2) how pre-operative cognitive abilities predict post-operative hospital/clinical reported outcomes (i.e., length of stay, hospital cost) and 3) how pre-operative cognitive abilities interact with perioperative events to predict post-operative cognitive change and patient reported outcomes. The study will result in improved ability to appreciate cognition in older adults electing surgery and optimize their perioperative experience.",PRECEDE: PREsurgical Cognitive Evaluation via Digital clockfacEdrawing,9382352,R01AG055337,"['Abdomen', 'Academic Medical Centers', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'American College of Surgeons', 'Anesthetics', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Boston', 'Cardiac', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Chest', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complication', 'Comprehension', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Elderly', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Face', 'Framingham Heart Study', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospital Records', 'Hospitals', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Length of Stay', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Memory', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'Neurons', 'Observational Study', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Orthopedics', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patients', 'Pelvis', 'Perioperative', 'Postoperative Pain', 'Postoperative Period', 'Predictive Value', 'Price', 'Psyche structure', 'Recovery', 'Regression Analysis', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Secondary to', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Societies', 'Subgroup', 'Suggestion', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'adverse outcome', 'age effect', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive change', 'cognitive process', 'cognitive testing', 'cost', 'digital', 'executive function', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'frailty', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'member', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'peer', 'performance tests', 'prospective', 'research clinical testing', 'screening', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,R01,2017,479151,-0.028550355129379014
"Telehealth Intervention for Improved Blood Pressure Control with Targeted Incentives: Using New Technologies and Insights From Behavioral Economics to Increase the Effectiveness of Behavioral Change PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: Hypertension, or sustained systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP) of 140 and 90 mm Hg or higher, is among the most frequently encountered conditions in primary care in the U.S. The estimated prevalence is 30% among all U.S. adults and increases with age to affect 65% of seniors. Hypertension is also the leading risk factor for cardiovascular disease, global mortality, and ranks third among the causes of disability. Treatment of hypertension is relatively straightforward, but patient adherence to long- term self-care strategies is problematically low. Three important behaviors that individuals can adhere to in order to help lower their BP are 1) Taking medications as prescribed by a physician, 2) Monitoring blood pressure at home, and 3) Limiting dietary sodium intake. Adherence to these behaviors is problematic and currently ranges from 25% to 50%; the current proposal is aimed at addressing the behavioral barriers for these three activities with the help of new technology. In particular, this STTR will develop and test an incentive program delivered through a telehealth app to increase adherence to prescribed BP control regimens, and precipitate reduction in BP. The target participants for the test are a vulnerable population of seniors with clinically diagnosed hypertension in the University of California - San Diego community. The product to be developed through this STTR is a telehealth app for patient smartphones, which incorporates financial and targeted incentives framed in a way that targets specific “mental accounts” to maximize the behavioral effectiveness of the intervention. The approach is to (1) Using focus group to construct an optimal incentive strategy to promote adherence to overcome behavioral barriers, support self-efficacy, and complement intrinsic motivators, and (2) Demonstrate feasibility of combining behavioral economics with state-of-the-art telehealth technology to deliver an optimal incentive strategy to the specific group of patients to promote adherence and reduce BP. The telehealth innovation centers on (a) Immediate delivery of reminder triggers and reinforcement to establish behaviors, (b) Employment of computer vision and artificial intelligence technologies to reduce time and effort costs of adherence, and finally (c) Support for remote monitoring of patient progress by health plans, providers and researchers. Phase II will test the efficacy of this approach in a larger and more diverse population within the UCSD Health system, additionally incorporating incentives for outcomes (e.g., achievement of BP < 140/90 mm Hg) to search for statistically and clinically significant improvements in blood pressure resulting from use of the app with the optimal incentives. Initial customers are health insurers and risk-bearing hospital systems (e.g. those with value-based reimbursement models), who are fiscally responsible for large numbers of patients with poorly controlled BP. PROJECT NARRATIVE/PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Nonadherence to treatment for high blood pressure in the aging population is an urgent public health concern that impacts individuals, families, and communities across the nation. The resulting health problems, including cardiovascular disease, heart attack, stroke, and death, and excessive spending, can be relieved through enhanced remote support for behavioral change using low-cost, scalable, and widely accessible telehealth tools, such as the product of this STTR. This approach has the potential to become widely adopted by health plans and providers that care for millions of seniors with poorly controlled hypertension to help these populations avoid complications and achieve better their health, as well as contribute to a better understanding of human behaviors and their impact on medical conditions.",Telehealth Intervention for Improved Blood Pressure Control with Targeted Incentives: Using New Technologies and Insights From Behavioral Economics to Increase the Effectiveness of Behavioral Change,9345760,R41AG056184,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Antihypertensive Agents', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood Pressure Monitors', 'California', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Diastolic blood pressure', 'Dietary Sodium', 'Documentation', 'Effectiveness', 'Effectiveness of Interventions', 'Employment', 'Failure', 'Family', 'Focus Groups', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Planning', 'Health Technology', 'Health system', 'Home Blood Pressure Monitoring', 'Home environment', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Incentives', 'Individual', 'Insurance Carriers', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Literature', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicare/Medicaid', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Health Care', 'Provider', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Public Health', 'Regimen', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Salvelinus', 'Self Care', 'Self Efficacy', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Sodium', 'Stroke', 'System', 'Target Populations', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Universities', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'aging population', 'base', 'behavior change', 'behavioral economics', 'beneficiary', 'blood pressure reduction', 'blood pressure regulation', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinically significant', 'commercial application', 'compliance behavior', 'cost', 'digital', 'disability', 'disparity reduction', 'dual eligible', 'efficacy testing', 'evidence base', 'health care quality', 'hypertension control', 'hypertension treatment', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'member', 'mortality', 'new technology', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'telehealth', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'treatment adherence', 'usability']",NIA,"WELLTH, INC.",R41,2017,223743,-0.003121445254629002
"Pattern Classification Using Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Traumatic Brain Injury PROJECT SUMMARY Mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI) affects ~1.5 million persons annually in the United States with fifteen to 30% of patients suffering long-term disability after injury. We remain in the early phase of understanding this disease and one of the greatest barriers to studying the disease and developing appropriate therapy is the difficulty in diagnosis and outcome prediction. Generally, the diagnosis of MTBI relies on using the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), a 15-point gross measurement of eye-opening, motor and verbal response. The National Institute for Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) workshop in 2014 indicated that use of GCS score as a single classifier for TBI is insufficient and proposed that neuroimaging play a larger role towards the development of objective criteria for diagnosis and outcome prediction. We have specific experience in studying novel MRI techniques that show much promise in evaluating MTBI patients. The goal of the current proposal is to bring these novel MRI techniques to clinical use. We propose to combine information from objective MR imaging features with clinical information to learn the patterns that can best distinguish patients from controls and predict long-term outcome using machine learning. We will validate our tool using a separate subject cohort. Such a tool would be an extremely powerful clinical tool to identify at-risk patients for early intervention. Additionally, this research will identify the most clinically relevant MR metrics, thereby pointing the way to novel therapeutic pathways. PROJECT NARRATIVE Mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI) is a major public health problem for which there is a lack of evidence-based, quantitative and objective criteria for diagnosis and outcome prediction. The goal of the proposed research is to incorporate recent advances in MR imaging of MTBI with clinically important information using advanced machine-learning computational algorithms to identify the most clinically relevant features, thus allowing us to distinguish patients from controls and to predict clinical outcome. If successful, this research will provide an objective tool for classification and outcome prediction in MTBI and will be a critical advance in both the clinical and research arenas in the study of traumatic brain injury.",Pattern Classification Using Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Traumatic Brain Injury,9295067,R21NS090349,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Biological Markers', 'Biophysics', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Common Data Element', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Connective Tissue', 'Corpus Callosum', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Educational workshop', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Eye', 'FarGo', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Glasgow Coma Scale', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Image', 'Imaging problem', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Iron', 'Learning', 'Linear Regressions', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Neurons', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Neuropsychology', 'Non-linear Models', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regression Analysis', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Societies', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Trauma', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'axon injury', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'disability', 'drug development', 'evidence base', 'executive function', 'experience', 'improved', 'indexing', 'magnetic field', 'mild traumatic brain injury', 'mood regulation', 'neural patterning', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'scaffold', 'tool', 'white matter', 'white matter injury']",NINDS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R21,2017,198365,-0.013216180566524934
"Identification of Patients with Low Life Expectancy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is increasingly recognized that optimal treatment is not the same for every patient - it depends on the individual patient's circumstances. One important factor that determines the optimal clinical management is the patient's life expectancy, which determines the temporal horizon within which medical decisions have to operate. For example, while adding an extra diabetes medication may save a 40-year-old individual from going blind or developing kidney failure 20 years later, it will not bring any benefits to an 80-yer old with a metastatic malignancy who is expected to live only a few months.  Consequently, it is critical that when we measure quality of care, suggest treatment options to clinicians through clinical decision support or compare different treatment strategies, we take into account the patient's life expectancy. However, currently there are no methods available that can do this with sufficient accuracy.  Most commonly used techniques to assess a patient's mortality risk draw primarily on administrative data and other structured data fields in electronic medical records. This approach leaves out a large amount of information that is only available in narrative documents such as provider notes, radiology reports, etc. In this project we propose to test the hypothesis that application of two novel technologies - artificial intelligence technique Dynamic Logic and natural language processing (NLP) - could leverage the information in narrative electronic documents to significantly improve the accuracy of identification of patients with low life expectancy.  Dynamic Logic allows to circumvent the challenge of combinatorial complexity that limits the number of variables and their combinations that can be considered as predictors of an outcome by most currently used analytical methods. Dynamic Logic makes use of a limited number of iterative approximations to reduce the complexity of a problem with multiple predictor variables from exponential to approximately linear. Utilization of Dynamic Logic will allow us to greatly increase the richness of the models for identification of patients with low life expectancy and ultimately improve their accuracy.  Information such as the patient's functional status that is usually only found in narrative documents may be critical to improving accuracy of identifying frail patients at high mortality risk. Modern NLP techniques can effectively identify key concepts in medical text but until now analytical methods allowed consideration of only a few of pre-selected concepts in prediction models. Combining NLP with Dynamic Logic will allow us to greatly expand the number of concepts from narrative text that could be included in the life expectancy prediction model, likely leading to a considerable improvement in accuracy.  In the proposed translational multidisciplinary project our team that will include experts on artificial intelligence, natural language processing, analysis of data in electronic medical records, and geriatrics will test whether a combination of Dynamic Logic and NLP improves identification of patients at high risk of death. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Identification of patients with limited life expectancy is important for accurate measurement of quality of care delivered by clinicians, clinical decision support in electronic medical records and research that compares different treatment options for patients. However, currently available methods suffer from low accuracy or use information that is not widely available. In this project we propose to combine two advanced computational technologies - artificial intelligence technique Dynamic Logic and natural language processing - to improve accuracy of identification of patients with low life expectancy.",Identification of Patients with Low Life Expectancy,9275946,R01HS024090,[' '],AHRQ,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2017,227900,-0.01872139474717315
"Early CSF detection of FTLD DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) is the second most common cause of dementia among subjects under the age of 65. There are two main FTLD subtypes: FTLD associated with lesions immunoreactive to TDP-43 (FTLD-TDP), and FTLD associated with Tau-immunoreactive lesions (FTLD-Tau). Currently, the exact FTLD pathology cannot be confidently defined until autopsy, and there is an urgent need for ante- mortem biomarker which reliably predict FTLD pathology. Over the past 30 months, I have identified and validated a panel of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) FTLD-TDP biomarkers that identified FTLD-TDP patients with 85% accuracy, including Tau phosphorylation, tripeptidyl peptidase 1 (TPP1) levels, and inflammatory protein levels (FAS, eotaxin-3, IL-23), with 85% accuracy in distinguishing between the two main FTLD subtypes. The identification and validation of these CSF alterations will serve as the basis of the current proposal to translate these markers towards clinical application through multi-site technical validation and advanced classification through machine-based learning, and to better characterize altered biochemical pathways in FTLD-TDP. First, I hypothesize that we can reduce the coefficient of variation for each FTLD-TDP biomarker to under 15% through a multi-site technical validation using 60 banked CSF samples. I will test this hypothesis in Aim 1 by determining technical factors (freeze-thawing, blood contamination, detergent use, protease inhibitor use, buffer condition) which reduce assay precision, and validating the assay at Penn. Second, I hypothesize that machine-based learning/support vector machine approach will better diagnose FTLD-TDP by taking into account non-linear effects of age, gender, and disease duration. I will test this hypothesis in Aim 2 by comparing the classification performance between more established algorithms and the support vector machine algorithm. Lastly, I hypothesize that these biomarker changes reflect altered biochemical pathways in FTLD-TDP. I will test this hypothesis by measuring brain and CSF levels of proteins involved in Tau phosphorylation, TPP1 maturation, and inflammation. As an exploratory Sub-aim 3a, I will determine if any of the changes from Aims 1 & 3 are detectable in asymptomatic subjects carrying familial FTLD-TDP mutations, to power an R01 application on longitudinal CSF biomarker changes in prodromal FTLD-TDP subjects. I will carry out this proposal with guidance from my mentoring team including Allan Levey, MD, PhD (Emory), John Trojanowski, MD, PhD (Penn), James Lah, MD, PhD (Emory), Jonathan Glass, MD (Emory), Leslie Shaw, PhD (Penn), and Eva Lee, PhD (Georgia Tech). I will also obtain formal training in biostatistics, bioinformatics, analytical chemistry, quality control, clinical trial design, geriatrics, and responsible conduct of research. Successful completion of the aims in the current proposal will establish the standard procedures to clinically  translate promising FTLD-TDP biomarkers, determine the best algorithm to diagnose FTLD-TDP using these biomarkers, and identify altered CSF and brain pathways related to these biomarker alterations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: FTLD is the second most common cause of dementia among subjects under the age of 65, and patients and their caregivers face unique challenges including poor judgment on the job, single parents suffering from FTLD with young children, and working spouses as caregivers. There is currently no reliable way to predict the underlying FTLD subtype, and as a result it is challenging to enroll the appropriate patients for substrate-specifi clinical trials (such as drugs targeting TDP but not Tau). This proposal will establish the standardized measurements of FTLD-TDP biomarkers towards translating this research panel into clinical testing, and identify biomarker changes which can be used even when symptoms are very mild. Early and accurate FTLD- TDP diagnosis will enhance future drug development and clinical trial design to alleviate the unique personal, social, and economic burden of FTLD.",Early CSF detection of FTLD,9279027,K23AG042856,"['Accounting', 'Adult', 'Adult Children', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Autopsy', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Buffers', 'CCL26 gene', 'Caregivers', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Detergents', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Drug Targeting', 'Economic Burden', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'Face', 'Freezing', 'Frontotemporal Lobar Degenerations', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Geriatrics', 'Glass', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Institutes', 'Judgment', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Occupations', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phosphorylation', 'Procedures', 'Protease Inhibitor', 'Proteins', 'Quality Control', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Training', 'Sampling', 'Single Parent', 'Site', 'Spouses', 'Standardization', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Trials', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Tube', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'age effect', 'base', 'brain pathway', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'design', 'drug development', 'experimental study', 'illness length', 'immunoreactivity', 'improved', 'inflammatory marker', 'interleukin-23', 'model design', 'novel', 'pediatric patients', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'protein TDP-43', 'public health relevance', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'responsible research conduct', 'social', 'tau Proteins', 'tau phosphorylation', 'tau-1', 'tool', 'trial design', 'tripeptidyl aminopeptidase']",NIA,EMORY UNIVERSITY,K23,2017,156324,-0.008463535097004248
"Multiparametric Prediction of Vasospasm after Subarachnoid Hemorrhage ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (SAH) affects an estimated 14.5 per 100,000 persons in the United States, and is a substantial burden on health care resources, because it can cause long-term functional and cognitive disability. Much of this is due to delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) from vasospasm (VSP). VSP refers to the reactive narrowing of cerebral blood vessels due the unusual presence of blood surrounding the vessel. In its extreme, severe VSP precludes blood flow to brain tissue, resulting in stroke.  SAH is one of the most common disease entities treated in the Neurointensive Care Unit (NICU). Currently, resource planning is scripted around the Modified Fisher Scale, which predicts the odds ratio of developing DCI based on the volume and pattern of blood on initial brain computed tomography (CT). It does not, however, allow for further individualized risk assessments. The first 14 days are occupied by efforts to detect preclinical or early VSP and arrange timely interventions to prevent permanent injury. The only noninvasive tool supported by guidelines to potentially identify preclinical VSP is the transcrania Doppler (TCD), which has an unreliable range of sensitivity and negative predictive values, and is at the mercy of technician availability. If not identified preclinically, VSP must be detected once it is symptomatic and is then dependent on quality and availability of expertise in the complex and diurnal environment of the ICU.  Promisingly, electronic medical record (EMR) data and continuous physiology monitors offer abundant opportunities to risk stratify for future events as well as reveal events in real-time in the acutely brain injured patient. A methodical approach to feature engineering will be performed over a large set of potentially discriminatory data-driven and knowledge-based features. Meta-features representing variations and trends in time series variables will be extracted using a variety of quantitative and symbolic abstraction techniques. Predictive modeling will be performed using Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine.  This project will result in a prediction tool that improves timeliness and precision in VSP classification. It will fill an important gap in the understanding of the potentia of underutilized EMR and physiological data to predict neurological decline. Generating accurate and timely prediction rules from already collected clinical data would be cost effective and have implications not only for SAH patients, but also for almost any monitored patient in any ICU. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    This project will explore the optimal methods for creating a prediction tool that improves timeliness and precision of diagnosis.

"Tailored Drug Titration through Artificial Intelligence Optima Integrated Health Inc. (Optima) proposes to demonstrate the clinical efficacy of the decision support technology for medication treatment optimization it validated in a pilot clinical trial, optima4BP. optima4BP is designed as a physician decision/action support aid in timely and safely optimizing medication treatment independent of in-office visits, for patients with uncontrolled hypertension (HTN). optima4BP is designed to reduce preventable hospitalizations and the associated incidence of stroke, heart failure (HF) or myocardial infarction (MI) events resulting from high blood pressure (BP) above goal. Uncontrolled HTN affects 34 million Americans. The cost of HTN-associated hospitalizations is $113 billion, or 15% of all hospital costs, with >135 million Emergency Dptm. (ED) visits. optima4BP will improve the quality of life for uncontrolled HTN patients, and reduce this massive burden on the US healthcare system. Our long term objective is to help drive the transformation from the reactive pay-for-service healthcare paradigm to one that emphasizes preventative care through personalized health surveillance, assessment, and action via timely and safely optimized medication treatment. Our specific aims include: Aim (1) demonstrating the efficacy of optima4BP in a randomized clinical trial (n=300 patients) deployed at UC San Francisco Medical Center. Patients will be randomized to an enhanced care (EC) arm or an optima4BP arm (O4BP). All patients will use Omron10 BP arm cuff to remotely measure their BP. For the patients in the EC arm, physicians will be provided with a monthly summary of the Omron10 data. For patients in the O4BP arm, aside from the BP monthly summary, physicians will receive (a) a risk stratified patient roster, (b) next step actions in medication optimization for each patient, and (c) access to optima4BP's secure web-service medication treatment modeling to investigate how changing current patient data could affect medication choice (e.g., change in medication choice if BP goal is lowered). We will then examine the BP value reduction between arms (success:>7 mmHg decreased systolic; >4 mmHg decreased diastolic of O4BP vs. EC), along with secondary outcomes between O4BP and EC: medication treatment action frequency; ED admissions due to HTN-related symptoms and associated hospitalizations for stroke, HF or MI; and overall cost of HTN management. Aim (2) optima4BP data processing steps will be optimized to scale-up its capability to >1000/day patient cases processing power. 3 specific optimization processing tools will be developed: Optima Extract, Transform, and Load (OETL); Optima Survey Generator (OSG), and Optima Message Builder (OMB). OETL will provide streamlined scheduling logic to extracting data from Epic® EMR (electronic medical record), optimize data mapping scripts within optima4BP, and optimize data uploading protocols. OSG will optimize the current generation protocol for patient surveys, patient response, and assignment of patient responses to specific processing modules. OMB will ensure streamlined scheduling of risk stratification updates and scheduled delivery to physician In-Basket messaging system within Epic® EHR. Our goal is to simplify the management of high blood pressure (BP) while improving the quality of care of patients and reducing the associated costs. We will investigate the benefits of a novel surveillance- assessment-medication treatment action artificial intelligence (optima4BP) as a physician decision support aid in timely and safely optimizing medication treatment independent of in-office visits, with the goal of reducing preventable hospitalizations and the associated incidence of stroke, heart failure or heart attack events.",Tailored Drug Titration through Artificial Intelligence,9341533,R44HL132622,"['Admission activity', 'Adoption', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Age', 'American', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Blood Pressure', 'Businesses', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Comorbidity', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Emergency Situation', 'Emergency department visit', 'Ensure', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Gender', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart failure', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospitalization', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Hypertension', 'Incidence', 'Intelligence', 'Intervention Studies', 'Laboratories', 'Life Style', 'Logic', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Modeling', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Office Visits', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Preventive care', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of Care', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'San Francisco', 'Schedule', 'Secure', 'Site', 'Stroke', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Titrations', 'Update', 'Visit', 'arm', 'base', 'blood pressure reduction', 'blood pressure regulation', 'clinical efficacy', 'cloud based', 'commercial application', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'design', 'health care delivery', 'health care service', 'health data', 'hypertension treatment', 'improved', 'innovative technologies', 'medication compliance', 'novel', 'patient stratification', 'primary outcome', 'response', 'scale up', 'secondary outcome', 'success', 'tool', 'web services']",NHLBI,"OPTIMA INTEGRATED HEALTH, INC.",R44,2017,849047,-0.009399215652487521
"Instrumental screening for dysphagia by combining high-resolution cervical auscultation with advanced data analysis tools to identify silent dysphagia and silent aspiration ABSTRACT Dysphagia (disordered swallowing) causes nearly 150,000 annual hospitalizations and over 220,000 additional hospital days, and prolongs hospital lengths of stay by 40%. Dysphagia risk is typically identified through subjective screening methods and those identified through screening undergo gold standard imaging testing such as videofluoroscopy (VF). However, screening methods over- or underestimate risk, and completely fail to identify patients with silent dysphagia (e.g., silent aspiration) that can cause pneumonia and other adverse events. Pre-emptive detection of silent or near-silent aspiration is essential. The long term goal is to develop an instrumental dysphagia screening approach based on high-resolution cervical auscultation (HRCA) in order to early predict dysphagia-related adverse events, and initiate intervention measures to mitigate them. The overall objective here is to develop accurate, advanced data analysis approaches to translate HRCA signals to swallowing events observed in VF images. Our strong preliminary data has led us to our central hypothesis: advanced data analytics tools are suitable approaches for the analysis of HRCA in order to automate dysphagia screening. The rationale is that a reliable, robust early-warning instrumental dysphagia screening approach will reduce adverse events in patients with silent aspiration/dysphagia, shorten length of stay and improve overall clinical outcomes. Guided by strong preliminary data, we will pursue the following three specific aims: (1) develop machine learning algorithms to differentiate HRCA signals produced by swallowing physiologic events from similar, non-swallow related signals produced during swallowing; (2) translate HRCA swallowing-signal signatures to actual swallow physiologic events to detect abnormal swallowing physiology; and (3) discriminate normal from abnormal airway protection and swallow physiology via machine-learning analysis of HRCA signals with similar accuracy as VF. Under the first aim, a machine learning approach will be used to detect pharyngeal swallowing events and differentiate them from speech, cough and other non- swallow events, with 90% accuracy, when compared to a human expert’s interpretation of our VF data sets. Under the second aim, objective swallowing physiology observations from VF will be matched to swallowing events observed with HRCA in order to show that abnormal swallow physiology and airway protection will produce distinctive HRCA signal signatures that predict the same events identified with VF. Under the third aim, analytical algorithms will be used to detect signs of disordered airway protection in HRCA signal signatures with 90% accuracy when compared to a human expert’s airway protection ratings from VF images. The approach is innovative, as it will produce analysis tools that will infer about dysphagia and aspiration based on the analysis of HRCA with unprecedented accuracy, before patients are placed in harm’s way. Our work is significant, because it will translate to an early-warning HRCA screening tool that predicts dysphagia- related adverse events in asymptomatic patients reducing medical adverse events, and length of stay. The proposed research is relevant to public health because dysphagia is related to nearly 150,000 annual hospitalizations and over 220,000 additional hospital days, it increases pneumonia incidence, prolongs hospital stays by 40% for patients with many diseases, and is prevalent in acute care hospitals and nursing homes. Choking (airway obstruction) and pneumonia due to aspiration (inhalation of swallowed food and liquids), are common results of dysphagia, and both are preventable when dysphagia is identified before patients are offered oral food, liquids or medications. The proposed research is relevant to the part of NIH’s mission that pertains to enhancing health, lengthening life and reducing illnesses, as we will develop new data analytics tools to be used along with high-resolution cervical auscultation in order to instrumentally screen for dysphagia and predict dysphagia-related adverse events before they can harm patients with dysphagia.",Instrumental screening for dysphagia by combining high-resolution cervical auscultation with advanced data analysis tools to identify silent dysphagia and silent aspiration,9355417,R01HD092239,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Adult', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Aspirate substance', 'Aspiration Pneumonia', 'Auscultation', 'Biomechanics', 'Breathing', 'Caring', 'Cervical', 'Choking', 'Clinical', 'Coughing', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Deglutition', 'Deglutition Disorders', 'Dehydration', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Device Designs', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disabled Persons', 'Disease', 'Equipment', 'Event', 'Food', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Group Homes', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Health', 'Hospital Nursing', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Length of Stay', 'Life', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Malnutrition', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nature', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Nursing Homes', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Pneumonia', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speech', 'Stroke', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Water', 'Work', 'airway obstruction', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'clinical practice', 'clinically significant', 'image processing', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'kinematics', 'mortality', 'patient safety', 'predictive signature', 'predictive tools', 'screening', 'tool', 'translational impact', 'vibration']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2017,302394,0.007657351215185782
"Towards automated phenotyping in epilepsy Over 5 million children and adults in the United States have had a diagnosis of epilepsy or a seizure disorder. However, treatment options for the epilepsies remain inadequate, because many patients suffer from uncontrolled seizures and from the negative side effects of treatment. A major obstacle to the faster development of new anti-convulsant therapies is the fact that rigorous preclinical epilepsy research typically requires labor-intensive and expensive 24/7 video-EEG monitoring of seizures that rests on the subjective scoring of seizure phenotypes by human observers (as exemplified by the widely used Racine scale of behavioral seizures). We propose to test if it is possible to perform objective, inexpensive and automated phenotyping of mice in various mouse models of acquired and genetic epilepsies. The approach rests on the recent recognition that mouse behaviors are structured in stereotyped modules at sub-second timescales that are arranged according to specific rules. These characteristic behavioral modules, and the transitions between them, can be identified without observer bias by combined 3D imaging and machine learning (ML) -assisted analytic methods. We propose to adopt this novel ML-assisted 3D video analysis technology to epilepsy research, in order to test if it can be used to identify mice with chronic temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) during inter-ictal and ictal periods in two distinct experimental TLE models, and under various experimental conditions. In addition, we will also test whether the approach is able to automatically detect not only the overtly epileptic mice in a genetic model of severe childhood epilepsy (homozygous voltage-gated sodium channel β-subunit SCN1B-/- knock-out mice), but also distinguish the seemingly normal, non-epileptic, SCN1B+/- heterozygous mice from the wild-type controls. We anticipate that these results will have a potentially transformative effect on the field by demonstrating the feasibility and power of automated, objective, user-independent, inexpensive analysis of acquired and genetic epilepsy phenotypes. There is an urgent need for new therapies for patients with uncontrolled epilepsy. The project will test if it is possible to objectively characterize epileptic phenotypes in mice using a breakthrough technology involving machine learning-assisted analysis of 3-dimensional video data of behavior. If successful, this innovative approach is expected to dramatically accelerate epilepsy research by enabling the objective, automated, inexpensive phenotyping of experimental animals to aid the testing of novel anticonvulsant therapies.",Towards automated phenotyping in epilepsy,9369284,R21NS102908,"['Adopted', 'Adult', 'Adverse effects', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Anticonvulsants', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Electroencephalography', 'Epilepsy', 'Exhibits', 'Frequencies', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Models', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Human immunodeficiency virus test', 'Image', 'Knockout Mice', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'Neurons', 'Observer Variation', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Pilocarpine', 'Probability', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Seizures', 'Sodium Channel', 'Stereotyping', 'Structure', 'Syndrome', 'Technology', 'Temporal Lobe Epilepsy', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Time', 'Translational Research', 'United States', 'Wild Type Mouse', 'analytical method', 'base', 'cost', 'evidence base', 'high throughput analysis', 'innovation', 'kainate', 'learning strategy', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'pre-clinical', 'voltage']",NINDS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R21,2017,197528,-0.0117751947352455
"Developing Classification Criteria for the Uveitides ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The uveitides are a collection of ~30 distinct diseases characterized by intraocular infection. Each disease has its own features, course, treatment, and prognosis. Traditionally, the uveitides have been grouped by the primary anatomic site of inflammation as anterior uveitis, intermediate uveitis, posterior uveitis, and panuveitis. However, there are substantial limitations to this ""lumping"" of diseases. For example, among the posterior uveitides, some (e.g. toxoplasmic retinitis and cytomegalovirus retinitis) are infectious and require treatment with antimicrobial/antiviral agents, some are chronic, presumed immune-mediated diseases that require immunosuppression (e.g. birdshot chorioretinitis, multifocal choroiditis, serpiginous choroiditis), and a few are self-limited, spontaneously-remitting diseases with a good prognosis (e.g. acute posterior multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy and multiple evanescent white dot syndrome). As such precise diagnosis is critical for research, including epidemiology, translational pathogenesis research, outcomes research, and disease specific clinical trials. Classification criteria are a type of ""diagnostic"" criteria used for reserch purposes. Although classification criteria seek to optimize sensitivity and specificity, when a trade-off is required, they emphasize specificity in order to ensure that a homogeneous group of patients is being studied. A precise phenotype is required particularly for genomic risk factor studies of complex disorders and translational pathogenesis research, as inclusion of other diseases with different risk factors and disease mechanisms would confound the results. Currently there are no widely-accepted and validated classification criteria for any of the uveitides. Preliminary data indicate ""fair to moderate"" agreement at best on the independent diagnosis of any one case by uveitis experts (κ's 0.27-0.40), but the ability of committees to reach agreement on the diagnosis of >98% of cases. The goal of the ""Developing Classification Criteria for the Uveitides"" project is for the Standardization of Uveitis Nomenclature (SUN) Working Group to develop classification criteria for the 25 leading uveitides using a formal, rigorous approach. There are 4 phases to the project: 1) informatics, to develop a standardized terminology; 2) case collection, to develop a preliminary database of ~250 cases of each disease; 3) case selection, to select at least 150-200 cases of each disease that are generally accepted to be the disease (using formal consensus techniques) from the preliminary database into a final database; and 4) data analysis, using machine learning approaches, of the final database to develop a parsimonious set of criteria for each disease that minimizes misclassification. The informatics and case collection phases of the Project are complete. The case selection phase is well underway and uses online voting and consensus conference calls to achieve supermajority acceptance on all cases included in the final database. The goals of this application are to complete case selection and data analysis and develop classification criteria for the 25 of the major uveitides. These results are crucial to future clinical research i the field of uveitis. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Collectively, the uveitides are the 5th leading cause of blindness in the U.S., and the cost of treating them is estimated to be similar to that of treating diabetic retinopathy. Because uveitis occurs in all age groups, including children and working-age adults, there is a greater potential for years of vision lost than with age- related diseases. Clinical research in the field of uveitis has been hampered by diagnostic imprecision and a lack of widely-accepted and validated classification criteria, the development of which is the goal of this application; these criteria are needed urgently to advance epidemiology, genomic research, translational pathogenesis research, outcomes research, and disease-specific clinical trials.",Developing Classification Criteria for the Uveitides,9250167,R01EY026593,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior uveitis', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Blindness', 'Child', 'Choroiditis', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'Cytomegalovirus Retinitis', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Future', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Immune', 'Immunosuppression', 'Infection', 'Inflammation', 'Informatics', 'Intermediate Uveitis', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Nomenclature', 'Outcomes Research', 'Panuveitis', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Pigments', 'Posterior Uveitis', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Retinitis', 'Risk Factors', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specificity', 'Standardization', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Terminology', 'United States', 'Uveitis', 'Vision', 'Visual impairment', 'Voting', 'age group', 'age related', 'aging population', 'antimicrobial', 'birdshot chorioretinitis', 'cost', 'outcome forecast', 'public health relevance', 'symposium', 'tool', 'web page', 'working group']",NEI,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2017,400107,0.0029789358284465343
"Sepsis Early Prediction and Subphenotype Illumination Study (SEPSIS) PROJECT SUMMARY Sepsis, defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction in response to infection, is a devastating condition that contributes to up to half of hospital deaths and over $24 billion in healthcare costs in the U.S. annually. Over 750,000 patients develop sepsis in the U.S. each year, and survivors suffer long-term cognitive impairment and physical disability. Historically, sepsis research has focused on patients who are already critically ill. However, up to 50% of patients with sepsis receive their care on the inpatient wards, and only 10% of patients with sepsis are initially diagnosed in the intensive care unit (ICU). Because early intervention improves outcomes in sepsis, it is important to optimize the detection and treatment of sepsis outside the ICU.  The current sepsis paradigm has several problems. The first problem is that early identification of infection relies on clinician intuition, and caregivers often disagree regarding which patients are infected. This leads to delays in therapy and increased mortality in some patients and unnecessary therapies and adverse medication side effects in others. A second problem is that there is a lack of accurate tools to risk stratify infected patients outside the ICU after they are identified. Some patients with infection are treated outside the ICU and are later discharged home, while others develop life-threatening complications and die in the hospital. Accurate risk stratification of infected patients would bring additional critical care resources to the bedside of the high-risk patients that need them most. A third problem with the current sepsis paradigm is that it is often treated as a one-size-fits-all syndrome. However, patients with sepsis have a wide range of clinical presentations and outcomes due to the complex interactions between patient risk factors, the infectious organism, and the host immune response. These data suggest that the impact of timely and more aggressive interventions on outcomes may differ based on a patient's clinical phenotype. Identifying important subphenotypes of infected patients is critical to delivering more personalized care at the bedside.  The purpose of this project is to use data from the electronic health record and statistical modeling techniques to identify high-risk infected patients and important new subphenotypes of this syndrome. In Aim 1, we will develop a novel tool for identifying infected patients outside the ICU using modern machine learning techniques. In Aim 2, we will develop a tool for risk stratifying infected patients outside the ICU using machine learning methods. Finally, in Aim 3 we will use cluster analysis techniques to determine whether the benefit of early and more aggressive interventions varies based on clinical phenotype. Our project will provide clinicians with powerful new tools to identify high-risk infected patients and important new subphenotypes of this common and deadly syndrome. This work will help to deliver early, life-saving care to the bedside of septic patients and lead to future interventional trials aimed at decreasing preventable death.

"mHealth for Heart Failure: Predictive Models of Readmission Risk and Self-care Using Consumer Activity Trackers PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Heart failure (HF) is a debilitating disease that affects over five million people in the United States. Occurrence of, morbidity related to, and hospitalization due to HF have serious financial implications. In 2009, HF had a direct cost of over $34 billion annually, the majority of which was due to hospitalizations. By 2030, HF total direct costs are predicted to reach $53 billion, and indirect costs are predicted to rise from $31 billion to $70 billion. Increases in costs are contingent on the increase in the aging population, making prevention of HF and care efficiency imperative. Fifty percent of readmissions due to HF are preventable, with lack of adherence to prescribed self-care as the driving factor. Results of telemedicine intervention studies to support adherence to self-care and improve HF outcomes are inconclusive. Past telemedicine interventions for HF have utilized an array of methods including: wireless sensors, telephone services, websites, and home visits from nurses. Structured telephone support has shown in some cases to reduce hospitalization, improve clinical outcomes, and reduce all-cause mortality in HF patients. However, patient adherence to telemedicine interventions is often low. This lack of adherence is due in part to the high treatment burden placed upon patients in such home monitoring interventions, which require them to engage in novel behaviors, including using new unfamiliar hardware and spending time meeting with home health nurses. The goal of this R01 is to demonstrate the following: 1) patients are more adherent with a home monitoring regimen when using minimally-invasive monitoring technologies, including wrist-worn consumer activity trackers; 2) a minimally-invasive home monitoring regimen combined with novel predictive algorithms may be used to forecast hospital readmission; and 3) data from the electronic health record (EHR) and a baseline survey may be used to predict levels of adherence to the home monitoring regimen. Towards these goals, we will recruit 500 HF patients to participate in a minimally-invasive home monitoring regimen. A novel mobile application will allow patients to monitor their progress, submit additional data, and receive adherence notifications. We will measure levels of adherence to the regimen, and use collected sensor data and known readmission events to create a novel hidden semi-Markov model that continuously predicts readmission risk. Predicting a patient's level of adherence will be performed with EHR data and a baseline survey using several techniques, including logistic regression and support vector machine models. The work outlined in this proposal will produce a set of foundational tools for performing home monitoring of HF patients. These tools will be adaptable for future studies of individually-tailored interventions, towards our ultimate goal of allowing patients to download an “app” from an “app store” that adapts to their individual characteristics and allows them to more effectively manage their disease.

"Automated quantitative CT imaging of epicardial adipose tissue and risk of cardiac events PROJECT SUMMARY Coronary artery disease remains the leading cause of death worldwide, and more than half of the individuals suffering acute myocardial infarction have no prior symptoms. Coronary calcium scoring with non-contrast CT is increasingly used for cardiovascular risk stratification in the asymptomatic population. Epicardial adipose tissue (EAT), a local visceral fat depot surrounding the heart, has been recently reported as a significant imaging biomarker for cardiovascular risk stratification. Despite being routinely imaged noninvasively by non-contrast cardiac CT for coronary calcium scoring, EAT features are currently not measured or reported, primarily due to the absence of robust, automated quantification methods.  We propose to employ novel image processing algorithms to achieve fully automated, robust quantification of EAT features from cardiac CT, and to apply machine learning methods to efficiently combine patient clinical data, coronary calcium and EAT features into a new integrated risk score to predict future cardiac events. We will evaluate this risk score in two existing, prospective registries of asymptomatic patients with available coronary calcium scans, clinical data, and followup for cardiac events (myocardial infarction, cardiac death, late revascularization). These rich resources are: the Early Identification of Subclinical Atherosclerosis Using Non-Invasive Imaging Research [EISNER] registry (2614 patients) and the St. Francis Heart Study (4613 patients). We propose three specific aims: 1) To develop and evaluate the accuracy and reproducibility of new computational algorithms for automated quantification of EAT measures; 2) To evaluate the prognostic value of automatically-quantified EAT features, relative to atherosclerotic plaque burden and measures of obesity, for the prediction of future cardiac events in asymptomatic patients in the EISNER registry and the St. Francis Heart Study; 3) To derive and evaluate a new, integrated risk score—combining standard risk factors, coronary calcium score and EAT measures using machine learning—for the prediction of future cardiac events in the EISNER registry, and further, to additionally evaluate this risk score externally in the St. Francis Heart Study patient cohort.  This work in this proposal will provide a novel, personalized paradigm that will objectively and accurately identify asymptomatic patients undergoing coronary calcium scanning who are at increased risk for future cardiac events, without any additional imaging or risk to the patient. PROJECT NARRATIVE (lay language) CT scanning of the heart for coronary calcium scoring is a simple, widely-used, low-cost test with low radiation dose. Using these scans, the researchers propose to establish automated analysis of fat which surrounds the heart, as well as novel computerized scores that identify the patients who are at highest risk of suffering a heart attack. This new research will allow doctors to better identify patients for whom appropriate treatment could be prescribed, to avoid a heart attack or sudden cardiac death.",Automated quantitative CT imaging of epicardial adipose tissue and risk of cardiac events,9310380,R01HL133616,"['Acute myocardial infarction', 'Adipose tissue', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Arterial Fatty Streak', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Calcium', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Death', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Categories', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinical Data', 'Cohort Studies', 'Computational algorithm', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary artery', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Early identification', 'Event', 'Expressed Sequence Tags', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Future', 'Heart', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Institution', 'Interleukin-1 beta', 'Interleukin-6', 'Language', 'Length', 'Lipids', 'Low Dose Radiation', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Obesity', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Reader', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Scanning', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Stenosis', 'Symptoms', 'TNF gene', 'Testing', 'Trees', 'Visceral', 'Woman', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'computerized', 'cost', 'density', 'experience', 'heart imaging', 'high risk', 'image processing', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'indexing', 'learning strategy', 'men', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'pericardial sac', 'predictive marker', 'prognostic value', 'prospective', 'routine imaging', 'sudden cardiac death']",NHLBI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2017,653101,-0.004629204804917807
"Advanced morphological analysis of cerebral blood flow for acute concussion diagnosis and return-to-play determination Project Summary / Abstract Between 1.6 and 3.8 million people each year suffer a mild TBI in the US alone. Reliable diagnosis and prompt treatments are vital to managing the often-serious short and long-term sequelae resulting from mild TBI. However, a reliable objective and accurate method for mild TBI diagnosis outside of a hospital setting, and in particular for determining RTP readiness, has eluded the clinical community. Current diagnosis and RTP assessments are based on patient symptoms, neurocognitive evaluations, and / or physical performance testing. Use of symptom scales are problematic for several reasons including subjectivity and reliability. Neurocognitive evaluations and physical tests (such as balance tests), although less subjective, require pre- injury baseline testing of subjects due to inherently large subject-to-subject variations in evaluation performances. Due to these reasons, current mild TBI diagnostic methods have limited applications and are not suitable for a significant majority of patients who suffer mild TBI. This project is aimed at developing an objective diagnosis of mild traumatic brain injury (mild TBI) based on physiologic changes in a patient after injury and providing a platform capable of RTP guidance. The method is based on quantification of well-known physiologic changes after a concussion, i.e. the impairment of autonomic function and altered cerebral blood flow (CBF) as measured with transcranial Doppler (TCD). The novelty of the proposed approach is the use of a recently-developed analytical machine learning framework for the analysis of the CBF velocity (CBFV) waveforms. In contrast to previous methods used before, the proposed approach utilizes the entire shape of the complex CBFV waveform, thus obtaining subtle changes in blood flow that are lost in other analysis methods. Additionally, comprehensive verification between our platform and MRI will be performed following injury resulting in the first scientific experiments of this kind. The ultimate goal of this Phase II SBIR is to commercialize an objective and accurate software algorithm for reliable diagnosis and management of sports concussions which does not currently exist. The outcome will be a software suite integrated into existing TCD and will be marketed to emergency departments, neurology clinics, and other healthcare providers involved in mild TBI diagnosis and RTP management. Project Narrative Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a serious public health problem in the United States contributing to a substantial number of deaths and cases of permanent disability. Mild TBI concussions account for over 80% of all TBIs sustained and a major problem is the high rate of mis-diagnosis due to lack of objective measures and delayed onset of symptoms. This project aims to develop the first objective concussion evaluation method using a novel analysis platform that can obtain subtle, physiologic changes in cerebral hemodynamics. Successful completion of this project will result in a portable diagnostic device suitable for use in many scenarios where concussion diagnosis is inaccurate or unavailable today.",Advanced morphological analysis of cerebral blood flow for acute concussion diagnosis and return-to-play determination,9323604,R44NS092209,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute', 'Adoption', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Area Under Curve', 'Assessment tool', 'Blood flow', 'Brain Concussion', 'Cerebrovascular Circulation', 'Cessation of life', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Controlled Study', 'Core-Binding Factor', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Evaluation', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Health Personnel', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Injury', 'Letters', 'Licensing', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurologist', 'Neurology', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Neurology', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Physical Performance', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Readiness', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Spin Labels', 'Sports', 'Sports Medicine', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Variant', 'balance testing', 'base', 'brain health', 'cerebral hemodynamics', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'disability', 'experimental study', 'hemodynamics', 'high school', 'injured', 'innovation', 'mild traumatic brain injury', 'novel', 'pediatric department', 'performance tests', 'portability', 'prevent', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'success', 'tool']",NINDS,"NEURAL ANALYTICS, INC.",R44,2017,1500000,-0.0009902998612131898
"High Performance Automated System for Analysis of Fast Cardiac SPECT DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Coronary artery disease remains a major public health problem worldwide. It causes approximately 1 of every 6 deaths in the United States. Imaging of myocardial perfusion (delivery of blood to the heart muscle) by myocardial perfusion single photon emission tomography (MPS) allows physicians to detect disease before a heart attack, and predict risk in millions of patients annually. This is currently limited by the need fo visual interpretation, which is highly variable and depends on the physician's experience. The long-term objective of this program is to improve the interpretation of this widely used heart imaging technique-achieving higher accuracy for disease detection than it is possible by the best attainable visual analysis. This proposal builds on our prior work in conventional myocardial MPS, and focuses on fast, low-radiation MPS imaging (fast-MPS) obtained by new high-efficiency scanners. Specifically, we aim to: 1) develop new image processing algorithms for a fully automated analysis of fast-MPS. The algorithms will include better heart muscle detection by training with correlated anatomical data and a novel approach for mapping the probability of abnormal perfusion for each location of the heart muscle; 2) enhance the diagnosis of heart disease from fast-MPS by machine- learning algorithms that integrate clinical data, stress test parameters, and quantitative image features; 3) demonstrate the clinical utility of the new algorithms applied to automatic canceling of the rest portion of the MPS scan, when not needed. The new system will be more accurate than the clinical expert analysis in the detection of obstructive coronary disease. By immediately indicating whether a stress scan is normal, the system will allow for the automatic cancellation of the rest imaging portion when it is not needed (estimated in over 60% of all MPS studies). Our research will demonstrate that the computer decision regarding rest-scan cancellation is safe for the patient, both from a diagnostic and prognostic standpoint. This will lead to a wide adoption of low-dose stress-only imaging for MPS studies, which would reduce the amount of radiation that patients are exposed to, and allow for significant healthcare savings. It will additionally lead to a paradigm shift in the practice of nuclear cardiology, which will ultimately result in better selection of patients who need intervention, and reduce the number of deaths due coronary artery disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Imaging of myocardial perfusion (heart muscle blood flow) at rest and stress allows physicians to detect disease and predict risk in millions of patients in the US each year, but it is currently limited by the need of visual interpretation, which is dependent on doctor's experience. The investigators propose to develop and validate an automated, highly-accurate and objective computer system which will outperform even experienced physicians in interpreting these images using latest generation scanners and novel machine learning computer tools. The computer will be able to better select patients needing treatment and automatically indicate the normal stress-scan immediately, and more accurately than physicians allowing automatic cancellation of the rest imaging, when not needed; this will result in large healthcare savings and reduced radiation to the patients.",High Performance Automated System for Analysis of Fast Cardiac SPECT,9282634,R01HL089765,"['Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Blood', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collimator', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Coronary Angiography', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Generations', 'Grant', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Diseases', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Industry', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Mitral Valve', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'Myocardium', 'Nuclear', 'Patient Selection', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Photons', 'Physicians', 'Probability', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Radiation', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Recovery', 'Registries', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Savings', 'Scanning', 'Site', 'Stress', 'Stress Tests', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'United States', 'Visual', 'Work', 'attenuation', 'base', 'cardiac single photon emission computed tomography', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'clinical imaging', 'computer generated', 'cost', 'detector', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'experience', 'heart imaging', 'image processing', 'improved', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'patient population', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'quantitative imaging', 'reconstruction', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'solid state', 'tomography', 'tool']",NHLBI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2017,600120,-0.002249047416866193
"Predicting Diabetic Retinopathy from Risk Factor Data and Digital Retinal Images Abstract Diabetic retinopathy is the leading cause of blindness among US adults between the ages of 20 and 74 years. Laser photocoagulation surgery has been established as an effective way of treating retinopathy if it is detected early. Yearly retinal screening examinations are a potent tool in the battle to reduce the incidence of blindness from diabetic retinopathy because they provide diabetic patients with timely diagnoses and consequently, the potential for timely treatment. Primary care safety net clinics provide monitoring and other services for diabetic patients but they are often not equipped to provide specialty care services such as retinal screenings. Access to specialists who can provide retinal screenings can be increased through the use of telemedicine, which has shown great promise as a means of screening for diabetic retinopathy in the US and internationally. A pilot study by Charles Drew University investigators had a total of 2,876 teleretinal screenings performed for diabetic retinopathy, with 2,732 unique diabetic patients from six South Los Angeles safety net clinics screened. The present study aims to build on this prior work by: (a) developing novel software that utilizes information from clinical records to detect latent diabetic retinopathy in diabetic patients who have not yet received an annual eye examination, and (b) devising methods to speed up the diabetic retinopathy detection process for diabetic patients who have had digital retinal images taken by partially automating the process using image processing and machine learning techniques. Specifically, we propose to: 1. Develop predictive models for diabetic retinopathy using risk factors collected from patient clinical records. 2. Develop predictive models for automated diabetic retinopathy assessment using a combination of patient  risk factor data and data from digital retinal images previously evaluated by experts. 3. Evaluate the predictive accuracy of: a) the models developed for specific aim 2, and, b) the assessments of  optometrist readers against standard of care dilated retinal examinations by board certified  ophthalmologists for 300 diabetic patients utilizing a new Los Angeles County reading center. 4. Create web-based software tools based on the predictive models developed in specific aim 1 that can be  used to initiate outreach to high-risk patients in under-resourced settings, boosting detection rates for those  patients who are most at risk for diabetic retinopathy. 5. Establish targeted outreach methods to promote screening for patients that the predictive models from  specific aim 1 identify as potentially having undetected diabetic retinopathy. Narrative Diabetic retinopathy is the leading cause of blindness among US adults between the ages of 20 and 74 years. Although previous studies within the US and internationally have shown that teleretinal screening can increase access to eye examinations for detecting retinopathy, few studies have focused on the US urban safety net, which has ophthalmic screening rates that are well below the US average and a preponderance of diabetic patients who are from ethnic minority groups. Building on a previous teleretinal screening study that assessed 2,732 South Los Angeles patients for retinopathy, this study deploys machine learning and image processing techniques to detect latent retinopathy in unscreened diabetic patients and partially automate the diabetic retinopathy detection process for teleretinal screening.",Predicting Diabetic Retinopathy from Risk Factor Data and Digital Retinal Images,9353867,R01LM012309,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alaska Native', 'American Indians', 'Asian Americans', 'Blindness', 'Blood Circulation', 'Blood Vessels', 'Caring', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Computer software', 'County', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Diagnosis', 'Eye', 'Glucose', 'Health Care Reform', 'Health Insurance', 'Hispanics', 'Image', 'Incidence', 'International', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Minority Groups', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Online Systems', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Ophthalmic examination and evaluation', 'Ophthalmologist', 'Optometrist', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retina', 'Retinal', 'Retinal Diseases', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Rural', 'Services', 'Software Tools', 'Specialist', 'Speed', 'Techniques', 'Telemedicine', 'Time', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Work', 'aged', 'base', 'diabetic', 'diabetic patient', 'digital', 'digital imaging', 'disorder prevention', 'ethnic minority population', 'high risk', 'image processing', 'inner city', 'laser photocoagulation', 'medical specialties', 'medically underserved', 'mortality', 'novel', 'outreach', 'predictive modeling', 'primary care setting', 'racial minority', 'randomized trial', 'safety net', 'screening', 'standard of care', 'statistics', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'trend']",NLM,CHARLES R.

"Magnetic Resonance Imaging Based Calf Muscle Perfusion To Assess Patients with Symptomatic Peripheral Artery Disease Abstract: Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is associated with impaired leg function, possible limb loss and an increased risk of cardiovascular events. Intermittent claudication (IC) is a classic PAD symptom occurring in 40% of symptomatic patients, and is associated with 5-, and 15-year mortality rates of 30% and 70%, respectively. PAD is a debilitating illness affecting more than 8.5 million Americans of age 40 and older and 202 million people globally. Despite the high prevalence, PAD patients are less likely to receive appropriate treatment for their atherosclerotic risk factors than patients with coronary artery disease. Advances in endovascular therapy have reduced risks associated with intervention, enabling revascularization as a routine procedure in patients with lower extremity ischemia. However, revascularization success rates vary substantially and numerous PAD patients do not improve at 1-year despite technically good revascularization. Previous findings suggest that alterations in the microcirculation due to a paucity of collateralization may contribute to functional impairment in PAD patients. We hypothesize that the change in microvascular perfusion can identify PAD patients who do not improve at 12-months after revascularization. We will utilize contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (CE-MRI) to assess skeletal muscle perfusion in PAD patients. The CE-MRI measures will be associated with hemodynamics and symptoms. The early identification of individuals with a likely poor prognosis post intervention could help to improve surgical treatment strategies. We will investigate the association of microvascular perfusion (Aim 1) and measures of arterial hemodynamics (Aim 2) with leg function and PAD symptoms. We will utilize machine learning methodologies to identify predictors of poor leg function and symptoms (Aim 3). Given the high incidence of PAD and the associated high risk of cardiovascular events, it is paramount to identify individuals who are less likely to improve following lower extremity revascularization. The data of this clinical imaging study will provide novel information on the etiology of microvascular blood flow in PAD. Relevance: The proposed research study is of considerable public health importance given that patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) have an increased risk of atherothrombotic cardiovascular events and mortality. The development of improved non-invasive imaging techniques to assess PAD may enable optimized treatment for individuals who are at an increased risk of future cardiovascular events.",Magnetic Resonance Imaging Based Calf Muscle Perfusion To Assess Patients with Symptomatic Peripheral Artery Disease,9363302,R01HL137763,"['Affect', 'Age', 'American', 'Ankle', 'Arteries', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical assessments', 'Comorbidity', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Development', 'Disease Outcome', 'Early identification', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'High Prevalence', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Intermittent Claudication', 'Intervention', 'Ischemia', 'Leg', 'Legal patent', 'Limb structure', 'Literature', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Methodist Church', 'Methodology', 'Microcirculation', 'Muscle', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Oxygen', 'Partial Pressure', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perfusion', 'Peripheral arterial disease', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Pilot Projects', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reference Values', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skeletal Muscle', 'Standardization', 'Superficial Femoral Artery', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Toes', 'Treadmill Tests', 'Validation', 'Veterans', 'Walking', 'base', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'contrast enhanced', 'contrast imaging', 'functional disability', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'post intervention', 'regional difference', 'research study', 'skeletal', 'success', 'successful intervention', 'symptomatic improvement', 'treadmill', 'treatment strategy', 'two-dimensional', 'vascular sonography']",NHLBI,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2017,518262,0.0056565213224430665
"A Novel Probabilistic Methodology for Prediction of Emerging Diseases in Patients with Multiple Chronic Conditions ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Treatment for people living with multiple chronic conditions (MCC) currently accounts for an estimated 66 percent of the Nation's health care costs and will continue to grow. This mounting challenge has become a major public health issue since MCC is linked to suboptimal health outcomes and rising health care costs. However, it now known how MCC emerge among individuals or in the general population. Traditional epidemiological approaches have led to important findings of disease links and comorbidity associations. However, they are limited in their ability to characterize how patients acquire new chronic conditions and predict/personalize the emergence of MCC for individual patients. Objectives: This study will develop approaches that can be used to identify the most likely combinations of comorbidity within a population. These approaches can be tailored to examine MCC patterns in specific sub- populations or at the level of the individual patient. We will also study the effect of a large set of risk factors on MCC combinations emergence. Furthermore, we will use data mining approaches to predict and monitor the development of MCC combinations in at the population and individual levels. Hypotheses: We hypothesize that the emergence and progression of comorbidities in MCC patients form patterns that can be predicted and which are associated with prior medical conditions, demographic, and socio-economic characteristics. We further hypothesize that these methods can predict the timing and emergence of new chronic diseases more accurately by personalizing the records for individual patients. Aims and methodology: in Aim1, we will characterize how MCC emerge and progress in distinct patterns and how these patterns transition between different combinations of diseases over time. We will then identify and group major MCC transitions using the Markov clustering (MCL) algorithm, which is a novel, efficient graphical approach to handle big data. In Aim 2, we will identify which risk factors are associated with MCC emergence using a machine learning approach that can handle the complex heterogeneity of comorbidity patterns. Risk factors include age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, economic status, marital status, and prior medical conditions. In Aim 3, we will use a similarity learning approach to develop models that can predict if MCC will emerge in individual patients or among populations and we will be able to use these models to monitor MCC emergence over time. Conclusion: Our findings will provide a foundation for future research that will evaluate specific treatment patterns associated with progression in MCC patterns and ultimately identify optimal time points of intervention for those with, or at risk for multiple chronic conditions. These findings will also provide information that can be used at the community level to manage healthcare resources to improve continuity and accessibility of care.

"Automated detection and prediction of atrial fibrillation during sepsis 7. ABSTRACT / PROJECT SUMMARY We propose the “Automated detection and prediction of atrial fibrillation during sepsis” study to develop automated technologies capable of accurate atrial fibrillation (AF) detection and prediction during sepsis. Sepsis is a life-threatening, dysregulated response to infection and the most common illness leading to hospitalization in the United States, affecting ~1 million Americans yearly, and is associated with 50% of all hospital deaths. With the exception early antibiotic and fluid use, few therapies improve outcomes among septic patients; new treatment strategies are greatly needed to improve survival. New-onset AF is a common dysrhythmia among critically ill patients with sepsis, affecting up to 1 in 3 septic patients and conferring increased short- and long-term risks stroke, heart failure, and death. Prevention of AF or its complications may improve sepsis outcomes by reducing AF-related morbidity and mortality. Although several evidence-based treatments have shown efficacy in treating and preventing AF in certain high-risk subgroups (e.g., AF prevention following cardiac surgery), studying application of these therapies among critically ill patients with sepsis has been hampered by two major factors: 1) we lack validated automated mechanisms to detect AF and facilitate real-world AF research in large clinical databases, and 2) we cannot presently predict which patients with sepsis will develop AF. Our project will leverage the unique resources of the recently released Multiparameter Intelligent Monitoring in Intensive Care (MIMIC III) database. MIMIC III links continuous ECG and pulse plethysmographic waveforms to a wealth of time-varying clinical and hemodynamic data. Our project will develop and validate state-of-the art automated AF detection algorithms using waveform data from critically ill patients. Automated AF detection would enable expedited clinical treatment of AF, identification of subclinical AF, and will catalyze the study of AF in emerging electronic health record waveform databases. We will develop innovative automated AF prediction capabilities using state-of-the-art waveform analysis algorithms and machine learning methods in critically ill patients. Automated algorithms that identify patients at high risk for developing AF in the near-term would enable targeting of preventative therapies and potentially usher in a new era of AF prevention for critically ill patients. AF prevention and treatment facilitated through our project will allow targeting of novel, AF-based mechanisms of poor outcomes during and following sepsis. 8. Project Narrative Sepsis is a dysregulated response to infection that causes life-threatening organ dysfunction that affects nearly 1 million Americans each year. Atrial fibrillation is a form of cardiac dysfunction that occurs during sepsis characterized by abnormal heart rhythm, loss of normal atrial contraction, rapid heart rates, heart failure, shock and increased risk for stroke. Our proposal seeks to develop automated methods for the detection and prediction of atrial fibrillation during sepsis, methods that will enhance our future ability to prevent and treat atrial fibrillation to avoid its life-threatening consequences.",Automated detection and prediction of atrial fibrillation during sepsis,9283910,R01HL136660,"['Affect', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Antibiotics', 'Arrhythmia', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Big Data', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Surgery procedures', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Comorbidity', 'Complication', 'Computer Assisted', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electrolytes', 'Electromagnetics', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Heart Abnormalities', 'Heart Atrium', 'Heart Rate', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Infection', 'Intensive Care', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Myocardial dysfunction', 'Noise', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Prevention', 'Preventive therapy', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sepsis', 'Shock', 'Stroke', 'Stroke Volume', 'Subgroup', 'Technology', 'Telemetry', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'base', 'clinical predictors', 'electronic data', 'heart rhythm', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'mortality', 'novel', 'portability', 'predictive signature', 'prevent', 'response', 'septic', 'therapeutic target', 'time use', 'tool', 'treatment strategy']",NHLBI,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,R01,2017,544529,0.004906682862551036
"Statistical methods for healthcare in complex patients with diabetes ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Diabetes affects 8.3% of the US population, and lead to costly adverse healthcare outcomes. Unfortunately, there may be a quality gap in the care of complex diabetes patients, that is, older patients (age>65 years) and those with comorbid conditions. Current practices, relying primarily on the presence of several factors, are not effective in capturing the risk of poor prognosis, i.e., multiple hospitalization and/or emergency department visits, and death. Hence, little evidence exists so far to help prioritize care for thes patients. The diabetes guidelines recognize that tight control of glycosylated hemoglobin (A1c) may not be appropriate for complex patients, and recommend individualizations in tight A1c control. However, neither the outcomes of tight A1c control, nor the effects of the typical treatment regimens used to achieve tight A1c control can be evaluated in clinical trials, with minimal, if any, enrollment of complex diabetes patients due to either their restrictive inclusion criteria or lack of encouragement of the patient and/or clinical investigator to consider the RCT. In order to deliver more effective, efficient and accountable health cares, it is important to help clinicians to examine the relationship between patient complexity and patients' A1c control level, and to modify guideline appropriately with an evidence base. The proposed research will analyze a cohort of 8,304 Medicare beneficiaries with diabetes who were cared for by one of the country's 10 largest physician group practices, the University of Wisconsin Medical Foundation during 2003-2011 to address the following aims: (1) to conduct risk prediction incorporating longitudinal outcomes, (2) to inform guidelines for complex diabetes patients, and (3) to create a patient-centered surveillance tool for detecting short-term negative outcomes. Our analytic approach involves the use of state- of-the-art statistics and machine learning methods to take advantage of the large electronic health records data. The proposed methods and results will help clinicians to identify and quantify risks of tight A1c control in complex diabetes patients an potentially lead to improved patient experiences, and reduce medical expenditures from excess adverse events. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Sub-optimal glycosylated hemoglobin (A1c) control recommendations and treatment recommendations for diabetes patients can result in adverse events, and increased health care utilization. Unfortunately, current guidelines on the care for complex and/or older patients with diabetes are inadequate. We propose to develop an effective and patient-centered health care delivery system for complex diabetes patients, focusing on accurate prediction of adverse events, development of potential guidelines on targeting tight control of A1c and treatment regimens, and real-time monitoring of health conditions.",Statistical methods for healthcare in complex patients with diabetes,9336291,R01DK108073,"['Address', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biometry', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Comorbidity', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency department visit', 'Enrollment', 'Exclusion Criteria', 'Expenditure', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Glean', 'Glycosylated Hemoglobin', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'Goals', 'Group Practice', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Long-Term Care', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical History', 'Medicare', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient observation', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Privatization', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recommendation', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sampling', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Time', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Trees', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Wisconsin', 'Work', 'base', 'beneficiary', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'cost', 'data resource', 'design', 'diabetes management', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'health care delivery', 'health care quality', 'health care service utilization', 'high risk', 'improved', 'inclusion criteria', 'learning strategy', 'longitudinal dataset', 'mortality', 'older patient', 'outcome forecast', 'patient oriented', 'patient population', 'population health', 'public health relevance', 'statistics', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'user friendly software']",NIDDK,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2017,287228,0.015090805922151238
"CorBand: A novel wearable wrist sensor for heart failure remote monitoring ReThink Medical, Inc. proposes to develop an ambulatory version of the physiologic monitoring technology it validated in Phase I, the CorBand. The CorBand is designed to track key physiologic parameters that are predictive of cardiac decompensation, to detect the early stages of decompensation, and to relay both the physiologic data and generated alerts to relevant caregivers with the end goal of reducing hospitalizations by enabling proactive/preventative care in the heart failure population. Heart failure effects 5.8 million individuals in the US and the costs associated are approaching $40 billion annually. This technology will not only improve the quality of life for heart failure patients, but also help to reduce this massive burden on the US healthcare system. Our long term objective is to help drive the transformation from the reactive pay-for-service healthcare paradigm to one that puts emphasis on preventative care through health monitoring technologies. Our specific aims include (1) manufacturing a robust version of the device for use in two large, long term, ambulatory studies. It will be validated using patients who have cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs). Heart rate (HR), heart rate variability (HRV), activity levels, and fluid index derived from the CorBand will be compared with data collected from CIEDs manufactured by Medtronic and Boston Scientific and analyzed for correlation. (2) The CorBand will be deployed in a large ambulatory population of HF patients. We will collect the patient's clinical notes and note hospitalization events along with remote physiologic data from the CorBand. We will use this data to further build a predictive model for cardiac decompensation using a number of machine learning approaches. In aim (3), we will perform a controlled study on a population of HF patients. All the subjects will wear the CorBand; we will use the data from half the subjects to predict decompensation events, provide that information to subject's caregiver in order to provide preventative care. The other half will receive usual care. We will then examine the number of HF related hospitalizations in both groups to evaluate the ability of the CorBand to reduce hospitalizations. Our goal is to simplify the management of heart failure while improving the quality of care of the patients and reducing the associated costs. We will investigate the benefits of a novel, non-invasive multi-parameter sensor with telemetry for monitoring patients with heart failure combined with an algorithm for detecting early-stage cardiac decompensation with a goal of preventing hospitalizations.",CorBand: A novel wearable wrist sensor for heart failure remote monitoring,9335418,R44HL125001,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Ambulatory Care', 'Award', 'Boston', 'California', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cloud Service', 'Complement', 'Control Groups', 'Controlled Study', 'Data', 'Decision Modeling', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Edema', 'Electronics', 'Emergency department visit', 'Engineering', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart', 'Heart Rate', 'Heart failure', 'Home environment', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Masks', 'Medical', 'Medicare', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Multicenter Trials', 'Office Visits', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Photoplethysmography', 'Physicians', 'Physiologic Monitoring', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Preventive care', 'Quality of Care', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiration', 'Risk', 'San Francisco', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Single-Blind Study', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Specialist', 'Technology', 'Telemetry', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Universities', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'clinical decision-making', 'cloud based', 'cost', 'cost effectiveness', 'cost efficient', 'design', 'health care service', 'heart rate variability', 'hemodynamics', 'implantable device', 'improved', 'indexing', 'monitoring device', 'novel', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prototype', 'sensor', 'treatment as usual', 'treatment group']",NHLBI,"RETHINK MEDICAL, INC.",R44,2017,490059,0.031136479402867467
"APPLYING ERROR-CORRECTED SEQUENCING TO DETECT MINIMAL RESIDUAL IN THE AAML 1031 STUDY Abstract  Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) accounts for half of all pediatric leukemia deaths and is the leading cause of leukemia-related death in adulthood. One reason for worse outcomes is the inability to properly assess for minimal residual disease (MRD) following therapy. Unlike ALL, AML presents with multiple subclonal populations without a singular clonal surface marker, and surface markers can change during therapy. The current gold standard for AML MRD is multi-parameter flow cytometry (MPFC), which is predictive of outcomes to frequencies of 0.001, yet 30% of MPFC-MRD-negative patients still relapse. Alternatively, every AML case harbors leukemia-specific mutations that could be markers of disease, except that next-generation sequencing has high error rate of ~1%. In this proposal, we will implement a novel, validated error-corrected sequencing (ECS) strategy, developed by the Druley lab in collaboration with Illumina, to improve MRD assessment of AML subclonal heterogeneity in 990 pediatric de novo AML cases from the Children's Oncology Group AAML1031 study. We hypothesize that using a highly sensitive sequencing method will improve identification of residual AML, provide important insights on subclonal heterogeneity in pediatric AML, improve understanding of the role of germline variability and gene function on relapses or refractory disease and facilitate personalized medicine. To interrogate this hypothesis, we propose the following aims: 1. Define subclonal heterogeneity at diagnosis and end of Induction 1 (EOI1) in 990 pediatric de novo  AML patients (n=1890). By using the largest prospective study of pediatric AML that has ever been  performed, we will perform ECS on 94 genes that are the most frequently mutated genes in pediatric and  adult AML at diagnosis and EOI1 to identify patterns of mutation associated with relapsed disease, FAB  subtypes or other cytogenetic features. 2. Correlate ECS-MRD with existing EOI1 MPFC-MRD for all participants in the COG AAML1031 study.  A major question is whether the “different from normal” cell population identified as residual disease by  MPFC is actually the same population(s) identified by ECS. We will define residual disease by ECS and  compare results to MPFC status (positive/negative), actual MPFC percentages (<0.001) and the clinical  outcomes (relapse risk, disease-free survival and overall survival) of study participants. 3. Integrate germline variation and all subclonal mutations into mechanistic groups that are frequently  mutated in pediatric AML and correlate with outcomes using unbiased machine learning  algorithms. Preliminary data tells us that every patient will have multiple subclones at diagnosis and EOI1  as well as germline variants in AML-associated genes, which may be important for outcome. In this aim, we  will take these mutations into account as well as MPFC, clinical features and cytogenetics for probabilistic  risk assessment using unsupervised machine learning algorithms for improved outcome prognostication. Narrative We have developed Error-Corrected Sequencing (ECS) that enables the highly accurate detection of leukemia- specific mutations in heterogeneous DNA samples to a limit of 0.0001. We will perform ECS with a panel of 94 frequently mutated genes in adult and pediatric AML in matched diagnostic and end of Induction 1 bone marrow samples from 990 pediatric de novo AML patients enrolled on the Children's Oncology Group AAML1031 protocol, which is the largest pediatric AML trial ever performed in North America. With these data, we can truly understand subclonal heterogeneity in pediatric AML, significantly improve minimal residual disease testing in pediatric AML, and integrate these data into an unbiased multivariate probability platform taking into account individual sequencing, flow cytometry, cytogenetic and clinical features to provide truly personalized cancer care.",APPLYING ERROR-CORRECTED SEQUENCING TO DETECT MINIMAL RESIDUAL IN THE AAML 1031 STUDY,9216965,R01CA211711,"['Acute Myelocytic Leukemia', 'Adult', 'Adult Acute Myeloblastic Leukemia', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'BAY 54-9085', 'Biological Markers', 'Bone Marrow', 'Bortezomib', 'Categories', 'Cessation of life', 'Childhood', 'Childhood Acute Myeloid Leukemia', 'Childhood Leukemia', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Cytogenetics', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Enrollment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Exons', 'FLT3 gene', 'Family', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Normal Cell', 'North America', 'Oncogenes', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pediatric Oncology Group', 'Phase', 'Point Mutation', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protein Tyrosine Kinase', 'Protein phosphatase', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reagent', 'Recurrent disease', 'Refractory Disease', 'Relapse', 'Residual Neoplasm', 'Residual Tumors', 'Residual state', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk stratification', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Spliceosomes', 'Surface', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'analytical method', 'base', 'chemotherapy', 'cohesion', 'design', 'digital', 'falls', 'functional group', 'gene function', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'insight', 'leukemia', 'leukemia treatment', 'next generation', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'nucleocytoplasmic transport', 'outcome prediction', 'pediatric patients', 'personalized cancer care', 'personalized medicine', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'randomized trial', 'relapse risk', 'response', 'specific biomarkers', 'subclonal heterogeneity', 'transcription factor']",NCI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,388615,-0.007027276349782184
"Detecting and Monitoring Tardive Dyskinesia to Improve Patient Outcomes Tardive dyskinesia (TD) is a common debilitating side effect of antipsychotic use. Characterized most notably by involuntary facial movements such as grimacing, involuntary lip, mouth, and tongue movements, and eye blinking, TD is difficult to treat and potentially irreversible. Psychiatrists and other mental health professionals are acutely aware of the impairment and disability experienced by patients who develop TD. Early detection of TD is critical so that appropriate interventions can be instituted. Unfortunately, despite professionals’ best efforts, it is often too late in the process and the involuntary movements are permanent. Antipsychotic prescriptions exceeded 50 million in 2011 and the reported incidence of TD is between 13% and 24%. Risk grows with advancing age, off-label uses, and chronic exposure to antipsychotics. Therefore, prevention and early detection are key to managing TD. However, current methods for monitoring patients require observation of patients at infrequent in-person visits or self-reporting by vigilant patients and their families. Therefore strong market potential exists for an automated detection system. This Phase I project proposes to leverage existing telepsychiatry and video interview data gathering technologies available commercially to efficiently collect and analyze two hundred 5-minute video interviews with individuals taking anti-psychotic medications. Half of the interviews will be with individuals living with diagnosed TD and the other without a diagnosis of TD. The participants in the study will be recruited to ensure an equal distribution of females and males as well as an ethnically and racially representative sample. The proposed data gathering strategy will provide the source material necessary to create a powerful supervised machine learning derived video and audio analysis tool to detect TD. The detection tool will be created using 80% of the collected video data as a training set and validated on the remaining 20% reserved as the control set. Based on industry experience with other supervised machine learning training sets and the amount of data to be collected, we set a goal of a 90% success rate in identifying TD positive and TD negative participants in the control set. Once the detection tool is complete the project will conclude by incorporating access to the tool into an existing smartphone app, iRxReminder, that is used for data gathering and monitoring of clinical trials. The iRxReminder system links patients directly to researchers and their electronic records. The modified app will be tested in the laboratory to ensure the interface can be easily used. In Phase II the iRxReminder system will be validated for use in supporting the self-management and symptom monitoring of medication taking by individuals living with chronic mental illnesses. Once feasibility is established, we propose a year-long RCT where participants will be monitored for early detection of TD along with goals for high adherence, improved control of symptoms and side effects, and more aggressive and frequent treatment responses by the healthcare team. A recent study reported that TD rates among newly treated elderly ranged from 7.2% for those taking Risperidone to 11.1% for those taking olanzapine after 2 years of treatment. Earlier meta-analyses estimate TD frequency in women to be 26.6% and in men 21.6%. Ethnically Chinese and Malaysian mental health patients were studied in Singapore and patients taking anti-psychotic medications were found to have TD in 40% and 29% of cases respectively. Regardless of prevalence, TD is a threat to patient adherence and quality of life. TD only remits in a minority of cases and can be permanent. With 50 million prescriptions for anti-psychotics written annually, more than 10 million persons living with a chronic mental illness are at risk of developing TD. There are likely over 6 million patients living with TD and the number of patients with TD is expected to grow with the aging population and increasing off- label use of antipsychotics. ",Detecting and Monitoring Tardive Dyskinesia to Improve Patient Outcomes,9410244,R43MH114763,"['Acute', 'Adherence', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Apple', 'Awareness', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Blinking', 'Brain', 'Cellular Phone', 'Characteristics', 'Chinese People', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive Science', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Distress', 'Drug usage', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Exposure to', 'Eye', 'FDA approved', 'Face', 'Family', 'Female', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Professional', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Institutes', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Involuntary Movements', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Limb structure', 'Link', 'Lip structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Malaysian', 'Medical Care Team', 'Mental Health', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Metoclopramide', 'Minority', 'Monitor', 'Monitoring Clinical Trials', 'Movement', 'Mydriasis', 'Neurologic', 'Oral cavity', 'Participant', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patient observation', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Psychiatrist', 'Quality of life', 'Records', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporter', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risperidone', 'Sampling', 'Secure', 'Self Management', 'Self-Administered', 'Singapore', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Speech', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Tardive Dyskinesia', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tongue', 'Training', 'Tremor', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visit', 'Voice', 'Woman', 'aging population', 'base', 'chronic care model', 'cloud based', 'collaborative care', 'compliance behavior', 'disability', 'experience', 'field study', 'improved', 'interest', 'mHealth', 'male', 'medication compliance', 'men', 'new technology', 'olanzapine', 'racial and ethnic', 'severe mental illness', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NIMH,"CREATIVE ACTION, LLC",R43,2017,260928,0.005862670036564103
"Systems Level Causal Discovery in Heterogeneous TOPMed Data SYSTEMS LEVEL CAUSAL DISCOVERY IN HETEROGENEOUS TOPMED DATA ABSTRACT The advent of new technologies for collecting and analyzing multiple heterogeneous data streams from the same individual makes possible the detailed phenotypic characterization of diseases and paves the way for the development of individualized precision therapies. A major bottleneck in this process is the lack of robust, efficient and truly integrative analytic methods for such multi-modal data. This proposal builds on the ongoing efforts of our group in the area of causal learning in biomedicine. The objective of this application is to extend, modify and tailor our causal probabilistic graphical models to data typically collected by TOPMed projects, such as –omics data (SNPs, metabolomics, RNA-seq, etc), imaging, patients' history, and clinical data. COPDGene® is one of the TOPMed projects and has generated datasets with those modalities for 10,000 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), the third leading cause of death and a major cause of disability and health care costs in the US. The prevailing view is that COPD is a syndrome, consisting of multiple diseases with different characteristics. There is currently no satisfactory method for COPD subtyping or prediction of disease progression. In this project we will apply, test and validate our approaches on COPDGene® and another large independent COPD cohort. The extension and application of our methods to cross-sectional and longitudinal data will also allow us to investigate a number of important questions and aspects related to COPD. Mechanistically, we will investigate how SNPs, genes and their networks are causally linked to disease phenotypes. In pathology, we will identify conditional biomarkers, which will lead to disease sub-classification and identification of causal components in each subtype. In pathophysiology, we will identify features that are directly linked to lung function decline and outcome. We will make all our algorithms and results available to the community through web and public cloud interfaces. The deliverables will be (1) new probabilistic approaches for integration and analysis of multi-modal cross-sectional and longitudinal data, including SNPs, blood biomarkers, CT scans and clinical data; (2) new cloud-based server to make these approaches available to the research community; (3) results on the mechanism, pathology and pathophysiology of COPD facilitation and progression. To guarantee the success of the project we have assembled a team of experts in genomics, machine learning, cloud computing and COPD. This cross- disciplinary team project will have a positive impact beyond the above deliverables, since the generality of our approaches makes them applicable to any disease. We expect that during this U01 we will have the opportunity to collaborate with other teams in the TOPMed consortium to help them investigate the causes of their corresponding disease phenotypes. We do believe that data integration in a single probabilistic framework will be in the heart of precision medicine strategies in the future, when massive high-throughput data collection will become a routine diagnostic and prognostic procedure in all hospitals. PROJECT NARRATIVE Current technologies for high-throughput biomedical data collection allow the interrogation of multiple modalities from a single patient. New promising analytical methods started emerging, which can analyze those multi-modal data in a holistic way. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) constitutes the third leading cause of death and a major cause of disability and health care costs in the US. The prevailing view is that COPD is a syndrome, consisting of multiple diseases with their own characteristics. There is currently no satisfactory method for COPD subtyping. We will apply, test and validate new probabilistic approaches on two cohorts of COPD patients. We will investigate the mechanisms of disease facilitation; we will identify patient cohorts with specific characteristics (disease subtypes); and investigate risk factors and causal variants for the disease progression in each subtype.  ",Systems Level Causal Discovery in Heterogeneous TOPMed Data,9310591,U01HL137159,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Models', 'Blood', 'Cause of Death', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cloud Computing', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease model', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Health Care Costs', 'Heart', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Learning', 'Lifting', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Assessment', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Pulmonology', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Stream', 'Subgroup', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Tissues', 'Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'analytical method', 'base', 'clinical imaging', 'clinically relevant', 'cloud based', 'cohort', 'computer science', 'cost effective', 'data integration', 'disability', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder subtype', 'graphical user interface', 'high throughput technology', 'innovation', 'longitudinal dataset', 'medical schools', 'metabolomics', 'mortality', 'multimodality', 'new technology', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'precision genomic medicine', 'precision medicine', 'prognostic', 'repository', 'success', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'user-friendly']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,U01,2017,607934,-0.0055436967047008965
"Repurposing pyronaridine as a treatment for Chagas disease Summary Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) are a diverse group of diseases with distinct characteristics that thrive mainly among the poorest populations of the world. There are 17 NTDs prioritized by the World Health Organization which are endemic in 149 countries and affect more than 1.4 billion people globally, which costs these developing economies billions of dollars annually. The neglected tropical diseases result from four different causative pathogens: protozoa, bacteria, helminth and virus. The majority of the diseases lack effective treatments. For example, 6 to 7 million people in Latin America are infected with the eukaryotic parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease. This disease is gaining recognition as an emerging infection in the United States where an estimated 300,000 people may be infected. Chagas disease has a serious economic impact on the United States and the world. The cost of treatment in the United States alone, where the disease is not indigenous, is estimated to be $900 million annually, which includes hospitalization and medical devices such as pacemakers. The global cost is estimated at $7 billion. Unfortunately, there are no FDA approved treatments for Chagas disease and the two available treatments used outside the U.S. have toxic side effects. New therapeutics for Chagas disease and the other NTDs are desperately needed. Using a machine learning model based on published data for compounds tested against T. cruzi we have identified the EU-approved antimalarial pyronaridine as particularly active in vitro and in vivo with statistically significant efficacy in a 4-day mouse model of infection with a T. cruzi strain expressing firefly luciferase. Pyronaridine demonstrated 85.2% parasite reduction after 4 days treatment, and is known to have a long half-life in humans (13.2 days), promising toxicity profile (less toxic than chloroquine in malaria treatment) and may suggest a drug repurposing opportunity for further study. We propose in this project to determine the minimum effective dose (treatment regimen) for pyronaridine in the acute model of Chagas disease. We will also determine efficacy in the chronic phase of Chagas disease (sterile cure). We will pursue combination therapy DMPK profiling as well as performing combination therapy in vivo efficacy in chronic model of Chagas disease. The results will enable us to assess whether this EU approved drug is worthy of a clinical trial for Chagas disease in the UH3 stage. If successful we will design a clinical study and recruit patients for a phase II trial. This grant represents a unique opportunity to partner the Center for Discovery and Innovation in Parasitic Diseases (www.cdipd.org) at UCSD and the University of Sao Paulo in Brazil with Collaborations Pharmaceuticals Inc. Narrative Approximately 6 to 7 million people in Latin America are infected with the eukaryotic parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of the deadly Chagas disease. This disease is gaining recognition as an emerging infection in the United States where an estimated 300,000 people may be infected and there is no FDA approved treatment. The antimalarial pyronaridine was recently identified by our groups using computational Bayesian repurposing methods and was confirmed as active when tested in vitro and in vivo in the acute mouse model of Chagas disease. We now propose in the UH2 stage to determine: the minimum effective dose in the acute model of Chagas disease and efficacy in the chronic phase while also assessing potential for combination therapy.

"Autoimmunity as a Mechanism for Atherosclerosis in COPD ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project will facilitate the development of the principal investigator into an independent translational researcher investigating systemic vascular injury in Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This will be accomplished in the rich academic environment at the University of Pittsburgh, under the guidance of a highly accomplished team of mentors, and in the conduct of multidisciplinary research project that will develop autoimmunity as a novel mechanism for atherosclerosis in COPD. The increased risk of atherosclerosis in COPD is not explained by smoking, age, hypertension, and other established vascular disease risk factors. Chronic inflammation has recently been implicated as an atherogenic mechanism in COPD. We and others have reported that chronic inflammation in COPD may be propagated by humoral autoimmunity. Specifically, smokers with COPD have greatly increased levels of circulating autoantibodies that demonstrate in vitro pathogenic effects. Our subsequent studies also show that these autoantibodies target at least 50 different autoantigens and consistently target glucose regulated protein 78 (GRP78), particularly in patients with parenchymal lung destruction, i.e. emphysema. GRP78 is present in the endoplasmic reticulum, where it regulates the unfolded protein response, and is also a multifunction cell surface receptor. Studies in cancer patients suggest that ligation of the N-terminus of cell surface GRP78 by anti-GRP78 IgG transduces pro-inflammatory and pro-proliferative signals by activation of the AKT pathway, followed by NFκB activation. Additional in vivo studies have identified anti-GRP78 IgG with affinity for the C-terminus of cell surface GRP78 that produce counteracting anti-inflammatory effects by suppressing AKT activation. Our preliminary work shows that circulating anti-GRP78 IgG in COPD patients binds to macrophages and leads to increased NFκB activation and production of atherogenic inflammatory mediators by them. The macrophage is critical in the development of both atherosclerosis and COPD. Also, cross-sectional studies in our cohort find that levels of circulating anti-GRP78 IgG are strongly associated with carotid atherosclerosis in patients with emphysema, independent of established vascular risk factors. Therefore, we hypothesize that autoimmune responses against GRP78 are a mechanism for atherosclerosis in COPD. During this award, we will: (1) Test the hypothesis that elevated levels of circulating anti-GRP78 IgG predict progression of carotid atherosclerosis in patients with emphysema independent of established risk factors over 4 year follow up; (2) Test the hypothesis that anti-GRP78 IgG binds to the N-terminus of cell surface GRP78 and activates the AKT pathway followed by NFκB activation and production of inflammatory mediators using a variety of cell function assays, and provide proof of concept for two potential therapeutic strategies; (3) Test the hypothesis that there are other antigen-specific immune responses associated with atherosclerosis in COPD by using machine learning to analyze high-throughput data on a large number of circulating autoantibody levels. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a lung disease caused by smoking that kills more and more Americans each year, and is now the third leading cause of death in the US. Although it is largely viewed as a disease of the lungs, the most common cause of death in patients with COPD are blockages in blood vessels. This research project will investigate why patients with COPD are so prone to develop these blood vessel blockages.",Autoimmunity as a Mechanism for Atherosclerosis in COPD,9238793,K23HL126912,"['Affinity', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Anti-inflammatory', 'Antibodies', 'Antigens', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Autoantibodies', 'Autoantigens', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmune Responses', 'Autoimmunity', 'Award', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cancer Patient', 'Carotid Artery Plaques', 'Carotid Atherosclerotic Disease', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Surface Receptors', 'Cell physiology', 'Cell surface', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum', 'Environment', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Event', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Immune response', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'In Vitro', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Inflammatory', 'Injury', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Ligation', 'Link', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphorylation', 'Principal Investigator', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Reporting', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Western Blotting', 'Work', 'cancer clinical trial', 'cohort', 'follow-up', 'glucose-regulated proteins', 'in vitro testing', 'in vivo', 'killings', 'macrophage', 'novel', 'peptidomimetics', 'predictive marker', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'targeted treatment', 'translational scientist']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,K23,2017,166104,-0.014786607415129915
"A Novel eFace System to Prevent the Risks of Facial Distortion after CMF Surgery DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The number of patients suffering from craniomaxillofacial (CMF) deformities and requiring surgical correction is escalating. CMF deformities may involve skeleton, overlying soft-tissues, or the both. Patients with CMF deformities often have psychological problems. The goal of CMF surgery is to reconstruct a normal facial appearance and function, and the outcome of the surgery is judged as such. The current problem is that we do not have a reliable way of simulating the soft-tissue-change following skeletal reconstruction. In treating patients with isolated skeletal defects, the current practice is to normalize the skeleton, hoping for optimal facial appearance. However, because the thickness and contour of the soft-tissue envelope varies from patient to patient, this approach is not reliable. The problem is even bigger in patients with composite defects. For example, in the scenario of a patient with a skeletal deformity and a mild soft-tissue defect, a surgeon would have to know, before surgery, how to overcorrect the skeleton to camouflage the soft-tissue defect. But, this information can only be attained by having an accurate planning system to simulate soft-tissue changes. In addition, from patient's perspective, the final facial appearance is the most apparent to them. Therefore, it is extremely important, for both doctors and patients, to accurately simulate soft-tissue-deformation.  Simulation methods must be accurate and fast. Attaining both is difficult because these attributes are inversely related, the more accurate the model, the longer it takes to prepare and run. Among the most effective, they are empirical-based model, mass spring model, finite element model, and mass tensor model. Unfortunately they are either too inaccurate or too slow, and clinically unacceptable.  Our hypothesis is that facial soft-tissue changes following virtual osteotomy can be accurately simulated by our innovative approach using an anatomically detailed modeling and mapping routine, along with statistical modeling technique. To test our hypothesis, we propose to develop an open source novel imaging informatics platform, eFace system, to accurately simulate soft-tissue-change following virtual osteotomies, and thus to significantly improve the outcomes of patients undergoing facial reconstruction. This approach can not only maintain the integrity of complex facial anatomy to accurately simulate the facial soft tissue deformation, but also significantly improve the computational efficiency in order to fit the requirement for clinical use  This project presents an innovative approach to model the facial soft-tissue deformation. If successful, it will allow accurate simulation of soft-tissue changes after virtual osteotomy. Patients will also be able to foresee the postoperative face preoperatively (patient education) and regain their psychological confidence. Finally, eFace will have significant impact and applications in orthodontics, plastic surgery, general surgery, growth/aging prediction, and forensic science. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In the US and throughout the world, the number of patients requiring surgical correction for facial deformities, which involves skeleton, overlying soft tissu, or both, is escalating every year. 2. Currently, while surgeons are able to accurately plan bone reconstructive surgery, they have to use  their visual imagination with clinical experience to mentally predict the facial soft tissue changes  following the bone surgery because they do not have a reliable way of simulating the soft-tissue-change  that is resulted from skeletal reconstruction. 3. We are proposing to develop an open source novel imaging informatics platform, eFace system, to accurately simulate soft-tissue-change following virtual skeletal surgery and thus to significantly improve the outcomes of patients undergoing facial reconstruction.",A Novel eFace System to Prevent the Risks of Facial Distortion after CMF Surgery,9233988,R01DE021863,"['Address', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Appearance', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Deformity', 'Development', 'Elements', 'Face', 'Forensic Sciences', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Imagination', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Orthodontics', 'Osteotomy', 'Outcome', 'Patient Education', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Plastic Surgical Procedures', 'Plasticizers', 'Postoperative Period', 'Property', 'Psyche structure', 'Reconstructive Surgical Procedures', 'Reporting', 'Residual state', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Severities', 'Skeleton', 'Speed', 'Statistical Models', 'Surgeon', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'balance testing', 'base', 'bone', 'craniomaxillofacial', 'experience', 'imaging informatics', 'improved', 'improved functioning', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'mechanical properties', 'novel', 'open source', 'prevent', 'psychologic', 'public health relevance', 'reconstruction', 'simulation', 'skeletal', 'skeletal surgery', 'soft tissue', 'system architecture', 'virtual']",NIDCR,METHODIST HOSPITAL RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2017,393538,-0.004636192449203487
"Enhancing an EMR-Based Real-Time Sepsis Alert System Performance through Machine Learning Project Summary  Sepsis is defined as a severe infection with dangerous physiologic changes, organ dysfunction or death, which hospitalizes over 1.6 million people in the U.S. annually. Sepsis is a priority for the Center for Medicaid and Medicare Services due to its healthcare impact, incidence and staggering annual cost, which exceed $20 billion and 5% of all U.S. hospital costs. All sepsis patients, even those with mild sepsis are at risk for in- hospital complications and death, but have improved outcomes if identified early. Sepsis recognition, however, is challenging due to the heterogeneity of patients who may manifest a wide array of clinical presentations. Electronic medical record (EMR) linked computer programs, known as clinical decision support (CDS) tools, have become ubiquitous to assist providers, including identifying sepsis patients. Unfortunately, all CDS tools in the literature miss 20-30% of sepsis patients and frequently misidentify non-sepsis patients as sepsis patients. Inaccurate CDS tools generate far too many false positive alerts, creating the dangerous condition of “alert fatigue” in which providers become habituated to all alerts, threatening patient safety and even leading to fatal consequences.  The PI and Co-I of this proposal collaboratively developed a CDS software called Sepsis-Alert for adult emergency department (ED) patients. It was fully implemented into Detroit Medical Center's (DMC) EMR live environment and has now been continually operational to provide real-time ongoing monitoring of all ED patients at Sinai Grace Hospital of DMC since October 2014. Our analysis of 25,000 ED visits reveals that while Sepsis-Alert's performance exceeds any reported performance, it still remains unacceptably inaccurate. All the CDS tools, including ours, have two limitations: (1) they lack a mechanism to learn from their past erroneous decisions and consequently repeat the same mistakes again and again, and (2) their decision- making process is fixed and treats all patients in the same way even in face of high heterogeneity of patients,  The main thrust of this research project is to develop an innovative prototype CDS software that functions like Sepsis-Alert but without the two limitations for the same ED sepsis screening purpose. We will develop the software system by utilizing data extracted from the EMR and will test and fine tune the system in over 35,000 retrospective and prospective patients at Sinai Grace Hospital. The proposed prototype, Intelligent Sepsis Alert, will have the cutting edge capabilities of recognizing the subtleties of sepsis, categorizing patients and learning from its own mistakes to avoid repeat them. CDS tools of the future can and must be better. Machine learning is the solution to optimizing patient care without creating a harmful environment. The final deliverable of this project will be a highly accurate and advanced program readily adoptable by any health system or hospital to improve sepsis care and create a safer healthcare environment. 1 Project Narrative  Sepsis is a toxic response to a severe infection and represents a healthcare epidemic, which afflicts millions of people and accounts for 5% of all hospital costs and over $20 billion in the U.S. annually. This project's objective is to develop a cutting edge computer based tool, called Intelligent Sepsis Alert, with the power of machine intelligence (a form of artificial intelligence) and the ability to learn that will accurately identify sepsis patients for healthcare providers extremely early in their hospital course to ensure that patients receive all of the necessary life-saving interventions they need. Intelligent Sepsis Alert will be readily adoptable by other hospitals and health systems and by providing the critical real-time, bedside support for early sepsis identification will translate into multitudes of deaths prevented, abundant intensive care unit admissions avoided, hundreds of thousands of dollars saved and thousands of wasted nursing and physician man-hours eliminated.",Enhancing an EMR-Based Real-Time Sepsis Alert System Performance through Machine Learning,9280871,R21HS024750,[' '],AHRQ,WAYNE STATE UNIVERSITY,R21,2017,149851,-0.010163389534009097
"Development of Models for the Prediction of Ventilator-Associated Conditions in the Hospital Setting ABSTRACT Mechanical ventilation refers to the use of life-support technology to perform the work of breathing for patients suffering from respiratory failure. Patients undergoing mechanical ventilation are disproportionately older and suffer from multiple chronic conditions: Approximately half of these patients are older than 65, and half suffer from multiple chronic conditions. Prolonged mechanical ventilation is associated with a higher likelihood of death as a result of complications from ventilator associated conditions (VAC), the most lethal of which is ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP). Approximately 10 to 20% of mechanically ventilated patients develop VAP, and patients suffering from VAP are twice as likely to die compared to similar patients without VAP. In addition, approximately 80% of mechanically ventilated patients will develop delirium. Currently, most institutions take a one-size-fits-all ‘bundled’ approach to mitigate ventilator associated complications. This wastes healthcare resources on patients who will not benefit while simultaneously denying additional potentially life-saving resources from patients who are most likely to benefit from vigorous prophylactic interventions. In this Phase 1 SBIR study, we will design models to predict with a high degree of accuracy which patients will likely develop VAC, VAP and delirium. Current care focuses on the disease (i.e., respiratory failure) as opposed to the patient. Our vision is to put this tool into the hands of hospital caregivers, which we will do during Phase 2 of this SBIR. Successful completion of the proposed work will alter the current bundled approach to the care of mechanically ventilated patients such that the care becomes tailored to the needs of each individual patient. Furthermore, this work will facilitate the early application of targeted prevention interventions to reduce the frequency of VAC, pneumonia and delirium in mechanically ventilated patients, thus improving patient outcomes. Finally, the developed models will provide critical prognostic information for providers and patients, facilitating shared decision-making and care planning. NARRATIVE This SBIR Phase 1 application seeks to create then use a dataset of predictor variables and outcomes from mechanically ventilated patients to develop novel analytical tools that predict whether individual ventilated patients will develop delirium, ventilator associated conditions, and pneumonia. This information will improve patient outcomes and facilitate clinical decision-making by nurses and physicians by drawing their attention and resources to the patients most likely to develop these conditions.",Development of Models for the Prediction of Ventilator-Associated Conditions in the Hospital Setting,9402876,R43NR015721,"['Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Classification', 'Clinical Trials', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Decision Trees', 'Delirium', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Event', 'Family', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Logit Models', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Mechanics', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Nurses', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Pneumonia', 'Preventive', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Probability', 'Provider', 'Quality of Care', 'Records', 'Resources', 'Respiratory Failure', 'Sales', 'Savings', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Trees', 'Validation', 'Ventilator', 'Vision', 'Work', 'Work of Breathing', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'design', 'forest', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'model design', 'model development', 'multiple chronic conditions', 'novel', 'older patient', 'patient oriented', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'prognostic', 'prognostic value', 'prophylactic', 'prospective', 'shared decision making', 'tool', 'ventilator-associated pneumonia', 'wasting']",NINR,"ORIGENT DATA SCIENCES, INC.",R43,2017,75665,0.02587500973126515
"The Next Frontier in Diabetes Communication: Promoting Health Literacy in the Era of Secure Messaging ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Limited health literacy (HL) places individuals at greater risk of type 2 diabetes (DM2) and its complications, is a marker of vulnerability, and presents a critical clinical and public health problem. To be health literate in the 21st century, patients will need a certain level of linguistic facility, in combination with technical skills, to access services via online patient portals. Our research has shown that DM2 patients with limited HL are actively using patient portals. However, as healthcare becomes increasingly dependent on electronic communications (e.g., secure messages via internet-based patient portals), patients with limited HL may have difficulty communicating electronically with their clinician or understanding their clinician's secure message responses or instructions. For clinicians to electronically provide meaningful and actionable information and support, their secure messages must be written in an easily comprehended style. Few studies have examined how patients with limited HL interact with their healthcare providers via patient portals. This trans-disciplinary proposal, involving a team of health services researchers, health communication scientists, and computational linguists, will focus on a population of ethnically diverse DM2 patients and their primary care providers from 1) a large, integrated group model HMO with a well-developed patient portal and 2) a county-run, integrated public (safety net) delivery system with a newly launched electronic health record and patient portal. Our study is designed around a conceptual framework promoted most recently by the Institute of Medicine: overcoming the challenges LHL patients face in managing DM2 requires that healthcare systems, and their clinicians, make accommodations to meet patients' communication needs. The degree of linguistic ""mismatch"" observed in secure message exchanges between DM2 patients and their providers, measured using computational linguistics, will serve as one indicator of the extent to which providers are, or are not, making such accommodations. Our specific aims are to (Aim 1) develop and validate a novel, automated linguistic complexity profile (LCP) to assess secure message content generated by DM2 patients and their providers via patient portals. We will employ natural language processing (NLP) to develop and validate the LCP, based on secure messages and data from >200,000 DM2 patients. The LCP will demonstrate construct validity with patient HL and patient reports of provider communication, and will be associated with DM2 outcomes; (Aim 2) examine whether concordance between provider and patient LCP is associated with adherence among DM2 patients newly prescribed insulin or antidepressants; (Aim 3) characterize the collaborative nature of exchanges between providers and low LCP patients, using mixed methods, to enhance our understanding of communication in the critical period surrounding initiation of insulin or antidepressants; (Aim 4) create an automated, LCP-based prototype to provide real-time feedback to providers while writing secure messages to reduce linguistic complexity and better accommodate DM2 patients' linguistic skills and HL. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Limited health literacy places individuals at greater risk of type 2 diabetes and its complications, making limited health literacy a critical clinical and publi health problem. As healthcare becomes increasingly dependent on electronic communications, patients with limited health literacy may have difficulty communicating by email with their clinician or understanding the clinician's emailed replies or instructions. This proposal will use computational linguistics to examine how diabetes patients with a variety of health literacy levels interact with their clinicians via patient portals, will explore whether linguistic gaps between patients and clinicians are associated with diabetes outcomes, and will create a feedback tool to assist clinicians to better accommodate diabetes patients' communication needs.",The Next Frontier in Diabetes Communication: Promoting Health Literacy in the Era of Secure Messaging,9296180,R01LM012355,"['Adherence', 'Advocate', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Computational Linguistics', 'Computer software', 'County', 'Data', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronic Mail', 'Face', 'Feedback', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'Health', 'Health Communication', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Services', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hypoglycemia', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Information Services', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Instruction', 'Insulin', 'Internet', 'Linguistics', 'Measures', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Regimen', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Secure', 'Series', 'System', 'Technical Expertise', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Visit', 'Writing', 'arm', 'base', 'communication aid', 'critical period', 'design', 'ethnic diversity', 'experimental study', 'frontier', 'health care delivery', 'health care service utilization', 'health literacy', 'improved', 'literate', 'novel', 'profiles in patients', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'safety net', 'service utilization', 'simulation', 'skills', 'tool', 'uptake']",NLM,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2017,612234,0.008793635840113013
"Statistical methods for biosignals with varying domains DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Clinical care and large observational studies are characterized by periods of intense health monitoring during hospital visits followed by long periods of low-intensity or no-monitoring between visits. Data obtained during in-hospital visits come from a host of new technologies, such as very densely sampled biosignal recordings (EEG, ECG, health scores) and high resolution multi-modality imaging (MRI, CT, PET). A major characteristic of this type of data is that it is collected for a period of time that is subject-spcific. Indeed, the in-hospital length and amount of monitoring varies between subjects, and is highly informative both for studying health outcomes in the hospital and after discharge. One among many examples is a recent study of subjects admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). For each subject the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, a commonly- used scoring system to measure organ dysfunction in the ICU, was collected daily for each subject for the duration of their ICU stay. The ICU length of stay is different by subject and likely to be highly informative of current and future health outcomes. In this application, a set of relevant problems are conceptualized and distilled to statistical aims to address specific complexities associated with this type of data sampling. Specifically, the proposal addresses the following fundamental unsolved problems in studies that collect high density biosignals: 1) introducing statistical models for the association between high density biosignals with uneven support and health outcomes; 2) developing functional registration-by-prediction models that transform the support of biosignals to provide best prediction of health outcomes; and 3) developing models for describing the cross-sectional and longitudinal variability of biosignals obtained in studies with rare -but intense- health monitorin. While focus lies on research studies that collect quasi- continuous ultra-high resolution biosignals for subject-specific lengths of time, methods will be generalizable to many other studies with similar data sampling structures. 2 PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project provides analytic methods for biological and health signals that are measured often for unequal periods of time (e.g. disease severity scores during hospital stays, EEG data during sleep, reaching hand movement after stroke). Special emphasis is given to the study of the association between these biosignals and health outcomes. 4",Statistical methods for biosignals with varying domains,9297324,R01HL123407,"['Address', 'Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Applications Grants', 'Biological', 'Characteristics', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electroencephalography', 'Event', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Length', 'Length of Stay', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Observational Study', 'Organ', 'Organ failure', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Severity of illness', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Study Subject', 'Survival Analysis', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Visit', 'Width', 'analytical method', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'clinical care', 'density', 'experience', 'hazard', 'indexing', 'kinematics', 'member', 'new technology', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'statistics', 'ultra high resolution']",NHLBI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,404000,-0.007935034774988683
"Michigan Hepatotoxicity Clinical Research Network Renewal 2013 DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Drug Induced Liver Injury Network (DILIN) was established in 2003 to advance understanding and research into the causes, pathogenesis, and natural history of DILI. The ongoing Retrospective study has collected 109 DNA samples from subjects with liver injury attributed to one of 8 drugs. In addition, 1215 patients with liver injuy attributed to over 100 individual drugs and herbal and dietary supplements (HDS) have been enrolled and followed for at least 6 months in the ongoing DILIN Prospective study. Manuscripts describing the presenting features and clinical outcomes in the overall cohort and with DILI attributed to specific agents have been published. Ancillary studies exploring the chemical content of implicated HDS products have been initiated. The collected DNA, lymphocytes, serum, plasma, and liver tissue have also been used to conduct informative mechanistic studies. The primary aim of the current application is to continue to recruit and enroll suspected DILI patients as early as possible after liver injury onset for collection of biological samples tobe used in genetic, immunological, transcriptomic, and proteomic studies. It is hypothesized that these studies will lead to improved biomarkers of DILI susceptibility, mechanisms, and outcomes. We also propose novel studies of liver elastography to longitudinally assess disease severity and a pilot clinical trial for patients with severe acute DILI. Recruiting and enrolling cases within 2 weeks of DILI onset at the University of Michigan will be accomplished via use of natural language processing algorithms to search inpatient and outpatient electronic medical records as well as the referral of patients from the 140 physician member Michigan Hepatotoxicity Research Network. A second aim of this application is to continue to explore the role of host genetic variation in DILI susceptibility and outcomes using next generation sequencing techniques in high causality score cases. Exome arrays, whole genome, and whole exome sequencing are proposed to identify rare genetic polymorphisms associated with DILI susceptibility followed by expression system and pathway analysis studies. The third aim of this application is to further develop an accurate and reliable computerized causality assessment instrument that will have improved sensitivity and specificity compared to expert opinion and other currently used methods. The coefficients for specific variables of this instrument will be developed from the DILIN database and tested and validated using future DILIN cases and other acute cases of non-DILI hepatitis. The fourth aim of this application is to further develop the LiverTox website as a comprehensive and authoritative resource on DILI. A LiverTox Executive Committee is proposed to oversee and coordinate the development of a computerized causality assessment instrument as well as the development and maintenance of chapters on liver injury due to prescription drugs and HDS products. Finally, a LiverTox website portal is proposed to allow for the submission of bona-fide DILI cases for causality assessment and potential enrollment into future DILIN studies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The Michigan Hepatotoxicity Research Network proposes to improve our understanding of the causes, mechanisms, and outcomes of drug induced liver injury via the continued enrollment of adult and pediatric patients into the ongoing DILIN Prospective and Retrospective studies. The collection of early blood and urine samples from well-characterized DILI patients will allow for innovative studies of patient, drug and environmental risk factors. Further development of a computerized diagnostic instrument and expansion of the LiverTox website is also planned which will provide doctors, researchers, and the general public an authoritative and up-to-date resource that can help accelerate DILI research in the US and abroad.",Michigan Hepatotoxicity Clinical Research Network Renewal 2013,9325499,U01DK065184,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Anabolic steroids', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Ancillary Study', 'Assessment tool', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Budesonide', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Catalogs', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Enrollment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Etiology', 'Exclusion', 'Expert Opinion', 'Floxacillin', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'General Population', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Variation', 'Hepatitis', 'Hepatotoxicity', 'Herbal supplement', 'Histopathology', 'Immunologics', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Injury to Liver', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Leadership', 'Liver', 'Lymphocyte', 'Maintenance', 'Manuscripts', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Molecular', 'Monograph', 'Natural History', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Plasma', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Prospective Studies', 'Proteomics', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Recovery', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'Severity of illness', 'Site', 'Specimen', 'Speed', 'Systems Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Valproic Acid', 'Variant', 'Writing', 'chemical property', 'cohort', 'computerized', 'design', 'elastography', 'exome', 'exome sequencing', 'follow-up', 'genetic variant', 'genome analysis', 'genome wide association study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'isoniazid', 'liver injury', 'meetings', 'member', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'pediatric patients', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'repository', 'screening', 'transcriptomics', 'web site', 'whole genome']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U01,2017,317128,-0.003292544246654424
"A Novel Device for Optimal and Personalized Fluid Therapy in Septic Shock Patients Abstract Septic shock is a severe condition resulting in a critical reduction of organ perfusion with consequential and common stage 2 and 3 acute kidney injury (AKI) occurring in as many as 60% of patients and with an alarmingly high in-hospital co-morbid mortality rate of up to 70%. Current Surviving Sepsis Guidelines recommend early aggressive fluid resuscitation targeting mean arterial pressure (MAP≥ 65 mmHg); however aggressive resuscitation commonly results in hypervolemia. Elevated intra-abdominal pressure (IAP), which occurs frequently in critically ill patients, is recognized as a vital parameter reflecting venous outflow that has wide-ranging physiologic effects including an association with AKI. Thus, abdominal perfusion pressure (APP=MAP-IAP) may provide the optimal target to guide hemodynamic support as it reflects both inflow (MAP) and outflow (IAP) perfusion. However, current methods of IAP measurement limit the validation of APP as a hemodynamic target as they are prone to (1) human error, limiting the reproducibility of measurements and (2) contamination resulting in catheter-associated urinary tract infections. Potrero Medical, Inc. has developed the Accuryn Monitoring System, which accurately, automatically and digitally extracts physiological data in real-time from the bladder, without the need for external equipment or manual manipulation. Accuryn received formal 510(k) clearance from the FDA for measurement of IAP, urine output and core temperature in April of 2016. In combination with MAP acquired through standard of care, Accuryn will enable APP-targeted hemodynamic resuscitation in septic shock patients. In this grant, the use of Accuryn to improve clinical outcomes in septic shock patients via both IAP monitoring and APP-targeted hemodynamic resuscitation will be validated. We plan to conduct a 24-month clinical trial with 200 septic shock patients divided among three groups: (1) Monitoring (normal IAP receiving MAP-targeted resuscitation), (2) Standard of Care MAP group (elevated IAP receiving MAP-targeted resuscitation), and (3) APP group (elevated IAP receiving APP≥ 60 mmHg targeted resuscitation. The primary endpoint for comparison will be incidence or progression (defined by peak severity in creatinine and UO compared to baseline levels) of stage 2 and 3 AKI. Secondary endpoints include ICU- and hospital mortality, frequency and duration of RRT, urinary biomarker data, days on mechanical ventilation, mean duration of vasopressor support, and adverse events. Independent comparisons between these groups will (1) verify that elevated IAP during fluid resuscitation is correlated with AKI in septic shock patients and (2) validate that APP-guided fluid resuscitation reduces the incidence or progression of stage 2 and 3 AKI in septic shock patients compared to MAP-guided resuscitation. With this clinical study, we will validate the need for the Accuryn device to continuously measure IAP and target APP during resuscitation. The data collected from this grant will enable the design of a pivotal phase III clinical study defining APP- targeted hemodynamic support as the new standard of care for septic shock. Narrative Improving the resuscitation procedures in septic shock by (1) better gauging the patient’s volume status and (2) guiding hemodynamic support to individualized patient needs by a balanced, precision approach involving vasopressor support and targeted fluid expansion, may dramatically improve clinical outcomes including acute kidney injury. Potrero Medical intends use our Accuryn Monitoring System, to continuously measure intra- abdominal pressure (IAP) and apply the measure to target abdominal perfusion pressure (APP) during resuscitation to (1) verify the importance of IAP in the development of AKI in septic shock patients and (2) validate that APP-guided fluid resuscitation reduces the incidence or progression of AKI in septic shock patients compared to current standard care.",A Novel Device for Optimal and Personalized Fluid Therapy in Septic Shock Patients,9348493,R44GM123799,"['Abdomen', 'Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Adverse effects', 'Adverse event', 'Awareness', 'Biological Markers', 'Bladder', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood Volume', 'Catheters', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Comorbidity', 'Computer Simulation', 'Consequentialism', 'Creatinine', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Employee Strikes', 'Equation', 'Equipment', 'Failure', 'Fluid Therapy', 'Fluid overload', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Incidence', 'Intra-abdominal', 'Joints', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Marketing', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Mississippi', 'Monitor', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reproducibility', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Sepsis', 'Septic Shock', 'Severities', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'Vasoconstrictor Agents', 'Venous', 'Work', 'abdominal pressure', 'catheter associated UTI', 'design', 'digital', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'monitoring device', 'mortality', 'novel', 'patient population', 'personalized approach', 'pressure', 'prospective', 'standard care', 'standard of care', 'urinary']",NIGMS,"POTRERO MEDICAL, INC.",R44,2017,1685221,-0.026739790677194043
"Effectiveness of IG-IMRT for Locally Advanced Cervix Cancer on NRG Trial CVM-1421 ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Cervical cancer is among the leading causes of cancer death worldwide. Patients often have poor access to screening and vaccination, and present in advanced stages, for which chemoradiotherapy (chemoRT) is the standard of care. This treatment is limited, however, by high rates of failure and toxicity. Although intensifying chemotherapy can improve tumor control and survival, toxicity is often unacceptably high. Strategies to reduce toxicity while increasing efficacy of chemoRT are therefore needed.  Standard pelvic RT techniques encompass large volumes of normal tissue. In contrast, image-guided intensity-modulated RT (IG-IMRT) is a modern technique that maximizes target dose and minimizes normal tissue dose. Multiple studies have found that IG-IMRT can significantly reduce organ dose and reduce toxicity compared to standard RT. These studies support the hypothesis that IG-IMRT can permit delivery of more intensive chemotherapy. For example, gemcitabine, a potent radiosensitizer, has been found to improve survival for cervical cancer patients in randomized trials (Dueñas-Gonzalez et al.). However, the toxicity when delivered with standard RT is extreme (>80% grade 3-4 toxicity). Therefore, this regimen has not replaced cisplatin alone as the standard of care. In contrast, our research group has found that the maximum tolerated dose of gemcitabine was increased when given with IG-IMRT. A large international multi-institutional trial has also found lower rates of toxicity with IG-IMRT compare to standard chemoRT. These findings support the hypothesis that IG-IMRT, by reducing bowel and bone marrow dose, could permit delivery of more effective concurrent chemotherapy. If confirmed, this would have significant implications for many pelvic malignancies. However, this hypothesis has not been tested in a randomized trial.  CVM-1421 is an emerging NCI-funded randomized phase II trial within the NRG Oncology Cooperative Group that will test the hypothesis that adding concurrent triapine, a ribonucleotide reductase inhibitor, to concurrent cisplatin and RT can improve outcomes in patients with locoregionally advanced cervix cancer undergoing definitive chemoradiation. This trial presents a unique opportunity to study the effects of IG- IMRT on normal tissue toxicity, as it will be the first cooperative group trial to permit IG-IMRT in this population. This trial also presents an opportunity to study ways to improve IG-IMRT quality, as there has been considerable controversy in how to optimally design IG-IMRT plans, due to their increased complexity. The goal of our research is to study the effect of IG-IMRT on toxicity, quality of life, and treatment outcomes, under varying intensities of chemotherapy. We will also implement a novel technique called knowledge-based planning (KBP) in order to improve plan quality and achieve optimal IG-IMRT dose distributions. This research could help establish IG-IMRT as a new standard of care for pelvic malignancies, and will lay groundwork for future studies testing novel technologies in clinical trial settings. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  In this study, we will test the hypothesis that image guided intensity modulated radiation therapy (IG-IMRT) will reduce hematologic and gastrointestinal toxicity compared to standard pelvic radiotherapy in cervical cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy and cisplatin with or without triapine. We are in an optimal situation to ask this question because the randomized phase II trial that will set the background for our study is evaluating the efficacy of more intensive chemotherapy while allowing both IG-IMRT and standard radiation treatment techniques. It would be beneficial for clinicians and patients to know whether IG-IMRT will reduce toxicity and improve quality of life. Further, this study could help establish IG-IMRT as a new standard of care.",Effectiveness of IG-IMRT for Locally Advanced Cervix Cancer on NRG Trial CVM-1421,9301295,R01CA197059,"['American', 'Anterior', 'Bone Marrow', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cessation of life', 'Cisplatin', 'Clinical Trials', 'DNA Synthesis Inhibitors', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Effectiveness', 'Failure', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genitourinary system', 'Goals', 'Gynecologic', 'Gynecology', 'Intensity-Modulated Radiotherapy', 'International', 'Intestines', 'Lateral', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri', 'Maximum Tolerated Dose', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Organ', 'Patients', 'Pelvis', 'Population', 'Progression-Free Survivals', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of life', 'Radiation', 'Radiation therapy', 'Radiation-Sensitizing Agents', 'Randomized', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Ribonucleotide Reductase Inhibitor', 'Secondary to', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Treatment outcome', 'Triapine', 'Vaccination', 'chemoradiation', 'chemotherapy', 'comparative effectiveness', 'contrast imaging', 'design', 'gastrointestinal', 'gemcitabine', 'image guided', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'new technology', 'novel', 'oncology', 'phase I trial', 'phase II trial', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'radiation effect', 'randomized trial', 'screening', 'standard of care', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'tumor']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2017,217388,-0.02145196321062124
"Comparative Effectiveness of Oral Anticoagulants in Atrial Fibrillation ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Atrial fibrillation (AF), a common cardiac arrhythmia, affects >2 million Americans and is associated with increased morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs. Adequate antithrombotic treatment in AF is critical to preventing stroke and other complications. To date, this has been mostly achieved with vitamin K antagonists (warfarin in the US). Warfarin use, however, is burdensome and carries a significant risk of complications. Recently, new oral anticoagulants (OACs; dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban) have proved in randomized trials to be at least as efficacious as warfarin in preventing stroke in AF patients. Randomized trials, however, are not always generalizable to the usual clinical setting. Therefore, additional research is necessary to determine the effectiveness of these new OACs, compared to warfarin, and to identify patients more likely to benefit from the new medications. In this application, we propose to assess the following specific aims: (1) to estimate the effectiveness of new OACs versus warfarin treatment in the prevention of ischemic stroke, systemic embolism, healthcare utilization, and mortality;(2) to assess the risk of bleeding and other complications (myocardial infarction, dyspepsia) associated with use of new OACs versus warfarin in these patients; (3) to identify patient subgroups, defined by age, sex, race/ethnicity, comorbidities, and use of other medications, for which the new OACs are particularly beneficial or hazardous; and (4) to develop and validate risk predictive models of stroke / cardioembolic complications and severe hemorrhage in AF patients using new OACs. To address these research questions, we will use two large claim databases, OptumInsight and MarketScan. These databases include health insurance claims from over 1 million patients with AF, and >155,000 users of new OACs. State- of-the-art methods for comparative effectiveness research, including high-dimensional propensity scores, marginal structural models, and instrumental variables, will be used to adjust for confounding. Results from our research will provide key evidence to help patients and clinicians make decisions about their anticoagulant treatment, balancing benefits and risks associated with different therapeutic options. This proposal also has the potential to inform decisions by regulatory agencies, insurers, health system leaders, and professional organizations in issues such as post marketing approval, reimbursements, and clinical guidelines. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Limited information exists on the ""real-world"" effectiveness of new oral anticoagulants compared to warfarin in the treatment of patients with atrial fibrillation,a common cardiac arrhythmia. The proposed research will provide timely and necessary information to help clinicians and patients make well-founded decisions on the use and choice of oral anticoagulants.

"Aptamer-Based Arrays for Detection of Pathogenic IgA1 O-Glycoforms in IgA Nephropathy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The glycosylation patterns on IgA1 antibodies are highly complex and heterogeneous. When there are dysregulations in activities of glycosylation enzymes, the hinge domain of IgA1's, i.e., the peptide domain connecting constant and variable regions, can undergo shifts in glycosylation patterns and become galactose- deficient (Gd). The galactose deficiency, together with other triggers, can lead to an auto-immune response in which patients' own antibodies form complexes with Gd-IgA1's; these complexes precipitate and cause damage in glomeruli, eventually leading to IgA1 nephropathy (IgAN).  It is of a great interest to monitor regularly Gd-IgA1's of patients who are predisposed to develop nephropathy. Further, increased understanding of correlations between dynamic variations in glycosylation patterns and the natural development of the disease in individual patients is expected to lead to improved interventions, including individually optimized therapies that could block the formation of offending complexes. None of the current approaches to assess microheterogeneity in glycosylation patterns is completely satisfactory; while elegant, these are also arduous and indirect, limited to highly specialized laboratories and difficult to reproduce in actual patients' samples, in large part due to lack of precise, well-characterized, molecular-level analytical tools  We propose to address this issue by systematic isolation of oligonucleotide-based molecular receptors or aptamers that will interact with clusters of different O-glycosides displayed in the hinge subregions. Aptameric receptors will be isolated from large oligonucleotide pools through the process of an in vitro selection and amplification coupled to the affinity separation via interactions with IgA1 hinge regions isolated from both Gd- IgAN patients and healthy controls. Individual aptamers will interact with substructures within the hinge domain, that is, with shorter peptides displaying one or more oligosaccharides. A large number of identified aptamers will be screened for their ability to interact with fractions of polyclonal IgA1's, and a variety of those aptamers that show a quantitatively different response to IgA1s from patients and matched controls will be selected for a more detailed characterization and incorporation in ""classification sensor arrays"" (CSAs).  As the result of our work, we will have immediately a set of aptamers that would together form a classification sensor array, an artificial ""nose"" capable of distinguishing samples belonging to patients with Gd- IgAN from healthy controls, as well as quantifying the extent of shifts in glycosylation patterns. Further molecular-level characterizatio of epitopes (subdomains) that these aptamers recognize is expected to enable studies towards identification of structures that are responsible for auto-immune responses in individual patients, and correlation with secondary triggers of diseases, which are the key step in the rational design of targeted inhibitors of the complex formation. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Complex saccharide structures ('glycans') play crucial roles in a wide range of biological functions and diseases such as autoimmunity, cancer, and nephropathy. We will help elucidate the role of complex glycans in the pathogenesis of IgA nephropathy, one of the most common causes of kidney failure worldwide, by systematically and exhaustively generating oligonucleotide-based receptors (aptamers) for glycan clusters on IgA1 antibodies. This will allow new diagnostic protocols based on pattern recognition with classification arrays and, in the long-term, personalized therapies to prevent antigen-autoantibody interaction and nephropathy.",Aptamer-Based Arrays for Detection of Pathogenic IgA1 O-Glycoforms in IgA Nephropathy,9308943,R21DK109690,"['Address', 'Affinity', 'Alkaloids', 'Amino Acids', 'Antibodies', 'Antigens', 'Autoantibodies', 'Autoimmunity', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Biopsy', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Deposition', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Dopamine', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Enzymes', 'Epidemiology', 'Epitopes', 'Galactose', 'Genetic', 'Glycosides', 'IGA Glomerulonephritis', 'IgA1', 'Immune response', 'Immunoglobulin Constant Region', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region', 'Immunology', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Kidney Failure', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Lectin', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Nephrology', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Nose', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Oligonucleotides', 'Oligosaccharides', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Peptides', 'Play', 'Polysaccharides', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reagent', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Regulation', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Serum', 'Specificity', 'Sphingosine', 'Standardization', 'Steroids', 'Structure', 'Tertiary Protein Structure', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'aptamer', 'base', 'combinatorial', 'cost effective', 'design', 'disorder control', 'exhaustion', 'glycosylation', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'inorganic phosphate', 'interest', 'multidisciplinary', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'patient stratification', 'personalized medicine', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'receptor', 'response', 'screening', 'sensor', 'sugar', 'tool']",NIDDK,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R21,2017,200347,-0.002863942505315634
"Bioenergetics and Rehabilitation in Older Patients with Acute Heart Failure ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Older adults exhibit poor recovery and are at high risk for rehospitalization after acute heart failure. Current rehabilitation and clinical management strategies have shown only modest benefits because the mechanisms underlying poor outcomes remain under recognized and therefore unmitigated. The proposed study will address this critical knowledge gap by examining the role of systemic mitochondrial bioenergetic capacity as a fundamental factor underlying poor physical function in hospitalized acute decompensated heart failure, the success of rehabilitation, and the prognosis of patients following hospitalization. This will be accomplished in a highly translational and cost-effective manner as an ancillary study to REHAB-HF (R01AG045551; PI: Kitzman), a multi-center clinical trial funded by the NIA that tests the hypothesis that impaired physical function underlies adverse outcomes in older hospitalized ADHF patients and employs a novel rehabilitation program that targets multiple domains of physical function for 12 weeks beginning during hospitalization. The results of REHAB-HF can impact clinical practice; however, its outcomes do not directly address potential mechanisms of action. Mitochondrial function is likely candidate for mediating physiological decline in REHAB-HF participants, because these organelles are sensitive to a myriad of intrinsic and extrinsic factors related to aging, physical function, heart failure, and hospitalization.  Mitochondrial dysfunction across multiple tissues has been implicated in physiological decline associated with heart failure and is thought to be mediated by circulating factors that affect systemic bioenergetic capacity. Therefore, we propose that respirometric profiling of circulating cells can be used to report on systemic bioenergetic decline in heart failure patients and will be associated with physical function and long term outcomes - including rehospitalization rate. We will determine whether the REHAB-HF rehabilitation program increases bioenergetic capacity, compared to control, thereby improving functional outcomes. Bioenergetic profiling of multiple blood cell populations will enable us to identify the specific cell types and bioenergetic parameters, or patterns comprised of multiple variables, that are most closely associated with REHAB-HF outcomes such as physical function and quality of life. We will also determine the ability of blood cells to report on systemic bioenergetic decline y examining relationships with mitochondrial function measured in skeletal muscle. Successful strategies for mitigating poor physical function and improving long-term outcomes rely on the identification of mechanisms that contribute to the vulnerability of patients after discharge. Bioenergetic profiling may enable the identification of patients in need of more intensive management and targeted rehabilitation. The advancement of blood-based bioenergetic profiling will enhance the use of this promising test in future trials, and potentially, in the cliical care of older patients with the wide range of chronic medical conditions associated with physical disability and poor clinical outcomes. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed project will examine the role of mitochondrial bioenergetics in the physical function of older adults hospitalized for acute heart failure, and th long term rehabilitation outcomes of these patients. Understanding the mechanisms that underlie the success of recovery will lead to improved treatment strategies that can be personalized in order to maximize benefits for individual patients. The results of this study can improve the management of older adults hospitalized with acute heart failure and will be generalizable to the broader issues of age-related bioenergetic decline and post-hospitalization syndrome.",Bioenergetics and Rehabilitation in Older Patients with Acute Heart Failure,9267094,R21AG051077,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Ancillary Study', 'Bioenergetics', 'Blood', 'Blood Cells', 'Blood Platelets', 'Cardiac', 'Caring', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Trials', 'Comorbidity', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Exercise stress test', 'Exhibits', 'Fatigue', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Heart failure', 'Hormones', 'Hospitalization', 'Impairment', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Knowledge', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Medicare', 'Mitochondria', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'Myocardium', 'Organelles', 'Outcome', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Oxygen Consumption', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physical Function', 'Physically Handicapped', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Protons', 'Quality of life', 'Recovery', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Reporting', 'Respiration', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skeletal Muscle', 'Stress', 'Syndrome', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'adverse outcome', 'age effect', 'age related', 'base', 'cell type', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cytokine', 'exercise intolerance', 'follow-up', 'functional outcomes', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'long-term rehabilitation', 'mitochondrial dysfunction', 'monocyte', 'novel', 'older patient', 'outcome forecast', 'primary outcome', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'rehabilitation management', 'respiratory', 'success', 'treatment strategy']",NIA,WAKE FOREST UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R21,2017,229328,-0.029237462005875396
"Development of a Multi-Modal Neuroimaging Biomarker for Amyotrophic Lateral Scler DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive degenerative motor neuron disease involving the motor cortex, corpus callosum, cortical spinal tract and spinal anterior horn neurons. The disease has a uniformly fatal outcome, although the clinical presentation and course is quite heterogeneous, with median survival times between 2 - 4 years. Approximately 30,000 people in the United States are living with ALS. There is no definitive diagnostic test for ALS. Confident diagnosis is primarily based on clinical assessment and relies on the detection of upper motor neuron (UMN) and lower motor neuron (LMN) signs in multiple body segments, together with a history of progression of symptoms. Evaluation of LMN pathology may be supplemented by electromyography, but UMN pathology can remain occult as it is only assessed using clinical examination which can lead to diagnostic uncertainty. Unfortunately, there is on average a one- year delay between the onset of symptoms and diagnosis for this rapidly progressive disease; this delay prevents early treatment with emerging disease-modifying drugs. Thus, reliable biomarkers for the early diagnosis and disease prognostication are needed.  Conventional magnetic resonance imaging techniques provide limited and inconsistent information in ALS patients. Therefore, there has been and continues to be great interest in using advanced neuroimaging techniques to establish improved markers of the disease. Although advanced neuroimaging techniques such as magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and resting state functional connectivity (fcMRI) have identified differences between ALS patients and healthy controls, they lack sufficient accuracy to reliably classify individual patients. To meet this important unmet need, the proposed study will use novel advanced neuroimaging techniques to develop a multimodal biomarker of ALS, and validate a discrimination and prediction model to refine the diagnostic clinical workup for ALS. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: There are no definitive tests for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and many of these patients have a delayed diagnosis preventing early intervention with new emerging treatments. Furthermore, disease prognosis is challenging due to the variability of the natural history of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. This study will use multiple advanced neuroimaging methods to build a robust diagnostic test and prognostic model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. We will use a novel statistical approach to develop and validate the models.",Development of a Multi-Modal Neuroimaging Biomarker for Amyotrophic Lateral Scler,9265960,R01NS082304,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Anterior', 'Anterior Horn Cells', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical assessments', 'Corpus Callosum', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Electromyography', 'Evaluation', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Heterogeneity', 'Horns', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Motor Neuron Disease', 'Motor Neurons', 'Natural History', 'Neuraxis', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Progressive Disease', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Riluzole', 'Spinal', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Transcend', 'Uncertainty', 'United States', 'base', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinical predictors', 'clinically relevant', 'diagnosis evaluation', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'interest', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'neurotransmission', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'public health relevance', 'rapid diagnosis', 'response', 'screening', 'spinal tract', 'treatment response', 'treatment trial']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2017,577180,-0.010727918566981439
"Using epigenomic subtyping to understand the racial differences in lymphoma PROJECT SUMMARY Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), the most common aggressive type of lymphomas, is characterized by marked clinical and pathological heterogeneity that is reflected at the molecular level. It is well known that although the incidence rates for DLBCL were lower for African Americans (AA) than for European Americans (EA), AA patients were diagnosed at a significantly younger age and have worse 5-year survival compared with EA patients. The reason for this apparent racial/ethnic difference is unclear and cannot be fully explained by social stressors or access to care. We speculate that epigenetic variations could underlie the racial/ethnic differences because the pathogenesis of DLBCL is strongly linked to perturbation of epigenetic mechanisms, and population-specific cytosine modifications are a fundamental feature between human populations. In addition, greater epigenetic heterogeneity is linked with more aggressive DLBCL and poorer survival outcomes. Most prior studies of DLBCL epigenetics have assessed 5-methylcytosines (5mC) in predominantly EA patients. No studies have evaluated 5-hydroxymethylcytosines (5hmC), an emerging stable and abundant modification with distinct gene regulatory and cellular functions, due mainly to technical limitations. Most importantly, no studies have assessed concurrently 5mC and 5hmC in both EA and AA DLBCL patients. Without an effective technique to obtain the complete landscape of modified cytosines, development of targeted epigenetic approaches to improve DLBCL disparities is unlikely. The objective of this Exploratory/Developmental study is to distinguish 5hmC from 5mC at the time of DLBCL diagnosis between AA and EA patients and evaluate their clinical significance. Our hypothesis is that the 5mC/5hmC signatures in tumor tissues differ between AA and EA patients and that these differences contribute to the well-known racial/ethnic differences in DLBCL risk and outcomes. The Specific Aims are to 1) distinguish 5hmC from 5mC in EA and AA patients and evaluate population-specific 5mC/5hmC loci; and 2) determine therapeutic response-associated 5hmC/5mC loci. Specifically, we will obtain tissues for 120 patients with DLBCL (60 AA and 60 EA) from the University of Chicago Lymphoma Biobank. We will combine an innovative technique, the Tet-assisted Bisulfite Sequencing (TAB-Seq) and the new Illumina EPIC array to accurately distinguish 5hmC from 5mC. We will perform an epigenome-wide scan to assess differences in 5hmC/5mC modification levels between AA and EA patients at presentation and also integrate both modifications to predict therapeutic response, defined as relapse within 24 months after treatment. This proposal addresses a critical research question in a highly innovative, cost-efficient, and timely manner, providing important data for the first time on the complete landscape of modified cytosines for racial/ethnic differences in DLBCL. The results are expected to have positive impact because it is possible that the identified epigenetic loci/biomarkers will provide new targets for individualized preventive and therapeutic interventions to decrease mortality and burden of DLBCL. PROJECT NARRATIVE PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: African Americans were diagnosed of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), the most aggressive lymphoma in adults, at a significantly younger age (54 years vs. 65 years) and have worse 5-year survival (45% vs. 54%) compared with European American patients. This work seeks to understand the biological bases of the racial/ethnic differences by identifying complete DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation signatures at the time of diagnosis between African American and European American patients with DLBCL. Successful completion of this study will lead to a much better understanding of epigenetic factors that underlie the apparent racial/ethnic differences in DLBCL, which should accelerate the development of race-based individualized preventive and therapeutic interventions to substantially reduce the disparities observed in DLBCL among patients from different ethnic groups.",Using epigenomic subtyping to understand the racial differences in lymphoma,9455051,R21MD011439,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'African', 'African American', 'Aftercare', 'Age', 'American', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Breast', 'Cell physiology', 'Chicago', 'Clinical', 'Colon', 'Cytosine', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Endometrium', 'Enhancers', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Ethnic group', 'European', 'Exploratory/Developmental Grant', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Link', 'Liver', 'Lymphoma', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Prevention approach', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Prostate', 'Protocols documentation', 'Race', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'Specificity', 'Techniques', 'Tetanus Helper Peptide', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'biobank', 'bisulfite sequencing', 'clinically significant', 'cost efficient', 'disparity reduction', 'epigenetic marker', 'epigenetic variation', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'ethnic difference', 'health disparity', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'large cell Diffuse non-Hodgkin&apos', 's lymphoma', 'member', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'public health relevance', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial difference', 'social', 'stressor', 'survival outcome', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor initiation']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R21,2017,254325,-0.061621631513487325
"Using the electronic health record to identify children likely to suffer last-minute surgery cancellation PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Last-minute cancellation of surgery frequently leads to psychological stress and financial hardships that disproportionately affect individuals of low socioeconomic status. Moreover, cancellation leaves unutilized healthcare resources valued as high as $1 per second. Machine learning can uncover patterns in historical data to identify predictors, and captures relationships among many factors to allow assessment of risk associated with a particular set of conditions. There is a critical need to develop a model system through machine learning both to understand and to predict cancellation. The long-term goal is to develop evidence- based strategies for improved perioperative resource utilization and efficiency. The overall objective in this application is to develop and deploy an analytical model for predicting last-minute surgical cancellations. The central hypothesis is that a predictive model based on patient-specific and contextual factors will accurately determine the probability of cancellation. The hypothesis has been formulated on the basis of preliminary data showing that risk of cancellation varies substantially with respect to data extracted from the electronic health record (EHR). The rationale for the proposed research is that development of a model that can accurately predict the probability of last-minute cancellation of surgical procedures is likely to provide new opportunities for improving healthcare costs and efficiency. The hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: 1) Develop computerized models for predicting surgery cancellation; 2) Identify key predictors of last-minute cancelation of surgery from the EHR and online data resources; and 3) Establish a scalable last-minute surgery cancellation prediction system. Under the first aim, using a pre-existing database and machine- learning techniques already established as feasible in the applicants' hands, patient-specific and contextual data from two pediatric surgical sites in a large Midwest conurbation will be mined. Under the second aim, these predictive models will be interrogated to generate actionable advice. Under the third aim, the optimal model will be identified and integrated into the clinical workflow to direct cancellation prevention and mitigation strategies. The approach is innovative, in the applicants' opinion, because it represents a substantial departure from the status quo by employing machine-learning techniques on large and detailed datasets drawing from the modern EHR and publicly available contextual data. The proposed research is significant because it will both have broad translational importance in perioperative management and also elucidate the etiology of cancellation. The positive impact is expected to be in facilitating quality improvement projects and operating room management strategies to increase utilization of expensive perioperative resources. Successful completion of the proposed research is also expected to lead to more timely surgeries at lower cost for hundreds of thousands of patients, which is of vital importance at a time when the cost of healthcare is ever increasing. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because a clinically useful approach to decreasing last- minute cancellations of surgery will provide new opportunities to reduce healthcare expenditures and improve overall efficiency. The project is relevant to AHRQ's mission by making surgical care more accessible, equitable, and affordable.",Using the electronic health record to identify children likely to suffer last-minute surgery cancellation,9338140,R21HS024983,[' '],AHRQ,CINCINNATI CHILDRENS HOSP MED CTR,R21,2017,174567,-0.028907571055367457
"Practical Prognostics Project Summary/Abstract (Walker WC; Practical Prognostics) Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a very heterogeneous anatomical and physiological condition with extremely variable outcomes. For survivors of higher TBI severity grades, functional recovery is usually incomplete and protracted, and can range from total dependence to full recovery. While this offers hope for specific individuals, it also creates enormous uncertainty in prognosis. Facing this uncertain future, patients and their families desperately want and need meaningful prognostic information. Unfortunately, the extensive TBI outcomes literature has largely failed to inform clinical prognosis, and predicting long- term functional outcome remains particularly challenging. For TBI severities greater than mild, the standard clinical prognosis given is “time will tell” or “we honestly don't know.” Clearly, better clinically relevant prognostic models are needed. This study will analyze clinical data from survivors of closed TBI enrolled in multi-center database (NIDILRR TBI Model Systems; N>14,000) and develop a set of user-friendly prognostic tools for 1, 2, and 5 year functional outcomes (Glasgow Outcome Scale and employment). Models will be built using classification tree methodology that permits multiway splits, a more robust way of estimation compared to the few past TBI studies using decision tree methods. First, TBI severity will be stratified by post-traumatic amnesia duration, then select clinical variables (injury, health, and demographic) will be entered. The result will be a set of prognostic tools that will empower providers to give meaningful prognostic information to survivors and their families. It will also help set rehabilitation expectations and serve as a basis for preliminary rehabilitative treatment planning. Using the information found in the models, several post-injury modifiable conditions will also be assessed to find patient groups at risk for having poorer outcomes from these conditions and potential candidates for targeted therapy. The specific aims of our proposed study are as follows: 1. Build the decision tree prognostic models for long-term GOS and employment outcomes 2. Assess their generalizability in large, independent datasets from TBI-MS and [exploratory aim] patients  in the Transforming Research and Clinical Knowledge in TBI II database. 3. Using the classifications of outcomes from the previous method, assess how modifiable conditions  (depression, anxiety, substance misuse, emotional problems) are related to the outcomes after adjusting  for the demographic and baseline injury characteristics using the predictions from the prognostic tool. Project Narrative (Walker WC; Practical Prognostics) Individuals who survive traumatic brain injury (TBI) face a very uncertain future, with a wide variation in potential functional outcomes ranging from total dependence to full recovery. The main purpose of this study is to develop a set of prognostic tools that is tailored to the individual patient and will give better long-term forecasts on chances for returning to independent living and work. It will also assess several conditions that are common after TBI, such as depression and anxiety, and measure their impact on outcome in order to find high risk groups who may need targeted therapy.",Practical Prognostics,9324730,R21HD089097,"['Algorithms', 'Amnesia', 'Anatomy', 'Anxiety', 'Biological Models', 'Caring', 'Categories', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Trees', 'Dependence', 'Emotional', 'Employment', 'Enrollment', 'Facial Injuries', 'Family', 'Fostering', 'Future', 'Glasgow Outcome Scale', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Independent Living', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Long-Term Care', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Persistent Vegetative State', 'Physiological', 'Provider', 'Randomized', 'Recovery', 'Recovery of Function', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stratification', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Survivors', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Trees', 'Uncertainty', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Walkers', 'Work', 'base', 'care systems', 'caregiving', 'clinical translation', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'expectation', 'flexibility', 'functional outcomes', 'high risk population', 'individual patient', 'outcome forecast', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'prognostic tool', 'rehabilitation strategy', 'substance misuse', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'trait', 'treatment planning', 'user-friendly']",NICHD,VIRGINIA COMMONWEALTH UNIVERSITY,R21,2017,228750,0.00028120473210603146
"Optical Tomographic Imaging of Peripheral Arterial Disease DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to build and test a dynamic vascular optical tomographic imaging (DVOTI) system that can be used to detect and monitor peripheral arterial disease (PAD). PAD is estimated to affect approximately 8 to 12 million individuals in the United States. However, the disease is considerably under-diagnosed, since most patients are asymptomatic and no single reliable screening modality has been established. Most of the undiagnosed and untreated patients are diabetics. They commonly suffer from peripheral neuropathy and hence do not sense and report symptoms (such as pain) that are early signs of the disease. Consequently more than 60% (~65,000 per year) of all lower extremity amputations in the United States are performed in diabetic patients with PAD. With the number of diabetic patients expected to triple and reach almost 100 million by 2050, the problems related to undiagnosed PAD will only rise in the years to come  The most widely used diagnostic test for PAD, determination of the ankle-brachial index (ABI) in conjunction with pulse-volume recordings (PVR), is known to be unreliable for diabetics. And even in non- diabetics, ABI with PVR and all other existing diagnostic tests (such as Duplex Ultrasound or Magnetic resonance angiography), only provides accurate information about proximal occlusions in major arteries of the leg. However, none of these tests assess the distal perfusion of the foot where most complications, such as ulcers and gangrene, typically occur. Monitoring the success of surgical interventions, such as angioplasty or bypass surgery, suffers from the same shortcomings, as physicians are limited to the same suite of tests that are inadequate to assess the perfusion of the foot.  Dynamic VOTI promises to overcome the limitations of current diagnostic and monitoring techniques and has the potential to initiate a paradigm shift concerning how vascular diseases are assessed. In preliminary studies we have shown that DVOTI can provide three-dimensional time-series images that provide valuable information about the perfusion of the vascular bed in feet of PAD patients. The near-infrared light used in the instrument has no adverse health effects and measurements can be repeated frequently to monitor post interventional progress. Therefore, we believe that DVOTI will prove to be a safe and accurate method to diagnose and monitor PAD in non-diabetic and diabetic patients. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to build and test a novel optical imaging system that will allow for the diagnosis and monitoring of peripheral artery disease (PAD), which affects approximately 8 to 12 million individuals in the United States. The disease is considerably under-diagnosed, especially in diabetic patients, the elderly, and patients with kidney disease. The system will address an unmet need to directly assess the degree of blood perfusion in the feet, where most PAD-related complications occur, which lead to over 65,000 amputations each year.",Optical Tomographic Imaging of Peripheral Arterial Disease,9338285,R01HL115336,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Air', 'Algorithms', 'Amputation', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Anatomy', 'Angioplasty', 'Ankle', 'Arteries', 'Blood Vessels', 'Bypass', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Classification', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diffusion', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Distal', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Foot Ulcer', 'Gangrene', 'Geometry', 'Head', 'Health', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Lead', 'Leg', 'Light', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Angiography', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Peripheral Nervous System Diseases', 'Peripheral arterial disease', 'Physicians', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Preventive measure', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stroke', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment outcome', 'Ulcer', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Vascular Diseases', 'accurate diagnosis', 'blood perfusion', 'data acquisition', 'design', 'diabetic', 'diabetic patient', 'experience', 'foot', 'healthy volunteer', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging system', 'indexing', 'instrument', 'light emission', 'non-diabetic', 'novel', 'older patient', 'optical imaging', 'post intervention', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'spatiotemporal', 'success', 'theories', 'tissue phantom', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'vascular bed']",NHLBI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2017,557344,0.005962835461614206
"Mechanisms of Increased Ambulatory Blood Pressure in Intradialytic Hypertension DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This NIH Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award proposal describes a 5 year training program with the long-term goal of the candidate developing into an independent academic investigator with a research focus in hypertension in patients with chronic and end-stage kidney disease. The candidate will build on a background in clinical research developed during a comprehensive research fellowship spent studying ambulatory blood pressure and endothelial cell dysfunction in patients with intradialytic hypertension. The career development objectives are to obtain skills in designing and conducting prospective clinical research studies, learn statistical models to analyze ambulatory blood pressure in hemodialysis patients, gain experience in measuring and interpreting cardiovascular physiologic parameters including extracellular water and vascular resistance utilizing bioimpedance analysis, and participate in scholarly activities to facilitate te transition into an independent investigator. These will be applied immediately to investigating how extracellular volume and mediators of vascular resistance affect ambulatory blood pressure in patients with intradialytic hypertension and hemodialysis controls. Aim 1 will use a case control design to compare differences in extracellular water in patients with intradialytic hypertension and hemodialysis controls. Aim 2 will determine how extracellular volume, vasoconstrictor mediators of vascular resistance, and vascular resistance itself modify ambulatory blood pressure and the ambulatory blood pressure slope in these two groups. In aim 3, the candidate will gain experience in designing and conducting a randomized trial by comparing the effects of carvedilol vs. prazosin on ambulatory blood pressure, vascular resistance, and mediators of vascular resistance in patients with intradialytic hypertension. The candidate will develop these skills with the support a primary mentor, 3 co-mentors (including one translational research cardiologist and one biostatistician), and a research advisory committee with extensive experience in multiple research disciplines. The candidate and his advisors are located at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, a leading academic medical center with substantial physical and intellectual resources necessary for the career development of young investigators and the performance of cutting-edge research. The candidate will take advantage of numerous courses and research activities as a Clinical Research Scholar in the Department of Clinical Sciences that will promote the overall development of his career. Consistent with the candidate's long term career goals, the findings from this study can be broadened to studying hypertension in hemodialysis patients in general. Understanding the relationship between extracellular volume, vascular resistance, and ambulatory blood pressure will provide the opportunity to investigate how pharmacologic therapies affect each component and how this can improve cardiovascular outcomes in hemodialysis patients. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In hemodialysis patients, high blood pressure increases the risk for death and complications related to heart disease. This research studies how hemodynamic changes during dialysis are associated with high blood pressure measured throughout the entire 44 hour period between dialysis treatments. Findings from this project will direct future studies that investigate which medications or interventions will most successfully lower blood pressure and reduce adverse events in hemodialysis patients.",Mechanisms of Increased Ambulatory Blood Pressure in Intradialytic Hypertension,9303381,K23DK096007,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Adrenergic alpha-Antagonists', 'Adverse event', 'Advisory Committees', 'Affect', 'Angiotensin II', 'Award', 'Blood Pressure', 'Body Water', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cross-Over Studies', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Dietary Sodium', 'Discipline', 'End stage renal failure', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Endothelin-1', 'Fellowship', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hemodialysis', 'Hour', 'Hypertension', 'Impedance Cardiography', 'In Vitro', 'Ingestion', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medical center', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'N,N-dimethylarginine', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Physiological', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Prazosin', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Reduction', 'Sodium Chloride', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Statistical Models', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Training Programs', 'Translational Research', 'Ultrafiltration', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Vascular resistance', 'Vasoconstrictor Agents', 'Water', 'beta-adrenergic receptor', 'blood pressure reduction', 'blood pressure regulation', 'career', 'career development', 'carvedilol', 'case control', 'design', 'experience', 'extracellular', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'mortality', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'randomized trial', 'research study', 'skills', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'trial comparing', 'vasoconstriction']",NIDDK,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,K23,2017,159840,-0.025484431229520137
"Endotypes of thrombocytopenia in the critically ill Thrombocytopenia is extremely frequent in critically ill patients. However, the role of acute platelet responses in critically ill patients is not well studied, and the multifactorial etiology of thrombocytopenia in the ICU makes it difficult to understand, or understand whether or not to treat it. In several situations such as traumatic injury or sepsis, very low platelet counts have been to bleeding, thrombosis and end-organ injury. Platelets have been extensively studied as a key component of hemostasis, but a rapidly emerging concept is that platelets are also key effector cells in systemic inflammatory processes as both instigators of local and systemic inflammatory reactions and also participants in the inflammation that contributes to tissue injury. The link between platelets and inflammation is complex and bidirectional, as inflammatory ligands have been shown to regulate platelet function and activated platelets induce inflammatory responses in other cell types. The overarching theme of this proposal is to study platelet dynamics in critically ill patients, construct clinical endotypes of thrombocytopenia in this population, and to relate these endotypes to underlying mesoscale mechanisms through computational modeling. We will use a large electronic health record-based database and a tri-state trauma database as source data to construct these endotypes. We define endotype as clinical patterns defined along four dimensions: (1) baseline information (demographic, chronic disease burden, severity of illness and admitting diagnosis), (2) features of the platelet count time series (rate of decrease, nadir, etc.), (3) concurrent interventions, and (4) outcome. The computational approach will attempt to root clinical endotypes in mechanistic interpretations (or collections of alternative interpretations), contributing to focus basic science investiagtions, and to close key knowledge gaps preventing the design and use of targeted anti-platelet-inflammatory therapies in the critically ill. Computational models will be developed at different levels of complexity, with a specific attention to tie underlying mechanisms to functional assays routinely performed in thrombocytopenic patients, such as prothrombin time, activated coagulation time, and thromboelastogram. Platelets is a blood component playing a central role in coagulation and the inflammatory response. A low platelet counts is seen extremely often in acutely ill patients. This proposal will use large databases to find patterns associated with low platelets, how decreasing or low platelet counts are associated with disease and outcome, and use computer model to link the time evolution of platelet counts to mechanisms of disease.

"Air Pollution, Heart Failure and Atrial Fibrillation in MESA Abstract Kaufman: Air pollution, heart failure, and atrial fibrillation burden in MESA This proposal examines the impact of ambient air pollutants on the development, burden, and triggering of heart failure and atrial fibrillation. Air pollutants, especially particulate matter, have been associated with the incidence of cardiovascular disease, especially coronary heart disease and stroke. The incidence of coronary heart disease and stroke is declining due to prevention efforts, while development of heart failure (HF, especially with preserved ejection fraction, HFpEF) and atrial arrhythmias (especially atrial fibrillation, AF) are becoming more important components of the burden of cardiovascular disease; the role of environmental factors in these two frequently co-existing conditions diseases is largely unstudied. The Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) is an extraordinarily valuable cohort for understanding predictors and correlates of heart failure and atrial fibrillation, due to participants’ ages, extensive existing phenotyping, and planned assessment in an examination beginning in 2016. In addition, MESA has become the most carefully studied cohort in terms of exposure to ambient air pollutants. This proposed study will extend the air pollutant characterization using innovative low-cost indoor and outdoor home-based monitoring and state-of-the-art modeling approaches incorporating extensive geographic inputs. We will characterize both the relationship between long-term ambient exposures to fine particulate matter (PM2.5), oxides of nitrogen (NOX), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O3), and carbon monoxide (CO), and development of early stage heart failure and atrial arrhythmias, and the relationship between short-term exposure to air pollutants and triggering of atrial arrhythmias and AF burden. It is important to understand these relationships since: 1) Air pollutants are associated with cardiovascular mortality; 2) HF and structural disease correlates of HF are risk factors for AF; and 3) HFpEF with AF represents a group at especially high mortality risk. We will estimate long-term (annual average) and short-term (hourly and daily) concentrations of PM2.5, NOX, NO2, O3, and CO, outside and inside all MESA participants’ homes using state-of-the-art monitoring technology and spatiotemporal statistical models. We will use novel low-cost pollutant monitoring sensors at a subset of MESA participant homes and community locations. Early evidence of prevalent HF subtypes and newly emerging sub-phenotypes will be assessed using information from in-exam echocardiographic cardiac parameters, 6-minute walk test results, arterial tonometry, and biomarkers (NTproBNP, sST2, galectin-3). Ambulatory novel two-week ECG monitoring and interrogations of implanted pacemakers and cardioverter-defibrillators will allow us to assess the association between long-term air pollution exposure and AF and short-term air pollution and the triggering of atrial arrhythmias. Through this effort, we will gain unprecedented insight into the role of air pollutants in development of cardiovascular disease, with a focus on HF, especially HFpEF, and on AF. PROJECT NARRATIVE Heart failure (HF) and atrial fibrillation (AF) are increasingly important health problems as our population ages. Air pollution exposures have been linked to both HF and AF, but many questions remain about the relationships, and new technologies are available to study this. By understanding the relationship between short- and long-term air pollution exposures and the development of HF and triggering and burden of AF, we can gain critical information to help protect public health, reduce health inequality, and inform air quality regulatory policy.","Air Pollution, Heart Failure and Atrial Fibrillation in MESA",9386363,R56ES026528,"['Address', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Air', 'Air Pollutants', 'Air Pollution', 'Arrhythmia', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Biological Markers', 'Carbon Monoxide', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communities', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Data', 'Defibrillators', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'EFRAC', 'Echocardiography', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exercise stress test', 'Exposure to', 'Galectin 3', 'Geography', 'Health', 'Heart Atrium', 'Heart failure', 'Home environment', 'Hour', 'Hypertension', 'Impaired cognition', 'Implant', 'Incidence', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Location', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis', 'Myocarditis', 'Nitrogen Dioxide', 'Nitrogen Oxides', 'Obesity', 'Ozone', 'Pacemakers', 'Participant', 'Particulate Matter', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Source', 'Statistical Models', 'Stress', 'Stroke', 'Technology', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Variant', 'Walking', 'aging population', 'ambient air pollution', 'arterial tonometry', 'base', 'brachial artery', 'cardiogenesis', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'cohort', 'coronary fibrosis', 'cost', 'disability', 'environmental agent', 'fine particles', 'health inequalities', 'high risk', 'implantable device', 'innovation', 'insight', 'monitoring device', 'mortality', 'new technology', 'novel', 'pollutant', 'sensor', 'spatiotemporal', 'success']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R56,2017,600964,0.0023447851944698845
"Software Platform to Stratify Patients for Treatment Arm Randomization in Human Clinical Trials using Patient-Level Predictive Models ABSTRACT Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease of brain and spinal cord motor neurons. Since Riluzole was approved in 1995, over 30 late-phase clinical trials have failed and no additional medications have been approved for ALS. While death from ALS averages 3 to 5 years from onset of symptoms, disease progression displays wide heterogeneity. A typical year-long clinical trial can have 20 to 25% of the patients die from the disease while another similar percentage progresses very slowly if at all. Several meta-analyses of ALS trial data indicate that ALS clinical trials are prone to statistical uncertainty and would benefit from tools that increase statistical sensitivity. It is clear that current statistical tools are inadequate to address the drug development challenges posed by this disease and many other diseases that characteristically exhibit high heterogeneity in disease progression. Using the recently available ALS PRO-ACT data set, our team was recently declared a winner of the DREAM Phil Bowen ALS Prediction Prize4Life Challenge. Since the contest, we have significantly improved the algorithm, built several additional models and begun to create drug development tools. The goal of this grant is to validate our clinical trial randomization tool and develop a prototype interface for use and testing at clinical trial sites. This prototype will serve as a platform for building a suite of tools based on disease progression predictions of individual patients that will eventually be used for drug development in multiple indications. The key innovation of this work, as it applies to randomizing patients for inclusion in different arms of a clinical trial is that it stratifies patients not by a set of features at the beginning of a trial, but rather by predicted outcome at the end of the trial as if patients in the treatment arm had not received the intervention being tested. An improved trial arm balance will provide a better test of the efficacy of the intervention. This work will focus on the following Specific Aims: Aim 1: Demonstrate that, compared to traditional randomization strata, randomization strata defined by predictive algorithms significantly improve the balance of outcome features at the end of a trial period. Aim 2: Work with our clinical partner to develop a prototype platform that will enable an ALS predictive algorithm to be used by on-site investigators for randomization in future clinical trials. The randomization tool is the first in a series of planned tools based on patient level disease progression predictions. These tools will radically change the way early ALS clinical trials are enrolled, simulated and analyzed and will enable the development of similar tools, not only for other neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s, but also for multiple other diseases including diabetes, hospital-acquired infections, heart disease and cancer. NARRATIVE This work will develop a prototype to test the use of patient disease progression predictions made by machine learning models as a new way of randomizing clinical trials.

"Health Information Technology in Heart Failure Care DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Patients with heart failure experience four million hospitalizations per year in the United States. Of these hospitalizations, approximately three-quarters, or three million hospitalizations annually, are for causes other than heart failure. Patients with heart failure who are hospitalized for other causes are at high risk of post- discharge mortality possibly in part because they are less likely to receive guideline recommended care than patients who are hospitalized primarily for heart failure. Health information technology (HIT) has the potential to improve patient care by enhancing clinician compliance with evidence-based guidelines. Specifically, clinical decision support systems (CDSS) have been used to improve care for patients in hospitals, including those hospitalized for heart failure. Despite their utility, CDSSs have not been developed to apply more broadly to patients with heart failure who are hospitalized for other causes. This is clearly a gap for the millions of patients with heart failure who might experience improved outcomes if they were to receive guideline recommended care. The purpose of this study is to develop and test a CDSS for hospitalized patients who have heart failure, regardless of reason for hospitalization. The firt aim is to develop an Electronic Health Record (EHR) based algorithm to identify patients with heart failure using a variety of computational techniques including natural language processing. The second aim is to develop a CDSS to support delivery of guideline recommended care to hospitalized patients with heart failure using human computer interaction techniques. The third aim is to implement and test the effectiveness of the CDSS on processes of care for patients with heart failure who are hospitalized for other causes. The central hypothesis is that this decision support system will increase adherence to guideline recommended care, ideally improving outcomes as a result. The candidate, Saul Blecker, MD, MHS, is a general internist and clinician investigator at NYU School of Medicine. The candidate proposes a program of career development and training to achieve the following objectives: 1) develop expertise in medical informatics; 2) gain skills in human computer interaction; 3) develop expertise in implementation research. The candidate's primary mentor, Stuart Katz, MD, MS, is a seasoned mentor and researcher in heart failure. His co-mentor is Gilad Kuperman, MD, PhD, a leader in health information technology and medical informatics. Donna Shelley, MD, MPH, an expert in implementation and effectiveness research, will serve as an additional co-mentor. This mentorship team will work closely together to guide Dr. Blecker toward his research goal of leveraging HIT to improve the quality care for patients with heart failure. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Patients with heart failure are hospitalized three million times annually for other causes. These hospitalizations are associated with poor quality of care and high morbidity and mortality. We propose to leverage health information technology to improve outcomes for these patients by creating a novel system of reminders to ensure that hospitalized patients with heart failure receive guideline recommended care.",Health Information Technology in Heart Failure Care,9348609,K08HS023683,[' '],AHRQ,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,K08,2017,158609,0.02217424005533187
"Phase 2 Clinical Trial of Coralmyn for Coral Snake Bite (BB-IND 13926,01/02/09) Abstract Background: Each year, poison control centers report approximately 75 bites by coral snakes (Micrurus and Micruroides species) in the United States. More than half of these occur in Florida, with the rest concentrated in the southeastern states, westward as far as Texas. Before the introduction of anti-coral antivenom by Wyeth in 1967, approximately 10% of Micrurus bites were potentially fatal, due to ventilatory failure caused by neurotoxins active at the neuromuscular junction. Wyeth Ayerst has recently ceased production of this antivenom. In October of 2009, the last vials will expire, leaving the U.S. without a licensed supplier of antivenom. Objectives: Licensure of a new antivenom product, Coralmyn. Specific Aims: (1) Demonstrate the safety of Coralmyn in patients bitten by Micrurus coral snakes, by monitoring recipients for Type I and Type III immune reactions. (2) Demonstrate the value of plasma venom levels as a surrogate endpoint in coral snake bites by relating venom levels to severity of envenomation, before and after treatment. (3) Demonstrate that cost of treatment is different for patients presenting to hospitals with and without antivenom in stock, and use patient cost data to complete a pharmacoeconomic model comparing distribution methodologies applicable to Phase 3 or 4 study design. Research Design and Methods: This will be an open-label Phase 2 clinical trial of Coralmyn (anti-coral serum injectable solution, Instituto Bioclon, S.A. de C.V.) in male and female human patients of any age who present for emergency care following bites by coral snakes of genus Micrurus. Using grant funds, as many hospitals as economically feasible (at least 3 in Florida) will be provided with antivenom with which to enroll patients promptly in the study, using a central IRB. Patients presenting to other sites may enroll in the study either by interhospital transfer or by emergency delivery of antivenom to out-of-network hospitals. In all cases, clinical observations and plasma for venom levels will be collected at study enrollment and hourly until start of study drug. Following infusion of antivenom, clinical observations and plasma collection will be repeated at intervals until hospital discharge; and telephone follow-up will continue through day 22. Clinical and financial data will be extracted by examination of patient records including standardized data collection sheets completed prospectively by hospital staff and extracted into Case Report Forms secondarily by study staff at a central site. Plasma will be frozen and held for batch analysis every six months, using a Micrurus-specific ELISA assay. Statistical analysis of safety indicators will be conducted using Cox Proportional Hazard or survival models. Venom levels will be analyzed using a combination of logistic regression and ANOVA and compared with neurological assessments using a Generalized Linear Mixed Model. Cost data will be entered into a decision-tree model constructed in TreeAge HealthcarePro, and sensitivity analysis will be performed using MonteCarlo simulation. Project Narrative: Bites by coral snakes can be fatal if the bitten person does not receive antivenom promptly, but the only U.S. manufacturer of coral snake antivenom has stopped making it. This study will test the safety of a new antivenom in patients bitten by coral snakes, it will show whether testing for venom in the bloodstream is a useful way to determine how bad of a bite a person has, and it will show whether it is cost-effective to stock investigational antivenom in just a small number of places if there is no licensed antivenom for hospitals to buy. Results of the study will help doctors, the manufacturer, and the FDA to move forward toward getting a new antivenom for use in the U.S.","Phase 2 Clinical Trial of Coralmyn for Coral Snake Bite (BB-IND 13926,01/02/09)",9023329,R01FD003706,[' '],FDA,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R01,2017,200000,0.023353712327099548
"Validation of Survey Questions to Distinguish Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes Among Adults With Diabetes PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes are distinct clinical conditions with different etiologies, ages of onset, management strategies, risk factors, and outcomes. Currently, the data sources that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) relies upon to monitor trends in diabetes prevalence and incidence are unable to reliably distinguish between types of diabetes. Most of the large federal surveys used for diabetes surveillance have not included questions on diabetes type, and few studies have reported survey-based algorithms for identifying diabetes type. None have compared survey-based identification algorithms with a gold standard case ascertainment in order to validate survey-based assignment of diabetes type. Methods for distinguishing between diabetes types in electronic health records (EHR) data have been tested for children and adults, but additional validation work is needed. Our approach to improving diabetes surveillance in these two areas is based on an integrated study design whereby survey data for diabetes patients are linked with data from their EHR and a gold standard case ascertainment derived from chart review. We will select a diverse sample of diabetes patients that is designed and powered to assess algorithm validity for subpopulations defined by age, sex, and race/ethnicity. We will use rigorous questionnaire development methods to build on items used in previous surveys, cognitively test the new survey module to optimize wording and question order, field the survey using data collection methods similar to established CDC surveys, and analyze the responses relative to a gold standard classification of diabetes type. In addition, we will develop and validate against the gold standard EHR-based algorithms, including a modeling approach that produces a parsimonious rule-based algorithm for determining diabetes type based on the most important clinical variables, and a machine learning approach that uses the gold standard dataset as a starting point to identify implicit patterns that distinguish T1DM and T2DM. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed project will result in a set of validated survey questions for distinguishing Type 1 diabetes (T1DM) and Type 2 diabetes (T2DM). It will also produce validated survey-based and EHR-based algorithms for identifying diabetes type. T1DM and T2DM are distinct clinical conditions with different etiologies, ages of onset, management strategies, risk factors, and outcomes. Currently, the data sources that CDC relies upon to monitor trends in diabetes prevalence and incidence are unable to reliably distinguish between types of diabetes. It is important for surveillance systems to be able to distinguish diabetes type to support type-specific analyses of morbidity, mortality, medical care costs, and health-related quality of life. Improved surveillance data by diabetes type can help guide and monitor federal, state, and local diabetes programs, enrich diabetes research, and support people with diabetes.",Validation of Survey Questions to Distinguish Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes Among Adults With Diabetes,9438672,U01DP006327,[' '],NCCDPHP,"WESTAT, INC.",U01,2017,498977,-0.02116101778126373
"Multi-level modeling to inform interventions for control of multidrug-resistant organisms within healthcare networks Project Summary/Abstract Multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs), particularly carbapenem-resistant organisms (CROs), are a major cause of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs). Though studies have found multiple interventions addressing MDRO colonization and transmission to be effective at reducing HAIs, implementation has lagged due to questions regarding the most efficacious combination of interventions. As healthcare facilities (e.g., hospitals, long-term care facilities, or outpatient surgical centers and clinics) are part of an interconnected healthcare network, evaluation of an intervention’s impact on transmission and infection must consider the dynamics across the healthcare system. To address remaining knowledge gaps regarding the most effective combinations of intervention strategies, we will build a multi-level model that spans from individual patients to regionally interconnected healthcare facilities. The resulting framework will provide hospital administrators and infection control experts with tools for quantifying individual patient risk factors for colonization and infection and for comparing the potential effectiveness of interventions to control HAIs. The aims of the project are: (1) to develop models to estimate the underlying prevalence and incidence of CROs and predict which patients are at highest risk for colonization and infection with CROs using clinical samples collected during the normal course of care; (2) to utilize hospital-level models to quantify the combinatorial relationship between, and marginal impact of, additional interventions to reduce HAIs; and (3) to build a regional model of a healthcare system to examine the effectiveness of interventions across institutions. Models will start with the patient at the center, utilizing the rich covariate data stored in electronic medical records to develop prediction models based on advanced machine learning. These prediction models will be translatable tools that can be directly incorporated into clinical care to assist clinicians in preventing HAIs. In addition, they will form the foundation of hospital-level models that will allow for detailed examinations of the effectiveness of different combinations of interventions. Hospital-level models will then be embedded in a network of healthcare facilities that accounts for the differing incentives faced by geographically dispersed facilities with variable demographic populations. These models will directly inform CDC guidelines about MDRO prevention and aid clinicians in reducing the risk of HAIs. Project Narrative The models developed through this proposal will improve understanding of how biological factors associated with the transmission of multidrug-resistant organisms (MDRO) impact interventions to reduce hospital-associated infections (HAIs). This will aid predictions of patients’ risk for colonization and infection, as well as improve understanding of how interventions can most effectively be combined to reduce the likelihood that patients will suffer from these high-consequence pathogens.",Multi-level modeling to inform interventions for control of multidrug-resistant organisms within healthcare networks,9420097,U01CK000536,[' '],NCEZID,"CENTER/ DISEASE DYNAMICS, ECONOM/POLICY",U01,2017,649361,-0.011083845331110502
"VERITY: Value and Evidence in Rheumatology using bioInformaTics, and advanced analYtics PROJECT ABSTRACT  Pediatric and adult rheumatic and musculoskeletal (MSK) diseases challenge the clinical researcher: they affect the population across the lifespan, impact a broad range of patient-centered outcomes, are rarely cured, and often have multiple possible treatment strategies. If properly addressed, these factors present tremendous opportunities for improving patient care and outcomes of patients. The overarching goal of the Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH) CCCR is to facilitate advancements in the methodologic sciences supporting clinical research within the NIAMS pediatric and adult rheumatic and musculoskeletal (MSK) disease missions.  VERITY is organized around central scientific themes that can be applied to multiple rheumatic and MSK diseases. The Cores address the following cross-cutting areas: 1) including patients in clinical trial design, outcome selection, result interpretation, and dissemination; 2) integrating behavioral economics to enhance benefits of known interventions, i.e., adherence to medications, engagement in physical activity and weight loss; 3) extracting maximum information content from big data; 4) using smart technologies (mobile health) to advance clinical research; and 5) disseminating knowledge and mentoring of local and national rheumatic and MSK disease clinical researchers through distributed learning models. These scientific themes will be approached through several Cores described in the following Specific Aims. 1. To strategically direct, supervise, and provide financial accountability to VERITY and to train a broad group of local and national investigators for patient-oriented clinical research in pediatric and adult rheumatic and MSK diseases. (Administrative Core) 2. To develop and implement state of the art methods in innovative trials and longitudinal comparative effectiveness studies for rheumatic and MSK disease research. (Methodology Core) 3. To support bioinformatic approaches to enhance utilization of large databases for phenotyping relevant patients, and implementing biomarker, electronic medical record, and comparative effectiveness analyses.

"Human nasal epithelial organoids as a non-invasive, personalized model for predicting effectiveness of CFTR modulators in cystic fibrosis patients Project Summary  The discovery of the single gene (CFTR) responsible for cystic fibrosis (CF) has been transformational in focusing treatment efforts on the development and approval of drugs that restore the function of the CFTR protein. Excellent clinical response for CF patients with “gating” mutations is observed following treatment with the CFTR modulator drug ivacaftor (VX-770); however, for the remaining ~95% of patients, no effective treatments exist. More than two thousand different CFTR mutations, combined with other genetic and environmental factors, result in significant variability in response among individuals to a single therapy. To improve the clinical outcome for all CF patients, it is important that patient-specific in vivo features of CF are faithfully reproduced in vitro for predictive screening assays. To meet that need we have developed a novel organoid-based screening platform, Sphera™, using cells derived from a patient’s nasal epithelia. Sphera couples patient-specific organoids with an integrated assessment of CFTR function, including organoid morphology and viscoelastic characterization of luminal mucus using our proprietary microrheology analytics. In Phase I we developed the Sphera platform and validated its utility in measuring organoid response to CFTR rescue. During Phase II we will define the efficiency and sensitivity of the Sphera platform and scale it for high throughput use in a cross-sectional clinical study. A multi-disciplinary, industry-academic partnership with expertise in all areas essential to the successful accomplishment of these aims has been assembled, including investigators with expertise in microfluidics, advanced mathematics, CF lung physiology, and clinical studies. Sphera will be commercialized as a full service platform marketed to clinical and drug development clients. The primary endpoint of this work is to develop a novel tool with dual utility in both CFTR modulator development and precision treatment for individuals with CF. Project Narrative  Individuals with cystic fibrosis face two realities: the extreme diversity in known CFTR mutations and the unpredictable response of CFTR modulator therapies in individual patients.

"Point of Care Device for Reducing Overuse of Antibiotics in Potentially Septic Hospital Populations Principal Investigator/Program Director (Last, first, middle): Reddy, Jr., Bobby Project Summary: At least 30 percent of antibiotics prescribed in the United States are unnecessary. This has obviously catastrophic implications for the future of humanity. Sepsis is the third leading cause of death in the United States with an annual toll of over 230,000 people. Survival rates have been reported to drop by 7.6% per hour appropriate treatment is delayed. This drastic drop in survival rate leads to vast over prescription of antibiotics in hospital settings. A dominant factor underlying this behavior is the lack of rapid methods to determine whether or not an individualized patient would actually benefit from the intended course of antibiotics. Furthermore, if a course of antibiotics are chosen to be administered, it is not clear how to optimize the de-escalation of the antibiotics. This results in a blanket antibiotics approach, where nearly every patient with even a possibility of sepsis is dosed with broad spectrum antibiotics and stays on these antibiotics for far longer than is necessary. Procalcitonin (PCT) has shown much promise in recent years as a potential discriminator between bacterial and viral infections. Various assays for PCT from company such as bioMerieux and Roche have received 510k clearance from the FDA for use by physicians in optimizing the administration of antibiotics. In addition, Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) criteria are often used as rough indications of a global inflammatory problem in patients. Of these four criteria (WBC count, respiratory rate, heart rate, and temperature), only the WBC count is not currently possible to measure outside of clinical labs. A handheld device that could combine both a WBC count and a plasma PCT measurement from a drop of blood in 10 minutes could revolutionize the administration of antibiotics in acute care settings. In particular, obtaining the first measurement of both PCT and WBC as early as possible before arrival to Emergency Departments is critical. Ideally this would be obtained in the most common “funnels” into the acute care EDs, including outpatient, ambulatory, and nursing home settings. Several studies have shown that the temporal trends of these two parameters can be very powerful for further adjustments to the administered antibiotics. For example, Roche’s Elecsys BRAHMS PCT system recommends that a PCT measurement is performed at both day 0 and day 4, and that the difference should be used to inform optimization of the antibiotics. ElectroCyt, Inc. is an early stage company that has raised $1.7M in investment and has licensed its core technology from University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. The company aims to develop a hand-held electronic reader with an accompanying pipeline of cartridge designs to measure a variety of cell counts, cell surface receptor expression levels, and plasma protein expression levels. Our first cartridge will measure a total WBC count and PCT from a drop of blood. The company has signed an exciting joint development agreement (JDA) with Foxconn Interconnect Technologies (FIT) to co-develop the low cost prototype cartridge and hand- held readers (letter attached). In addition, ElectroCyt has also established two clinical partnerships with hospitals to perform clinical studies (letters attached) to build a unique combined biomarker/EMR dataset. This dataset, when combined with machine learning for predictive analytics and the patient’s latest biomarker readings, will provide real time feedback to physicians as to a patient’s overall “immune state score”. This score could be used as individualized evaluation of how well a patient is recovering or not recovering from a septic event, which can help physicians adjust course of antibiotics with real time feedback. In this project, we will adapt our core technology, which has focused on cell measurements, to enable plasma protein measurements as well. In addition, we will continue to perform clinical studies to build the unique combined biomarker + EMR dataset at three clinical sites, University of Chicago Main Hospital, Carle Foundation Hospital and Order of Saint Francis (OSF) hospital.

"Adaptive Prediction of Blood Glucose Levels using Wearable Physiological Sensors ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Type 1 diabetes is a chronic disease, which presently cannot be prevented or cured. It is treated with insulin therapy and actively managed through blood glucose (BG) control. To avoid serious diabetic complications, patients must monitor their BG levels throughout the day, striving to avoid both hyperglycemia (high BG levels) and hypoglycemia (low BG levels). While continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) sensors and insulin pumps with ﬂexible dosing may aid in achieving good BG control, management of diabetes is still difﬁcult and laborious for patients and physicians. It is complicated by a wide variability among individual patients in terms of physiological responses to treatment as well as to life events such as stress, exercise, or changes in schedule and sleep. New portable sensing technologies have been recently developed for providing almost continuous measure- ments of an array of physiological parameters that include heart rate, skin conductance, skin temperature, and properties of body movements such as acceleration. The main research objective of this project is to leverage data acquired from wearable physiological sensors to build accurate, personalized blood glucose level prediction models for diabetes management. Predicting BG control problems before they occur would give patients time to intervene and prevent these problems. This would enhance patient safety and contribute to improved overall control, with its concomitant reduction in costly complications. Blood glucose level prediction is  very complex problem. Recent advances in unsupervised feature learning and deep learning have made it possible to learn complex models from data using simple algorithms. Inspired by these signiﬁcant developments in Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI), we propose to employ unsupervised feature learn- ing and deep learning techniques in order to build an architecture for modeling blood glucose behavior that can seamlessly incorporate data coming from any number of physiological sensors. A recurrent neu- ral network (RNN) will be trained to capture dependencies among the input physiological parameters that are relevant to BG prediction. To account for individual patient differences, a predictive model will be developed for each patient by training on the features discovered by the RNN. The primary impact of this work would be to improve the overall health and quality of life for the 1.25 million Americans with type 1 diabetes. Accurate prediction models would enable practical applications ranging from alerts of impending problems to decision support tools for evaluating the effects of different food or lifestyle choice. Additionally, the wealth of patient and sensor data collected for this work will lead to the creatin of de-identiﬁed datasets to be used by the research community in evaluating approaches to blood glucose prediction. The new approaches developed for this complex domain may aid in the development of time series forecasting models for a broad array of sensor-enabled applications in other health and wellness domains.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: To aid in diabetes management, machine learning models will be built to predict future blood glucose levels based on wearable sensor data from commercially available fitness bands in addition to blood glucose, insulin and meal data. These models could help the over one million Americans with type 1 diabetes to anticipate and prevent blood glucose control problems before they occur. This would enhance patient safety and contribute to improved overall blood glucose control, with its associated reduction in costly complications.        ",Adaptive Prediction of Blood Glucose Levels using Wearable Physiological Sensors,9112492,R21EB022356,"['Acceleration', 'Accounting', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Amputation', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Blindness', 'Blood Glucose', 'Carbohydrates', 'Chronic Disease', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Dependency', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Dose', 'Engineering', 'Equation', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Expenditure', 'Food', 'Future', 'Galvanic Skin Response', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Heart Rate', 'Hyperglycemia', 'Hypoglycemia', 'Individual', 'Insulin', 'Insulin Infusion Systems', 'Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Intelligence', 'Intervention', 'Kidney Failure', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Life Style', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Patient Education', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Property', 'Quality of life', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Schedule', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin Temperature', 'Sleep', 'Speed', 'Stress', 'Stroke', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'blood glucose regulation', 'collected works', 'cost', 'data modeling', 'diabetes management', 'direct application', 'fitness', 'glucose monitor', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel strategies', 'patient safety', 'practical application', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'sensor', 'speech recognition', 'support tools', 'technology development', 'treatment choice', 'treatment response']",NIBIB,OHIO UNIVERSITY ATHENS,R21,2016,225750,0.011932684234495006
"Machine learning of physiological variables to predict diagnose and treat cardiorespiratory instability Project Summary/Abstract: If one could accurately predict who, when and why patients develop cardiorespiratory instability (CRI), then effective preemptive treatments could be given to improve outcome and better use care resources. However, CRI is often unrecognized until it is well established and patients are more refractory to treatment, or progressed to organ injury. We have shown that an integrated monitoring system alert obtained from continuous noninvasively acquired monitoring parameters and coupled to a care algorithm improved step-down unit (SDU) patient outcomes. We also showed that advanced HR variability analysis (sample entropy) identified SDU patients at CRI risk within 2 minutes, and if monitored for 5 minutes differentiated between patients who would develop CRI or remain stable over the next 48 hours. We also applied machine learning (ML) modeling to our clinically-relevant porcine model of hemorrhagic shock to characterize responses to hypovolemia, hemorrhage, and resuscitation, predict which animals would or would not collapse during hypovolemia, and identify occult bleeding 5 minutes earlier than with traditional monitoring. We now propose to apply our work to vulnerable and invasively monitored ICU patients. We will develop multivariable models through ML data-driven classification techniques such as regression, Fourier and principal component analysis, artificial neural networks, random forest classification, etc. as well as more novel approaches (temporal rule learning developed by our team; Bayesian Aggregation) to predict CRI in ICU patients. We will first use our existing annotated high fidelity waveform MIMIC II clinical data set (4200 patients) to develop predictive models and differential signatures for various CRI drivers. We will also use our high-density data collection and processing platform (Bernoulli) to prospectively collect data from ICUs in three institutions: Univ. Pittsburgh (PITT), Univ. California (UC) Irvine and UC San Diego (initial algorithm development conducted at PITT and validated in the UC systems). We will identify the number and type of independent measures, sampling frequency, and lead time necessary to create robust algorithms to: 1) predict impending CRI, 2) select the most effective treatments, 3) monitor treatment response, and 4) determine when treatment has restored physiologic stability and can be stopped. We will also determine the smallest number and types of parameters coupled to the longest CRI lead time to achieve the above four targets with the best sensitivity and specificity (a concept we call Monitoring Parsimony).We will simultaneously iteratively design and test a graphical user interface (GUI) and clinical decision support system (CDSS) driven by these parsimoniously derived predictive smart alerts and functional hemodynamic monitoring treatment approaches in two human simulation environments (PITT & UC Irvine).We envision a basic monitoring surveillance that identifies patients most likely to develop CRI to apply focused clinician attention and targeted treatments to deliver highly personalized medical care. Public Health Narrative If one could accurately predict who, when and why patients develop shock then effective preemptive treatments could be given to improve outcome and more effectively use healthcare resources. But signs of shock often occur late once organ injury is already present. The purpose of this study is to first develop multivariable models through data-driven classification techniques to parsimoniously predict cardiovascular insufficiency, etiology and response to treatment. We will do this first in our existing MIMIC II clinical data sets of 4200 ICU patients as to timing and types of instability. Then we will prospectively collect real time high- density data on patients admitted to our trauma intensive care units of University of Pittsburgh, UC Irvine and UC San Diego. We will create and test in simulators of ICU care bedside user interfaces to drive recognition and treatment algorithms based on these models in all three medical centers.",Machine learning of physiological variables to predict diagnose and treat cardiorespiratory instability,9029396,R01GM117622,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Attention', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'California', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Entropy', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Family suidae', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hemorrhagic Shock', 'Homeostasis', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Hypovolemia', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Institution', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Normal Range', 'Organ', 'Organ failure', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physiologic Monitoring', 'Physiological', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Recommendation', 'Refractory', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sepsis', 'Shock', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Stream', 'Stress', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'Triage', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Weaning', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinically relevant', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'database structure', 'density', 'design', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'early onset', 'effective therapy', 'fitness', 'forest', 'graphical user interface', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'insight', 'iterative design', 'mortality', 'novel strategies', 'patient population', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'response', 'simulation', 'support tools', 'treatment response']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2016,662537,0.025043752917854736
"Machine learning with generative mixture models for fetal monitoring DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): For many years, there has been a concerted effort to automate the analysis of fetal heart rate (FHR) rhythms. However, despite significant advances in biomedical signal analysis, there has not been any significant improvement in automated decision support systems. FHR monitoring is now ubiquitous throughout delivery rooms, especially using the non-invasive Doppler monitor, but also using the fetal scalp electrode. Physician classification of fetal heart rate patterns is known to be a non-trivial problem because of significant inter and intra-observer variability of diagnosis. This has led to a marked increase in the number of caesarean deliveries, thereby increasing risk to the fetus and mother in many cases. This has further motivated the machine learning community to automate the classification procedure in the interest of accuracy and consistency as well as robustness with respect to noise. Usual approaches to this involve some type of supervised classification procedure, where the algorithm output on training data is compared with a ""gold-standard"" physician classification, followed by testing and validation on new datasets. However, since physician classification can be unreliable in the presence of the aforementioned diagnostic variability, as well as significant tracing noise, we propose the use of unsupervised algorithms to cluster FHR data records into clinically useful categories. We use nonparametric Bayes theory and Markov-time-dependence models for the evolution of feature sequences to propose methods that will achieve improved accuracy. The methods involve extraction of feature sequences from FHR time series data, which are modeled as samples from finite or infinite Dirichlet mixture models. We then use Gibbs sampling to obtain the cluster probabilities for each dataset. Clustering outcomes are compared against direct physician diagnosis and our current results are seen to be in broad agreement with them, while still giving new information on the character of different sub-groups of FHR records. With the proposed research, further gains in classification performance will be made. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Fetal heart rate monitoring is now commonly used during childbirth and, at present, physicians read and interpret these data to classify fetal heart rate patterns and make sure that the baby is not in distress during the course of labor. However, there is great variability in how individual doctors interpret the tracings and this has led increases in the number of caesarean deliveries, thereby potentially increasing risk to both mothers and babies. Thus there has been a concerted effort from the machine learning community to develop an accurate automatic reading and classification procedure so that correct interpretation of fetal heart rates during labor is more diagnostic and consistent.",Machine learning with generative mixture models for fetal monitoring,9018050,R21HD080025,"['Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Apgar Score', 'Bayesian Method', 'Behavioral', 'Birth', 'Categories', 'Cesarean section', 'Childbirth', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Delivery Rooms', 'Dependence', 'Dependency', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Distress', 'Electrodes', 'Evolution', 'Feedback', 'Fetal Heart', 'Fetal Heart Rate', 'Fetal Monitoring', 'Fetus', 'Freedom', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Individual', 'Intraobserver Variability', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Litigation', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Mothers', 'Motivation', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Reading', 'Records', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scalp structure', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Umbilical cord structure', 'Uncertainty', 'Uterine Contraction', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'cost', 'fetal', 'heart rate monitor', 'improved', 'interest', 'learning community', 'pressure', 'stem', 'theories', 'vector']",NICHD,STATE UNIVERSITY NEW YORK STONY BROOK,R21,2016,193120,0.001070978190098684
"Reliable Seizure Prediction Using Physiological Signals and Machine Learning ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): For most individuals living with epilepsy, seizures are relatively infrequent events occupying a small fraction of their life. Despite spending as little a 0.01% of their lives having seizures (typically only minutes per month), people with epilepsy take anti-epileptic drugs (AED) daily, suffer AED related side effects, and spend their lives dreading when the next seizure will strike. The apparent randomness of seizures is associated with significant psychological consequences. In addition, despite daily AED approximately 1/3 of patients continue to have seizures. We hypothesize that epilepsy can be more effectively treated, both the seizures and their psychological impact, by providing patients with real-time seizure forecasting. Periods of low seizure probability would not require AEDs, or at least lower doses of AEDs, thus reducing AED exposure and their side effects. Periods of high seizure probability may respond to acute AED and patients could alter their activities to avoid injury. Patients would be empowered to manage their medications and life activities using reliable seizure forecasts. In this grant we investigate the hypothesis that seizures are predictable events, and pursue accurate, clinically relevant seizure forecasting using recent advances in support vector machines (SVM), data-analytic models, and Universum-SVM applied to continuous intracranial EEG (iEEG) in focal canine epilepsy. This is an initial step in establishin a new treatment paradigm for focal epilepsy, whereby the probability of seizure occurrence is continuously tracked for patient warning and intelligent responsive therapies. Naturally occurring focal canine epilepsy is an excellent model for investigation of seizure forecasting because of the clinical and electrophsyiological similarity to focal human epilepsy. This study provides a unique opportunity to study seizure forecasting in naturally occurring canine epilepsy under uniform conditions (the same environment). Importantly, dogs are large enough to accommodate devices designed for human use. The hypotheses driving this proposal are that focal seizures are not random events and there are brain states associated with low or high probability of seizure occurrence, and that these states can be reliably classified using machine learning approaches (SVM & Universum-SVM) that combine features from iEEG, behavioral state tracking, and electrocardiogram (ECG) heart rate variability.

"Deep Learning and Streaming Analytics for Prediction of Adverse Events in the ICU ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)     Critical care medicine in the United States costs over 80 billion dollars annually. Over the past decade the rate of intensive care unit (ICU) use has been increasing, with a recent study reporting almost one in three Medicare beneficiaries experiencing an ICU visit during the last month of their lives. Every year, sepsis, a medical condition characterized by whole-body inflammation, strikes between 800,000 and 3.1 million Americans, killing approximately one in four patients affected. There is currently no definite treatment for sepsis in spite of many clinicl trials. However, early detection of sepsis and timely initiation of interventions are widely considered as important determinants of patient survival. However, basic care tasks (such as microbiological sampling and antibiotic delivery within 1 h, fluid resuscitation, and risk stratification using serum lactate or alternative), which are known to benefit most patients, are not performed in a timely manner. Previous literature suggests that high-resolution vital signs (such as heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, etc.), and other sequential measurements within the electronic medical records (EMRs), can be dynamically integrated using Machine Learning techniques to help with early detection of sepsis. With the ubiquity of inexpensive high- capacity storage and high-bandwidth streaming technology it is now possible to monitor patients' vital signs continuously (for instance, the research application developed by the Emory hospital ICU uses IBM's streaming analytics platform to transmit over 100,000 real-time data points per 100 beds, per second). Despite this continuous feed of data, commonly used acuity scores, such as APACHE and SAPS, are based on snapshot values of these vital signs (typically the worst values during a 24 hours period). This limitation is partially due to unavailability of computationally efficient and robust algorithms capable of finding predictive features in multivariate, nonlinear and nonstationary sequential data, which may reveal inter- organ communication and disintegration of causal couplings with critical illnesses such as sepsis.  We have recently developed a novel Machine Learning algorithm to discover automatically a collection of predictive multivariate dynamical patterns in a database of patient time-series, which can be used to classify patients or to monitor progression of disease in a given patient. The primary goal of this proposal is to apply our method to assess the predictive power of high- resolution multivariate time-series of vital signs and sequentially recorded EMR data in the ICU for early detection of sepsis and risk stratification of septic patient. To accomplish this, we aim to benchmark our technique on a large ICU cohort (the MIMIC II database with over 60,000 patients), as well as simulated data from a multiscale mathematical model of influence of inflammatory mediators on dynamical patterns of vital signs. Next, the technique will be externally validated on two separate ICU sepsis cohorts (the Emory Sepsis dataset and the Mayo Clinic Metric dataset). Finally, we will provide a real-time implementation of the proposed algorithm in an streaming environment (such as the IBM streaming analytics), in order to address the Big Data challenge of harnessing real-time, streaming sensor data from bedside monitors within the ICU, while enabling advanced pattern recognition and real-time forecasting. Ultimately we believe these methods can change the current standard of care through faster recognition and initiation of basic care, as well as guiding interventional strategis based on severity of illness and mechanisms underlying physiological deterioration. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    The proposed project is making use of computers to analyze data from sickest patients in the intensive care unit (ICU).

"Pattern Classification Using Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Traumatic Brain Injury PROJECT SUMMARY Mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI) affects ~1.5 million persons annually in the United States with fifteen to 30% of patients suffering long-term disability after injury. We remain in the early phase of understanding this disease and one of the greatest barriers to studying the disease and developing appropriate therapy is the difficulty in diagnosis and outcome prediction. Generally, the diagnosis of MTBI relies on using the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), a 15-point gross measurement of eye-opening, motor and verbal response. The National Institute for Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) workshop in 2014 indicated that use of GCS score as a single classifier for TBI is insufficient and proposed that neuroimaging play a larger role towards the development of objective criteria for diagnosis and outcome prediction. We have specific experience in studying novel MRI techniques that show much promise in evaluating MTBI patients. The goal of the current proposal is to bring these novel MRI techniques to clinical use. We propose to combine information from objective MR imaging features with clinical information to learn the patterns that can best distinguish patients from controls and predict long-term outcome using machine learning. We will validate our tool using a separate subject cohort. Such a tool would be an extremely powerful clinical tool to identify at-risk patients for early intervention. Additionally, this research will identify the most clinically relevant MR metrics, thereby pointing the way to novel therapeutic pathways. PROJECT NARRATIVE Mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI) is a major public health problem for which there is a lack of evidence-based, quantitative and objective criteria for diagnosis and outcome prediction. The goal of the proposed research is to incorporate recent advances in MR imaging of MTBI with clinically important information using advanced machine-learning computational algorithms to identify the most clinically relevant features, thus allowing us to distinguish patients from controls and to predict clinical outcome. If successful, this research will provide an objective tool for classification and outcome prediction in MTBI and will be a critical advance in both the clinical and research arenas in the study of traumatic brain injury.",Pattern Classification Using Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Traumatic Brain Injury,9180408,R21NS090349,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Common Data Element', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Corpus Callosum', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Educational workshop', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Eye', 'FarGo', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Glasgow Coma Scale', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Image', 'Imaging problem', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Iron', 'Learning', 'Linear Regressions', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Neurons', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Non-linear Models', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regression Analysis', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Societies', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Trauma', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'axon injury', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'disability', 'drug development', 'evidence base', 'executive function', 'experience', 'improved', 'indexing', 'magnetic field', 'mild traumatic brain injury', 'mood regulation', 'neural patterning', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychological', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'scaffold', 'tool', 'white matter', 'white matter injury']",NINDS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R21,2016,196059,-0.013216180566524934
"A Clinical 3D Movement Analysis System for Assessing Lower Extremity Injury Risk and Recovery in Athletes ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The mission of Bioniks is to develop and commercialize accurate, low-cost movement analysis systems for clinicians, ergonomists, athletic trainers, and other professionals interested in quantifying human movement. Our initial focus is on developing computer enhancements for inexpensive 3D cameras like the Microsoft Kinect. These enhancements surpass the accuracy limitations of state-of-the-art ""skeleton"" by combining established marker-based measurement protocols and advanced computer vision techniques, to generate clinical-quality 3D human motion data.  Difficult to obtain outside a laboratory setting, these kinematic data are inherently valuable for several NIH priority areas: 1) assessment of function and fatigability in older adults (NIA); 2) measurement of gait and posture biomechanics to monitor patients (NIAMS); 3) tools to enable mobile health and telemedicine by providing a means to monitor, evaluate, manage, track, train, and treat patients in underserved community settings and rural and remote locations (NIMHD, NINR); 4) tools for health informatics for clinical and translational research (NCATS); and 5) measurement of occupational health stressors in the workplace (NIOSH).  For this Phase I STTR, Bioniks' goal is to provide therapists with an affordable and easy-to-use 3D movement analysis system that quantifies an athlete's risk for, or recovery from, lower extremity injury. Our first aim is to show that the movement analysis system will not only be accurate and reliable (Aim 1), but also be practical and easy to use (Aim 2). We hypothesize that: 1) our kinematic measurements will agree with those from a gold-standard laboratory-based motion capture system (Vicon); and 2) that therapists will judge our system to be more useful and usable than current clinical tools, including traditional 2D video analyses. To test these hypotheses, we will conduct a validation study with healthy volunteers at the UCSF Human Performance Center as well as a pilot usability study with therapists and healthy volunteers and patients with history of ACL injury at the SF Sports and Spine Physical Therapy Clinic.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Because of the high cost and perceived ineffectiveness of traditional musculoskeletal care, there is growing pressure on health care professionals to provide more cost- effective treatments as well as to validate treatment effectiveness. Bioniks has the opportunity to be the first clinic-based tool that quantitatively and objectively assesses musculoskeletal function of patients over the course of treatment and rehabilitation. This STTR proposal focuses on quantification of an athlete's risk for, and recovery from, lower extremity injury.                ",A Clinical 3D Movement Analysis System for Assessing Lower Extremity Injury Risk and Recovery in Athletes,9046038,R41AR068202,"['Adoption', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Ankle', 'Anterior Cruciate Ligament', 'Area', 'Athletic', 'Biomechanics', 'Boxing', 'Caring', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Drops', 'Dyskinetic syndrome', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Feedback', 'Functional disorder', 'Gait', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health Professional', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Joints', 'Kinetics', 'Knee', 'Knee Injuries', 'Laboratories', 'Leg', 'Length', 'Limb structure', 'Location', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Musculoskeletal', 'National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases', 'Nature', 'Occupational Health', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physical therapy', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Posture', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Publishing', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Rural', 'Series', 'Site', 'Skeleton', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Sports', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telemedicine', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Vertebral column', 'Video Games', 'Workplace', 'anterior cruciate ligament rupture', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'clinical research site', 'commercialization', 'community setting', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'design', 'healthy volunteer', 'interest', 'kinematics', 'ligament injury', 'mHealth', 'meetings', 'modifiable risk', 'movement analysis', 'neuromuscular function', 'physical therapist', 'pressure', 'public health relevance', 'research clinical testing', 'stressor', 'tool', 'usability', 'validation studies', 'volunteer']",NIAMS,"BIONIKS, INC.",R41,2016,215600,-0.0189989958526432
"Identification of Patients with Low Life Expectancy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is increasingly recognized that optimal treatment is not the same for every patient - it depends on the individual patient's circumstances. One important factor that determines the optimal clinical management is the patient's life expectancy, which determines the temporal horizon within which medical decisions have to operate. For example, while adding an extra diabetes medication may save a 40-year-old individual from going blind or developing kidney failure 20 years later, it will not bring any benefits to an 80-yer old with a metastatic malignancy who is expected to live only a few months.  Consequently, it is critical that when we measure quality of care, suggest treatment options to clinicians through clinical decision support or compare different treatment strategies, we take into account the patient's life expectancy. However, currently there are no methods available that can do this with sufficient accuracy.  Most commonly used techniques to assess a patient's mortality risk draw primarily on administrative data and other structured data fields in electronic medical records. This approach leaves out a large amount of information that is only available in narrative documents such as provider notes, radiology reports, etc. In this project we propose to test the hypothesis that application of two novel technologies - artificial intelligence technique Dynamic Logic and natural language processing (NLP) - could leverage the information in narrative electronic documents to significantly improve the accuracy of identification of patients with low life expectancy.  Dynamic Logic allows to circumvent the challenge of combinatorial complexity that limits the number of variables and their combinations that can be considered as predictors of an outcome by most currently used analytical methods. Dynamic Logic makes use of a limited number of iterative approximations to reduce the complexity of a problem with multiple predictor variables from exponential to approximately linear. Utilization of Dynamic Logic will allow us to greatly increase the richness of the models for identification of patients with low life expectancy and ultimately improve their accuracy.  Information such as the patient's functional status that is usually only found in narrative documents may be critical to improving accuracy of identifying frail patients at high mortality risk. Modern NLP techniques can effectively identify key concepts in medical text but until now analytical methods allowed consideration of only a few of pre-selected concepts in prediction models. Combining NLP with Dynamic Logic will allow us to greatly expand the number of concepts from narrative text that could be included in the life expectancy prediction model, likely leading to a considerable improvement in accuracy.  In the proposed translational multidisciplinary project our team that will include experts on artificial intelligence, natural language processing, analysis of data in electronic medical records, and geriatrics will test whether a combination of Dynamic Logic and NLP improves identification of patients at high risk of death. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Identification of patients with limited life expectancy is important for accurate measurement of quality of care delivered by clinicians, clinical decision support in electronic medical records and research that compares different treatment options for patients. However, currently available methods suffer from low accuracy or use information that is not widely available. In this project we propose to combine two advanced computational technologies - artificial intelligence technique Dynamic Logic and natural language processing - to improve accuracy of identification of patients with low life expectancy.",Identification of Patients with Low Life Expectancy,9115065,R01HS024090,[' '],AHRQ,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2016,227891,-0.01872139474717315
"Impact of Crouch Gait and Surgical Treatment on Knee Mechanics and Function DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Children with Cerebral Palsy (CP) often exhibit crouch gait, which is characterized by excessive knee flexion during stance. This form of walking is extremely fatiguing and tends to progress until eventually walking ability ceases. A newly revived surgical procedure, distal femoral extension osteotomy (DFEO) and patellar tendon advancement (PTA), simultaneously addresses both knee flexion contractures and patella alta (superiorly displaced patella) that often co-exist in those with crouch. Initial outcoe studies demonstrate greater improvements in gait than conventional surgical treatments. However, complication rates remain high and some patients exhibit little to no improvement in gait after surgery. The first aim of this study is to investigate the effects of patella position, crouch and surgical parameters on functional knee mechanics. Computational knee models will be created that include detailed representations of ligament and articular cartilage geometry within the tibiofemoral and patellofemoral joints. Patella alta and knee flexion contractures will be introduced, and surgical simulations will be performed virtually. The computational models will then be used to simulate knee mechanics when walking in normal, and mild, moderate, and severe crouch gait postures. Probabilistic simulations will then be used to investigate how variability in physical characteristics and surgical factors can contribute to variable outcomes. The effects of surgery and crouch gait on cartilage pressure patterns will also be determined, which is relevant for understanding subsequent skeletal growth and long-term cartilage health. The second aim investigates whether a combination of quantitative measures of physical characteristics and surgical parameters can retrospectively classify post-surgical gait performance. Pre- and post-surgical x- rays will be used to quantitatively measure the Koshino index (metric of patella alta/baja), the magnitude and location of the DFEO, and the PTA advancement distance in patients who previously underwent DFEO+PTA. Pre-surgical measures of knee flexion contracture and spasticity will also be obtained. Pre- and post-operative gait analysis data will be used to assess changes in gait mechanics, while functional surveys will assess changes in performance on activities of daily living. The random forest algorithm will then be used to identify decision trees and associate predictor variables that can classify those patients whose gait and overall function improved after surgery. These results will be interpreted in the context of modeling results from Aim 1, thereby providing a potential mechanistic explanation for clinical observations. The research will impact innumerable CP patients as the DFEO+PTA surgical procedures are adopted around the world, and will also set the groundwork for more rigorous scientific study of other procedures used to treat gait disorders. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Children with Cerebral Palsy (CP) often exhibit a crouch walking posture, which can be extremely fatiguing, painful and disabling as a child grows. Orthopedic surgical procedures are used to correct the physical abnormalities that contribute to crouch, but clinical outcomes remain variable and difficult to predict. This study uses a combination of computational models and retrospective analyses of clinical data to identify the physical and surgical treatment factors that can best restore more normal walking function in CP patients.",Impact of Crouch Gait and Surgical Treatment on Knee Mechanics and Function,8975231,R21HD084213,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Aftercare', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Biomechanics', 'Bone Growth', 'Cartilage', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Complication', 'Computer Simulation', 'Contracture', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Decision Trees', 'Distal', 'Exhibits', 'Fatigue', 'Gait', 'Gait abnormality', 'Geometry', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Height', 'Individual', 'Inferior', 'Joints', 'Knee', 'Knee bone', 'Ligaments', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Musculoskeletal', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Orthopedic Surgical Procedures', 'Osteotomy', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Pain', 'Patient Selection', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postoperative Period', 'Posture', 'Procedures', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Selection Criteria', 'Severities', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'Tendon structure', 'Testing', 'Treatment Factor', 'Walking', 'Work', 'articular cartilage', 'crouch gait', 'forest', 'functional outcomes', 'gait examination', 'human subject', 'improved functioning', 'indexing', 'knee mechanics', 'pressure', 'prevent', 'quadriceps muscle', 'restoration', 'simulation', 'skeletal', 'spasticity']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R21,2016,168604,0.0022440126566513727
"High Performance Automated System for Analysis of Fast Cardiac SPECT DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Coronary artery disease remains a major public health problem worldwide. It causes approximately 1 of every 6 deaths in the United States. Imaging of myocardial perfusion (delivery of blood to the heart muscle) by myocardial perfusion single photon emission tomography (MPS) allows physicians to detect disease before a heart attack, and predict risk in millions of patients annually. This is currently limited by the need fo visual interpretation, which is highly variable and depends on the physician's experience. The long-term objective of this program is to improve the interpretation of this widely used heart imaging technique-achieving higher accuracy for disease detection than it is possible by the best attainable visual analysis. This proposal builds on our prior work in conventional myocardial MPS, and focuses on fast, low-radiation MPS imaging (fast-MPS) obtained by new high-efficiency scanners. Specifically, we aim to: 1) develop new image processing algorithms for a fully automated analysis of fast-MPS. The algorithms will include better heart muscle detection by training with correlated anatomical data and a novel approach for mapping the probability of abnormal perfusion for each location of the heart muscle; 2) enhance the diagnosis of heart disease from fast-MPS by machine- learning algorithms that integrate clinical data, stress test parameters, and quantitative image features; 3) demonstrate the clinical utility of the new algorithms applied to automatic canceling of the rest portion of the MPS scan, when not needed. The new system will be more accurate than the clinical expert analysis in the detection of obstructive coronary disease. By immediately indicating whether a stress scan is normal, the system will allow for the automatic cancellation of the rest imaging portion when it is not needed (estimated in over 60% of all MPS studies). Our research will demonstrate that the computer decision regarding rest-scan cancellation is safe for the patient, both from a diagnostic and prognostic standpoint. This will lead to a wide adoption of low-dose stress-only imaging for MPS studies, which would reduce the amount of radiation that patients are exposed to, and allow for significant healthcare savings. It will additionally lead to a paradigm shift in the practice of nuclear cardiology, which will ultimately result in better selection of patients who need intervention, and reduce the number of deaths due coronary artery disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Imaging of myocardial perfusion (heart muscle blood flow) at rest and stress allows physicians to detect disease and predict risk in millions of patients in the US each year, but it is currently limited by the need of visual interpretation, which is dependent on doctor's experience. The investigators propose to develop and validate an automated, highly-accurate and objective computer system which will outperform even experienced physicians in interpreting these images using latest generation scanners and novel machine learning computer tools. The computer will be able to better select patients needing treatment and automatically indicate the normal stress-scan immediately, and more accurately than physicians allowing automatic cancellation of the rest imaging, when not needed; this will result in large healthcare savings and reduced radiation to the patients.",High Performance Automated System for Analysis of Fast Cardiac SPECT,9064178,R01HL089765,"['Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Blood', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Computer Systems', 'Computers', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Generations', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Diseases', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'Myocardium', 'Nuclear', 'Patient Selection', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Photons', 'Physicians', 'Probability', 'Public Health', 'Radiation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Savings', 'Scanning', 'Stress', 'Stress Tests', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Training', 'United States', 'Visual', 'Work', 'cardiac single photon emission computed tomography', 'experience', 'heart imaging', 'image processing', 'improved', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'quantitative imaging', 'tomography', 'tool']",NHLBI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2016,695446,-0.002249047416866193
"Early CSF detection of FTLD DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) is the second most common cause of dementia among subjects under the age of 65. There are two main FTLD subtypes: FTLD associated with lesions immunoreactive to TDP-43 (FTLD-TDP), and FTLD associated with Tau-immunoreactive lesions (FTLD-Tau). Currently, the exact FTLD pathology cannot be confidently defined until autopsy, and there is an urgent need for ante- mortem biomarker which reliably predict FTLD pathology. Over the past 30 months, I have identified and validated a panel of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) FTLD-TDP biomarkers that identified FTLD-TDP patients with 85% accuracy, including Tau phosphorylation, tripeptidyl peptidase 1 (TPP1) levels, and inflammatory protein levels (FAS, eotaxin-3, IL-23), with 85% accuracy in distinguishing between the two main FTLD subtypes. The identification and validation of these CSF alterations will serve as the basis of the current proposal to translate these markers towards clinical application through multi-site technical validation and advanced classification through machine-based learning, and to better characterize altered biochemical pathways in FTLD-TDP. First, I hypothesize that we can reduce the coefficient of variation for each FTLD-TDP biomarker to under 15% through a multi-site technical validation using 60 banked CSF samples. I will test this hypothesis in Aim 1 by determining technical factors (freeze-thawing, blood contamination, detergent use, protease inhibitor use, buffer condition) which reduce assay precision, and validating the assay at Penn. Second, I hypothesize that machine-based learning/support vector machine approach will better diagnose FTLD-TDP by taking into account non-linear effects of age, gender, and disease duration. I will test this hypothesis in Aim 2 by comparing the classification performance between more established algorithms and the support vector machine algorithm. Lastly, I hypothesize that these biomarker changes reflect altered biochemical pathways in FTLD-TDP. I will test this hypothesis by measuring brain and CSF levels of proteins involved in Tau phosphorylation, TPP1 maturation, and inflammation. As an exploratory Sub-aim 3a, I will determine if any of the changes from Aims 1 & 3 are detectable in asymptomatic subjects carrying familial FTLD-TDP mutations, to power an R01 application on longitudinal CSF biomarker changes in prodromal FTLD-TDP subjects. I will carry out this proposal with guidance from my mentoring team including Allan Levey, MD, PhD (Emory), John Trojanowski, MD, PhD (Penn), James Lah, MD, PhD (Emory), Jonathan Glass, MD (Emory), Leslie Shaw, PhD (Penn), and Eva Lee, PhD (Georgia Tech). I will also obtain formal training in biostatistics, bioinformatics, analytical chemistry, quality control, clinical trial design, geriatrics, and responsible conduct of research. Successful completion of the aims in the current proposal will establish the standard procedures to clinically  translate promising FTLD-TDP biomarkers, determine the best algorithm to diagnose FTLD-TDP using these biomarkers, and identify altered CSF and brain pathways related to these biomarker alterations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: FTLD is the second most common cause of dementia among subjects under the age of 65, and patients and their caregivers face unique challenges including poor judgment on the job, single parents suffering from FTLD with young children, and working spouses as caregivers. There is currently no reliable way to predict the underlying FTLD subtype, and as a result it is challenging to enroll the appropriate patients for substrate-specifi clinical trials (such as drugs targeting TDP but not Tau). This proposal will establish the standardized measurements of FTLD-TDP biomarkers towards translating this research panel into clinical testing, and identify biomarker changes which can be used even when symptoms are very mild. Early and accurate FTLD- TDP diagnosis will enhance future drug development and clinical trial design to alleviate the unique personal, social, and economic burden of FTLD.",Early CSF detection of FTLD,9084432,K23AG042856,"['Accounting', 'Adult', 'Adult Children', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Autopsy', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Buffers', 'Caregivers', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Collection', 'Controlled Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Detergents', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Drug Targeting', 'Economic Burden', 'Enrollment', 'Eotaxin', 'Event', 'Face', 'Freezing', 'Frontotemporal Lobar Degenerations', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Geriatrics', 'Glass', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Institutes', 'Judgment', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Occupations', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phosphorylation', 'Procedures', 'Protease Inhibitor', 'Proteins', 'Quality Control', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Sampling', 'Single Parent', 'Site', 'Spouses', 'Staging', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Trials', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Tube', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'age effect', 'base', 'brain pathway', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'design', 'drug development', 'illness length', 'improved', 'inflammatory marker', 'interleukin-23', 'model design', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'protein TDP-43', 'public health relevance', 'research clinical testing', 'research study', 'response', 'responsible research conduct', 'social', 'tau Proteins', 'tau phosphorylation', 'tau-1', 'tool', 'tripeptidyl aminopeptidase']",NIA,EMORY UNIVERSITY,K23,2016,156324,-0.008463535097004248
"Multiparametric Prediction of Vasospasm after Subarachnoid Hemorrhage ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (SAH) affects an estimated 14.5 per 100,000 persons in the United States, and is a substantial burden on health care resources, because it can cause long-term functional and cognitive disability. Much of this is due to delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) from vasospasm (VSP). VSP refers to the reactive narrowing of cerebral blood vessels due the unusual presence of blood surrounding the vessel. In its extreme, severe VSP precludes blood flow to brain tissue, resulting in stroke.  SAH is one of the most common disease entities treated in the Neurointensive Care Unit (NICU). Currently, resource planning is scripted around the Modified Fisher Scale, which predicts the odds ratio of developing DCI based on the volume and pattern of blood on initial brain computed tomography (CT). It does not, however, allow for further individualized risk assessments. The first 14 days are occupied by efforts to detect preclinical or early VSP and arrange timely interventions to prevent permanent injury. The only noninvasive tool supported by guidelines to potentially identify preclinical VSP is the transcrania Doppler (TCD), which has an unreliable range of sensitivity and negative predictive values, and is at the mercy of technician availability. If not identified preclinically, VSP must be detected once it is symptomatic and is then dependent on quality and availability of expertise in the complex and diurnal environment of the ICU.  Promisingly, electronic medical record (EMR) data and continuous physiology monitors offer abundant opportunities to risk stratify for future events as well as reveal events in real-time in the acutely brain injured patient. A methodical approach to feature engineering will be performed over a large set of potentially discriminatory data-driven and knowledge-based features. Meta-features representing variations and trends in time series variables will be extracted using a variety of quantitative and symbolic abstraction techniques. Predictive modeling will be performed using Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine.  This project will result in a prediction tool that improves timeliness and precision in VSP classification. It will fill an important gap in the understanding of the potentia of underutilized EMR and physiological data to predict neurological decline. Generating accurate and timely prediction rules from already collected clinical data would be cost effective and have implications not only for SAH patients, but also for almost any monitored patient in any ICU. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    This project will explore the optimal methods for creating a prediction tool that improves timeliness and precision of diagnosis.

One approach to prediction, heretofore impractical, is rapidly finding a patient cohort ""similar enough"" to an index case that the health experiences and outcomes of this cohort are informative for prediction. This task is formidable because of large variability of the vast numbers of patient attributes with the added complexity of sequences of patient encounters evolving over time. Epidemiological considerations such as confounding by indication for treatment also come into play. The objective of this research effort is to (1) create a modular test bed that uses a ""big data"" systems architecture to support research in rapid individualized prediction of outcomes from large clinical repositories and (2) to explore various approaches to making ""pragmatic"" near-term predictions of outcomes. Using the Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) Informatics and Computing Infrastructure database (VINCI), a research database with records of tens of millions of patients, we will explore two synergistic strategies for rapidly finding a cohort of patients that are similar enough to an index patient to predict near-term treatment response and/or adverse effects in an elastic cloud environment: 1) use of temporal alignment of critical events including use of gene sequence alignment methods to relax requirements for exact temporal matching; and, 2) use of conceptual distance metrics to model the degree of content similarity of case records. The initial domain of application will be treatment of Type 2 diabetes. The approach will apply open source ""big data"" methodologies, including Hadoop and Accumulo, to store and filter ""medical log"" files. The content of these ""logs"" will be processed by a combination with strategies including conceptual markup of events using natural language processing tools, matching of event streams, and statistical data mining methods to rapidly retrieve and identify patients that are sufficiently similar to an index case to be able to make personalized yet pragmatic clinical predictions of outcomes. RELEVANCE (See instructions): This proposal studies how to use experience of past patients, stored in electronic medical records systems, to help clinicians make practical decisions on the care of complex patients with type 1 diabetes. Research applies methods adapted from Internet search engines and from studies of the human genome to determine what it means for one patient's disease experiences to be similar to and relevant to another's. n/a",BIGDATA: Mid-Scale: DA: Techniques to Integrate Disparate Data: Clinical Personalized Pragmatic Predictions of Outcomes (C3PO),9066173,R01GM108346,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Adverse effects', 'Algorithms', 'Assessment tool', 'Beds', 'Benchmarking', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biosensing Techniques', 'Budgets', 'Caring', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinic Visits', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer Systems', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Coupled', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Element', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disasters', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Exclusion', 'Extensible Markup Language', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Germ-Line Mutation', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Human Genome', 'Imagery', 'Informatics', 'Information Systems', 'Institutes', 'Instruction', 'Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Internet', 'Language', 'Letters', 'Location', 'Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Medicine', 'Metadata', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Names', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Oncogenes', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Privacy', 'Process', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Support', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Source', 'Specialist', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translational Research', 'Triage', 'United States National Library of Medicine', 'Variant', 'Veterans', 'Visualization software', 'Vocabulary', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'base', 'bench to bedside', 'cancer type', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'data integration', 'data mining', 'data visualization', 'design', 'emergency service responder', 'experience', 'genetic variant', 'genome analysis', 'genome sequencing', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'indexing', 'interoperability', 'learning strategy', 'medical information system', 'novel', 'open source', 'outcome prediction', 'parallel processing', 'performance tests', 'personalized care', 'predict clinical outcome', 'processing speed', 'reference genome', 'repository', 'research study', 'response', 'search engine', 'sugar', 'system architecture', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor progression', 'virtual', 'whole genome']",NIGMS,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,R01,2016,507805,-0.007112063639967777
"Automated quantitative CT imaging of epicardial adipose tissue and risk of cardiac events PROJECT SUMMARY Coronary artery disease remains the leading cause of death worldwide, and more than half of the individuals suffering acute myocardial infarction have no prior symptoms. Coronary calcium scoring with non-contrast CT is increasingly used for cardiovascular risk stratification in the asymptomatic population. Epicardial adipose tissue (EAT), a local visceral fat depot surrounding the heart, has been recently reported as a significant imaging biomarker for cardiovascular risk stratification. Despite being routinely imaged noninvasively by non-contrast cardiac CT for coronary calcium scoring, EAT features are currently not measured or reported, primarily due to the absence of robust, automated quantification methods.  We propose to employ novel image processing algorithms to achieve fully automated, robust quantification of EAT features from cardiac CT, and to apply machine learning methods to efficiently combine patient clinical data, coronary calcium and EAT features into a new integrated risk score to predict future cardiac events. We will evaluate this risk score in two existing, prospective registries of asymptomatic patients with available coronary calcium scans, clinical data, and followup for cardiac events (myocardial infarction, cardiac death, late revascularization). These rich resources are: the Early Identification of Subclinical Atherosclerosis Using Non-Invasive Imaging Research [EISNER] registry (2614 patients) and the St. Francis Heart Study (4613 patients). We propose three specific aims: 1) To develop and evaluate the accuracy and reproducibility of new computational algorithms for automated quantification of EAT measures; 2) To evaluate the prognostic value of automatically-quantified EAT features, relative to atherosclerotic plaque burden and measures of obesity, for the prediction of future cardiac events in asymptomatic patients in the EISNER registry and the St. Francis Heart Study; 3) To derive and evaluate a new, integrated risk score—combining standard risk factors, coronary calcium score and EAT measures using machine learning—for the prediction of future cardiac events in the EISNER registry, and further, to additionally evaluate this risk score externally in the St. Francis Heart Study patient cohort.  This work in this proposal will provide a novel, personalized paradigm that will objectively and accurately identify asymptomatic patients undergoing coronary calcium scanning who are at increased risk for future cardiac events, without any additional imaging or risk to the patient. PROJECT NARRATIVE (lay language) CT scanning of the heart for coronary calcium scoring is a simple, widely-used, low-cost test with low radiation dose. Using these scans, the researchers propose to establish automated analysis of fat which surrounds the heart, as well as novel computerized scores that identify the patients who are at highest risk of suffering a heart attack. This new research will allow doctors to better identify patients for whom appropriate treatment could be prescribed, to avoid a heart attack or sudden cardiac death.",Automated quantitative CT imaging of epicardial adipose tissue and risk of cardiac events,9159185,R01HL133616,"['Acute myocardial infarction', 'Adipose tissue', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Arterial Fatty Streak', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Calcium', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Death', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Categories', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinical Data', 'Cohort Studies', 'Computational algorithm', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary artery', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Early identification', 'Event', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Future', 'Heart', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Institution', 'Interleukin-1 beta', 'Interleukin-6', 'Investigation', 'Language', 'Length', 'Lipids', 'Low Dose Radiation', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Obesity', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Process', 'Reader', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Scanning', 'Source', 'Stenosis', 'Stratification', 'Symptoms', 'TNF gene', 'Testing', 'Trees', 'Visceral', 'Woman', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'computerized', 'cost', 'density', 'experience', 'high risk', 'image processing', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'indexing', 'learning strategy', 'men', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'pericardial sac', 'predictive marker', 'prognostic value', 'prospective', 'sudden cardiac death']",NHLBI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2016,671851,-0.004629204804917807
"Developing Classification Criteria for the Uveitides ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The uveitides are a collection of ~30 distinct diseases characterized by intraocular infection. Each disease has its own features, course, treatment, and prognosis. Traditionally, the uveitides have been grouped by the primary anatomic site of inflammation as anterior uveitis, intermediate uveitis, posterior uveitis, and panuveitis. However, there are substantial limitations to this ""lumping"" of diseases. For example, among the posterior uveitides, some (e.g. toxoplasmic retinitis and cytomegalovirus retinitis) are infectious and require treatment with antimicrobial/antiviral agents, some are chronic, presumed immune-mediated diseases that require immunosuppression (e.g. birdshot chorioretinitis, multifocal choroiditis, serpiginous choroiditis), and a few are self-limited, spontaneously-remitting diseases with a good prognosis (e.g. acute posterior multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy and multiple evanescent white dot syndrome). As such precise diagnosis is critical for research, including epidemiology, translational pathogenesis research, outcomes research, and disease specific clinical trials. Classification criteria are a type of ""diagnostic"" criteria used for reserch purposes. Although classification criteria seek to optimize sensitivity and specificity, when a trade-off is required, they emphasize specificity in order to ensure that a homogeneous group of patients is being studied. A precise phenotype is required particularly for genomic risk factor studies of complex disorders and translational pathogenesis research, as inclusion of other diseases with different risk factors and disease mechanisms would confound the results. Currently there are no widely-accepted and validated classification criteria for any of the uveitides. Preliminary data indicate ""fair to moderate"" agreement at best on the independent diagnosis of any one case by uveitis experts (κ's 0.27-0.40), but the ability of committees to reach agreement on the diagnosis of >98% of cases. The goal of the ""Developing Classification Criteria for the Uveitides"" project is for the Standardization of Uveitis Nomenclature (SUN) Working Group to develop classification criteria for the 25 leading uveitides using a formal, rigorous approach. There are 4 phases to the project: 1) informatics, to develop a standardized terminology; 2) case collection, to develop a preliminary database of ~250 cases of each disease; 3) case selection, to select at least 150-200 cases of each disease that are generally accepted to be the disease (using formal consensus techniques) from the preliminary database into a final database; and 4) data analysis, using machine learning approaches, of the final database to develop a parsimonious set of criteria for each disease that minimizes misclassification. The informatics and case collection phases of the Project are complete. The case selection phase is well underway and uses online voting and consensus conference calls to achieve supermajority acceptance on all cases included in the final database. The goals of this application are to complete case selection and data analysis and develop classification criteria for the 25 of the major uveitides. These results are crucial to future clinical research i the field of uveitis.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Collectively, the uveitides are the 5th leading cause of blindness in the U.S., and the cost of treating them is estimated to be similar to that of treating diabetic retinopathy. Because uveitis occurs in all age groups, including children and working-age adults, there is a greater potential for years of vision lost than with age- related diseases. Clinical research in the field of uveitis has been hampered by diagnostic imprecision and a lack of widely-accepted and validated classification criteria, the development of which is the goal of this application; these criteria are needed urgently to advance epidemiology, genomic research, translational pathogenesis research, outcomes research, and disease-specific clinical trials.            ",Developing Classification Criteria for the Uveitides,9081760,R01EY026593,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior uveitis', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Blindness', 'Child', 'Choroiditis', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'Cytomegalovirus Retinitis', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Future', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Immune', 'Immunosuppression', 'Infection', 'Inflammation', 'Informatics', 'Intermediate Uveitis', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Nomenclature', 'Outcomes Research', 'Panuveitis', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Pigments', 'Population', 'Posterior Uveitis', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Retinitis', 'Risk Factors', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specificity', 'Standardization', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Terminology', 'Translational Research', 'United States', 'Uveitis', 'Vision', 'Visual impairment', 'Voting', 'Work', 'age group', 'age related', 'antimicrobial', 'birdshot chorioretinitis', 'cost', 'outcome forecast', 'public health relevance', 'symposium', 'tool', 'web page', 'working group']",NEI,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2016,428590,0.0029789358284465343
"Host and Microbial Biomarkers Related to the Development of Complicated Clostridium difficile Infection ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is implicated in nearly 3 million cases of diarrhea and colitis in the U.S. each year. CDI, which disproportionately affects older adults, can result in fulminant, life-threatening colitis and lead to multiple recurrnt episodes. There is an urgent need for validated biomarker-based clinical decision-making tools to predict which patients will experience adverse outcomes from CDI. There is a gap in knowledge regarding which known and yet to-be-discovered biomarkers, derived from the host, microbiome and pathogen, will best predict complications and recurrence. Our long-term goal is to develop and validate accurate risk-prediction models for adverse outcomes following CDI that can be used to guide therapy. The next step in pursuit of that goal, and our overall objective for the proposed research, is to discover new candidate biomarkers and determine which ones together best predict complicated CDI in an adjusted model. Our central hypothesis is that a biomarker-based model will better predict complicated CDI compared to models based on clinical variables alone. To address this hypothesis we propose three specific aims: 1) validate host biomarkers previously shown to associate with complicated CDI; 2) discover novel microbial biomarkers for complicated CDI; and 3) develop a candidate biomarker-based predictive model for complicated CDI. We will collect sera and stool prospectively in a cohort of older adults to determine if characteristics of the microbiome, microbial features of C. difficile, levels of antitoxin antibodies, and/or inflammatory mediators associate with complications. Multivariable models will be constructed using linear regression and machine learning techniques and model diagnostics will be used to generate a final portable, biomarker-based predictive model for use in future studies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is implicated in nearly 3 million cases of diarrhea and colitis in the U.S. each year. We currently lack a complete understanding as to why certain patients with CDI progress to severe disease with increased complications, including death, while others recover. Our research proposes to discovery objective, readily obtainable indicators from serum/stool that predict adverse outcomes from CDI early after initial disease onset. It is envisioned that this could lead to a paradigm-shift in management by directing specific treatment strategies, including more costly therapeutics such as antibody treatment, fecal transplant and newer antibiotics, towards patients who would most benefit.

"Predicting Diabetic Retinopathy from Risk Factor Data and Digital Retinal Images Abstract Diabetic retinopathy is the leading cause of blindness among US adults between the ages of 20 and 74 years. Laser photocoagulation surgery has been established as an effective way of treating retinopathy if it is detected early. Yearly retinal screening examinations are a potent tool in the battle to reduce the incidence of blindness from diabetic retinopathy because they provide diabetic patients with timely diagnoses and consequently, the potential for timely treatment. Primary care safety net clinics provide monitoring and other services for diabetic patients but they are often not equipped to provide specialty care services such as retinal screenings. Access to specialists who can provide retinal screenings can be increased through the use of telemedicine, which has shown great promise as a means of screening for diabetic retinopathy in the US and internationally. A pilot study by Charles Drew University investigators had a total of 2,876 teleretinal screenings performed for diabetic retinopathy, with 2,732 unique diabetic patients from six South Los Angeles safety net clinics screened. The present study aims to build on this prior work by: (a) developing novel software that utilizes information from clinical records to detect latent diabetic retinopathy in diabetic patients who have not yet received an annual eye examination, and (b) devising methods to speed up the diabetic retinopathy detection process for diabetic patients who have had digital retinal images taken by partially automating the process using image processing and machine learning techniques. Specifically, we propose to: 1. Develop predictive models for diabetic retinopathy using risk factors collected from patient clinical records. 2. Develop predictive models for automated diabetic retinopathy assessment using a combination of patient  risk factor data and data from digital retinal images previously evaluated by experts. 3. Evaluate the predictive accuracy of: a) the models developed for specific aim 2, and, b) the assessments of  optometrist readers against standard of care dilated retinal examinations by board certified  ophthalmologists for 300 diabetic patients utilizing a new Los Angeles County reading center. 4. Create web-based software tools based on the predictive models developed in specific aim 1 that can be  used to initiate outreach to high-risk patients in under-resourced settings, boosting detection rates for those  patients who are most at risk for diabetic retinopathy. 5. Establish targeted outreach methods to promote screening for patients that the predictive models from  specific aim 1 identify as potentially having undetected diabetic retinopathy. Narrative Diabetic retinopathy is the leading cause of blindness among US adults between the ages of 20 and 74 years. Although previous studies within the US and internationally have shown that teleretinal screening can increase access to eye examinations for detecting retinopathy, few studies have focused on the US urban safety net, which has ophthalmic screening rates that are well below the US average and a preponderance of diabetic patients who are from ethnic minority groups. Building on a previous teleretinal screening study that assessed 2,732 South Los Angeles patients for retinopathy, this study deploys machine learning and image processing techniques to detect latent retinopathy in unscreened diabetic patients and partially automate the diabetic retinopathy detection process for teleretinal screening.",Predicting Diabetic Retinopathy from Risk Factor Data and Digital Retinal Images,9236094,R01LM012309,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alaska Native', 'American Indians', 'Asian Americans', 'Blindness', 'Blood Circulation', 'Blood Vessels', 'Caring', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Computer software', 'County', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Diagnosis', 'Eye', 'Glucose', 'Health Care Reform', 'Health Insurance', 'Hispanics', 'Image', 'Incidence', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Minority Groups', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Online Systems', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Ophthalmic examination and evaluation', 'Ophthalmologist', 'Optometrist', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Retina', 'Retinal', 'Retinal Diseases', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Rural', 'Services', 'Software Tools', 'Specialist', 'Speed', 'Techniques', 'Telemedicine', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'aged', 'base', 'diabetic', 'diabetic patient', 'digital', 'digital imaging', 'disorder prevention', 'ethnic minority population', 'high risk', 'image processing', 'inner city', 'laser photocoagulation', 'medical specialties', 'medically underserved', 'mortality', 'novel', 'outreach', 'predictive modeling', 'primary care setting', 'racial minority', 'randomized trial', 'safety net', 'screening', 'standard of care', 'statistics', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'trend']",NLM,CHARLES R.

"Statistical methods for healthcare in complex patients with diabetes ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Diabetes affects 8.3% of the US population, and lead to costly adverse healthcare outcomes. Unfortunately, there may be a quality gap in the care of complex diabetes patients, that is, older patients (age>65 years) and those with comorbid conditions. Current practices, relying primarily on the presence of several factors, are not effective in capturing the risk of poor prognosis, i.e., multiple hospitalization and/or emergency department visits, and death. Hence, little evidence exists so far to help prioritize care for thes patients. The diabetes guidelines recognize that tight control of glycosylated hemoglobin (A1c) may not be appropriate for complex patients, and recommend individualizations in tight A1c control. However, neither the outcomes of tight A1c control, nor the effects of the typical treatment regimens used to achieve tight A1c control can be evaluated in clinical trials, with minimal, if any, enrollment of complex diabetes patients due to either their restrictive inclusion criteria or lack of encouragement of the patient and/or clinical investigator to consider the RCT. In order to deliver more effective, efficient and accountable health cares, it is important to help clinicians to examine the relationship between patient complexity and patients' A1c control level, and to modify guideline appropriately with an evidence base. The proposed research will analyze a cohort of 8,304 Medicare beneficiaries with diabetes who were cared for by one of the country's 10 largest physician group practices, the University of Wisconsin Medical Foundation during 2003-2011 to address the following aims: (1) to conduct risk prediction incorporating longitudinal outcomes, (2) to inform guidelines for complex diabetes patients, and (3) to create a patient-centered surveillance tool for detecting short-term negative outcomes. Our analytic approach involves the use of state- of-the-art statistics and machine learning methods to take advantage of the large electronic health records data. The proposed methods and results will help clinicians to identify and quantify risks of tight A1c control in complex diabetes patients an potentially lead to improved patient experiences, and reduce medical expenditures from excess adverse events.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Sub-optimal glycosylated hemoglobin (A1c) control recommendations and treatment recommendations for diabetes patients can result in adverse events, and increased health care utilization. Unfortunately, current guidelines on the care for complex and/or older patients with diabetes are inadequate. We propose to develop an effective and patient-centered health care delivery system for complex diabetes patients, focusing on accurate prediction of adverse events, development of potential guidelines on targeting tight control of A1c and treatment regimens, and real-time monitoring of health conditions.            ",Statistical methods for healthcare in complex patients with diabetes,9145732,R01DK108073,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biometry', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency department visit', 'Enrollment', 'Exclusion Criteria', 'Expenditure', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Glean', 'Glycosylated Hemoglobin', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'Goals', 'Group Practice', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Long-Term Care', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical History', 'Medicare', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recommendation', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sampling', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Time', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Trees', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Wisconsin', 'Work', 'base', 'beneficiary', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'cost', 'design', 'diabetes management', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'health care delivery', 'health care quality', 'health care service utilization', 'high risk', 'improved', 'inclusion criteria', 'learning strategy', 'meetings', 'mortality', 'older patient', 'outcome forecast', 'patient oriented', 'patient population', 'public health relevance', 'statistics', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'user friendly software']",NIDDK,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2016,292485,0.015090805922151238
"Advanced morphological analysis of cerebral blood flow for acute concussion diagnosis and return-to-play determination Project Summary / Abstract Between 1.6 and 3.8 million people each year suffer a mild TBI in the US alone. Reliable diagnosis and prompt treatments are vital to managing the often-serious short and long-term sequelae resulting from mild TBI. However, a reliable objective and accurate method for mild TBI diagnosis outside of a hospital setting, and in particular for determining RTP readiness, has eluded the clinical community. Current diagnosis and RTP assessments are based on patient symptoms, neurocognitive evaluations, and / or physical performance testing. Use of symptom scales are problematic for several reasons including subjectivity and reliability. Neurocognitive evaluations and physical tests (such as balance tests), although less subjective, require pre- injury baseline testing of subjects due to inherently large subject-to-subject variations in evaluation performances. Due to these reasons, current mild TBI diagnostic methods have limited applications and are not suitable for a significant majority of patients who suffer mild TBI. This project is aimed at developing an objective diagnosis of mild traumatic brain injury (mild TBI) based on physiologic changes in a patient after injury and providing a platform capable of RTP guidance. The method is based on quantification of well-known physiologic changes after a concussion, i.e. the impairment of autonomic function and altered cerebral blood flow (CBF) as measured with transcranial Doppler (TCD). The novelty of the proposed approach is the use of a recently-developed analytical machine learning framework for the analysis of the CBF velocity (CBFV) waveforms. In contrast to previous methods used before, the proposed approach utilizes the entire shape of the complex CBFV waveform, thus obtaining subtle changes in blood flow that are lost in other analysis methods. Additionally, comprehensive verification between our platform and MRI will be performed following injury resulting in the first scientific experiments of this kind. The ultimate goal of this Phase II SBIR is to commercialize an objective and accurate software algorithm for reliable diagnosis and management of sports concussions which does not currently exist. The outcome will be a software suite integrated into existing TCD and will be marketed to emergency departments, neurology clinics, and other healthcare providers involved in mild TBI diagnosis and RTP management. Project Narrative Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a serious public health problem in the United States contributing to a substantial number of deaths and cases of permanent disability. Mild TBI concussions account for over 80% of all TBIs sustained and a major problem is the high rate of mis-diagnosis due to lack of objective measures and delayed onset of symptoms. This project aims to develop the first objective concussion evaluation method using a novel analysis platform that can obtain subtle, physiologic changes in cerebral hemodynamics. Successful completion of this project will result in a portable diagnostic device suitable for use in many scenarios where concussion diagnosis is inaccurate or unavailable today.",Advanced morphological analysis of cerebral blood flow for acute concussion diagnosis and return-to-play determination,9202982,R44NS092209,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Accounting', 'Acute', 'Adoption', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Area Under Curve', 'Assessment tool', 'Blood Flow Velocity', 'Blood flow', 'Brain Concussion', 'Cerebrovascular Circulation', 'Cessation of life', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Controlled Study', 'Core-Binding Factor', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Evaluation', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Health Personnel', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Injury', 'Letters', 'Licensing', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Marketing', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurologist', 'Neurology', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Neurology', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Physical Performance', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Readiness', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Spin Labels', 'Sports', 'Sports Medicine', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Variant', 'abstracting', 'balance testing', 'base', 'brain health', 'cerebral hemodynamics', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'disability', 'hemodynamics', 'high school', 'injured', 'innovation', 'mild traumatic brain injury', 'novel', 'performance tests', 'prevent', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'success', 'tool']",NINDS,"NEURAL ANALYTICS, INC.",R44,2016,1500000,-0.0009902998612131898
"A Multi-Omics Approach to Identify a Biomarker Panel for the Early Detection of Hepatocellular Carcinoma in Hepatitis C+ Individuals PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Our work to develop novel algorithms for predictive modeling will for the first time combine results from the use of both metabolomics and proteomics to identify multiple biomarkers that can be used to identify those Hepatitis C (HCV) patients who have developed early-stage Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC). Our long-term goal is to create a non-invasive diagnostic test that is both highly specific and sensitive for the detection of early-stage liver cancer. The overall objective of this project is the creation of a biomarker panel, developed from a predictive model, that can be used for the detection of early-stage HCC. Our central hypothesis is that machine learning algorithms can be used on urine and serum metabolomic data and/or serum proteomic data to create a predictive model for identifying those individuals with HCV that have developed early-stage HCC. The rationale underlying this project is that a combination of metabolites and proteins will yield a highly specific and sensitive predictive model to identify HCV subjects that have developed early stage HCC. Our central hypothesis will be objectively tested by pursuing two Specific Aims. Aim 1 is to test the hypothesis that combining proteomics data with metabolomics data will create a better predictive model for HCC. Based on preliminary data, our hypothesis is that a biomarker panel consisting of several metabolites and proteins will be more specific and sensitive than either set of data alone. Aim 2 is to test the hypothesis that combining different types of metabolomics data specific to Stage IV HCV will improve the predictive accuracy of a model for the early detection of HCC. Based on preliminary data, we hypothesize that by combining results from multiple platforms, we will create a more specific and sensitive predictive model for the early detection of HCC in Stage IV HCV individuals than either platform alone is capable of achieving. This project is significant because it will be the first step towards the early detection of HCC, and will lead to the development of a sensitive and specific diagnostic test for early-stage HCC, and thus to improved patient outcomes and long- term survival. This research is innovative because we are using Stage IV HCV individuals with liver cirrhosis as a control for HCC individuals (as all HCC patients have some amount of cirrhosis), and in using both metabolomics and proteomics on both urine and serum samples from infected patients to identify potential biomarkers. PROJECT NARRATIVE Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common cancer and the third most common cause of cancer deaths worldwide, yet there is no reliable diagnostic test for the early detection of the disease, when treatment options that improve long-term survival and patient outcomes are available. This project is relevant to public health because the discovery of a biomarker panel for the detection of early-stage HCC should ultimately provide new protein and metabolite targets for diagnostic assays to detect HCC in the early stages of the disease. Thus, the research in this project is relevant to that part of NIH's mission which pertains to fostering innovative research strategies and their applications as a basis for improving the health of the Nation by conducting research supporting better diagnosis and treatment of human diseases.",A Multi-Omics Approach to Identify a Biomarker Panel for the Early Detection of Hepatocellular Carcinoma in Hepatitis C+ Individuals,9221078,R03CA211210,"['Abdomen', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Cirrhosis', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Fostering', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hepatitis C', 'Hepatitis C virus', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Liver Cirrhosis', 'Liver diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of liver', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance', 'Outcome', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'Serum Proteins', 'Staging', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Ultrasonography', 'Urine', 'Work', 'alpha-Fetoproteins', 'base', 'biomarker panel', 'clinically relevant', 'diagnostic assay', 'differential expression', 'experience', 'human disease', 'improved', 'innovation', 'liquid chromatography mass spectrometry', 'metabolomics', 'model building', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'potential biomarker', 'predictive modeling', 'protein metabolite', 'research study', 'screening', 'survival outcome', 'tool']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS MED BR GALVESTON,R03,2016,155000,-0.012813909137547659
"A Novel Probabilistic Methodology for Prediction of Emerging Diseases in Patients with Multiple Chronic Conditions ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Treatment for people living with multiple chronic conditions (MCC) currently accounts for an estimated 66 percent of the Nation's health care costs and will continue to grow. This mounting challenge has become a major public health issue since MCC is linked to suboptimal health outcomes and rising health care costs. However, it now known how MCC emerge among individuals or in the general population. Traditional epidemiological approaches have led to important findings of disease links and comorbidity associations. However, they are limited in their ability to characterize how patients acquire new chronic conditions and predict/personalize the emergence of MCC for individual patients. Objectives: This study will develop approaches that can be used to identify the most likely combinations of comorbidity within a population. These approaches can be tailored to examine MCC patterns in specific sub- populations or at the level of the individual patient. We will also study the effect of a large set of risk factors on MCC combinations emergence. Furthermore, we will use data mining approaches to predict and monitor the development of MCC combinations in at the population and individual levels. Hypotheses: We hypothesize that the emergence and progression of comorbidities in MCC patients form patterns that can be predicted and which are associated with prior medical conditions, demographic, and socio-economic characteristics. We further hypothesize that these methods can predict the timing and emergence of new chronic diseases more accurately by personalizing the records for individual patients. Aims and methodology: in Aim1, we will characterize how MCC emerge and progress in distinct patterns and how these patterns transition between different combinations of diseases over time. We will then identify and group major MCC transitions using the Markov clustering (MCL) algorithm, which is a novel, efficient graphical approach to handle big data. In Aim 2, we will identify which risk factors are associated with MCC emergence using a machine learning approach that can handle the complex heterogeneity of comorbidity patterns. Risk factors include age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, economic status, marital status, and prior medical conditions. In Aim 3, we will use a similarity learning approach to develop models that can predict if MCC will emerge in individual patients or among populations and we will be able to use these models to monitor MCC emergence over time. Conclusion: Our findings will provide a foundation for future research that will evaluate specific treatment patterns associated with progression in MCC patterns and ultimately identify optimal time points of intervention for those with, or at risk for multiple chronic conditions. These findings will also provide information that can be used at the community level to manage healthcare resources to improve continuity and accessibility of care.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Project Narrative This research proposal aims to better understand the emergence of multiple chronic conditions by identifying and predicting emerging diseases in young adults and discovering the patient characteristics associated with comorbidity emergence and progression.            ",A Novel Probabilistic Methodology for Prediction of Emerging Diseases in Patients with Multiple Chronic Conditions,9074366,SC2GM118266,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Big Data', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Economics', 'Education', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Foundations', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Status', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'High Performance Computing', 'Hypertension', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Marital Status', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Records', 'Research Proposals', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scheme', 'Statistical Models', 'Stroke', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral health', 'data mining', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'learning strategy', 'multiple chronic conditions', 'multitask', 'novel', 'physical conditioning', 'population based', 'public health relevance', 'sex', 'socioeconomics', 'young adult']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS SAN ANTONIO,SC2,2016,147000,-0.010502265115392413
"CorBand: A novel wearable wrist sensor for heart failure remote monitoring ReThink Medical, Inc. proposes to develop an ambulatory version of the physiologic monitoring technology it validated in Phase I, the CorBand. The CorBand is designed to track key physiologic parameters that are predictive of cardiac decompensation, to detect the early stages of decompensation, and to relay both the physiologic data and generated alerts to relevant caregivers with the end goal of reducing hospitalizations by enabling proactive/preventative care in the heart failure population. Heart failure effects 5.8 million individuals in the US and the costs associated are approaching $40 billion annually. This technology will not only improve the quality of life for heart failure patients, but also help to reduce this massive burden on the US healthcare system. Our long term objective is to help drive the transformation from the reactive pay-for-service healthcare paradigm to one that puts emphasis on preventative care through health monitoring technologies. Our specific aims include (1) manufacturing a robust version of the device for use in two large, long term, ambulatory studies. It will be validated using patients who have cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs). Heart rate (HR), heart rate variability (HRV), activity levels, and fluid index derived from the CorBand will be compared with data collected from CIEDs manufactured by Medtronic and Boston Scientific and analyzed for correlation. (2) The CorBand will be deployed in a large ambulatory population of HF patients. We will collect the patient's clinical notes and note hospitalization events along with remote physiologic data from the CorBand. We will use this data to further build a predictive model for cardiac decompensation using a number of machine learning approaches. In aim (3), we will perform a controlled study on a population of HF patients. All the subjects will wear the CorBand; we will use the data from half the subjects to predict decompensation events, provide that information to subject's caregiver in order to provide preventative care. The other half will receive usual care. We will then examine the number of HF related hospitalizations in both groups to evaluate the ability of the CorBand to reduce hospitalizations. Our goal is to simplify the management of heart failure while improving the quality of care of the patients and reducing the associated costs. We will investigate the benefits of a novel, non-invasive multi-parameter sensor with telemetry for monitoring patients with heart failure combined with an algorithm for detecting early-stage cardiac decompensation with a goal of preventing hospitalizations.",CorBand: A novel wearable wrist sensor for heart failure remote monitoring,9202845,R44HL125001,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Ambulatory Care', 'Award', 'Boston', 'California', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cloud Service', 'Complement', 'Control Groups', 'Controlled Study', 'Data', 'Decision Modeling', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Edema', 'Electronics', 'Emergency department visit', 'Engineering', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart', 'Heart Rate', 'Heart failure', 'Home environment', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Masks', 'Medical', 'Medicare', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Multicenter Trials', 'Office Visits', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Photoplethysmography', 'Physicians', 'Physiologic Monitoring', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Preventive care', 'Quality of Care', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiration', 'Risk', 'San Francisco', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Single-Blind Study', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Specialist', 'Staging', 'Technology', 'Telemetry', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Universities', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'clinical decision-making', 'cloud based', 'cost', 'cost effectiveness', 'cost efficient', 'design', 'follow-up', 'health care service', 'heart rate variability', 'hemodynamics', 'implantable device', 'improved', 'indexing', 'novel', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prototype', 'sensor', 'treatment as usual', 'treatment group']",NHLBI,"RETHINK MEDICAL, INC.",R44,2016,1009410,0.031136479402867467
"Autoimmunity as a Mechanism for Atherosclerosis in COPD ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project will facilitate the development of the principal investigator into an independent translational researcher investigating systemic vascular injury in Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This will be accomplished in the rich academic environment at the University of Pittsburgh, under the guidance of a highly accomplished team of mentors, and in the conduct of multidisciplinary research project that will develop autoimmunity as a novel mechanism for atherosclerosis in COPD. The increased risk of atherosclerosis in COPD is not explained by smoking, age, hypertension, and other established vascular disease risk factors. Chronic inflammation has recently been implicated as an atherogenic mechanism in COPD. We and others have reported that chronic inflammation in COPD may be propagated by humoral autoimmunity. Specifically, smokers with COPD have greatly increased levels of circulating autoantibodies that demonstrate in vitro pathogenic effects. Our subsequent studies also show that these autoantibodies target at least 50 different autoantigens and consistently target glucose regulated protein 78 (GRP78), particularly in patients with parenchymal lung destruction, i.e. emphysema. GRP78 is present in the endoplasmic reticulum, where it regulates the unfolded protein response, and is also a multifunction cell surface receptor. Studies in cancer patients suggest that ligation of the N-terminus of cell surface GRP78 by anti-GRP78 IgG transduces pro-inflammatory and pro-proliferative signals by activation of the AKT pathway, followed by NFκB activation. Additional in vivo studies have identified anti-GRP78 IgG with affinity for the C-terminus of cell surface GRP78 that produce counteracting anti-inflammatory effects by suppressing AKT activation. Our preliminary work shows that circulating anti-GRP78 IgG in COPD patients binds to macrophages and leads to increased NFκB activation and production of atherogenic inflammatory mediators by them. The macrophage is critical in the development of both atherosclerosis and COPD. Also, cross-sectional studies in our cohort find that levels of circulating anti-GRP78 IgG are strongly associated with carotid atherosclerosis in patients with emphysema, independent of established vascular risk factors. Therefore, we hypothesize that autoimmune responses against GRP78 are a mechanism for atherosclerosis in COPD. During this award, we will: (1) Test the hypothesis that elevated levels of circulating anti-GRP78 IgG predict progression of carotid atherosclerosis in patients with emphysema independent of established risk factors over 4 year follow up; (2) Test the hypothesis that anti-GRP78 IgG binds to the N-terminus of cell surface GRP78 and activates the AKT pathway followed by NFκB activation and production of inflammatory mediators using a variety of cell function assays, and provide proof of concept for two potential therapeutic strategies; (3) Test the hypothesis that there are other antigen-specific immune responses associated with atherosclerosis in COPD by using machine learning to analyze high-throughput data on a large number of circulating autoantibody levels. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a lung disease caused by smoking that kills more and more Americans each year, and is now the third leading cause of death in the US. Although it is largely viewed as a disease of the lungs, the most common cause of death in patients with COPD are blockages in blood vessels. This research project will investigate why patients with COPD are so prone to develop these blood vessel blockages.",Autoimmunity as a Mechanism for Atherosclerosis in COPD,9024612,K23HL126912,"['Affinity', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Anti-inflammatory', 'Antibodies', 'Antigens', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Autoantibodies', 'Autoantigens', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmune Responses', 'Autoimmunity', 'Award', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cancer Patient', 'Carotid Artery Plaques', 'Carotid Atherosclerotic Disease', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Surface Receptors', 'Cell physiology', 'Cell surface', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum', 'Environment', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Event', 'Figs - dietary', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Health', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Immune response', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'In Vitro', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Inflammatory', 'Injury', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Ligation', 'Link', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphorylation', 'Principal Investigator', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Western Blotting', 'Work', 'cohort', 'disorder risk', 'follow-up', 'glucose-regulated proteins', 'in vitro testing', 'in vivo', 'killings', 'macrophage', 'novel', 'peptidomimetics', 'predictive marker', 'prevent', 'response', 'targeted treatment']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,K23,2016,166104,-0.014786607415129915
"A Novel eFace System to Prevent the Risks of Facial Distortion after CMF Surgery DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The number of patients suffering from craniomaxillofacial (CMF) deformities and requiring surgical correction is escalating. CMF deformities may involve skeleton, overlying soft-tissues, or the both. Patients with CMF deformities often have psychological problems. The goal of CMF surgery is to reconstruct a normal facial appearance and function, and the outcome of the surgery is judged as such. The current problem is that we do not have a reliable way of simulating the soft-tissue-change following skeletal reconstruction. In treating patients with isolated skeletal defects, the current practice is to normalize the skeleton, hoping for optimal facial appearance. However, because the thickness and contour of the soft-tissue envelope varies from patient to patient, this approach is not reliable. The problem is even bigger in patients with composite defects. For example, in the scenario of a patient with a skeletal deformity and a mild soft-tissue defect, a surgeon would have to know, before surgery, how to overcorrect the skeleton to camouflage the soft-tissue defect. But, this information can only be attained by having an accurate planning system to simulate soft-tissue changes. In addition, from patient's perspective, the final facial appearance is the most apparent to them. Therefore, it is extremely important, for both doctors and patients, to accurately simulate soft-tissue-deformation.  Simulation methods must be accurate and fast. Attaining both is difficult because these attributes are inversely related, the more accurate the model, the longer it takes to prepare and run. Among the most effective, they are empirical-based model, mass spring model, finite element model, and mass tensor model. Unfortunately they are either too inaccurate or too slow, and clinically unacceptable.  Our hypothesis is that facial soft-tissue changes following virtual osteotomy can be accurately simulated by our innovative approach using an anatomically detailed modeling and mapping routine, along with statistical modeling technique. To test our hypothesis, we propose to develop an open source novel imaging informatics platform, eFace system, to accurately simulate soft-tissue-change following virtual osteotomies, and thus to significantly improve the outcomes of patients undergoing facial reconstruction. This approach can not only maintain the integrity of complex facial anatomy to accurately simulate the facial soft tissue deformation, but also significantly improve the computational efficiency in order to fit the requirement for clinical use  This project presents an innovative approach to model the facial soft-tissue deformation. If successful, it will allow accurate simulation of soft-tissue changes after virtual osteotomy. Patients will also be able to foresee the postoperative face preoperatively (patient education) and regain their psychological confidence. Finally, eFace will have significant impact and applications in orthodontics, plastic surgery, general surgery, growth/aging prediction, and forensic science. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In the US and throughout the world, the number of patients requiring surgical correction for facial deformities, which involves skeleton, overlying soft tissu, or both, is escalating every year. 2. Currently, while surgeons are able to accurately plan bone reconstructive surgery, they have to use  their visual imagination with clinical experience to mentally predict the facial soft tissue changes  following the bone surgery because they do not have a reliable way of simulating the soft-tissue-change  that is resulted from skeletal reconstruction. 3. We are proposing to develop an open source novel imaging informatics platform, eFace system, to accurately simulate soft-tissue-change following virtual skeletal surgery and thus to significantly improve the outcomes of patients undergoing facial reconstruction.",A Novel eFace System to Prevent the Risks of Facial Distortion after CMF Surgery,9017812,R01DE021863,"['Address', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Appearance', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Deformity', 'Development', 'Elements', 'Face', 'Figs - dietary', 'Forensic Sciences', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Imagination', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Orthodontics', 'Osteotomy', 'Outcome', 'Patient Education', 'Patients', 'Plastic Surgical Procedures', 'Postoperative Period', 'Property', 'Reconstructive Surgical Procedures', 'Reporting', 'Residual state', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Severities', 'Skeleton', 'Speed', 'Statistical Models', 'Surgeon', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'balance testing', 'base', 'bone', 'craniomaxillofacial', 'experience', 'imaging informatics', 'improved', 'improved functioning', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'meetings', 'novel', 'open source', 'prevent', 'psychologic', 'reconstruction', 'simulation', 'skeletal', 'skeletal surgery', 'soft tissue', 'system architecture', 'virtual']",NIDCR,METHODIST HOSPITAL RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2016,393538,-0.004636192449203487
"Enhancing an EMR-Based Real-Time Sepsis Alert System Performance through Machine Learning Project Summary  Sepsis is defined as a severe infection with dangerous physiologic changes, organ dysfunction or death, which hospitalizes over 1.6 million people in the U.S. annually. Sepsis is a priority for the Center for Medicaid and Medicare Services due to its healthcare impact, incidence and staggering annual cost, which exceed $20 billion and 5% of all U.S. hospital costs. All sepsis patients, even those with mild sepsis are at risk for in- hospital complications and death, but have improved outcomes if identified early. Sepsis recognition, however, is challenging due to the heterogeneity of patients who may manifest a wide array of clinical presentations. Electronic medical record (EMR) linked computer programs, known as clinical decision support (CDS) tools, have become ubiquitous to assist providers, including identifying sepsis patients. Unfortunately, all CDS tools in the literature miss 20-30% of sepsis patients and frequently misidentify non-sepsis patients as sepsis patients. Inaccurate CDS tools generate far too many false positive alerts, creating the dangerous condition of “alert fatigue” in which providers become habituated to all alerts, threatening patient safety and even leading to fatal consequences.  The PI and Co-I of this proposal collaboratively developed a CDS software called Sepsis-Alert for adult emergency department (ED) patients. It was fully implemented into Detroit Medical Center's (DMC) EMR live environment and has now been continually operational to provide real-time ongoing monitoring of all ED patients at Sinai Grace Hospital of DMC since October 2014. Our analysis of 25,000 ED visits reveals that while Sepsis-Alert's performance exceeds any reported performance, it still remains unacceptably inaccurate. All the CDS tools, including ours, have two limitations: (1) they lack a mechanism to learn from their past erroneous decisions and consequently repeat the same mistakes again and again, and (2) their decision- making process is fixed and treats all patients in the same way even in face of high heterogeneity of patients,  The main thrust of this research project is to develop an innovative prototype CDS software that functions like Sepsis-Alert but without the two limitations for the same ED sepsis screening purpose. We will develop the software system by utilizing data extracted from the EMR and will test and fine tune the system in over 35,000 retrospective and prospective patients at Sinai Grace Hospital. The proposed prototype, Intelligent Sepsis Alert, will have the cutting edge capabilities of recognizing the subtleties of sepsis, categorizing patients and learning from its own mistakes to avoid repeat them. CDS tools of the future can and must be better. Machine learning is the solution to optimizing patient care without creating a harmful environment. The final deliverable of this project will be a highly accurate and advanced program readily adoptable by any health system or hospital to improve sepsis care and create a safer healthcare environment. 1 Project Narrative  Sepsis is a toxic response to a severe infection and represents a healthcare epidemic, which afflicts millions of people and accounts for 5% of all hospital costs and over $20 billion in the U.S. annually. This project's objective is to develop a cutting edge computer based tool, called Intelligent Sepsis Alert, with the power of machine intelligence (a form of artificial intelligence) and the ability to learn that will accurately identify sepsis patients for healthcare providers extremely early in their hospital course to ensure that patients receive all of the necessary life-saving interventions they need. Intelligent Sepsis Alert will be readily adoptable by other hospitals and health systems and by providing the critical real-time, bedside support for early sepsis identification will translate into multitudes of deaths prevented, abundant intensive care unit admissions avoided, hundreds of thousands of dollars saved and thousands of wasted nursing and physician man-hours eliminated.",Enhancing an EMR-Based Real-Time Sepsis Alert System Performance through Machine Learning,9166164,R21HS024750,[' '],AHRQ,WAYNE STATE UNIVERSITY,R21,2016,149836,-0.010163389534009097
"Development of Models for the Prediction of Ventilator-Associated Conditions in the Hospital Setting ABSTRACT Mechanical ventilation refers to the use of life-support technology to perform the work of breathing for patients suffering from respiratory failure. Patients undergoing mechanical ventilation are disproportionately older and suffer from multiple chronic conditions: Approximately half of these patients are older than 65, and half suffer from multiple chronic conditions. Prolonged mechanical ventilation is associated with a higher likelihood of death as a result of complications from ventilator associated conditions (VAC), the most lethal of which is ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP). Approximately 10 to 20% of mechanically ventilated patients develop VAP, and patients suffering from VAP are twice as likely to die compared to similar patients without VAP. In addition, approximately 80% of mechanically ventilated patients will develop delirium. Currently, most institutions take a one-size-fits-all ‘bundled’ approach to mitigate ventilator associated complications. This wastes healthcare resources on patients who will not benefit while simultaneously denying additional potentially life-saving resources from patients who are most likely to benefit from vigorous prophylactic interventions. In this Phase 1 SBIR study, we will design models to predict with a high degree of accuracy which patients will likely develop VAC, VAP and delirium. Current care focuses on the disease (i.e., respiratory failure) as opposed to the patient. Our vision is to put this tool into the hands of hospital caregivers, which we will do during Phase 2 of this SBIR. Successful completion of the proposed work will alter the current bundled approach to the care of mechanically ventilated patients such that the care becomes tailored to the needs of each individual patient. Furthermore, this work will facilitate the early application of targeted prevention interventions to reduce the frequency of VAC, pneumonia and delirium in mechanically ventilated patients, thus improving patient outcomes. Finally, the developed models will provide critical prognostic information for providers and patients, facilitating shared decision-making and care planning. NARRATIVE This SBIR Phase 1 application seeks to create then use a dataset of predictor variables and outcomes from mechanically ventilated patients to develop novel analytical tools that predict whether individual ventilated patients will develop delirium, ventilator associated conditions, and pneumonia. This information will improve patient outcomes and facilitate clinical decision-making by nurses and physicians by drawing their attention and resources to the patients most likely to develop these conditions.",Development of Models for the Prediction of Ventilator-Associated Conditions in the Hospital Setting,9254970,R43NR015721,"['Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Classification', 'Clinical Trials', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Decision Trees', 'Delirium', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Event', 'Family', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Logit Models', 'Machine Learning', 'Marketing', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Nurses', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Pneumonia', 'Preventive', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Probability', 'Provider', 'Quality of Care', 'Records', 'Resources', 'Respiratory Failure', 'Sales', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Trees', 'Validation', 'Ventilator', 'Vision', 'Work', 'Work of Breathing', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'design', 'forest', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'meetings', 'model design', 'model development', 'multiple chronic conditions', 'novel', 'older patient', 'patient oriented', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'prophylactic', 'prospective', 'shared decision making', 'tool', 'ventilator-associated pneumonia', 'wasting']",NINR,"ORIGENT DATA SCIENCES, INC.",R43,2016,147653,0.02587500973126515
"The Next Frontier in Diabetes Communication: Promoting Health Literacy in the Era of Secure Messaging ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Limited health literacy (HL) places individuals at greater risk of type 2 diabetes (DM2) and its complications, is a marker of vulnerability, and presents a critical clinical and public health problem. To be health literate in the 21st century, patients will need a certain level of linguistic facility, in combination with technical skills, to access services via online patient portals. Our research has shown that DM2 patients with limited HL are actively using patient portals. However, as healthcare becomes increasingly dependent on electronic communications (e.g., secure messages via internet-based patient portals), patients with limited HL may have difficulty communicating electronically with their clinician or understanding their clinician's secure message responses or instructions. For clinicians to electronically provide meaningful and actionable information and support, their secure messages must be written in an easily comprehended style. Few studies have examined how patients with limited HL interact with their healthcare providers via patient portals. This trans-disciplinary proposal, involving a team of health services researchers, health communication scientists, and computational linguists, will focus on a population of ethnically diverse DM2 patients and their primary care providers from 1) a large, integrated group model HMO with a well-developed patient portal and 2) a county-run, integrated public (safety net) delivery system with a newly launched electronic health record and patient portal. Our study is designed around a conceptual framework promoted most recently by the Institute of Medicine: overcoming the challenges LHL patients face in managing DM2 requires that healthcare systems, and their clinicians, make accommodations to meet patients' communication needs. The degree of linguistic ""mismatch"" observed in secure message exchanges between DM2 patients and their providers, measured using computational linguistics, will serve as one indicator of the extent to which providers are, or are not, making such accommodations. Our specific aims are to (Aim 1) develop and validate a novel, automated linguistic complexity profile (LCP) to assess secure message content generated by DM2 patients and their providers via patient portals. We will employ natural language processing (NLP) to develop and validate the LCP, based on secure messages and data from >200,000 DM2 patients. The LCP will demonstrate construct validity with patient HL and patient reports of provider communication, and will be associated with DM2 outcomes; (Aim 2) examine whether concordance between provider and patient LCP is associated with adherence among DM2 patients newly prescribed insulin or antidepressants; (Aim 3) characterize the collaborative nature of exchanges between providers and low LCP patients, using mixed methods, to enhance our understanding of communication in the critical period surrounding initiation of insulin or antidepressants; (Aim 4) create an automated, LCP-based prototype to provide real-time feedback to providers while writing secure messages to reduce linguistic complexity and better accommodate DM2 patients' linguistic skills and HL. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Limited health literacy places individuals at greater risk of type 2 diabetes and its complications, making limited health literacy a critical clinical and publi health problem. As healthcare becomes increasingly dependent on electronic communications, patients with limited health literacy may have difficulty communicating by email with their clinician or understanding the clinician's emailed replies or instructions. This proposal will use computational linguistics to examine how diabetes patients with a variety of health literacy levels interact with their clinicians via patient portals, will explore whether linguistic gaps between patients and clinicians are associated with diabetes outcomes, and will create a feedback tool to assist clinicians to better accommodate diabetes patients' communication needs.",The Next Frontier in Diabetes Communication: Promoting Health Literacy in the Era of Secure Messaging,9146397,R01LM012355,"['Adherence', 'Advocate', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Computational Linguistics', 'Computer software', 'County', 'Data', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronic Mail', 'Face', 'Feedback', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'Health', 'Health Communication', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Services', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hypoglycemia', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Information Services', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Instruction', 'Insulin', 'Internet', 'Linguistics', 'Measures', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Regimen', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Secure', 'Series', 'System', 'Technical Expertise', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Visit', 'Writing', 'arm', 'base', 'communication aid', 'critical period', 'design', 'ethnic diversity', 'frontier', 'health care delivery', 'health care service utilization', 'health literacy', 'improved', 'literate', 'meetings', 'novel', 'profiles in patients', 'prototype', 'research study', 'response', 'safety net', 'service utilization', 'simulation', 'skills', 'tool', 'uptake']",NLM,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2016,628346,0.008793635840113013
"Statistical methods for biosignals with varying domains DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Clinical care and large observational studies are characterized by periods of intense health monitoring during hospital visits followed by long periods of low-intensity or no-monitoring between visits. Data obtained during in-hospital visits come from a host of new technologies, such as very densely sampled biosignal recordings (EEG, ECG, health scores) and high resolution multi-modality imaging (MRI, CT, PET). A major characteristic of this type of data is that it is collected for a period of time that is subject-spcific. Indeed, the in-hospital length and amount of monitoring varies between subjects, and is highly informative both for studying health outcomes in the hospital and after discharge. One among many examples is a recent study of subjects admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). For each subject the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, a commonly- used scoring system to measure organ dysfunction in the ICU, was collected daily for each subject for the duration of their ICU stay. The ICU length of stay is different by subject and likely to be highly informative of current and future health outcomes. In this application, a set of relevant problems are conceptualized and distilled to statistical aims to address specific complexities associated with this type of data sampling. Specifically, the proposal addresses the following fundamental unsolved problems in studies that collect high density biosignals: 1) introducing statistical models for the association between high density biosignals with uneven support and health outcomes; 2) developing functional registration-by-prediction models that transform the support of biosignals to provide best prediction of health outcomes; and 3) developing models for describing the cross-sectional and longitudinal variability of biosignals obtained in studies with rare -but intense- health monitorin. While focus lies on research studies that collect quasi- continuous ultra-high resolution biosignals for subject-specific lengths of time, methods will be generalizable to many other studies with similar data sampling structures. 2 PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project provides analytic methods for biological and health signals that are measured often for unequal periods of time (e.g. disease severity scores during hospital stays, EEG data during sleep, reaching hand movement after stroke). Special emphasis is given to the study of the association between these biosignals and health outcomes. 4",Statistical methods for biosignals with varying domains,9081248,R01HL123407,"['Address', 'Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Applications Grants', 'Biological', 'Characteristics', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electroencephalography', 'Event', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Length', 'Length of Stay', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Observational Study', 'Organ', 'Organ failure', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Severity of illness', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Study Subject', 'Survival Analysis', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Visit', 'Width', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'clinical care', 'density', 'experience', 'hazard', 'imaging modality', 'indexing', 'kinematics', 'member', 'new technology', 'research study', 'statistics', 'ultra high resolution']",NHLBI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,404000,-0.007935034774988683
"Michigan Hepatotoxicity Clinical Research Network Renewal 2013 DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Drug Induced Liver Injury Network (DILIN) was established in 2003 to advance understanding and research into the causes, pathogenesis, and natural history of DILI. The ongoing Retrospective study has collected 109 DNA samples from subjects with liver injury attributed to one of 8 drugs. In addition, 1215 patients with liver injuy attributed to over 100 individual drugs and herbal and dietary supplements (HDS) have been enrolled and followed for at least 6 months in the ongoing DILIN Prospective study. Manuscripts describing the presenting features and clinical outcomes in the overall cohort and with DILI attributed to specific agents have been published. Ancillary studies exploring the chemical content of implicated HDS products have been initiated. The collected DNA, lymphocytes, serum, plasma, and liver tissue have also been used to conduct informative mechanistic studies. The primary aim of the current application is to continue to recruit and enroll suspected DILI patients as early as possible after liver injury onset for collection of biological samples tobe used in genetic, immunological, transcriptomic, and proteomic studies. It is hypothesized that these studies will lead to improved biomarkers of DILI susceptibility, mechanisms, and outcomes. We also propose novel studies of liver elastography to longitudinally assess disease severity and a pilot clinical trial for patients with severe acute DILI. Recruiting and enrolling cases within 2 weeks of DILI onset at the University of Michigan will be accomplished via use of natural language processing algorithms to search inpatient and outpatient electronic medical records as well as the referral of patients from the 140 physician member Michigan Hepatotoxicity Research Network. A second aim of this application is to continue to explore the role of host genetic variation in DILI susceptibility and outcomes using next generation sequencing techniques in high causality score cases. Exome arrays, whole genome, and whole exome sequencing are proposed to identify rare genetic polymorphisms associated with DILI susceptibility followed by expression system and pathway analysis studies. The third aim of this application is to further develop an accurate and reliable computerized causality assessment instrument that will have improved sensitivity and specificity compared to expert opinion and other currently used methods. The coefficients for specific variables of this instrument will be developed from the DILIN database and tested and validated using future DILIN cases and other acute cases of non-DILI hepatitis. The fourth aim of this application is to further develop the LiverTox website as a comprehensive and authoritative resource on DILI. A LiverTox Executive Committee is proposed to oversee and coordinate the development of a computerized causality assessment instrument as well as the development and maintenance of chapters on liver injury due to prescription drugs and HDS products. Finally, a LiverTox website portal is proposed to allow for the submission of bona-fide DILI cases for causality assessment and potential enrollment into future DILIN studies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The Michigan Hepatotoxicity Research Network proposes to improve our understanding of the causes, mechanisms, and outcomes of drug induced liver injury via the continued enrollment of adult and pediatric patients into the ongoing DILIN Prospective and Retrospective studies. The collection of early blood and urine samples from well-characterized DILI patients will allow for innovative studies of patient, drug and environmental risk factors. Further development of a computerized diagnostic instrument and expansion of the LiverTox website is also planned which will provide doctors, researchers, and the general public an authoritative and up-to-date resource that can help accelerate DILI research in the US and abroad.",Michigan Hepatotoxicity Clinical Research Network Renewal 2013,9132205,U01DK065184,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Anabolic steroids', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Ancillary Study', 'Assessment tool', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Budesonide', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Enrollment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Etiology', 'Exclusion', 'Expert Opinion', 'Floxacillin', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'General Population', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Variation', 'Health', 'Hepatitis', 'Hepatotoxicity', 'Herbal supplement', 'Histopathology', 'Immunologics', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Injury to Liver', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Liver', 'Lymphocyte', 'Maintenance', 'Manuscripts', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Molecular', 'Monograph', 'Natural History', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Plasma', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Prospective Studies', 'Proteomics', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Recovery', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severity of illness', 'Site', 'Specimen', 'Speed', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Valproic Acid', 'Variant', 'Writing', 'chemical property', 'cohort', 'computerized', 'design', 'elastography', 'exome', 'exome sequencing', 'follow-up', 'genetic variant', 'genome analysis', 'genome wide association study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'isoniazid', 'liver injury', 'meetings', 'member', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'pediatric patients', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'repository', 'screening', 'transcriptomics', 'web site', 'whole genome']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U01,2016,268344,-0.003292544246654424
"Aptamer-Based Arrays for Detection of Pathogenic IgA1 O-Glycoforms in IgA Nephropathy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The glycosylation patterns on IgA1 antibodies are highly complex and heterogeneous. When there are dysregulations in activities of glycosylation enzymes, the hinge domain of IgA1's, i.e., the peptide domain connecting constant and variable regions, can undergo shifts in glycosylation patterns and become galactose- deficient (Gd). The galactose deficiency, together with other triggers, can lead to an auto-immune response in which patients' own antibodies form complexes with Gd-IgA1's; these complexes precipitate and cause damage in glomeruli, eventually leading to IgA1 nephropathy (IgAN).  It is of a great interest to monitor regularly Gd-IgA1's of patients who are predisposed to develop nephropathy. Further, increased understanding of correlations between dynamic variations in glycosylation patterns and the natural development of the disease in individual patients is expected to lead to improved interventions, including individually optimized therapies that could block the formation of offending complexes. None of the current approaches to assess microheterogeneity in glycosylation patterns is completely satisfactory; while elegant, these are also arduous and indirect, limited to highly specialized laboratories and difficult to reproduce in actual patients' samples, in large part due to lack of precise, well-characterized, molecular-level analytical tools  We propose to address this issue by systematic isolation of oligonucleotide-based molecular receptors or aptamers that will interact with clusters of different O-glycosides displayed in the hinge subregions. Aptameric receptors will be isolated from large oligonucleotide pools through the process of an in vitro selection and amplification coupled to the affinity separation via interactions with IgA1 hinge regions isolated from both Gd- IgAN patients and healthy controls. Individual aptamers will interact with substructures within the hinge domain, that is, with shorter peptides displaying one or more oligosaccharides. A large number of identified aptamers will be screened for their ability to interact with fractions of polyclonal IgA1's, and a variety of those aptamers that show a quantitatively different response to IgA1s from patients and matched controls will be selected for a more detailed characterization and incorporation in ""classification sensor arrays"" (CSAs).  As the result of our work, we will have immediately a set of aptamers that would together form a classification sensor array, an artificial ""nose"" capable of distinguishing samples belonging to patients with Gd- IgAN from healthy controls, as well as quantifying the extent of shifts in glycosylation patterns. Further molecular-level characterizatio of epitopes (subdomains) that these aptamers recognize is expected to enable studies towards identification of structures that are responsible for auto-immune responses in individual patients, and correlation with secondary triggers of diseases, which are the key step in the rational design of targeted inhibitors of the complex formation.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Complex saccharide structures ('glycans') play crucial roles in a wide range of biological functions and diseases such as autoimmunity, cancer, and nephropathy. We will help elucidate the role of complex glycans in the pathogenesis of IgA nephropathy, one of the most common causes of kidney failure worldwide, by systematically and exhaustively generating oligonucleotide-based receptors (aptamers) for glycan clusters on IgA1 antibodies. This will allow new diagnostic protocols based on pattern recognition with classification arrays and, in the long-term, personalized therapies to prevent antigen-autoantibody interaction and nephropathy.            ",Aptamer-Based Arrays for Detection of Pathogenic IgA1 O-Glycoforms in IgA Nephropathy,9128230,R21DK109690,"['Address', 'Affinity', 'Alkaloids', 'Amino Acids', 'Antibodies', 'Antigens', 'Autoantibodies', 'Autoimmunity', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Biopsy', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Classification', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Deposition', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Dopamine', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Enzymes', 'Epidemiology', 'Epitopes', 'Galactose', 'Glycosides', 'IgA1', 'Immune response', 'Immunoglobulin A', 'Immunoglobulin Constant Region', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region', 'Immunology', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Kidney Failure', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Lectin', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical Genetics', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Nephrology', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Nose', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Olfactory Pathways', 'Oligonucleotides', 'Oligosaccharides', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Peptides', 'Play', 'Polysaccharides', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reagent', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Regulation', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Serum', 'Specificity', 'Sphingosine', 'Steroids', 'Structure', 'Tertiary Protein Structure', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'aptamer', 'base', 'combinatorial', 'cost effective', 'design', 'disorder control', 'glycosylation', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'inorganic phosphate', 'interest', 'multidisciplinary', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'patient stratification', 'personalized medicine', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'receptor', 'response', 'screening', 'sensor', 'sugar', 'tool']",NIDDK,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R21,2016,251130,-0.002863942505315634
"Volatile Metabolite-Based Detection of Clostridium difficile Infection ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is a major cause of nosocomial diarrhea and mortality worldwide, increasing dramatically in incidence and severity over the past decade and rivaling or exceeding methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus as the most common healthcare-associated infection in the US. A critical barrier to reducing the nosocomial spread of CDI is the delay in timely identification of CDI cases, with subsequent delays in initiation of appropriate antimicrobial therapy and implementation of contact precautions and isolation measures to reduce horizontal CDI transmission. Despite advances in rapid laboratory-based CDI testing, there are still delays of 2-5 days between the onset of clinical symptoms and stool sampling and another 0.5-3.5 days between sample collection and actionable test results. Anticipating a delay in obtaining diagnostic results, many providers prescribe CDI antimicrobial therapy empirically, resulting in frequent and unnecessary treatment of patients who ultimately test negative for CDI. There is clearly an unmet need for diagnostic methods that can reduce this interval between onset of clinical symptoms and accurate identification of CDI. To address this unmet need, we propose a novel approach to CDI diagnosis based on detection of the volatile metabolome of the altered CDI microbiome. C. difficile flourishes in the antibiotic- disrupted intestinal microbiome and emits a distinctive odo detectable by human and canine olfaction. In a pilot study, we assessed the volatile metabolome of stool specimens from patients with suspected CDI using analytical chemistry techniques and discerned major differences in the stool volatome of patients with and without CDI. We propose two aims executed in parallel, to test the hypothesis that the altered CDI intestinal microbiome has a unique volatile metabolite profile, distinct from the profile of patiens with other causes of antibiotic-associated diarrhea, which can be used to identify patients with CDI in the hospital setting. Using thermal desorption GC-MS/MS to capture and identify these trace volatile metabolites and supervised learning methods - support vector machines, prediction analysis for microarray analysis, and random forests - to analyze this high-dimensional data matrix, we will deconvolute the complex volatome of CDI, (1) identifying the characteristic volatile metabolite profile of stool samples from hospitalized patients with CDI, compared to patients with other antibiotic-associated diarrhea, and (2) defining the CDI volatile metabolite profile in ambient air samples from the inpatient environment of patients with CDI, compared to patients with other antibiotic-associated diarrhea. The ultimate objective of this research is to derive and validate the volatile metabolic signature of CDI in stool samples and in the patient's environment, laying the groundwork for a novel CDI assay that can be coupled to a point-of-care gas sensor system for the bedside identification of CDI, reducing delays in diagnosis and decreasing nosocomial transmission of this common, highly morbid, and life- threatening infection. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is a major cause of healthcare-associated diarrhea and death worldwide, increasing dramatically in incidence and severity over the past decade. The objective of the proposed research is to identify and validate key components of the distinctive volatile metabolic 'scent' of CDI in stool and in air samples from the patient environment, laying the groundwork for a rapid bedside test for the detection of CDI. Such an assay would reduce the interval between the onset of CDI symptoms and diagnosis, allowing earlier treatment of patients with CDI, reducing unnecessary antibiotic use in patients without CDI, and decreasing healthcare-based transmission of this common, life-threatening infection.",Volatile Metabolite-Based Detection of Clostridium difficile Infection,9088345,R21AI119692,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Address', 'Air', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Antibiotics', 'Antigens', 'Biological Assay', 'Canis familiaris', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clostridium difficile', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Diarrhea', 'Early treatment', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Exotoxins', 'Exposure to', 'Feces', 'Gases', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infection Control', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Injury', 'Inpatients', 'Institution', 'Intestines', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Length of Stay', 'Life', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Fragmentography', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Nucleic Acid Amplification Tests', 'Odors', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pilot Projects', 'Proliferating', 'Provider', 'Pseudomembranous Colitis', 'Reference Standards', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Sampling', 'Septic Shock', 'Severities', 'Smell Perception', 'Specimen', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Toxic Megacolon', 'Toxin', 'Training', 'Tube', 'accurate diagnosis', 'air sampling', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'cytotoxicity', 'design', 'forest', 'gut microbiome', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'metabolome', 'methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus', 'microbiome', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'point of care', 'sample collection', 'sensor', 'tertiary care', 'transmission process', 'unnecessary treatment']",NIAID,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R21,2016,221875,-0.00521189888618523
"Comparative Effectiveness of Oral Anticoagulants in Atrial Fibrillation ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Atrial fibrillation (AF), a common cardiac arrhythmia, affects >2 million Americans and is associated with increased morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs. Adequate antithrombotic treatment in AF is critical to preventing stroke and other complications. To date, this has been mostly achieved with vitamin K antagonists (warfarin in the US). Warfarin use, however, is burdensome and carries a significant risk of complications. Recently, new oral anticoagulants (OACs; dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban) have proved in randomized trials to be at least as efficacious as warfarin in preventing stroke in AF patients. Randomized trials, however, are not always generalizable to the usual clinical setting. Therefore, additional research is necessary to determine the effectiveness of these new OACs, compared to warfarin, and to identify patients more likely to benefit from the new medications. In this application, we propose to assess the following specific aims: (1) to estimate the effectiveness of new OACs versus warfarin treatment in the prevention of ischemic stroke, systemic embolism, healthcare utilization, and mortality;(2) to assess the risk of bleeding and other complications (myocardial infarction, dyspepsia) associated with use of new OACs versus warfarin in these patients; (3) to identify patient subgroups, defined by age, sex, race/ethnicity, comorbidities, and use of other medications, for which the new OACs are particularly beneficial or hazardous; and (4) to develop and validate risk predictive models of stroke / cardioembolic complications and severe hemorrhage in AF patients using new OACs. To address these research questions, we will use two large claim databases, OptumInsight and MarketScan. These databases include health insurance claims from over 1 million patients with AF, and >155,000 users of new OACs. State- of-the-art methods for comparative effectiveness research, including high-dimensional propensity scores, marginal structural models, and instrumental variables, will be used to adjust for confounding. Results from our research will provide key evidence to help patients and clinicians make decisions about their anticoagulant treatment, balancing benefits and risks associated with different therapeutic options. This proposal also has the potential to inform decisions by regulatory agencies, insurers, health system leaders, and professional organizations in issues such as post marketing approval, reimbursements, and clinical guidelines. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Limited information exists on the ""real-world"" effectiveness of new oral anticoagulants compared to warfarin in the treatment of patients with atrial fibrillation,a common cardiac arrhythmia. The proposed research will provide timely and necessary information to help clinicians and patients make well-founded decisions on the use and choice of oral anticoagulants.

"Effectiveness of IG-IMRT for Locally Advanced Cervix Cancer on NRG Trial CVM-1421 ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Cervical cancer is among the leading causes of cancer death worldwide. Patients often have poor access to screening and vaccination, and present in advanced stages, for which chemoradiotherapy (chemoRT) is the standard of care. This treatment is limited, however, by high rates of failure and toxicity. Although intensifying chemotherapy can improve tumor control and survival, toxicity is often unacceptably high. Strategies to reduce toxicity while increasing efficacy of chemoRT are therefore needed.  Standard pelvic RT techniques encompass large volumes of normal tissue. In contrast, image-guided intensity-modulated RT (IG-IMRT) is a modern technique that maximizes target dose and minimizes normal tissue dose. Multiple studies have found that IG-IMRT can significantly reduce organ dose and reduce toxicity compared to standard RT. These studies support the hypothesis that IG-IMRT can permit delivery of more intensive chemotherapy. For example, gemcitabine, a potent radiosensitizer, has been found to improve survival for cervical cancer patients in randomized trials (Dueñas-Gonzalez et al.). However, the toxicity when delivered with standard RT is extreme (>80% grade 3-4 toxicity). Therefore, this regimen has not replaced cisplatin alone as the standard of care. In contrast, our research group has found that the maximum tolerated dose of gemcitabine was increased when given with IG-IMRT. A large international multi-institutional trial has also found lower rates of toxicity with IG-IMRT compare to standard chemoRT. These findings support the hypothesis that IG-IMRT, by reducing bowel and bone marrow dose, could permit delivery of more effective concurrent chemotherapy. If confirmed, this would have significant implications for many pelvic malignancies. However, this hypothesis has not been tested in a randomized trial.  CVM-1421 is an emerging NCI-funded randomized phase II trial within the NRG Oncology Cooperative Group that will test the hypothesis that adding concurrent triapine, a ribonucleotide reductase inhibitor, to concurrent cisplatin and RT can improve outcomes in patients with locoregionally advanced cervix cancer undergoing definitive chemoradiation. This trial presents a unique opportunity to study the effects of IG- IMRT on normal tissue toxicity, as it will be the first cooperative group trial to permit IG-IMRT in this population. This trial also presents an opportunity to study ways to improve IG-IMRT quality, as there has been considerable controversy in how to optimally design IG-IMRT plans, due to their increased complexity. The goal of our research is to study the effect of IG-IMRT on toxicity, quality of life, and treatment outcomes, under varying intensities of chemotherapy. We will also implement a novel technique called knowledge-based planning (KBP) in order to improve plan quality and achieve optimal IG-IMRT dose distributions. This research could help establish IG-IMRT as a new standard of care for pelvic malignancies, and will lay groundwork for future studies testing novel technologies in clinical trial settings. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  In this study, we will test the hypothesis that image guided intensity modulated radiation therapy (IG-IMRT) will reduce hematologic and gastrointestinal toxicity compared to standard pelvic radiotherapy in cervical cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy and cisplatin with or without triapine. We are in an optimal situation to ask this question because the randomized phase II trial that will set the background for our study is evaluating the efficacy of more intensive chemotherapy while allowing both IG-IMRT and standard radiation treatment techniques. It would be beneficial for clinicians and patients to know whether IG-IMRT will reduce toxicity and improve quality of life.

Adequate antithrombotic treatment in AF is critical to preventing stroke and other complications. To date, this has been mostly achieved with vitamin K antagonists (warfarin in the US). Warfarin use, however, is burdensome and carries a significant risk of complications. Recently, new oral anticoagulants (OACs; dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban) have proved in randomized trials to be at least as efficacious as warfarin in preventing stroke in AF patients. Randomized trials, however, are not always generalizable to the usual clinical setting. Therefore, additional research is necessary to determine the effectiveness of these new OACs, compared to warfarin, and to identify patients more likely to benefit from the new medications. In this application, we propose to assess the following specific aims: (1) to estimate the effectiveness of new OACs versus warfarin treatment in the prevention of ischemic stroke, systemic embolism, healthcare utilization, and mortality;(2) to assess the risk of bleeding and other complications (myocardial infarction, dyspepsia) associated with use of new OACs versus warfarin in these patients; (3) to identify patient subgroups, defined by age, sex, race/ethnicity, comorbidities, and use of other medications, for which the new OACs are particularly beneficial or hazardous; and (4) to develop and validate risk predictive models of stroke / cardioembolic complications and severe hemorrhage in AF patients using new OACs. To address these research questions, we will use two large claim databases, OptumInsight and MarketScan. These databases include health insurance claims from over 1 million patients with AF, and >155,000 users of new OACs. State- of-the-art methods for comparative effectiveness research, including high-dimensional propensity scores, marginal structural models, and instrumental variables, will be used to adjust for confounding. Results from our research will provide key evidence to help patients and clinicians make decisions about their anticoagulant treatment, balancing benefits and risks associated with different therapeutic options. This proposal also has the potential to inform decisions by regulatory agencies, insurers, health system leaders, and professional organizations in issues such as post marketing approval, reimbursements, and clinical guidelines. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Limited information exists on the ""real-world"" effectiveness of new oral anticoagulants compared to warfarin in the treatment of patients with atrial fibrillation,a common cardiac arrhythmia. The proposed research will provide timely and necessary information to help clinicians and patients make well-founded decisions on the use and choice of oral anticoagulants.

"Development of a Multi-Modal Neuroimaging Biomarker for Amyotrophic Lateral Scler DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive degenerative motor neuron disease involving the motor cortex, corpus callosum, cortical spinal tract and spinal anterior horn neurons. The disease has a uniformly fatal outcome, although the clinical presentation and course is quite heterogeneous, with median survival times between 2 - 4 years. Approximately 30,000 people in the United States are living with ALS. There is no definitive diagnostic test for ALS. Confident diagnosis is primarily based on clinical assessment and relies on the detection of upper motor neuron (UMN) and lower motor neuron (LMN) signs in multiple body segments, together with a history of progression of symptoms. Evaluation of LMN pathology may be supplemented by electromyography, but UMN pathology can remain occult as it is only assessed using clinical examination which can lead to diagnostic uncertainty. Unfortunately, there is on average a one- year delay between the onset of symptoms and diagnosis for this rapidly progressive disease; this delay prevents early treatment with emerging disease-modifying drugs. Thus, reliable biomarkers for the early diagnosis and disease prognostication are needed.  Conventional magnetic resonance imaging techniques provide limited and inconsistent information in ALS patients. Therefore, there has been and continues to be great interest in using advanced neuroimaging techniques to establish improved markers of the disease. Although advanced neuroimaging techniques such as magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and resting state functional connectivity (fcMRI) have identified differences between ALS patients and healthy controls, they lack sufficient accuracy to reliably classify individual patients. To meet this important unmet need, the proposed study will use novel advanced neuroimaging techniques to develop a multimodal biomarker of ALS, and validate a discrimination and prediction model to refine the diagnostic clinical workup for ALS. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: There are no definitive tests for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and many of these patients have a delayed diagnosis preventing early intervention with new emerging treatments. Furthermore, disease prognosis is challenging due to the variability of the natural history of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. This study will use multiple advanced neuroimaging methods to build a robust diagnostic test and prognostic model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. We will use a novel statistical approach to develop and validate the models.",Development of a Multi-Modal Neuroimaging Biomarker for Amyotrophic Lateral Scler,9052846,R01NS082304,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Anterior', 'Anterior Horn Cells', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical assessments', 'Corpus Callosum', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Electromyography', 'Evaluation', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Horns', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Life', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Motor Neuron Disease', 'Motor Neurons', 'Natural History', 'Neuraxis', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Process', 'Progressive Disease', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Riluzole', 'Spinal', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Transcend', 'Uncertainty', 'United States', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'diagnosis evaluation', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'interest', 'meetings', 'neuroimaging', 'neurotransmission', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'response', 'screening', 'spinal tract', 'treatment response', 'treatment trial']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2016,1,-0.010727918566981439
"Optical Tomographic Imaging of Peripheral Arterial Disease DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to build and test a dynamic vascular optical tomographic imaging (DVOTI) system that can be used to detect and monitor peripheral arterial disease (PAD). PAD is estimated to affect approximately 8 to 12 million individuals in the United States. However, the disease is considerably under-diagnosed, since most patients are asymptomatic and no single reliable screening modality has been established. Most of the undiagnosed and untreated patients are diabetics. They commonly suffer from peripheral neuropathy and hence do not sense and report symptoms (such as pain) that are early signs of the disease. Consequently more than 60% (~65,000 per year) of all lower extremity amputations in the United States are performed in diabetic patients with PAD. With the number of diabetic patients expected to triple and reach almost 100 million by 2050, the problems related to undiagnosed PAD will only rise in the years to come  The most widely used diagnostic test for PAD, determination of the ankle-brachial index (ABI) in conjunction with pulse-volume recordings (PVR), is known to be unreliable for diabetics. And even in non- diabetics, ABI with PVR and all other existing diagnostic tests (such as Duplex Ultrasound or Magnetic resonance angiography), only provides accurate information about proximal occlusions in major arteries of the leg. However, none of these tests assess the distal perfusion of the foot where most complications, such as ulcers and gangrene, typically occur. Monitoring the success of surgical interventions, such as angioplasty or bypass surgery, suffers from the same shortcomings, as physicians are limited to the same suite of tests that are inadequate to assess the perfusion of the foot.  Dynamic VOTI promises to overcome the limitations of current diagnostic and monitoring techniques and has the potential to initiate a paradigm shift concerning how vascular diseases are assessed. In preliminary studies we have shown that DVOTI can provide three-dimensional time-series images that provide valuable information about the perfusion of the vascular bed in feet of PAD patients. The near-infrared light used in the instrument has no adverse health effects and measurements can be repeated frequently to monitor post interventional progress. Therefore, we believe that DVOTI will prove to be a safe and accurate method to diagnose and monitor PAD in non-diabetic and diabetic patients. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to build and test a novel optical imaging system that will allow for the diagnosis and monitoring of peripheral artery disease (PAD), which affects approximately 8 to 12 million individuals in the United States. The disease is considerably under-diagnosed, especially in diabetic patients, the elderly, and patients with kidney disease. The system will address an unmet need to directly assess the degree of blood perfusion in the feet, where most PAD-related complications occur, which lead to over 65,000 amputations each year.",Optical Tomographic Imaging of Peripheral Arterial Disease,9116282,R01HL115336,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Air', 'Algorithms', 'Amputation', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Angioplasty', 'Ankle', 'Arteries', 'Blood Vessels', 'Bypass', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Classification', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diffusion', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Distal', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Ensure', 'Gangrene', 'Geometry', 'Head', 'Health', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Lead', 'Leg', 'Light', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Angiography', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Peripheral Nervous System Diseases', 'Peripheral arterial disease', 'Physicians', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Preventive measure', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stroke', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment outcome', 'Ulcer', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Vascular Diseases', 'blood perfusion', 'data acquisition', 'design', 'diabetic', 'diabetic patient', 'evaluation/testing', 'experience', 'foot', 'healthy volunteer', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging system', 'indexing', 'instrument', 'light emission', 'non-diabetic', 'novel', 'older patient', 'optical imaging', 'post intervention', 'prototype', 'screening', 'success', 'theories', 'tissue phantom', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'vascular bed']",NHLBI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2016,553894,0.005962835461614206
"Bioenergetics and Rehabilitation in Older Patients with Acute Heart Failure ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Older adults exhibit poor recovery and are at high risk for rehospitalization after acute heart failure. Current rehabilitation and clinical management strategies have shown only modest benefits because the mechanisms underlying poor outcomes remain under recognized and therefore unmitigated. The proposed study will address this critical knowledge gap by examining the role of systemic mitochondrial bioenergetic capacity as a fundamental factor underlying poor physical function in hospitalized acute decompensated heart failure, the success of rehabilitation, and the prognosis of patients following hospitalization. This will be accomplished in a highly translational and cost-effective manner as an ancillary study to REHAB-HF (R01AG045551; PI: Kitzman), a multi-center clinical trial funded by the NIA that tests the hypothesis that impaired physical function underlies adverse outcomes in older hospitalized ADHF patients and employs a novel rehabilitation program that targets multiple domains of physical function for 12 weeks beginning during hospitalization. The results of REHAB-HF can impact clinical practice; however, its outcomes do not directly address potential mechanisms of action. Mitochondrial function is likely candidate for mediating physiological decline in REHAB-HF participants, because these organelles are sensitive to a myriad of intrinsic and extrinsic factors related to aging, physical function, heart failure, and hospitalization.  Mitochondrial dysfunction across multiple tissues has been implicated in physiological decline associated with heart failure and is thought to be mediated by circulating factors that affect systemic bioenergetic capacity. Therefore, we propose that respirometric profiling of circulating cells can be used to report on systemic bioenergetic decline in heart failure patients and will be associated with physical function and long term outcomes - including rehospitalization rate. We will determine whether the REHAB-HF rehabilitation program increases bioenergetic capacity, compared to control, thereby improving functional outcomes. Bioenergetic profiling of multiple blood cell populations will enable us to identify the specific cell types and bioenergetic parameters, or patterns comprised of multiple variables, that are most closely associated with REHAB-HF outcomes such as physical function and quality of life. We will also determine the ability of blood cells to report on systemic bioenergetic decline y examining relationships with mitochondrial function measured in skeletal muscle. Successful strategies for mitigating poor physical function and improving long-term outcomes rely on the identification of mechanisms that contribute to the vulnerability of patients after discharge. Bioenergetic profiling may enable the identification of patients in need of more intensive management and targeted rehabilitation. The advancement of blood-based bioenergetic profiling will enhance the use of this promising test in future trials, and potentially, in the cliical care of older patients with the wide range of chronic medical conditions associated with physical disability and poor clinical outcomes.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed project will examine the role of mitochondrial bioenergetics in the physical function of older adults hospitalized for acute heart failure, and th long term rehabilitation outcomes of these patients. Understanding the mechanisms that underlie the success of recovery will lead to improved treatment strategies that can be personalized in order to maximize benefits for individual patients. The results of this study can improve the management of older adults hospitalized with acute heart failure and will be generalizable to the broader issues of age-related bioenergetic decline and post-hospitalization syndrome.        ",Bioenergetics and Rehabilitation in Older Patients with Acute Heart Failure,9112221,R21AG051077,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Ancillary Study', 'Bioenergetics', 'Blood', 'Blood Cells', 'Blood Platelets', 'Cardiac', 'Caring', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Trials', 'Comorbidity', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Exercise stress test', 'Exhibits', 'Fatigue', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Heart failure', 'Hormones', 'Hospitalization', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Medicare', 'Mitochondria', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'Myocardium', 'Organelles', 'Outcome', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Oxygen Consumption', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physical Function', 'Physically Handicapped', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Protons', 'Quality of life', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation Outcome', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Reporting', 'Respiration', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skeletal Muscle', 'Stress', 'Syndrome', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'adverse outcome', 'age effect', 'age related', 'base', 'cell type', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cytokine', 'exercise intolerance', 'follow-up', 'functional outcomes', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'long-term rehabilitation', 'mitochondrial dysfunction', 'monocyte', 'novel', 'older patient', 'outcome forecast', 'primary outcome', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'rehabilitation management', 'respiratory', 'success', 'treatment strategy']",NIA,WAKE FOREST UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R21,2016,190640,-0.029237462005875396
"Using the electronic health record to identify children likely to suffer last-minute surgery cancellation PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Last-minute cancellation of surgery frequently leads to psychological stress and financial hardships that disproportionately affect individuals of low socioeconomic status. Moreover, cancellation leaves unutilized healthcare resources valued as high as $1 per second. Machine learning can uncover patterns in historical data to identify predictors, and captures relationships among many factors to allow assessment of risk associated with a particular set of conditions. There is a critical need to develop a model system through machine learning both to understand and to predict cancellation. The long-term goal is to develop evidence- based strategies for improved perioperative resource utilization and efficiency. The overall objective in this application is to develop and deploy an analytical model for predicting last-minute surgical cancellations. The central hypothesis is that a predictive model based on patient-specific and contextual factors will accurately determine the probability of cancellation. The hypothesis has been formulated on the basis of preliminary data showing that risk of cancellation varies substantially with respect to data extracted from the electronic health record (EHR). The rationale for the proposed research is that development of a model that can accurately predict the probability of last-minute cancellation of surgical procedures is likely to provide new opportunities for improving healthcare costs and efficiency. The hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: 1) Develop computerized models for predicting surgery cancellation; 2) Identify key predictors of last-minute cancelation of surgery from the EHR and online data resources; and 3) Establish a scalable last-minute surgery cancellation prediction system. Under the first aim, using a pre-existing database and machine- learning techniques already established as feasible in the applicants' hands, patient-specific and contextual data from two pediatric surgical sites in a large Midwest conurbation will be mined. Under the second aim, these predictive models will be interrogated to generate actionable advice. Under the third aim, the optimal model will be identified and integrated into the clinical workflow to direct cancellation prevention and mitigation strategies. The approach is innovative, in the applicants' opinion, because it represents a substantial departure from the status quo by employing machine-learning techniques on large and detailed datasets drawing from the modern EHR and publicly available contextual data. The proposed research is significant because it will both have broad translational importance in perioperative management and also elucidate the etiology of cancellation. The positive impact is expected to be in facilitating quality improvement projects and operating room management strategies to increase utilization of expensive perioperative resources. Successful completion of the proposed research is also expected to lead to more timely surgeries at lower cost for hundreds of thousands of patients, which is of vital importance at a time when the cost of healthcare is ever increasing. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because a clinically useful approach to decreasing last- minute cancellations of surgery will provide new opportunities to reduce healthcare expenditures and improve overall efficiency. The project is relevant to AHRQ's mission by making surgical care more accessible, equitable, and affordable.",Using the electronic health record to identify children likely to suffer last-minute surgery cancellation,9223041,R21HS024983,[' '],AHRQ,CINCINNATI CHILDRENS HOSP MED CTR,R21,2016,119761,-0.028907571055367457
"Practical Prognostics Project Summary/Abstract (Walker WC; Practical Prognostics) Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a very heterogeneous anatomical and physiological condition with extremely variable outcomes. For survivors of higher TBI severity grades, functional recovery is usually incomplete and protracted, and can range from total dependence to full recovery. While this offers hope for specific individuals, it also creates enormous uncertainty in prognosis. Facing this uncertain future, patients and their families desperately want and need meaningful prognostic information. Unfortunately, the extensive TBI outcomes literature has largely failed to inform clinical prognosis, and predicting long- term functional outcome remains particularly challenging. For TBI severities greater than mild, the standard clinical prognosis given is “time will tell” or “we honestly don't know.” Clearly, better clinically relevant prognostic models are needed. This study will analyze clinical data from survivors of closed TBI enrolled in multi-center database (NIDILRR TBI Model Systems; N>14,000) and develop a set of user-friendly prognostic tools for 1, 2, and 5 year functional outcomes (Glasgow Outcome Scale and employment). Models will be built using classification tree methodology that permits multiway splits, a more robust way of estimation compared to the few past TBI studies using decision tree methods. First, TBI severity will be stratified by post-traumatic amnesia duration, then select clinical variables (injury, health, and demographic) will be entered. The result will be a set of prognostic tools that will empower providers to give meaningful prognostic information to survivors and their families. It will also help set rehabilitation expectations and serve as a basis for preliminary rehabilitative treatment planning. Using the information found in the models, several post-injury modifiable conditions will also be assessed to find patient groups at risk for having poorer outcomes from these conditions and potential candidates for targeted therapy. The specific aims of our proposed study are as follows: 1. Build the decision tree prognostic models for long-term GOS and employment outcomes 2. Assess their generalizability in large, independent datasets from TBI-MS and [exploratory aim] patients  in the Transforming Research and Clinical Knowledge in TBI II database. 3. Using the classifications of outcomes from the previous method, assess how modifiable conditions  (depression, anxiety, substance misuse, emotional problems) are related to the outcomes after adjusting  for the demographic and baseline injury characteristics using the predictions from the prognostic tool. Project Narrative (Walker WC; Practical Prognostics) Individuals who survive traumatic brain injury (TBI) face a very uncertain future, with a wide variation in potential functional outcomes ranging from total dependence to full recovery. The main purpose of this study is to develop a set of prognostic tools that is tailored to the individual patient and will give better long-term forecasts on chances for returning to independent living and work. It will also assess several conditions that are common after TBI, such as depression and anxiety, and measure their impact on outcome in order to find high risk groups who may need targeted therapy.",Practical Prognostics,9173087,R21HD089097,"['Algorithms', 'Amnesia', 'Anxiety', 'Biological Models', 'Caring', 'Categories', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Trees', 'Dependence', 'Emotional', 'Employment', 'Enrollment', 'Face', 'Family', 'Fostering', 'Future', 'Glasgow Outcome Scale', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Independent Living', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Long-Term Care', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Persistent Vegetative State', 'Physiological', 'Provider', 'Randomized', 'Recovery', 'Recovery of Function', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stratification', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Survivors', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Trees', 'Uncertainty', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Walkers', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'caregiving', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'empowered', 'expectation', 'flexibility', 'functional outcomes', 'high risk', 'individual patient', 'outcome forecast', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'prognostic tool', 'rehabilitation strategy', 'substance misuse', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'trait', 'treatment planning', 'user-friendly']",NICHD,VIRGINIA COMMONWEALTH UNIVERSITY,R21,2016,190625,0.00028120473210603146
"Naltrexone Treatment DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In this international pilot study we use data from four clinical trials of heroin dependence treatment to identify which patients will be better respondents to naltrexone treatment and among respondents which type of naltrexone formulation (oral, implantable, or injectable) leads to the best outcome. Although in the United States naltrexone has been FDA approved for treatment of opioid addiction it has been underutilized. In Russia (where substitution therapy is illegal), naltrexone is the only pharmacological treatment option. Naltrexone is available in three forms: oral and extended release, injectable, and implantable depot-formulations. A novel methodology (Model-based Random Forest, mobForest) (Garge et al. 2013) will be extended to heroin treatment and to the development of a single interpretable parsimonious model. These methods will be applied to combined data from past four naltrexone efficacy randomized double blind, double dummy, placebo- controlled clinical trials and identify which patients are likely to respond to different naltrexone formulations. These studies were conducted in St. Petersburg, Russia, have data on almost 1,000 patients with more than 400 individual-level variables spanning demographics, clinical, genetic, and psychometrics domains. We will develop validated predictive models that provide prognosis of patients' response. We will provide clinically- relevant interpretations to cross-cultural clinical practice, and assess potential use in a larger multi-country study.

"Endotypes of thrombocytopenia in the critically ill Thrombocytopenia is extremely frequent in critically ill patients. However, the role of acute platelet responses in critically ill patients is not well studied, and the multifactorial etiology of thrombocytopenia in the ICU makes it difficult to understand, or understand whether or not to treat it. In several situations such as traumatic injury or sepsis, very low platelet counts have been to bleeding, thrombosis and end-organ injury. Platelets have been extensively studied as a key component of hemostasis, but a rapidly emerging concept is that platelets are also key effector cells in systemic inflammatory processes as both instigators of local and systemic inflammatory reactions and also participants in the inflammation that contributes to tissue injury. The link between platelets and inflammation is complex and bidirectional, as inflammatory ligands have been shown to regulate platelet function and activated platelets induce inflammatory responses in other cell types. The overarching theme of this proposal is to study platelet dynamics in critically ill patients, construct clinical endotypes of thrombocytopenia in this population, and to relate these endotypes to underlying mesoscale mechanisms through computational modeling. We will use a large electronic health record-based database and a tri-state trauma database as source data to construct these endotypes. We define endotype as clinical patterns defined along four dimensions: (1) baseline information (demographic, chronic disease burden, severity of illness and admitting diagnosis), (2) features of the platelet count time series (rate of decrease, nadir, etc.), (3) concurrent interventions, and (4) outcome. The computational approach will attempt to root clinical endotypes in mechanistic interpretations (or collections of alternative interpretations), contributing to focus basic science investiagtions, and to close key knowledge gaps preventing the design and use of targeted anti-platelet-inflammatory therapies in the critically ill. Computational models will be developed at different levels of complexity, with a specific attention to tie underlying mechanisms to functional assays routinely performed in thrombocytopenic patients, such as prothrombin time, activated coagulation time, and thromboelastogram. Platelets is a blood component playing a central role in coagulation and the inflammatory response. A low platelet counts is seen extremely often in acutely ill patients. This proposal will use large databases to find patterns associated with low platelets, how decreasing or low platelet counts are associated with disease and outcome, and use computer model to link the time evolution of platelet counts to mechanisms of disease.

"Health Information Technology in Heart Failure Care DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Patients with heart failure experience four million hospitalizations per year in the United States. Of these hospitalizations, approximately three-quarters, or three million hospitalizations annually, are for causes other than heart failure. Patients with heart failure who are hospitalized for other causes are at high risk of post- discharge mortality possibly in part because they are less likely to receive guideline recommended care than patients who are hospitalized primarily for heart failure. Health information technology (HIT) has the potential to improve patient care by enhancing clinician compliance with evidence-based guidelines. Specifically, clinical decision support systems (CDSS) have been used to improve care for patients in hospitals, including those hospitalized for heart failure. Despite their utility, CDSSs have not been developed to apply more broadly to patients with heart failure who are hospitalized for other causes. This is clearly a gap for the millions of patients with heart failure who might experience improved outcomes if they were to receive guideline recommended care. The purpose of this study is to develop and test a CDSS for hospitalized patients who have heart failure, regardless of reason for hospitalization. The firt aim is to develop an Electronic Health Record (EHR) based algorithm to identify patients with heart failure using a variety of computational techniques including natural language processing. The second aim is to develop a CDSS to support delivery of guideline recommended care to hospitalized patients with heart failure using human computer interaction techniques. The third aim is to implement and test the effectiveness of the CDSS on processes of care for patients with heart failure who are hospitalized for other causes. The central hypothesis is that this decision support system will increase adherence to guideline recommended care, ideally improving outcomes as a result. The candidate, Saul Blecker, MD, MHS, is a general internist and clinician investigator at NYU School of Medicine. The candidate proposes a program of career development and training to achieve the following objectives: 1) develop expertise in medical informatics; 2) gain skills in human computer interaction; 3) develop expertise in implementation research. The candidate's primary mentor, Stuart Katz, MD, MS, is a seasoned mentor and researcher in heart failure. His co-mentor is Gilad Kuperman, MD, PhD, a leader in health information technology and medical informatics. Donna Shelley, MD, MPH, an expert in implementation and effectiveness research, will serve as an additional co-mentor. This mentorship team will work closely together to guide Dr. Blecker toward his research goal of leveraging HIT to improve the quality care for patients with heart failure. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Patients with heart failure are hospitalized three million times annually for other causes. These hospitalizations are associated with poor quality of care and high morbidity and mortality. We propose to leverage health information technology to improve outcomes for these patients by creating a novel system of reminders to ensure that hospitalized patients with heart failure receive guideline recommended care.",Health Information Technology in Heart Failure Care,9144768,K08HS023683,[' '],AHRQ,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,K08,2016,158304,0.02217424005533187
"Phase 2 Clinical Trial of Coralmyn for Coral Snake Bite (BB-IND 13926,01/02/09) Abstract Background: Each year, poison control centers report approximately 75 bites by coral snakes (Micrurus and Micruroides species) in the United States. More than half of these occur in Florida, with the rest concentrated in the southeastern states, westward as far as Texas. Before the introduction of anti-coral antivenom by Wyeth in 1967, approximately 10% of Micrurus bites were potentially fatal, due to ventilatory failure caused by neurotoxins active at the neuromuscular junction. Wyeth Ayerst has recently ceased production of this antivenom. In October of 2009, the last vials will expire, leaving the U.S. without a licensed supplier of antivenom. Objectives: Licensure of a new antivenom product, Coralmyn. Specific Aims: (1) Demonstrate the safety of Coralmyn in patients bitten by Micrurus coral snakes, by monitoring recipients for Type I and Type III immune reactions. (2) Demonstrate the value of plasma venom levels as a surrogate endpoint in coral snake bites by relating venom levels to severity of envenomation, before and after treatment. (3) Demonstrate that cost of treatment is different for patients presenting to hospitals with and without antivenom in stock, and use patient cost data to complete a pharmacoeconomic model comparing distribution methodologies applicable to Phase 3 or 4 study design. Research Design and Methods: This will be an open-label Phase 2 clinical trial of Coralmyn (anti-coral serum injectable solution, Instituto Bioclon, S.A. de C.V.) in male and female human patients of any age who present for emergency care following bites by coral snakes of genus Micrurus. Using grant funds, as many hospitals as economically feasible (at least 3 in Florida) will be provided with antivenom with which to enroll patients promptly in the study, using a central IRB. Patients presenting to other sites may enroll in the study either by interhospital transfer or by emergency delivery of antivenom to out-of-network hospitals. In all cases, clinical observations and plasma for venom levels will be collected at study enrollment and hourly until start of study drug. Following infusion of antivenom, clinical observations and plasma collection will be repeated at intervals until hospital discharge; and telephone follow-up will continue through day 22. Clinical and financial data will be extracted by examination of patient records including standardized data collection sheets completed prospectively by hospital staff and extracted into Case Report Forms secondarily by study staff at a central site. Plasma will be frozen and held for batch analysis every six months, using a Micrurus-specific ELISA assay. Statistical analysis of safety indicators will be conducted using Cox Proportional Hazard or survival models. Venom levels will be analyzed using a combination of logistic regression and ANOVA and compared with neurological assessments using a Generalized Linear Mixed Model. Cost data will be entered into a decision-tree model constructed in TreeAge HealthcarePro, and sensitivity analysis will be performed using MonteCarlo simulation. Project Narrative: Bites by coral snakes can be fatal if the bitten person does not receive antivenom promptly, but the only U.S. manufacturer of coral snake antivenom has stopped making it. This study will test the safety of a new antivenom in patients bitten by coral snakes, it will show whether testing for venom in the bloodstream is a useful way to determine how bad of a bite a person has, and it will show whether it is cost-effective to stock investigational antivenom in just a small number of places if there is no licensed antivenom for hospitals to buy.

"Identification of patients with diabetes at high risk for treatment failure ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The overall goal of this project is to improve quality of care of patients with diabetes by identifying patients who may have particular difficulty reaching treatment targets and who could therefore potentially benefit from additional resources. Investigators propose to achieve this goal by developing a technology to accurately identify patients at high risk for not reaching blood glucose target to enable cost-effective implementation of resource-intensive interventions that improve glycemic control in high-risk individuals.  Improving blood glucose control in patients with diabetes could both improve their quality of life by reducing diabetes complications and decrease costs. Some patients that face particularly high barriers to glucose control may benefit from additional resources that are too expensive to apply to broad patient populations. However, it is not currently possible to identify patients at high risk not being able to reach blood glucose targets with sufficient accuracy to make these interventions cost-effective.  One reason for this is that a large fraction of critical information about the patients' functional status, social circumstances and other important factors that may present barriers to glucose control is only found in narrative documents, from which it is difficult to extract. Furthermore, the amount of information about any single patient i the medical record is enormous, and is impossible to process efficiently using standard analytical algorithms such as regression analysis.  In the proposed project investigators will combine two novel technologies - natural language processing of electronic provider notes and artificial intelligence technology Dynamic Logic - to help circumvent these challenges to build a high-accuracy model of risk of not being able to reach blood glucose targets in patients with diabetes. Natural language processing will identify key concepts documented in the provider notes and will help translate their text into a compendium of facts about the patient. Dynamic Logic makes use of a limited number of iterative approximations to reduce the complexity of a problem with multiple predictor variables from exponential to approximately linear. Utilization of Dynamic Logic will therefore allow to greatly increasing the number of factors / variables that can be considered for the models for prediction of failure to reach glucose control, and ultimately improve their accuracy. Consequently this translational multidisciplinary project will both advance our understanding of the risk factors for not being able to reach glucose control for patients with diabetes and assist in real-life implementation of interventions that can help lower their blood glucose, decrease the rate of diabetes complications, improve the patients' quality of life and help control the rising costs of healthcare.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Lowering blood glucose of patients with diabetes could both improve their quality of life and reduce healthcare costs, but may be more difficult for some patients than others. Patients who have particularly high barriers to blood glucose control could benefit from extra resources, but it can be challenging to identify them in advance. In this projec the investigators will combine advanced computational technologies including artificial intelligence and natural language processing to identify patients with diabetes at high risk for difficulty lowering blood glucose to help make commitment of additional resources cost-effective.                ",Identification of patients with diabetes at high risk for treatment failure,8902473,R41DK105612,"['Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Blood Glucose', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Caring', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electronics', 'Epidemic', 'Face', 'Failure', 'Fee-for-Service Plans', 'Glucose', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Incentives', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Kidney Failure', 'Language', 'Life', 'Life Style', 'Logic', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neuropathy', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Quality of Care', 'Quality of life', 'Regression Analysis', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Translating', 'Transportation', 'Treatment Failure', 'analytical method', 'base', 'blood glucose regulation', 'combinatorial', 'commercial application', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'functional status', 'glycemic control', 'high risk', 'improved', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'new technology', 'patient population', 'public health relevance', 'social']",NIDDK,LP INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY,R41,2015,223336,0.013810405652416678
"Machine learning with generative mixture models for fetal monitoring     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): For many years, there has been a concerted effort to automate the analysis of fetal heart rate (FHR) rhythms. However, despite significant advances in biomedical signal analysis, there has not been any significant improvement in automated decision support systems. FHR monitoring is now ubiquitous throughout delivery rooms, especially using the non-invasive Doppler monitor, but also using the fetal scalp electrode. Physician classification of fetal heart rate patterns is known to be a non-trivial problem because of significant inter and intra-observer variability of diagnosis. This has led to a marked increase in the number of caesarean deliveries, thereby increasing risk to the fetus and mother in many cases. This has further motivated the machine learning community to automate the classification procedure in the interest of accuracy and consistency as well as robustness with respect to noise. Usual approaches to this involve some type of supervised classification procedure, where the algorithm output on training data is compared with a ""gold-standard"" physician classification, followed by testing and validation on new datasets. However, since physician classification can be unreliable in the presence of the aforementioned diagnostic variability, as well as significant tracing noise, we propose the use of unsupervised algorithms to cluster FHR data records into clinically useful categories. We use nonparametric Bayes theory and Markov-time-dependence models for the evolution of feature sequences to propose methods that will achieve improved accuracy. The methods involve extraction of feature sequences from FHR time series data, which are modeled as samples from finite or infinite Dirichlet mixture models. We then use Gibbs sampling to obtain the cluster probabilities for each dataset. Clustering outcomes are compared against direct physician diagnosis and our current results are seen to be in broad agreement with them, while still giving new information on the character of different sub-groups of FHR records. With the proposed research, further gains in classification performance will be made.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Fetal heart rate monitoring is now commonly used during childbirth and, at present, physicians read and interpret these data to classify fetal heart rate patterns and make sure that the baby is not in distress during the course of labor. However, there is great variability in how individual doctors interpret the tracings and this has led increases in the number of caesarean deliveries, thereby potentially increasing risk to both mothers and babies. Thus there has been a concerted effort from the machine learning community to develop an accurate automatic reading and classification procedure so that correct interpretation of fetal heart rates during labor is more diagnostic and consistent.            ",Machine learning with generative mixture models for fetal monitoring,8816208,R21HD080025,"['Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Apgar Score', 'Bayesian Method', 'Behavioral', 'Birth', 'Categories', 'Childbirth', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Delivery Rooms', 'Dependence', 'Dependency', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Distress', 'Electrodes', 'Evolution', 'Feedback', 'Fetal Heart', 'Fetal Heart Rate', 'Fetal Monitoring', 'Fetus', 'Freedom', 'Gold', 'Individual', 'Intraobserver Variability', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Litigation', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Mothers', 'Motivation', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Reading', 'Records', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scalp structure', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Umbilical cord structure', 'Uncertainty', 'Uterine Contraction', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'cost', 'fetal', 'improved', 'interest', 'pressure', 'public health relevance', 'stem', 'theories', 'vector']",NICHD,STATE UNIVERSITY NEW YORK STONY BROOK,R21,2015,234571,0.001070978190098684
"Reliable Seizure Prediction Using Physiological Signals and Machine Learning ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): For most individuals living with epilepsy, seizures are relatively infrequent events occupying a small fraction of their life. Despite spending as little a 0.01% of their lives having seizures (typically only minutes per month), people with epilepsy take anti-epileptic drugs (AED) daily, suffer AED related side effects, and spend their lives dreading when the next seizure will strike. The apparent randomness of seizures is associated with significant psychological consequences. In addition, despite daily AED approximately 1/3 of patients continue to have seizures. We hypothesize that epilepsy can be more effectively treated, both the seizures and their psychological impact, by providing patients with real-time seizure forecasting. Periods of low seizure probability would not require AEDs, or at least lower doses of AEDs, thus reducing AED exposure and their side effects. Periods of high seizure probability may respond to acute AED and patients could alter their activities to avoid injury. Patients would be empowered to manage their medications and life activities using reliable seizure forecasts. In this grant we investigate the hypothesis that seizures are predictable events, and pursue accurate, clinically relevant seizure forecasting using recent advances in support vector machines (SVM), data-analytic models, and Universum-SVM applied to continuous intracranial EEG (iEEG) in focal canine epilepsy. This is an initial step in establishin a new treatment paradigm for focal epilepsy, whereby the probability of seizure occurrence is continuously tracked for patient warning and intelligent responsive therapies. Naturally occurring focal canine epilepsy is an excellent model for investigation of seizure forecasting because of the clinical and electrophsyiological similarity to focal human epilepsy. This study provides a unique opportunity to study seizure forecasting in naturally occurring canine epilepsy under uniform conditions (the same environment). Importantly, dogs are large enough to accommodate devices designed for human use. The hypotheses driving this proposal are that focal seizures are not random events and there are brain states associated with low or high probability of seizure occurrence, and that these states can be reliably classified using machine learning approaches (SVM & Universum-SVM) that combine features from iEEG, behavioral state tracking, and electrocardiogram (ECG) heart rate variability. The goal of this proposal is to develop reliable seizure forecasting (when possible) and improved understanding (data characterization) when good forecasting is not possible.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This grant proposes to develop the capability for accurate, reliable seizure forecasting using recent advances in support vector machines, data-analytic models, and Universum-SVM applied to continuous intracranial EEG canines with naturally occurring epilepsy.

"Deep Learning and Streaming Analytics for Prediction of Adverse Events in the ICU ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)     Critical care medicine in the United States costs over 80 billion dollars annually. Over the past decade the rate of intensive care unit (ICU) use has been increasing, with a recent study reporting almost one in three Medicare beneficiaries experiencing an ICU visit during the last month of their lives. Every year, sepsis, a medical condition characterized by whole-body inflammation, strikes between 800,000 and 3.1 million Americans, killing approximately one in four patients affected. There is currently no definite treatment for sepsis in spite of many clinicl trials. However, early detection of sepsis and timely initiation of interventions are widely considered as important determinants of patient survival. However, basic care tasks (such as microbiological sampling and antibiotic delivery within 1 h, fluid resuscitation, and risk stratification using serum lactate or alternative), which are known to benefit most patients, are not performed in a timely manner. Previous literature suggests that high-resolution vital signs (such as heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, etc.), and other sequential measurements within the electronic medical records (EMRs), can be dynamically integrated using Machine Learning techniques to help with early detection of sepsis. With the ubiquity of inexpensive high- capacity storage and high-bandwidth streaming technology it is now possible to monitor patients' vital signs continuously (for instance, the research application developed by the Emory hospital ICU uses IBM's streaming analytics platform to transmit over 100,000 real-time data points per 100 beds, per second). Despite this continuous feed of data, commonly used acuity scores, such as APACHE and SAPS, are based on snapshot values of these vital signs (typically the worst values during a 24 hours period). This limitation is partially due to unavailability of computationally efficient and robust algorithms capable of finding predictive features in multivariate, nonlinear and nonstationary sequential data, which may reveal inter- organ communication and disintegration of causal couplings with critical illnesses such as sepsis.  We have recently developed a novel Machine Learning algorithm to discover automatically a collection of predictive multivariate dynamical patterns in a database of patient time-series, which can be used to classify patients or to monitor progression of disease in a given patient. The primary goal of this proposal is to apply our method to assess the predictive power of high- resolution multivariate time-series of vital signs and sequentially recorded EMR data in the ICU for early detection of sepsis and risk stratification of septic patient. To accomplish this, we aim to benchmark our technique on a large ICU cohort (the MIMIC II database with over 60,000 patients), as well as simulated data from a multiscale mathematical model of influence of inflammatory mediators on dynamical patterns of vital signs. Next, the technique will be externally validated on two separate ICU sepsis cohorts (the Emory Sepsis dataset and the Mayo Clinic Metric dataset). Finally, we will provide a real-time implementation of the proposed algorithm in an streaming environment (such as the IBM streaming analytics), in order to address the Big Data challenge of harnessing real-time, streaming sensor data from bedside monitors within the ICU, while enabling advanced pattern recognition and real-time forecasting. Ultimately we believe these methods can change the current standard of care through faster recognition and initiation of basic care, as well as guiding interventional strategis based on severity of illness and mechanisms underlying physiological deterioration.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    The proposed project is making use of computers to analyze data from sickest patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). We want to develop methods to identify patterns in the patient data which predict who is at risk for mortality and who might respond to various medications which could make them better. We have a very strong team of doctors and researchers who work closely together, covering all aspects of the proposed research, which we hope will help us improve the lives of the sickest patients in the ICU.                ",Deep Learning and Streaming Analytics for Prediction of Adverse Events in the ICU,9044236,K01ES025445,"['Address', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Antibiotics', 'Antihypertensive Agents', 'Beds', 'Benchmarking', 'Big Data', 'Blood Pressure', 'Caring', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computers', 'Critical Care', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Trees', 'Deterioration', 'Differential Equation', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Employee Strikes', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Goals', 'Heart Rate', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Medicare', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Nature', 'Organ', 'Pathologic', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'SCAP2 gene', 'Sampling', 'Sepsis', 'Series', 'Serum', 'Severity of illness', 'Stratification', 'Stream', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telemedicine', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'beneficiary', 'cohort', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'experience', 'feeding', 'improved', 'killings', 'mathematical model', 'mortality', 'multi-scale modeling', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'parallel computer', 'patient safety', 'portability', 'public health relevance', 'respiratory', 'safety practice', 'sensor', 'septic', 'simulation', 'standard of care', 'time use']",NIEHS,EMORY UNIVERSITY,K01,2015,190216,0.010009238545341649
"Identification of Patients with Low Life Expectancy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is increasingly recognized that optimal treatment is not the same for every patient - it depends on the individual patient's circumstances. One important factor that determines the optimal clinical management is the patient's life expectancy, which determines the temporal horizon within which medical decisions have to operate. For example, while adding an extra diabetes medication may save a 40-year-old individual from going blind or developing kidney failure 20 years later, it will not bring any benefits to an 80-yer old with a metastatic malignancy who is expected to live only a few months.  Consequently, it is critical that when we measure quality of care, suggest treatment options to clinicians through clinical decision support or compare different treatment strategies, we take into account the patient's life expectancy. However, currently there are no methods available that can do this with sufficient accuracy.  Most commonly used techniques to assess a patient's mortality risk draw primarily on administrative data and other structured data fields in electronic medical records. This approach leaves out a large amount of information that is only available in narrative documents such as provider notes, radiology reports, etc. In this project we propose to test the hypothesis that application of two novel technologies - artificial intelligence technique Dynamic Logic and natural language processing (NLP) - could leverage the information in narrative electronic documents to significantly improve the accuracy of identification of patients with low life expectancy.  Dynamic Logic allows to circumvent the challenge of combinatorial complexity that limits the number of variables and their combinations that can be considered as predictors of an outcome by most currently used analytical methods. Dynamic Logic makes use of a limited number of iterative approximations to reduce the complexity of a problem with multiple predictor variables from exponential to approximately linear. Utilization of Dynamic Logic will allow us to greatly increase the richness of the models for identification of patients with low life expectancy and ultimately improve their accuracy.  Information such as the patient's functional status that is usually only found in narrative documents may be critical to improving accuracy of identifying frail patients at high mortality risk. Modern NLP techniques can effectively identify key concepts in medical text but until now analytical methods allowed consideration of only a few of pre-selected concepts in prediction models. Combining NLP with Dynamic Logic will allow us to greatly expand the number of concepts from narrative text that could be included in the life expectancy prediction model, likely leading to a considerable improvement in accuracy.  In the proposed translational multidisciplinary project our team that will include experts on artificial intelligence, natural language processing, analysis of data in electronic medical records, and geriatrics will test whether a combination of Dynamic Logic and NLP improves identification of patients at high risk of death.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Identification of patients with limited life expectancy is important for accurate measurement of quality of care delivered by clinicians, clinical decision support in electronic medical records and research that compares different treatment options for patients. However, currently available methods suffer from low accuracy or use information that is not widely available. In this project we propose to combine two advanced computational technologies - artificial intelligence technique Dynamic Logic and natural language processing - to improve accuracy of identification of patients with low life expectancy.            ",Identification of Patients with Low Life Expectancy,8942806,R01HS024090,[' '],AHRQ,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2015,232521,-0.01872139474717315
"Impact of Crouch Gait and Surgical Treatment on Knee Mechanics and Function     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Children with Cerebral Palsy (CP) often exhibit crouch gait, which is characterized by excessive knee flexion during stance. This form of walking is extremely fatiguing and tends to progress until eventually walking ability ceases. A newly revived surgical procedure, distal femoral extension osteotomy (DFEO) and patellar tendon advancement (PTA), simultaneously addresses both knee flexion contractures and patella alta (superiorly displaced patella) that often co-exist in those with crouch. Initial outcoe studies demonstrate greater improvements in gait than conventional surgical treatments. However, complication rates remain high and some patients exhibit little to no improvement in gait after surgery. The first aim of this study is to investigate the effects of patella position, crouch and surgical parameters on functional knee mechanics. Computational knee models will be created that include detailed representations of ligament and articular cartilage geometry within the tibiofemoral and patellofemoral joints. Patella alta and knee flexion contractures will be introduced, and surgical simulations will be performed virtually. The computational models will then be used to simulate knee mechanics when walking in normal, and mild, moderate, and severe crouch gait postures. Probabilistic simulations will then be used to investigate how variability in physical characteristics and surgical factors can contribute to variable outcomes. The effects of surgery and crouch gait on cartilage pressure patterns will also be determined, which is relevant for understanding subsequent skeletal growth and long-term cartilage health. The second aim investigates whether a combination of quantitative measures of physical characteristics and surgical parameters can retrospectively classify post-surgical gait performance. Pre- and post-surgical x- rays will be used to quantitatively measure the Koshino index (metric of patella alta/baja), the magnitude and location of the DFEO, and the PTA advancement distance in patients who previously underwent DFEO+PTA. Pre-surgical measures of knee flexion contracture and spasticity will also be obtained. Pre- and post-operative gait analysis data will be used to assess changes in gait mechanics, while functional surveys will assess changes in performance on activities of daily living. The random forest algorithm will then be used to identify decision trees and associate predictor variables that can classify those patients whose gait and overall function improved after surgery. These results will be interpreted in the context of modeling results from Aim 1, thereby providing a potential mechanistic explanation for clinical observations. The research will impact innumerable CP patients as the DFEO+PTA surgical procedures are adopted around the world, and will also set the groundwork for more rigorous scientific study of other procedures used to treat gait disorders.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Children with Cerebral Palsy (CP) often exhibit a crouch walking posture, which can be extremely fatiguing, painful and disabling as a child grows. Orthopedic surgical procedures are used to correct the physical abnormalities that contribute to crouch, but clinical outcomes remain variable and difficult to predict. This study uses a combination of computational models and retrospective analyses of clinical data to identify the physical and surgical treatment factors that can best restore more normal walking function in CP patients.                ",Impact of Crouch Gait and Surgical Treatment on Knee Mechanics and Function,8815132,R21HD084213,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Aftercare', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Biomechanics', 'Bone Growth', 'Cartilage', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Complication', 'Computer Simulation', 'Contracture', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Decision Trees', 'Distal', 'Exhibits', 'Fatigue', 'Gait', 'Gait abnormality', 'Geometry', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Height', 'Individual', 'Inferior', 'Joints', 'Knee', 'Knee bone', 'Ligaments', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Musculoskeletal', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Orthopedic Surgical Procedures', 'Osteotomy', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Pain', 'Patient Selection', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postoperative Period', 'Posture', 'Procedures', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Selection Criteria', 'Severities', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'Tendon structure', 'Testing', 'Treatment Factor', 'Walking', 'Work', 'articular cartilage', 'crouch gait', 'forest', 'functional outcomes', 'gait examination', 'human subject', 'improved functioning', 'indexing', 'knee mechanics', 'pressure', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'quadriceps muscle', 'restoration', 'simulation', 'skeletal']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R21,2015,217599,0.0022440126566513727
"High Performance Automated System for Analysis of Fast Cardiac SPECT DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Coronary artery disease remains a major public health problem worldwide. It causes approximately 1 of every 6 deaths in the United States. Imaging of myocardial perfusion (delivery of blood to the heart muscle) by myocardial perfusion single photon emission tomography (MPS) allows physicians to detect disease before a heart attack, and predict risk in millions of patients annually. This is currently limited by the need fo visual interpretation, which is highly variable and depends on the physician's experience. The long-term objective of this program is to improve the interpretation of this widely used heart imaging technique-achieving higher accuracy for disease detection than it is possible by the best attainable visual analysis. This proposal builds on our prior work in conventional myocardial MPS, and focuses on fast, low-radiation MPS imaging (fast-MPS) obtained by new high-efficiency scanners. Specifically, we aim to: 1) develop new image processing algorithms for a fully automated analysis of fast-MPS. The algorithms will include better heart muscle detection by training with correlated anatomical data and a novel approach for mapping the probability of abnormal perfusion for each location of the heart muscle; 2) enhance the diagnosis of heart disease from fast-MPS by machine- learning algorithms that integrate clinical data, stress test parameters, and quantitative image features; 3) demonstrate the clinical utility of the new algorithms applied to automatic canceling of the rest portion of the MPS scan, when not needed. The new system will be more accurate than the clinical expert analysis in the detection of obstructive coronary disease. By immediately indicating whether a stress scan is normal, the system will allow for the automatic cancellation of the rest imaging portion when it is not needed (estimated in over 60% of all MPS studies). Our research will demonstrate that the computer decision regarding rest-scan cancellation is safe for the patient, both from a diagnostic and prognostic standpoint. This will lead to a wide adoption of low-dose stress-only imaging for MPS studies, which would reduce the amount of radiation that patients are exposed to, and allow for significant healthcare savings. It will additionally lead to a paradigm shift in the practice of nuclear cardiology, which will ultimately result in better selection of patients who need intervention, and reduce the number of deaths due coronary artery disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Imaging of myocardial perfusion (heart muscle blood flow) at rest and stress allows physicians to detect disease and predict risk in millions of patients in the US each year, but it is currently limited by the need of visual interpretation, which is dependent on doctor's experience. The investigators propose to develop and validate an automated, highly-accurate and objective computer system which will outperform even experienced physicians in interpreting these images using latest generation scanners and novel machine learning computer tools. The computer will be able to better select patients needing treatment and automatically indicate the normal stress-scan immediately, and more accurately than physicians allowing automatic cancellation of the rest imaging, when not needed; this will result in large healthcare savings and reduced radiation to the patients.",High Performance Automated System for Analysis of Fast Cardiac SPECT,8906912,R01HL089765,"['Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Blood', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Computer Systems', 'Computers', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Generations', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Diseases', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'Myocardium', 'Nuclear', 'Patient Selection', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Photons', 'Physicians', 'Probability', 'Public Health', 'Radiation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Savings', 'Scanning', 'Stress', 'Stress Tests', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Training', 'United States', 'Visual', 'Work', 'cardiac single photon emission computed tomography', 'experience', 'heart imaging', 'image processing', 'improved', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'quantitative imaging', 'tomography', 'tool']",NHLBI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2015,685014,-0.002249047416866193
"Improving Adherence and Outcomes by Artificial Intelligence-Adapted Text Messages DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Uncontrolled hypertension is a major cause of morbidity and mortality and many patients fail to take their antihypertensive medication as prescribed. We propose to use artificial intelligence (AI) to allow short message service (SMS or text messages) interventions to adapt to patients' adherence needs and substantially improve medication taking. The aims of the study are to: (1) develop AI methods for adaptive decision-making in human- centered environments and demonstrate the feasibility of the resulting AI-enhanced SMS medication adherence intervention, (2) demonstrate that the intervention can ""learn"" by adapting the SMS message stream according to patients' medication taking over time, and (3) examine potential intervention impact as measured by improvements in medication adherence and systolic blood pressures. We will recruit 100 patients with uncontrolled hypertension and antihypertensive medication non-adherence. Adherence and other covariates will be measured via surveys at baseline, 3- and 6 months; blood pressures will be measured at baseline and 6 months. Participants will be given an electronic pill-bottle adherence monitor. Participants will receive SMS messages designed to motivate antihypertensive medication adherence. Message content and frequency will adapt automatically using AI algorithms designed to automatically optimize expected pill bottle opening. For Aim 1, the first 25 patients will be enrolled to develop and test alternative RL algorithms and fine-tune the system parameters. For Aim 2, we will examine changes in the probability distribution over message-types and compare that distribution with patients' reasons for non-adherence reported at baseline. For Aim 3, we will examine changes in self-reported medication non-adherence and blood pressure and automatically-reported pill bottle openings. This pilot study will establish the feasibility and potential impact of this novel approach to mobile health messaging for self-management support. The results will be used to support an R01 application for a larger and more definitive trial of intervention impacts.

"Multiparametric Prediction of Vasospasm after Subarachnoid Hemorrhage ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (SAH) affects an estimated 14.5 per 100,000 persons in the United States, and is a substantial burden on health care resources, because it can cause long-term functional and cognitive disability. Much of this is due to delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) from vasospasm (VSP). VSP refers to the reactive narrowing of cerebral blood vessels due the unusual presence of blood surrounding the vessel. In its extreme, severe VSP precludes blood flow to brain tissue, resulting in stroke.  SAH is one of the most common disease entities treated in the Neurointensive Care Unit (NICU). Currently, resource planning is scripted around the Modified Fisher Scale, which predicts the odds ratio of developing DCI based on the volume and pattern of blood on initial brain computed tomography (CT). It does not, however, allow for further individualized risk assessments. The first 14 days are occupied by efforts to detect preclinical or early VSP and arrange timely interventions to prevent permanent injury. The only noninvasive tool supported by guidelines to potentially identify preclinical VSP is the transcrania Doppler (TCD), which has an unreliable range of sensitivity and negative predictive values, and is at the mercy of technician availability. If not identified preclinically, VSP must be detected once it is symptomatic and is then dependent on quality and availability of expertise in the complex and diurnal environment of the ICU.  Promisingly, electronic medical record (EMR) data and continuous physiology monitors offer abundant opportunities to risk stratify for future events as well as reveal events in real-time in the acutely brain injured patient. A methodical approach to feature engineering will be performed over a large set of potentially discriminatory data-driven and knowledge-based features. Meta-features representing variations and trends in time series variables will be extracted using a variety of quantitative and symbolic abstraction techniques. Predictive modeling will be performed using Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine.  This project will result in a prediction tool that improves timeliness and precision in VSP classification. It will fill an important gap in the understanding of the potentia of underutilized EMR and physiological data to predict neurological decline. Generating accurate and timely prediction rules from already collected clinical data would be cost effective and have implications not only for SAH patients, but also for almost any monitored patient in any ICU. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    This project will explore the optimal methods for creating a prediction tool that improves timeliness and precision of diagnosis. It will fill an important gap in the understanding of the underutilized potential of electronic medical record and high frequency device monitor data.

"Early CSF detection of FTLD DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) is the second most common cause of dementia among subjects under the age of 65. There are two main FTLD subtypes: FTLD associated with lesions immunoreactive to TDP-43 (FTLD-TDP), and FTLD associated with Tau-immunoreactive lesions (FTLD-Tau). Currently, the exact FTLD pathology cannot be confidently defined until autopsy, and there is an urgent need for ante- mortem biomarker which reliably predict FTLD pathology. Over the past 30 months, I have identified and validated a panel of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) FTLD-TDP biomarkers that identified FTLD-TDP patients with 85% accuracy, including Tau phosphorylation, tripeptidyl peptidase 1 (TPP1) levels, and inflammatory protein levels (FAS, eotaxin-3, IL-23), with 85% accuracy in distinguishing between the two main FTLD subtypes. The identification and validation of these CSF alterations will serve as the basis of the current proposal to translate these markers towards clinical application through multi-site technical validation and advanced classification through machine-based learning, and to better characterize altered biochemical pathways in FTLD-TDP. First, I hypothesize that we can reduce the coefficient of variation for each FTLD-TDP biomarker to under 15% through a multi-site technical validation using 60 banked CSF samples. I will test this hypothesis in Aim 1 by determining technical factors (freeze-thawing, blood contamination, detergent use, protease inhibitor use, buffer condition) which reduce assay precision, and validating the assay at Penn. Second, I hypothesize that machine-based learning/support vector machine approach will better diagnose FTLD-TDP by taking into account non-linear effects of age, gender, and disease duration. I will test this hypothesis in Aim 2 by comparing the classification performance between more established algorithms and the support vector machine algorithm. Lastly, I hypothesize that these biomarker changes reflect altered biochemical pathways in FTLD-TDP. I will test this hypothesis by measuring brain and CSF levels of proteins involved in Tau phosphorylation, TPP1 maturation, and inflammation. As an exploratory Sub-aim 3a, I will determine if any of the changes from Aims 1 & 3 are detectable in asymptomatic subjects carrying familial FTLD-TDP mutations, to power an R01 application on longitudinal CSF biomarker changes in prodromal FTLD-TDP subjects. I will carry out this proposal with guidance from my mentoring team including Allan Levey, MD, PhD (Emory), John Trojanowski, MD, PhD (Penn), James Lah, MD, PhD (Emory), Jonathan Glass, MD (Emory), Leslie Shaw, PhD (Penn), and Eva Lee, PhD (Georgia Tech). I will also obtain formal training in biostatistics, bioinformatics, analytical chemistry, quality control, clinical trial design, geriatrics, and responsible conduct of research. Successful completion of the aims in the current proposal will establish the standard procedures to clinically  translate promising FTLD-TDP biomarkers, determine the best algorithm to diagnose FTLD-TDP using these biomarkers, and identify altered CSF and brain pathways related to these biomarker alterations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: FTLD is the second most common cause of dementia among subjects under the age of 65, and patients and their caregivers face unique challenges including poor judgment on the job, single parents suffering from FTLD with young children, and working spouses as caregivers. There is currently no reliable way to predict the underlying FTLD subtype, and as a result it is challenging to enroll the appropriate patients for substrate-specifi clinical trials (such as drugs targeting TDP but not Tau). This proposal will establish the standardized measurements of FTLD-TDP biomarkers towards translating this research panel into clinical testing, and identify biomarker changes which can be used even when symptoms are very mild. Early and accurate FTLD- TDP diagnosis will enhance future drug development and clinical trial design to alleviate the unique personal, social, and economic burden of FTLD.",Early CSF detection of FTLD,8849802,K23AG042856,"['Accounting', 'Adult', 'Adult Children', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Autopsy', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Buffers', 'Caregivers', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Collection', 'Controlled Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Detergents', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Drug Targeting', 'Economic Burden', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'Face', 'Freezing', 'Frontotemporal Lobar Degenerations', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Geriatrics', 'Glass', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Institutes', 'Judgment', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Occupations', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phosphorylation', 'Procedures', 'Protease Inhibitor', 'Proteins', 'Quality Control', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Sampling', 'Single Parent', 'Site', 'Spouses', 'Staging', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Trials', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Tube', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'age effect', 'base', 'brain pathway', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'design', 'drug development', 'human CCL26 protein', 'illness length', 'improved', 'inflammatory marker', 'interleukin-23', 'model design', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'protein TDP-43', 'public health relevance', 'research clinical testing', 'research study', 'response', 'responsible research conduct', 'social', 'tau Proteins', 'tau phosphorylation', 'tau-1', 'tool', 'tripeptidyl aminopeptidase']",NIA,EMORY UNIVERSITY,K23,2015,156324,-0.008463535097004248
"BIGDATA: Mid-Scale: DA: Techniques to Integrate Disparate Data: Clinical Personalized Pragmatic Predictions of Outcomes (C3PO)     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): An unsolved problem in health informatics is how to apply the past experiences of patients, stored in large-scale medical records systems, to predict the outcomes of patients and to individualize care. One approach to prediction, heretofore impractical, is rapidly finding a patient cohort ""similar enough"" to an index case that the health experiences and outcomes of this cohort are informative for prediction. This task is formidable because of large variability of the vast numbers of patient attributes with the added complexity of sequences of patient encounters evolving over time. Epidemiological considerations such as confounding by indication for treatment also come into play. The objective of this research effort is to (1) create a modular test bed that uses a ""big data"" systems architecture to support research in rapid individualized prediction of outcomes from large clinical repositories and (2) to explore various approaches to making ""pragmatic"" near-term predictions of outcomes. Using the Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) Informatics and Computing Infrastructure database (VINCI), a research database with records of tens of millions of patients, we will explore two synergistic strategies for rapidly finding a cohort of patients that are similar enough to an index patient to predict near-term treatment response and/or adverse effects in an elastic cloud environment: 1) use of temporal alignment of critical events including use of gene sequence alignment methods to relax requirements for exact temporal matching; and, 2) use of conceptual distance metrics to model the degree of content similarity of case records. The initial domain of application will be treatment of Type 2 diabetes. The approach will apply open source ""big data"" methodologies, including Hadoop and Accumulo, to store and filter ""medical log"" files. The content of these ""logs"" will be processed by a combination with strategies including conceptual markup of events using natural language processing tools, matching of event streams, and statistical data mining methods to rapidly retrieve and identify patients that are sufficiently similar to an index case to be able to make personalized yet pragmatic clinical predictions of outcomes. RELEVANCE (See instructions): This proposal studies how to use experience of past patients, stored in electronic medical records systems, to help clinicians make practical decisions on the care of complex patients with type 1 diabetes. Research applies methods adapted from Internet search engines and from studies of the human genome to determine what it means for one patient's disease experiences to be similar to and relevant to another's.              n/a",BIGDATA: Mid-Scale: DA: Techniques to Integrate Disparate Data: Clinical Personalized Pragmatic Predictions of Outcomes (C3PO),8840825,R01GM108346,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Adverse effects', 'Algorithms', 'Beds', 'Benchmarking', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biosensing Techniques', 'Budgets', 'Caring', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Child', 'Child health care', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinic Visits', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer Systems', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Coupled', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Element', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disasters', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Exclusion', 'Extensible Markup Language', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Germ-Line Mutation', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Human Development', 'Human Genome', 'Imagery', 'Informatics', 'Information Systems', 'Institutes', 'Instruction', 'Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Internet', 'Language', 'Letters', 'Location', 'Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Medicine', 'Metadata', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Oncogenes', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Privacy', 'Process', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Records', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Support', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Source', 'Specialist', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translational Research', 'Triage', 'United States National Library of Medicine', 'Variant', 'Veterans', 'Visualization software', 'Vocabulary', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'base', 'bench to bedside', 'cancer type', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'data integration', 'data mining', 'data visualization', 'design', 'emergency service responder', 'experience', 'genetic variant', 'genome analysis', 'genome sequencing', 'improved', 'indexing', 'interoperability', 'medical information system', 'novel', 'open source', 'parallel processing', 'performance tests', 'processing speed', 'repository', 'research study', 'response', 'sugar', 'system architecture', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor progression', 'virtual']",NIGMS,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,R01,2015,529458,-0.007112063639967777
"Improving Heart Transplant Allocation to Reduce High Waitlist Mortality in Women ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is a fundamental gap in understanding why women awaiting heart transplantation have a higher mortality rate than men. The long-term goal of this project is to optimize timing and candidacy for advanced heart failure therapy in order to improve healthcare and reduce heart transplant waitlist mortality. The objective of this research application is to use a contemporary cohort to evaluate sex differences in heart transplant waitlist mortality and create a survival model that better predicts need for advanced heart failure therapy. The central hypothesis is that sex differences in heart failure mortality among patients awaiting transplantation are due to sex differences in prognostic risk factors. The rationale for the proposed research is that sex differences in prognostic risk factors have been identified in other heart failure cohorts and creation of risk prediction models has successfully reduced waitlist mortality for lung, liver, and kidney transplantation. The specific aims of this research proposal are: 1) to identify sex-specific risk factors for survival in heart failure patients awaitng heart transplantation and changes in risk factors over time using the national registry (Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients, SRTR), 2) to develop a survival model for patients awaiting heart transplant using the SRTR database, and 3) to validate that the survival model improves prediction of mortality for the general population of patients awaiting transplantation. The approach is innovative because it challenges and seeks to shift current heart failure research and clinical practice paradigms by taking into account the differences between women and men to create a heart failure survival model that will lay the foundation to change a ""rule based"" hear transplant allocation system to a state of the art ""survival model based"" system. The survival model will be created with innovative machine learning statistical methods that do not require advance knowledge of interactions between variables or the parametric relation of variables (linearity or non-linearity) to patient survival. The proposed research is significant, because few studies have explored sex differences in prognostic risk         factors despite known sex differences in heart failure survival. Furthermore, by creating the first heart failure survival model that includes sex specific risk factors and modern medical/device therapy with adequate representation of women and men we will be significantly advancing the heart failure field. This model, which is derived from our national transplant registry, will improe survival prediction for advanced heart failure patients and can be used to inform and enhance organ allocation policy in the United States. Clinical heart failure studies can also be designed i the future to include women with similar risk of mortality to men in order to improve treatment for both sexes. Ultimately, such knowledge has the potential to empower clinicians and researchers to provide the right therapies for the right patient at the right time. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to public health because women have a higher mortality rate than men while awaiting heart transplantation and the factors contributing to this disparity have not been identified. Thus the proposed research is relevant to the part of NIH's mission to better characterize patients with advanced heart failure and improve health care for both genders.",Improving Heart Transplant Allocation to Reduce High Waitlist Mortality in Women,9125416,R56HL125420,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Cardiomyopathies', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Databases', 'Equilibrium', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gender', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hearing', 'Heart', 'Heart Transplantation', 'Heart failure', 'Kidney Transplantation', 'Knowledge', 'Lung Transplantation', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanics', 'Medical Device', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Oxygen Consumption', 'Patient Rights', 'Patients', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Population Characteristics', 'Public Health', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sex Characteristics', 'Specialist', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Systolic heart failure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Transplantation', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Waiting Lists', 'Woman', 'base', 'candidate selection', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'design', 'empowered', 'expectation', 'hazard', 'improved', 'innovation', 'liver transplantation', 'men', 'mortality', 'organ allocation', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'sex', 'time use', 'transplant registry', 'working group']",NHLBI,CLEVELAND CLINIC LERNER COM-CWRU,R56,2015,285869,0.002659259252134493
"Computational Approach to Personalized Anemia Management DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Effective anemia management in End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) is a complex task due to large variation in erythropoietic response among the ESRD patients. Evidence shows that excessive doses of Erythropoiesis Stimulating Agents (ESA), used in hypo-responsive patients, coincide with increased cardiovascular complications. In addition to health risks, reimbursement restrictions imposed by Medicare demand additional vigilance in ESA administration. Iron is one of the most important elements affecting the erythropoietic response. The ongoing blood losses associated with hemodialysis treatments, increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, and access complications, as well as poor iron absorption lead to iron depletion in ESRD patients. Standard anemia management protocols do not fully address the synergistic nature of interactions between erythropoietin and iron. Personalized strategies for coordinated ESA and iron dosing are therefore necessary to achieve the desired clinical outcome, reduce patient risk exposure, and improve the cost-effectiveness of treatment. Our long-term goal is the advancement of biomedical computing to personalize medicine and pharmacologic management of chronic conditions. The objective of this project is to address the challenge of multiple drug dosing personalization with a specific application to ESA and iron management in anemia of ESRD. The central hypothesis is that a computational approach can be developed to perform coordinated personalized dosing of erythropoiesis stimulating agents and iron in order to achieve desired clinical outcomes and minimize patient exposure resulting in optimal care. The rationale behind the proposed research is that computational models quantifying the interaction between iron and erythropoietin can be applied through the principles of control theory and machine learning, to derive personalized dosing strategies for both agents. The main objective will be accomplished through three specific aims: 1) quantification of the erythropoietin-iron interaction through clinically relevant computational models, 2) application of such models to derive algorithms for coordinated personalized ESA and iron dosing, 3) validation of these algorithms through an ""in sillico"" trial for a wide range o simulated subjects and clinical conditions. The expected outcome of this project is a new systematic approach to the management of ESRD anemia using multiple agents resulting in improved patient care and decreased cost which will be broadly applicable to other therapeutic areas. The proposed research is relevant to public health because personalized dosing of multiple therapeutic agents broadly applicable to many chronic conditions is ultimately expected to improve cost-effectiveness of treatment and minimize patient risk. The proposed research is relevant to the NIH mission because it contributes toward advancement of personalized medicine, one of the top priorities of the NIH.",Computational Approach to Personalized Anemia Management,8914596,R01DK093832,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anemia', 'Area', 'Biomedical Computing', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Complication', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Dose', 'Elements', 'End stage renal failure', 'Erythropoiesis', 'Erythropoietin', 'Exposure to', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hemodialysis', 'Hemorrhage', 'Intestines', 'Iron', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicare', 'Medication Management', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'absorption', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cost', 'cost effectiveness', 'design', 'efficacy testing', 'gastrointestinal', 'improved', 'mathematical model', 'mortality', 'personalized medicine', 'response', 'theories', 'vigilance']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF LOUISVILLE,R01,2015,336757,0.012741586350359508
"Host and Microbial Biomarkers Related to the Development of Complicated Clostridium difficile Infection ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is implicated in nearly 3 million cases of diarrhea and colitis in the U.S. each year. CDI, which disproportionately affects older adults, can result in fulminant, life-threatening colitis and lead to multiple recurrnt episodes. There is an urgent need for validated biomarker-based clinical decision-making tools to predict which patients will experience adverse outcomes from CDI. There is a gap in knowledge regarding which known and yet to-be-discovered biomarkers, derived from the host, microbiome and pathogen, will best predict complications and recurrence. Our long-term goal is to develop and validate accurate risk-prediction models for adverse outcomes following CDI that can be used to guide therapy. The next step in pursuit of that goal, and our overall objective for the proposed research, is to discover new candidate biomarkers and determine which ones together best predict complicated CDI in an adjusted model. Our central hypothesis is that a biomarker-based model will better predict complicated CDI compared to models based on clinical variables alone. To address this hypothesis we propose three specific aims: 1) validate host biomarkers previously shown to associate with complicated CDI; 2) discover novel microbial biomarkers for complicated CDI; and 3) develop a candidate biomarker-based predictive model for complicated CDI. We will collect sera and stool prospectively in a cohort of older adults to determine if characteristics of the microbiome, microbial features of C. difficile, levels of antitoxin antibodies, and/or inflammatory mediators associate with complications. Multivariable models will be constructed using linear regression and machine learning techniques and model diagnostics will be used to generate a final portable, biomarker-based predictive model for use in future studies.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is implicated in nearly 3 million cases of diarrhea and colitis in the U.S. each year. We currently lack a complete understanding as to why certain patients with CDI progress to severe disease with increased complications, including death, while others recover. Our research proposes to discovery objective, readily obtainable indicators from serum/stool that predict adverse outcomes from CDI early after initial disease onset. It is envisioned that this could lead to a paradigm-shift in management by directing specific treatment strategies, including more costly therapeutics such as antibody treatment, fecal transplant and newer antibiotics, towards patients who would most benefit. This research takes the first steps towards development of a biomarker-based predictive tool to aid clinicians in treatment decisions.            ",Host and Microbial Biomarkers Related to the Development of Complicated Clostridium difficile Infection,8987064,R21AI120599,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Aftercare', 'Age', 'Antibiotics', 'Antibodies', 'Antitoxins', 'Bacterial Toxins', 'Biological Markers', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clostridium difficile', 'Colitis', 'Colon', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diarrhea', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Feces', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Hepatocyte Growth Factor', 'Infection', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Interleukin-8', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leukocyte L1 Antigen Complex', 'Life', 'Linear Models', 'Linear Regressions', 'Loop ileostomy', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Monoclonal Antibodies', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patients', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Ribosomal RNA', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Serum', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Toxin', 'Transplantation', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'aged', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'cohort', 'data reduction', 'experience', 'high risk', 'microbial', 'microbial host', 'microbiome', 'mortality', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'predictive modeling', 'procalcitonin', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'secondary outcome', 'tool', 'treatment strategy']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R21,2015,232500,-0.008039535819154498
"Autoimmunity as a Mechanism for Atherosclerosis in COPD ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project will facilitate the development of the principal investigator into an independent translational researcher investigating systemic vascular injury in Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This will be accomplished in the rich academic environment at the University of Pittsburgh, under the guidance of a highly accomplished team of mentors, and in the conduct of multidisciplinary research project that will develop autoimmunity as a novel mechanism for atherosclerosis in COPD. The increased risk of atherosclerosis in COPD is not explained by smoking, age, hypertension, and other established vascular disease risk factors. Chronic inflammation has recently been implicated as an atherogenic mechanism in COPD. We and others have reported that chronic inflammation in COPD may be propagated by humoral autoimmunity. Specifically, smokers with COPD have greatly increased levels of circulating autoantibodies that demonstrate in vitro pathogenic effects. Our subsequent studies also show that these autoantibodies target at least 50 different autoantigens and consistently target glucose regulated protein 78 (GRP78), particularly in patients with parenchymal lung destruction, i.e. emphysema. GRP78 is present in the endoplasmic reticulum, where it regulates the unfolded protein response, and is also a multifunction cell surface receptor. Studies in cancer patients suggest that ligation of the N-terminus of cell surface GRP78 by anti-GRP78 IgG transduces pro-inflammatory and pro-proliferative signals by activation of the AKT pathway, followed by NFκB activation. Additional in vivo studies have identified anti-GRP78 IgG with affinity for the C-terminus of cell surface GRP78 that produce counteracting anti-inflammatory effects by suppressing AKT activation. Our preliminary work shows that circulating anti-GRP78 IgG in COPD patients binds to macrophages and leads to increased NFκB activation and production of atherogenic inflammatory mediators by them. The macrophage is critical in the development of both atherosclerosis and COPD. Also, cross-sectional studies in our cohort find that levels of circulating anti-GRP78 IgG are strongly associated with carotid atherosclerosis in patients with emphysema, independent of established vascular risk factors. Therefore, we hypothesize that autoimmune responses against GRP78 are a mechanism for atherosclerosis in COPD. During this award, we will: (1) Test the hypothesis that elevated levels of circulating anti-GRP78 IgG predict progression of carotid atherosclerosis in patients with emphysema independent of established risk factors over 4 year follow up; (2) Test the hypothesis that anti-GRP78 IgG binds to the N-terminus of cell surface GRP78 and activates the AKT pathway followed by NFκB activation and production of inflammatory mediators using a variety of cell function assays, and provide proof of concept for two potential therapeutic strategies; (3) Test the hypothesis that there are other antigen-specific immune responses associated with atherosclerosis in COPD by using machine learning to analyze high-throughput data on a large number of circulating autoantibody levels.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a lung disease caused by smoking that kills more and more Americans each year, and is now the third leading cause of death in the US. Although it is largely viewed as a disease of the lungs, the most common cause of death in patients with COPD are blockages in blood vessels. This research project will investigate why patients with COPD are so prone to develop these blood vessel blockages.            ",Autoimmunity as a Mechanism for Atherosclerosis in COPD,8860899,K23HL126912,"['Affinity', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Anti-inflammatory', 'Antibodies', 'Antigens', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Autoantibodies', 'Autoantigens', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmune Responses', 'Autoimmunity', 'Award', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cancer Patient', 'Carotid Artery Plaques', 'Carotid Atherosclerotic Disease', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Surface Receptors', 'Cell physiology', 'Cell surface', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum', 'Environment', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Event', 'Figs - dietary', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Immune response', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'In Vitro', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Inflammatory', 'Injury', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Ligation', 'Link', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Peptides', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphorylation', 'Principal Investigator', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Western Blotting', 'Work', 'cohort', 'disorder risk', 'follow-up', 'glucose-regulated proteins', 'in vitro testing', 'in vivo', 'killings', 'macrophage', 'novel', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'targeted treatment']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,K23,2015,132192,-0.014786607415129915
"A Novel eFace System to Prevent the Risks of Facial Distortion after CMF Surgery DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The number of patients suffering from craniomaxillofacial (CMF) deformities and requiring surgical correction is escalating. CMF deformities may involve skeleton, overlying soft-tissues, or the both. Patients with CMF deformities often have psychological problems. The goal of CMF surgery is to reconstruct a normal facial appearance and function, and the outcome of the surgery is judged as such. The current problem is that we do not have a reliable way of simulating the soft-tissue-change following skeletal reconstruction. In treating patients with isolated skeletal defects, the current practice is to normalize the skeleton, hoping for optimal facial appearance. However, because the thickness and contour of the soft-tissue envelope varies from patient to patient, this approach is not reliable. The problem is even bigger in patients with composite defects. For example, in the scenario of a patient with a skeletal deformity and a mild soft-tissue defect, a surgeon would have to know, before surgery, how to overcorrect the skeleton to camouflage the soft-tissue defect. But, this information can only be attained by having an accurate planning system to simulate soft-tissue changes. In addition, from patient's perspective, the final facial appearance is the most apparent to them. Therefore, it is extremely important, for both doctors and patients, to accurately simulate soft-tissue-deformation.  Simulation methods must be accurate and fast. Attaining both is difficult because these attributes are inversely related, the more accurate the model, the longer it takes to prepare and run. Among the most effective, they are empirical-based model, mass spring model, finite element model, and mass tensor model. Unfortunately they are either too inaccurate or too slow, and clinically unacceptable.  Our hypothesis is that facial soft-tissue changes following virtual osteotomy can be accurately simulated by our innovative approach using an anatomically detailed modeling and mapping routine, along with statistical modeling technique. To test our hypothesis, we propose to develop an open source novel imaging informatics platform, eFace system, to accurately simulate soft-tissue-change following virtual osteotomies, and thus to significantly improve the outcomes of patients undergoing facial reconstruction. This approach can not only maintain the integrity of complex facial anatomy to accurately simulate the facial soft tissue deformation, but also significantly improve the computational efficiency in order to fit the requirement for clinical use  This project presents an innovative approach to model the facial soft-tissue deformation. If successful, it will allow accurate simulation of soft-tissue changes after virtual osteotomy. Patients will also be able to foresee the postoperative face preoperatively (patient education) and regain their psychological confidence. Finally, eFace will have significant impact and applications in orthodontics, plastic surgery, general surgery, growth/aging prediction, and forensic science. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In the US and throughout the world, the number of patients requiring surgical correction for facial deformities, which involves skeleton, overlying soft tissu, or both, is escalating every year. 2. Currently, while surgeons are able to accurately plan bone reconstructive surgery, they have to use  their visual imagination with clinical experience to mentally predict the facial soft tissue changes  following the bone surgery because they do not have a reliable way of simulating the soft-tissue-change  that is resulted from skeletal reconstruction. 3.

"Worcester Heart Attack Study DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This population-based study proposes to continue the examination of changing long-term trends in the descriptive epidemiology of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and out-of hospital deaths due to coronary heart disease (CHD) in residents of the Worcester, MA, metropolitan area. The specific objectives of this population- based study are to examine contemporary (2013 and 2015), as compared with prior (1975-2011), trends in the annual incidence and attack rates of AMI, hospital and post-discharge survival rates, management practices, and out-of-hospital deaths attributed to CHD. To accomplish these and several additional secondary study objectives, this investigation will be carried out in the 11 acute care general hospitals providing care for residents of central Massachusetts. All new (incident) and recurrent episodes of definite AMI occurring in greater Worcester residents during 2013 and 2015 will be identified from discharge diagnostic printouts obtained from all metropolitan Worcester hospitals of patients with a primary or secondary discharge diagnosis of AMI and related CHD rubrics. The medical records of these patients will be individually reviewed for validation purposes according to pre-established criteria for AMI. Abstraction of the medical records of patients satisfying the study diagnostic and geographic eligibility criteria will be carried out by trained physicians with the recording of demographic, clinical, treatment, and outcomes related data. A review of records for additional hospitalizations and a search of death certificates will be carried out to examine the long-term survival status of discharged hospital patients from each of the proposed 2 study years, as well as those identified previously, through 2017. Death certificates will be reviewed to identify cases of out-of-hospital deaths attributed to CHD occurring during 2013 and 2015. In addition, we will assess the feasibility of carrying out an innovative approach for ""real time"" surveillance of acute coronary disease in this central MA population through the development of natural language processing systems that will automatically extract clinical information from electronic medical records in our most recently hospitalized patient cohort in 2015. Monitoring contemporary trends in our principal study outcomes remains timely given the ongoing publication and dissemination of treatment guidelines and recommendations by national agencies and emphasis on improving quality in processes of care. Given the ""real world"" setting of this investigation, important contemporary insights would be provided into current gaps between ideal and achieved patient care in the broader community setting, to assist in the development of novel educational approaches and incentives to provide more optimal patient care. The results of this investigation will provide important insights from a 40 year (1975-2015) vantage point about the magnitude of, mortality from, and treatment approaches used in the management of the nation's leading cause of death as it affects residents of a large New England metropolitan area. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The results of the proposed community-based study will provide data about 40 year trends with regards to the changing magnitude of, and outcomes associated with, heart attacks in residents of a large central New England community.

"The Next Frontier in Diabetes Communication: Promoting Health Literacy in the Era of Secure Messaging ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Limited health literacy (HL) places individuals at greater risk of type 2 diabetes (DM2) and its complications, is a marker of vulnerability, and presents a critical clinical and public health problem. To be health literate in the 21st century, patients will need a certain level of linguistic facility, in combination with technical skills, to access services via online patient portals. Our research has shown that DM2 patients with limited HL are actively using patient portals. However, as healthcare becomes increasingly dependent on electronic communications (e.g., secure messages via internet-based patient portals), patients with limited HL may have difficulty communicating electronically with their clinician or understanding their clinician's secure message responses or instructions. For clinicians to electronically provide meaningful and actionable information and support, their secure messages must be written in an easily comprehended style. Few studies have examined how patients with limited HL interact with their healthcare providers via patient portals. This trans-disciplinary proposal, involving a team of health services researchers, health communication scientists, and computational linguists, will focus on a population of ethnically diverse DM2 patients and their primary care providers from 1) a large, integrated group model HMO with a well-developed patient portal and 2) a county-run, integrated public (safety net) delivery system with a newly launched electronic health record and patient portal. Our study is designed around a conceptual framework promoted most recently by the Institute of Medicine: overcoming the challenges LHL patients face in managing DM2 requires that healthcare systems, and their clinicians, make accommodations to meet patients' communication needs. The degree of linguistic ""mismatch"" observed in secure message exchanges between DM2 patients and their providers, measured using computational linguistics, will serve as one indicator of the extent to which providers are, or are not, making such accommodations. Our specific aims are to (Aim 1) develop and validate a novel, automated linguistic complexity profile (LCP) to assess secure message content generated by DM2 patients and their providers via patient portals. We will employ natural language processing (NLP) to develop and validate the LCP, based on secure messages and data from >200,000 DM2 patients. The LCP will demonstrate construct validity with patient HL and patient reports of provider communication, and will be associated with DM2 outcomes; (Aim 2) examine whether concordance between provider and patient LCP is associated with adherence among DM2 patients newly prescribed insulin or antidepressants; (Aim 3) characterize the collaborative nature of exchanges between providers and low LCP patients, using mixed methods, to enhance our understanding of communication in the critical period surrounding initiation of insulin or antidepressants; (Aim 4) create an automated, LCP-based prototype to provide real-time feedback to providers while writing secure messages to reduce linguistic complexity and better accommodate DM2 patients' linguistic skills and HL.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Limited health literacy places individuals at greater risk of type 2 diabetes and its complications, making limited health literacy a critical clinical and publi health problem. As healthcare becomes increasingly dependent on electronic communications, patients with limited health literacy may have difficulty communicating by email with their clinician or understanding the clinician's emailed replies or instructions. This proposal will use computational linguistics to examine how diabetes patients with a variety of health literacy levels interact with their clinicians via patient portals, will explore whether linguistic gaps between patients and clinicians are associated with diabetes outcomes, and will create a feedback tool to assist clinicians to better accommodate diabetes patients' communication needs.

"ICP Elevation Alerting Based on a Predictive Model Hosting Platform DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recurring acute ICP elevations occur frequently and unpredictably among severe brain injury patients. ICP elevation can cause cerebral ischemia and lead to deadly brain herniation if untreated. Hence, prompt recognition and treatment of rising ICP are critical in managing severe brain injury patients. However, existing protocols in most neurocritical care units are reactive where bedside nurses, in response to simple threshold-crossing alarms, have to check numerical display of ICP on monitors to manually establish whether the alarm is a true one before initiating treatment. Acute ICP elevation is accompanied by distinctive ICP pulse morphological changes. By utilizing ICP pulse morphological metrics as input, we can accurately recognize precursors to ICP elevation to alert nurses and free them from a cognitively demanding process of establishing whether a consistent ICP elevation triggers the alarm. We therefore propose to deploy a previously developed accurate ICP elevation prediction model on an open-source model hosting platform to monitor continuous ICP signals and alert bedside nurses. Using this alerting system, we will further investigate the principal physiological abnormalities associated with acute ICP elevation showing different precursory ICP patterns prior to onset of elevation. We will pursue the following three aims: 1) To develop an alerting system for ICP elevation based on a model hosting platform; 2) To investigate whether the ICP alerting system helps nurses more efficiently manage ICP. 3) To detect consistent physiological abnormalities associated with acute ICP elevation. Our long-term goal is to advance intensive care monitoring so that continuous signals from monitors are fully explored to integrate with the rest of clinical data in an electronic medical record (EMR) system to enhance clinical decision making. This project represents an effort piloting a platform-based approach towards overcoming translational barriers that impede the process of making advanced predictive analytics available at point of care. Therefore, broad impacts from this project are related to future efforts at leveraging this open model hosting platform to facilitate the translation of additional predictive models in other ICUs. Recurring acute intracranial pressure (ICP) elevation occurs frequently, up to more than 20 in a 12-hour nursing shift, and unpredictably among severe brain injury patients. These acute ICP elevations needs prompt treatment before they impair blood flow to the brain and cause deadly brain herniation. The present work is built upon our previously developed algorithm of detecting acute ICP elevation and an open software platform for hosting predictive algorithms to further develop and evaluate a real-time ICP elevation alerting system that will provide accurate alerts of impending ICP elevation. Rigorous human factor engineering principles and techniques will be adopted in developing this system and we will further leverage this real-time alerting system to investigate the principal physiological abnormalities that are associated with accurate ICP elevation.",ICP Elevation Alerting Based on a Predictive Model Hosting Platform,8789794,R01NS076738,"['Acute', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Blood flow', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Caring', 'Cerebral Ischemia', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Intensive Care', 'Intracranial Hypertension', 'Intracranial Pressure', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Nature', 'Nurses', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Plumbing', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Rest', 'Signal Transduction', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Trust', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical decision-making', 'cost', 'design', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'interest', 'model building', 'open source', 'point of care', 'predictive modeling', 'response', 'usability']",NINDS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2015,442019,0.008303624983965356
"Statistical methods for biosignals with varying domains DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Clinical care and large observational studies are characterized by periods of intense health monitoring during hospital visits followed by long periods of low-intensity or no-monitoring between visits. Data obtained during in-hospital visits come from a host of new technologies, such as very densely sampled biosignal recordings (EEG, ECG, health scores) and high resolution multi-modality imaging (MRI, CT, PET). A major characteristic of this type of data is that it is collected for a period of time that is subject-spcific. Indeed, the in-hospital length and amount of monitoring varies between subjects, and is highly informative both for studying health outcomes in the hospital and after discharge. One among many examples is a recent study of subjects admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). For each subject the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, a commonly- used scoring system to measure organ dysfunction in the ICU, was collected daily for each subject for the duration of their ICU stay. The ICU length of stay is different by subject and likely to be highly informative of current and future health outcomes. In this application, a set of relevant problems are conceptualized and distilled to statistical aims to address specific complexities associated with this type of data sampling. Specifically, the proposal addresses the following fundamental unsolved problems in studies that collect high density biosignals: 1) introducing statistical models for the association between high density biosignals with uneven support and health outcomes; 2) developing functional registration-by-prediction models that transform the support of biosignals to provide best prediction of health outcomes; and 3) developing models for describing the cross-sectional and longitudinal variability of biosignals obtained in studies with rare -but intense- health monitorin. While focus lies on research studies that collect quasi- continuous ultra-high resolution biosignals for subject-specific lengths of time, methods will be generalizable to many other studies with similar data sampling structures. 2 PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project provides analytic methods for biological and health signals that are measured often for unequal periods of time (e.g. disease severity scores during hospital stays, EEG data during sleep, reaching hand movement after stroke). Special emphasis is given to the study of the association between these biosignals and health outcomes. 4",Statistical methods for biosignals with varying domains,8915740,R01HL123407,"['Address', 'Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Applications Grants', 'Biological', 'Characteristics', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electroencephalography', 'Event', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Length', 'Length of Stay', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Observational Study', 'Organ', 'Organ failure', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Severity of illness', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Study Subject', 'Survival Analysis', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Visit', 'Width', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'clinical care', 'density', 'experience', 'hazard', 'imaging modality', 'indexing', 'kinematics', 'member', 'new technology', 'research study', 'statistics', 'ultra high resolution']",NHLBI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,397940,-0.007935034774988683
"Michigan Hepatotoxicity Clinical Research Network Renewal 2013 DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Drug Induced Liver Injury Network (DILIN) was established in 2003 to advance understanding and research into the causes, pathogenesis, and natural history of DILI. The ongoing Retrospective study has collected 109 DNA samples from subjects with liver injury attributed to one of 8 drugs. In addition, 1215 patients with liver injuy attributed to over 100 individual drugs and herbal and dietary supplements (HDS) have been enrolled and followed for at least 6 months in the ongoing DILIN Prospective study. Manuscripts describing the presenting features and clinical outcomes in the overall cohort and with DILI attributed to specific agents have been published. Ancillary studies exploring the chemical content of implicated HDS products have been initiated. The collected DNA, lymphocytes, serum, plasma, and liver tissue have also been used to conduct informative mechanistic studies. The primary aim of the current application is to continue to recruit and enroll suspected DILI patients as early as possible after liver injury onset for collection of biological samples tobe used in genetic, immunological, transcriptomic, and proteomic studies. It is hypothesized that these studies will lead to improved biomarkers of DILI susceptibility, mechanisms, and outcomes. We also propose novel studies of liver elastography to longitudinally assess disease severity and a pilot clinical trial for patients with severe acute DILI. Recruiting and enrolling cases within 2 weeks of DILI onset at the University of Michigan will be accomplished via use of natural language processing algorithms to search inpatient and outpatient electronic medical records as well as the referral of patients from the 140 physician member Michigan Hepatotoxicity Research Network. A second aim of this application is to continue to explore the role of host genetic variation in DILI susceptibility and outcomes using next generation sequencing techniques in high causality score cases. Exome arrays, whole genome, and whole exome sequencing are proposed to identify rare genetic polymorphisms associated with DILI susceptibility followed by expression system and pathway analysis studies. The third aim of this application is to further develop an accurate and reliable computerized causality assessment instrument that will have improved sensitivity and specificity compared to expert opinion and other currently used methods. The coefficients for specific variables of this instrument will be developed from the DILIN database and tested and validated using future DILIN cases and other acute cases of non-DILI hepatitis. The fourth aim of this application is to further develop the LiverTox website as a comprehensive and authoritative resource on DILI. A LiverTox Executive Committee is proposed to oversee and coordinate the development of a computerized causality assessment instrument as well as the development and maintenance of chapters on liver injury due to prescription drugs and HDS products. Finally, a LiverTox website portal is proposed to allow for the submission of bona-fide DILI cases for causality assessment and potential enrollment into future DILIN studies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The Michigan Hepatotoxicity Research Network proposes to improve our understanding of the causes, mechanisms, and outcomes of drug induced liver injury via the continued enrollment of adult and pediatric patients into the ongoing DILIN Prospective and Retrospective studies. The collection of early blood and urine samples from well-characterized DILI patients will allow for innovative studies of patient, drug and environmental risk factors. Further development of a computerized diagnostic instrument and expansion of the LiverTox website is also planned which will provide doctors, researchers, and the general public an authoritative and up-to-date resource that can help accelerate DILI research in the US and abroad.",Michigan Hepatotoxicity Clinical Research Network Renewal 2013,8920543,U01DK065184,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Anabolic steroids', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Ancillary Study', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Budesonide', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Enrollment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Etiology', 'Exclusion', 'Expert Opinion', 'Floxacillin', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'General Population', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Health', 'Hepatitis', 'Hepatotoxicity', 'Histopathology', 'Immunologics', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Injury to Liver', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Liver', 'Lymphocyte', 'Maintenance', 'Manuscripts', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Molecular', 'Monograph', 'Natural History', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Plasma', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Prospective Studies', 'Proteomics', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Recovery', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severity of illness', 'Site', 'Specimen', 'Speed', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Valproic Acid', 'Variant', 'Writing', 'chemical property', 'cohort', 'computerized', 'design', 'dietary supplements', 'elastography', 'exome', 'exome sequencing', 'follow-up', 'genetic variant', 'genome analysis', 'genome wide association study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'isoniazid', 'liver injury', 'meetings', 'member', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'pediatric patients', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'repository', 'screening', 'transcriptomics', 'web site']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U01,2015,335210,-0.003292544246654424
"Volatile Metabolite-Based Detection of Clostridium difficile Infection ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is a major cause of nosocomial diarrhea and mortality worldwide, increasing dramatically in incidence and severity over the past decade and rivaling or exceeding methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus as the most common healthcare-associated infection in the US. A critical barrier to reducing the nosocomial spread of CDI is the delay in timely identification of CDI cases, with subsequent delays in initiation of appropriate antimicrobial therapy and implementation of contact precautions and isolation measures to reduce horizontal CDI transmission. Despite advances in rapid laboratory-based CDI testing, there are still delays of 2-5 days between the onset of clinical symptoms and stool sampling and another 0.5-3.5 days between sample collection and actionable test results. Anticipating a delay in obtaining diagnostic results, many providers prescribe CDI antimicrobial therapy empirically, resulting in frequent and unnecessary treatment of patients who ultimately test negative for CDI. There is clearly an unmet need for diagnostic methods that can reduce this interval between onset of clinical symptoms and accurate identification of CDI. To address this unmet need, we propose a novel approach to CDI diagnosis based on detection of the volatile metabolome of the altered CDI microbiome. C. difficile flourishes in the antibiotic- disrupted intestinal microbiome and emits a distinctive odo detectable by human and canine olfaction. In a pilot study, we assessed the volatile metabolome of stool specimens from patients with suspected CDI using analytical chemistry techniques and discerned major differences in the stool volatome of patients with and without CDI. We propose two aims executed in parallel, to test the hypothesis that the altered CDI intestinal microbiome has a unique volatile metabolite profile, distinct from the profile of patiens with other causes of antibiotic-associated diarrhea, which can be used to identify patients with CDI in the hospital setting. Using thermal desorption GC-MS/MS to capture and identify these trace volatile metabolites and supervised learning methods - support vector machines, prediction analysis for microarray analysis, and random forests - to analyze this high-dimensional data matrix, we will deconvolute the complex volatome of CDI, (1) identifying the characteristic volatile metabolite profile of stool samples from hospitalized patients with CDI, compared to patients with other antibiotic-associated diarrhea, and (2) defining the CDI volatile metabolite profile in ambient air samples from the inpatient environment of patients with CDI, compared to patients with other antibiotic-associated diarrhea. The ultimate objective of this research is to derive and validate the volatile metabolic signature of CDI in stool samples and in the patient's environment, laying the groundwork for a novel CDI assay that can be coupled to a point-of-care gas sensor system for the bedside identification of CDI, reducing delays in diagnosis and decreasing nosocomial transmission of this common, highly morbid, and life- threatening infection.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is a major cause of healthcare-associated diarrhea and death worldwide, increasing dramatically in incidence and severity over the past decade. The objective of the proposed research is to identify and validate key components of the distinctive volatile metabolic 'scent' of CDI in stool and in air samples from the patient environment, laying the groundwork for a rapid bedside test for the detection of CDI. Such an assay would reduce the interval between the onset of CDI symptoms and diagnosis, allowing earlier treatment of patients with CDI, reducing unnecessary antibiotic use in patients without CDI, and decreasing healthcare-based transmission of this common, life-threatening infection.            ",Volatile Metabolite-Based Detection of Clostridium difficile Infection,8954018,R21AI119692,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Address', 'Air', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Antibiotics', 'Antigens', 'Biological Assay', 'Canis familiaris', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clostridium difficile', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Diarrhea', 'Early treatment', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Exotoxins', 'Exposure to', 'Feces', 'Gases', 'Healthcare', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infection Control', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Injury', 'Inpatients', 'Institution', 'Intestines', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Length of Stay', 'Life', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Fragmentography', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Nucleic Acid Amplification Tests', 'Odors', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pilot Projects', 'Proliferating', 'Provider', 'Pseudomembranous Colitis', 'Reference Standards', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Sampling', 'Septic Shock', 'Severities', 'Smell Perception', 'Specimen', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Toxic Megacolon', 'Toxin', 'Training', 'Tube', 'accurate diagnosis', 'air sampling', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'cytotoxicity', 'design', 'forest', 'innovation', 'methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus', 'microbiome', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'point of care', 'public health relevance', 'sample collection', 'sensor', 'tertiary care', 'transmission process']",NIAID,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R21,2015,266063,-0.00521189888618523
"Comparative Effectiveness of Oral Anticoagulants in Atrial Fibrillation ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Atrial fibrillation (AF), a common cardiac arrhythmia, affects >2 million Americans and is associated with increased morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs. Adequate antithrombotic treatment in AF is critical to preventing stroke and other complications. To date, this has been mostly achieved with vitamin K antagonists (warfarin in the US). Warfarin use, however, is burdensome and carries a significant risk of complications. Recently, new oral anticoagulants (OACs; dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban) have proved in randomized trials to be at least as efficacious as warfarin in preventing stroke in AF patients. Randomized trials, however, are not always generalizable to the usual clinical setting. Therefore, additional research is necessary to determine the effectiveness of these new OACs, compared to warfarin, and to identify patients more likely to benefit from the new medications. In this application, we propose to assess the following specific aims: (1) to estimate the effectiveness of new OACs versus warfarin treatment in the prevention of ischemic stroke, systemic embolism, healthcare utilization, and mortality;(2) to assess the risk of bleeding and other complications (myocardial infarction, dyspepsia) associated with use of new OACs versus warfarin in these patients; (3) to identify patient subgroups, defined by age, sex, race/ethnicity, comorbidities, and use of other medications, for which the new OACs are particularly beneficial or hazardous; and (4) to develop and validate risk predictive models of stroke / cardioembolic complications and severe hemorrhage in AF patients using new OACs. To address these research questions, we will use two large claim databases, OptumInsight and MarketScan. These databases include health insurance claims from over 1 million patients with AF, and >155,000 users of new OACs. State- of-the-art methods for comparative effectiveness research, including high-dimensional propensity scores, marginal structural models, and instrumental variables, will be used to adjust for confounding. Results from our research will provide key evidence to help patients and clinicians make decisions about their anticoagulant treatment, balancing benefits and risks associated with different therapeutic options. This proposal also has the potential to inform decisions by regulatory agencies, insurers, health system leaders, and professional organizations in issues such as post marketing approval, reimbursements, and clinical guidelines.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Limited information exists on the ""real-world"" effectiveness of new oral anticoagulants compared to warfarin in the treatment of patients with atrial fibrillation,a common cardiac arrhythmia. The proposed research will provide timely and necessary information to help clinicians and patients make well-founded decisions on the use and choice of oral anticoagulants. Our project will complement information from published phase III randomized controlled trials of new oral anticoagulants.                ",Comparative Effectiveness of Oral Anticoagulants in Atrial Fibrillation,8882953,R01HL122200,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'American', 'Anticoagulant therapy', 'Anticoagulants', 'Antithrombin III', 'Arrhythmia', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Comorbidity', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Dyspepsia', 'Effectiveness', 'Embolism', 'Equilibrium', 'Ethnic Origin', 'European', 'Food-Drug Interactions', 'Guidelines', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Insurance', 'Health system', 'Hemorrhage', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Insurance Carriers', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Oral', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Prevention', 'Professional Organizations', 'Publishing', 'Race', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Stroke', 'Stroke prevention', 'Structural Models', 'Subgroup', 'Therapeutic', 'Thrombin', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Vitamin K', 'Warfarin', 'base', 'comparative effectiveness', 'effectiveness research', 'head-to-head comparison', 'health care service utilization', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'post-market', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'randomized trial', 'sex', 'technique development']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2015,645731,-0.08023449688086992
"Development of a Multi-Modal Neuroimaging Biomarker for Amyotrophic Lateral Scler DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive degenerative motor neuron disease involving the motor cortex, corpus callosum, cortical spinal tract and spinal anterior horn neurons. The disease has a uniformly fatal outcome, although the clinical presentation and course is quite heterogeneous, with median survival times between 2 - 4 years. Approximately 30,000 people in the United States are living with ALS. There is no definitive diagnostic test for ALS. Confident diagnosis is primarily based on clinical assessment and relies on the detection of upper motor neuron (UMN) and lower motor neuron (LMN) signs in multiple body segments, together with a history of progression of symptoms. Evaluation of LMN pathology may be supplemented by electromyography, but UMN pathology can remain occult as it is only assessed using clinical examination which can lead to diagnostic uncertainty. Unfortunately, there is on average a one- year delay between the onset of symptoms and diagnosis for this rapidly progressive disease; this delay prevents early treatment with emerging disease-modifying drugs. Thus, reliable biomarkers for the early diagnosis and disease prognostication are needed.  Conventional magnetic resonance imaging techniques provide limited and inconsistent information in ALS patients. Therefore, there has been and continues to be great interest in using advanced neuroimaging techniques to establish improved markers of the disease. Although advanced neuroimaging techniques such as magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and resting state functional connectivity (fcMRI) have identified differences between ALS patients and healthy controls, they lack sufficient accuracy to reliably classify individual patients. To meet this important unmet need, the proposed study will use novel advanced neuroimaging techniques to develop a multimodal biomarker of ALS, and validate a discrimination and prediction model to refine the diagnostic clinical workup for ALS. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: There are no definitive tests for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and many of these patients have a delayed diagnosis preventing early intervention with new emerging treatments. Furthermore, disease prognosis is challenging due to the variability of the natural history of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. This study will use multiple advanced neuroimaging methods to build a robust diagnostic test and prognostic model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. We will use a novel statistical approach to develop and validate the models.",Development of a Multi-Modal Neuroimaging Biomarker for Amyotrophic Lateral Scler,8839318,R01NS082304,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Anterior', 'Anterior Horn Cells', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical assessments', 'Corpus Callosum', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Electromyography', 'Evaluation', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Horns', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Life', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Motor Neuron Disease', 'Motor Neurons', 'Natural History', 'Neuraxis', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Process', 'Progressive Disease', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Riluzole', 'Spinal', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Transcend', 'Uncertainty', 'United States', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'diagnosis evaluation', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'interest', 'meetings', 'neuroimaging', 'neurotransmission', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'response', 'screening', 'spinal tract', 'treatment trial']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2015,577490,-0.010727918566981439
"Effectiveness of IG-IMRT for Locally Advanced Cervix Cancer on NRG Trial CVM-1421 ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Cervical cancer is among the leading causes of cancer death worldwide. Patients often have poor access to screening and vaccination, and present in advanced stages, for which chemoradiotherapy (chemoRT) is the standard of care. This treatment is limited, however, by high rates of failure and toxicity. Although intensifying chemotherapy can improve tumor control and survival, toxicity is often unacceptably high. Strategies to reduce toxicity while increasing efficacy of chemoRT are therefore needed.  Standard pelvic RT techniques encompass large volumes of normal tissue. In contrast, image-guided intensity-modulated RT (IG-IMRT) is a modern technique that maximizes target dose and minimizes normal tissue dose. Multiple studies have found that IG-IMRT can significantly reduce organ dose and reduce toxicity compared to standard RT. These studies support the hypothesis that IG-IMRT can permit delivery of more intensive chemotherapy. For example, gemcitabine, a potent radiosensitizer, has been found to improve survival for cervical cancer patients in randomized trials (Dueñas-Gonzalez et al.). However, the toxicity when delivered with standard RT is extreme (>80% grade 3-4 toxicity). Therefore, this regimen has not replaced cisplatin alone as the standard of care. In contrast, our research group has found that the maximum tolerated dose of gemcitabine was increased when given with IG-IMRT. A large international multi-institutional trial has also found lower rates of toxicity with IG-IMRT compare to standard chemoRT. These findings support the hypothesis that IG-IMRT, by reducing bowel and bone marrow dose, could permit delivery of more effective concurrent chemotherapy. If confirmed, this would have significant implications for many pelvic malignancies. However, this hypothesis has not been tested in a randomized trial.  CVM-1421 is an emerging NCI-funded randomized phase II trial within the NRG Oncology Cooperative Group that will test the hypothesis that adding concurrent triapine, a ribonucleotide reductase inhibitor, to concurrent cisplatin and RT can improve outcomes in patients with locoregionally advanced cervix cancer undergoing definitive chemoradiation. This trial presents a unique opportunity to study the effects of IG- IMRT on normal tissue toxicity, as it will be the first cooperative group trial to permit IG-IMRT in this population. This trial also presents an opportunity to study ways to improve IG-IMRT quality, as there has been considerable controversy in how to optimally design IG-IMRT plans, due to their increased complexity. The goal of our research is to study the effect of IG-IMRT on toxicity, quality of life, and treatment outcomes, under varying intensities of chemotherapy. We will also implement a novel technique called knowledge-based planning (KBP) in order to improve plan quality and achieve optimal IG-IMRT dose distributions. This research could help establish IG-IMRT as a new standard of care for pelvic malignancies, and will lay groundwork for future studies testing novel technologies in clinical trial settings.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  In this study, we will test the hypothesis that image guided intensity modulated radiation therapy (IG-IMRT) will reduce hematologic and gastrointestinal toxicity compared to standard pelvic radiotherapy in cervical cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy and cisplatin with or without triapine. We are in an optimal situation to ask this question because the randomized phase II trial that will set the background for our study is evaluating the efficacy of more intensive chemotherapy while allowing both IG-IMRT and standard radiation treatment techniques. It would be beneficial for clinicians and patients to know whether IG-IMRT will reduce toxicity and improve quality of life. Further, this study could help establish IG-IMRT as a new standard of care.            ",Effectiveness of IG-IMRT for Locally Advanced Cervix Cancer on NRG Trial CVM-1421,8948940,R01CA197059,"['American', 'Anterior', 'Bone Marrow', 'Boxing', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cessation of life', 'Cisplatin', 'Clinical Trials', 'DNA Synthesis Inhibitors', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Effectiveness', 'Failure', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genitourinary system', 'Goals', 'Gynecologic', 'Intensity-Modulated Radiotherapy', 'International', 'Intestines', 'Lateral', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri', 'Maximum Tolerated Dose', 'Modeling', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pelvis', 'Population', 'Progression-Free Survivals', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of life', 'Radiation', 'Radiation therapy', 'Radiation-Sensitizing Agents', 'Randomized', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Ribonucleotide Reductase Inhibitor', 'Secondary to', 'Shapes', 'Solutions', 'Staging', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Treatment outcome', 'Triapine', 'Vaccination', 'chemoradiation', 'chemotherapy', 'comparative effectiveness', 'contrast imaging', 'design', 'gastrointestinal', 'gemcitabine', 'image guided', 'improved', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'new technology', 'novel', 'oncology', 'phase I trial', 'phase II trial', 'public health relevance', 'radiation effect', 'randomized trial', 'screening', 'standard of care', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'tumor']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2015,253619,-0.02145196321062124
"Optical Tomographic Imaging of Peripheral Arterial Disease DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to build and test a dynamic vascular optical tomographic imaging (DVOTI) system that can be used to detect and monitor peripheral arterial disease (PAD). PAD is estimated to affect approximately 8 to 12 million individuals in the United States. However, the disease is considerably under-diagnosed, since most patients are asymptomatic and no single reliable screening modality has been established. Most of the undiagnosed and untreated patients are diabetics. They commonly suffer from peripheral neuropathy and hence do not sense and report symptoms (such as pain) that are early signs of the disease. Consequently more than 60% (~65,000 per year) of all lower extremity amputations in the United States are performed in diabetic patients with PAD. With the number of diabetic patients expected to triple and reach almost 100 million by 2050, the problems related to undiagnosed PAD will only rise in the years to come  The most widely used diagnostic test for PAD, determination of the ankle-brachial index (ABI) in conjunction with pulse-volume recordings (PVR), is known to be unreliable for diabetics. And even in non- diabetics, ABI with PVR and all other existing diagnostic tests (such as Duplex Ultrasound or Magnetic resonance angiography), only provides accurate information about proximal occlusions in major arteries of the leg. However, none of these tests assess the distal perfusion of the foot where most complications, such as ulcers and gangrene, typically occur. Monitoring the success of surgical interventions, such as angioplasty or bypass surgery, suffers from the same shortcomings, as physicians are limited to the same suite of tests that are inadequate to assess the perfusion of the foot.  Dynamic VOTI promises to overcome the limitations of current diagnostic and monitoring techniques and has the potential to initiate a paradigm shift concerning how vascular diseases are assessed. In preliminary studies we have shown that DVOTI can provide three-dimensional time-series images that provide valuable information about the perfusion of the vascular bed in feet of PAD patients. The near-infrared light used in the instrument has no adverse health effects and measurements can be repeated frequently to monitor post interventional progress. Therefore, we believe that DVOTI will prove to be a safe and accurate method to diagnose and monitor PAD in non-diabetic and diabetic patients. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to build and test a novel optical imaging system that will allow for the diagnosis and monitoring of peripheral artery disease (PAD), which affects approximately 8 to 12 million individuals in the United States. The disease is considerably under-diagnosed, especially in diabetic patients, the elderly, and patients with kidney disease. The system will address an unmet need to directly assess the degree of blood perfusion in the feet, where most PAD-related complications occur, which lead to over 65,000 amputations each year.",Optical Tomographic Imaging of Peripheral Arterial Disease,8896855,R01HL115336,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Air', 'Algorithms', 'Amputation', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Angioplasty', 'Ankle', 'Arteries', 'Blood Vessels', 'Bypass', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Classification', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diffusion', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Distal', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Ensure', 'Gangrene', 'Geometry', 'Head', 'Health', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Lead', 'Leg', 'Light', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Angiography', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Peripheral Nervous System Diseases', 'Peripheral arterial disease', 'Physicians', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Preventive', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stroke', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment outcome', 'Ulcer', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Vascular Diseases', 'blood perfusion', 'data acquisition', 'design', 'diabetic', 'diabetic patient', 'evaluation/testing', 'experience', 'foot', 'healthy volunteer', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging system', 'indexing', 'instrument', 'light emission', 'non-diabetic', 'novel', 'older patient', 'optical imaging', 'post intervention', 'prototype', 'screening', 'success', 'theories', 'tissue phantom', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'vascular bed']",NHLBI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2015,542263,0.005962835461614206
"Rapid Detection of Common Failure Modes for Knee Prosthetics ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Bruin Biometrics' proposes to develop the Joint Health Monitor (JHM), an innovative low risk device capable of detecting artificial joint implant failure prior to all currently available diagnostic devices. Artificial joint replacements have demonstrated excellent clinical performance. However, failures do occur due to a multitude of factors including, aseptic loosening, wear, dislocation, osteolysis, and adverse local tissue reactions (ALTR), including pseudotumors and extensive tissue damage. Recent catastrophic failures associated with specific implant designs, and increasing concern over the severe clinical consequences of ALTR, have raised the attention of both consumer advocacy groups and regulatory agencies, in the US and abroad. It is evident that current diagnostic tools have failed to predict early enough complications associated with some implant designs and/or patient's characteristics. Rather than be predictive, current diagnostic methods usually do not detect joint degradation until bone and tissue damage have already occurred, increasing morbidity, mortality and severity of revision surgeries. Bruin Biometrics has developed an innovative monitoring device that will allow effective monitoring of an artificial joint functionality and eary detection of at risk patients, implant designs and reduction of the number or at least the severity of revision surgeries. Early detection should also enable physicians to prescribe exercise regimens, dietary supplements, medication, early revision surgery or other measures to protect against further damage. Moreover, the existence of an effective monitoring device would provide invaluable feedback, enabling unprecedented quantification and evaluation of treatment efficacy including drugs. The objectives of this proposal are to demonstrate the technical feasibility of this device to detect specific failure modes. This will be accomplished using an in vitro test rig set up and an in vivo human subject pilot study. Our overall goal is to rapidly delier a wearable system capable of monitoring the status of artificial joints and provide surgeons with more accurate and earlier diagnoses.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Hip and Knee replacement procedures will continue to increase dramatically over the next twenty years and the rate of revision surgery is expected to remain stable around 17-18%. This will increase the burden on orthopaedic surgeons, operating room capacity, and healthcare cost. In 2007 dollars, this volume of total joint replacement would generate costs exceeding $100 billion, or 1% of the gross domestic product (GDP).

"Advanced retinal image analysis for AMD screening ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In this grant application we propose to develop a screening tool for Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) - the single largest cause for legal blindness among aged Americans. A robust screening test that can be performed by a primary care physician or an optometrist, who can then refer the patient to an ophthalmologist, will be a useful first step in casting a wider net and helping reduce the toll of severe vision loss with timely intervention and patient education.  Large, multi-center studies Age Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) and AREDS2 have shown that vitamin supplements along with minerals and antioxidants slow progression of the disease in patients with intermediate AMD, and those with late AMD in one eye. Identifying the at-risk population for advanced AMD who might benefit from the supplements in a timely manner is a growing problem with the aging baby boomers. The proposed tool, EyeSeeAMD, will analyze color retinal fundus images from a patient, automatically detect the various pathologies associated with AMD, quantify them and recommend if the patient needs to be referred to an expert for further evaluation. We have promising preliminary results in drusen detection, detailed plans for developing the envisioned device, and excellent clinical, research, and engineering teams to guarantee success of the project.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed tool, EyeSeeAMD, will help in triaging age-related macular degeneration (AMD) patients who are at higher risk to progress to late AMD by providing an automated method for screening the growing aged-population in a non-invasive manner. Timely intervention will help slow the progression of AMD in such patients. Easy quantification of AMD pathological indicators will spur clinical research and drug discovery process by facilitating early and reliable measurement of efficacy of novel treatment methods.            ",Advanced retinal image analysis for AMD screening,8981869,R43EY025984,"['Address', 'Age related macular degeneration', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Antioxidants', 'Applications Grants', 'Architecture', 'Area Under Curve', 'Blindness', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cloud Computing', 'Collaborations', 'Color', 'Computer software', 'County', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug Formulations', 'Drusen', 'Elderly', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Eye diseases', 'Face', 'Fundus', 'Gold', 'Health Services', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Industry', 'Institutes', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Legal Blindness', 'Lesion', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Marketing', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Minerals', 'Monitor', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Ophthalmologist', 'Optometrist', 'Pathology', 'Patient Education', 'Patients', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Phase', 'Physician Executives', 'Pigments', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Primary Care Physician', 'Process', 'Progressive Disease', 'Quality of life', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Retina', 'Retinal', 'Retinal Diseases', 'Risk', 'Scientist', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Software Engineering', 'Specialist', 'Specificity', 'Staging', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Triage', 'United States', 'Vision', 'Visual impairment', 'Vitamins', 'Work', 'age related', 'aged', 'aging population', 'base', 'clinical care', 'design', 'detector', 'dietary supplements', 'disorder of macula of retina', 'drug discovery', 'experience', 'geographic atrophy', 'high risk', 'image processing', 'image registration', 'improved', 'neovascularization', 'novel', 'operation', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'software development', 'success', 'tool', 'usability', 'user-friendly']",NEI,"EYENUK, INC.",R43,2015,224999,-0.0015593415375049994
"Naltrexone Treatment     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In this international pilot study we use data from four clinical trials of heroin dependence treatment to identify which patients will be better respondents to naltrexone treatment and among respondents which type of naltrexone formulation (oral, implantable, or injectable) leads to the best outcome. Although in the United States naltrexone has been FDA approved for treatment of opioid addiction it has been underutilized. In Russia (where substitution therapy is illegal), naltrexone is the only pharmacological treatment option. Naltrexone is available in three forms: oral and extended release, injectable, and implantable depot-formulations. A novel methodology (Model-based Random Forest, mobForest) (Garge et al. 2013) will be extended to heroin treatment and to the development of a single interpretable parsimonious model. These methods will be applied to combined data from past four naltrexone efficacy randomized double blind, double dummy, placebo- controlled clinical trials and identify which patients are likely to respond to different naltrexone formulations. These studies were conducted in St. Petersburg, Russia, have data on almost 1,000 patients with more than 400 individual-level variables spanning demographics, clinical, genetic, and psychometrics domains. We will develop validated predictive models that provide prognosis of patients' response.

"Health Information Technology in Heart Failure Care DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Patients with heart failure experience four million hospitalizations per year in the United States. Of these hospitalizations, approximately three-quarters, or three million hospitalizations annually, are for causes other than heart failure. Patients with heart failure who are hospitalized for other causes are at high risk of post- discharge mortality possibly in part because they are less likely to receive guideline recommended care than patients who are hospitalized primarily for heart failure. Health information technology (HIT) has the potential to improve patient care by enhancing clinician compliance with evidence-based guidelines. Specifically, clinical decision support systems (CDSS) have been used to improve care for patients in hospitals, including those hospitalized for heart failure. Despite their utility, CDSSs have not been developed to apply more broadly to patients with heart failure who are hospitalized for other causes. This is clearly a gap for the millions of patients with heart failure who might experience improved outcomes if they were to receive guideline recommended care. The purpose of this study is to develop and test a CDSS for hospitalized patients who have heart failure, regardless of reason for hospitalization. The firt aim is to develop an Electronic Health Record (EHR) based algorithm to identify patients with heart failure using a variety of computational techniques including natural language processing. The second aim is to develop a CDSS to support delivery of guideline recommended care to hospitalized patients with heart failure using human computer interaction techniques. The third aim is to implement and test the effectiveness of the CDSS on processes of care for patients with heart failure who are hospitalized for other causes. The central hypothesis is that this decision support system will increase adherence to guideline recommended care, ideally improving outcomes as a result. The candidate, Saul Blecker, MD, MHS, is a general internist and clinician investigator at NYU School of Medicine. The candidate proposes a program of career development and training to achieve the following objectives: 1) develop expertise in medical informatics; 2) gain skills in human computer interaction; 3) develop expertise in implementation research. The candidate's primary mentor, Stuart Katz, MD, MS, is a seasoned mentor and researcher in heart failure. His co-mentor is Gilad Kuperman, MD, PhD, a leader in health information technology and medical informatics. Donna Shelley, MD, MPH, an expert in implementation and effectiveness research, will serve as an additional co-mentor. This mentorship team will work closely together to guide Dr. Blecker toward his research goal of leveraging HIT to improve the quality care for patients with heart failure. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Patients with heart failure are hospitalized three million times annually for other causes. These hospitalizations are associated with poor quality of care and high morbidity and mortality. We propose to leverage health information technology to improve outcomes for these patients by creating a novel system of reminders to ensure that hospitalized patients with heart failure receive guideline recommended care.",Health Information Technology in Heart Failure Care,8925840,K08HS023683,[' '],AHRQ,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,K08,2015,158282,0.02217424005533187
"Phase 2 Clinical Trial of Coralmyn for Coral Snake Bite (BB-IND 13926,01/02/09) Abstract Background: Each year, poison control centers report approximately 75 bites by coral snakes (Micrurus and Micruroides species) in the United States. More than half of these occur in Florida, with the rest concentrated in the southeastern states, westward as far as Texas. Before the introduction of anti-coral antivenom by Wyeth in 1967, approximately 10% of Micrurus bites were potentially fatal, due to ventilatory failure caused by neurotoxins active at the neuromuscular junction. Wyeth Ayerst has recently ceased production of this antivenom. In October of 2009, the last vials will expire, leaving the U.S. without a licensed supplier of antivenom. Objectives: Licensure of a new antivenom product, Coralmyn. Specific Aims: (1) Demonstrate the safety of Coralmyn in patients bitten by Micrurus coral snakes, by monitoring recipients for Type I and Type III immune reactions. (2) Demonstrate the value of plasma venom levels as a surrogate endpoint in coral snake bites by relating venom levels to severity of envenomation, before and after treatment. (3) Demonstrate that cost of treatment is different for patients presenting to hospitals with and without antivenom in stock, and use patient cost data to complete a pharmacoeconomic model comparing distribution methodologies applicable to Phase 3 or 4 study design. Research Design and Methods: This will be an open-label Phase 2 clinical trial of Coralmyn (anti-coral serum injectable solution, Instituto Bioclon, S.A. de C.V.) in male and female human patients of any age who present for emergency care following bites by coral snakes of genus Micrurus. Using grant funds, as many hospitals as economically feasible (at least 3 in Florida) will be provided with antivenom with which to enroll patients promptly in the study, using a central IRB. Patients presenting to other sites may enroll in the study either by interhospital transfer or by emergency delivery of antivenom to out-of-network hospitals. In all cases, clinical observations and plasma for venom levels will be collected at study enrollment and hourly until start of study drug. Following infusion of antivenom, clinical observations and plasma collection will be repeated at intervals until hospital discharge; and telephone follow-up will continue through day 22. Clinical and financial data will be extracted by examination of patient records including standardized data collection sheets completed prospectively by hospital staff and extracted into Case Report Forms secondarily by study staff at a central site. Plasma will be frozen and held for batch analysis every six months, using a Micrurus-specific ELISA assay. Statistical analysis of safety indicators will be conducted using Cox Proportional Hazard or survival models. Venom levels will be analyzed using a combination of logistic regression and ANOVA and compared with neurological assessments using a Generalized Linear Mixed Model. Cost data will be entered into a decision-tree model constructed in TreeAge HealthcarePro, and sensitivity analysis will be performed using MonteCarlo simulation. Project Narrative: Bites by coral snakes can be fatal if the bitten person does not receive antivenom promptly, but the only U.S. manufacturer of coral snake antivenom has stopped making it. This study will test the safety of a new antivenom in patients bitten by coral snakes, it will show whether testing for venom in the bloodstream is a useful way to determine how bad of a bite a person has, and it will show whether it is cost-effective to stock investigational antivenom in just a small number of places if there is no licensed antivenom for hospitals to buy. Results of the study will help doctors, the manufacturer, and the FDA to move forward toward getting a new antivenom for use in the U.S.","Phase 2 Clinical Trial of Coralmyn for Coral Snake Bite (BB-IND 13926,01/02/09)",8820077,R01FD003706,[' '],FDA,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R01,2015,250000,0.023353712327099548
"Computer-aided detection of non-calcified plaques in coronary CT angiograms   Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in both men and women in the United States. Over 16 million Americans have coronary heart disease (CHD), causing about 0.5 million deaths each year. The most common CHD is coronary artery disease which is mainly caused by atherosclerosis. Clinical evidence in recent years shows that noncalcified plaques (NCPs) are more vulnerable to rupture than calcified plaques. Plaque rupture and the thrombosis that follows is the main cause of acute myocardial infarction. Multidetector coronary CT angiography (cCTA) has the potential to help clinicians in early detection and in quantification of NCPs. cCTA may thus be useful for CHD detection, risk stratification, monitoring, and evaluation of the effectiveness of risk reduction treatment. However, many of these potential applications have not been utilized clinically.  The goal of this project is to develop a computer-aided detection (CADe) system to serve as a second reader for assisting clinicians in detection and quantification of NCPs in cCTA exams. Our specific aims are to (1) develop machine learning methods for detection of NCPs causing stenosis and/or positive remodeling along coronary arteries, and (2) evaluate the effect of CADe on radiologists' detection of NCPs on cCTA by observer ROC study. To achieve these aims, we will collect a database of cCTA cases for training and testing the CADe system, define the search space by designing 3D multiscale coronary artery response enhancement, segmentation, and dynamic balloon vessel tracking methods, develop a unique vessel- stitching method to automatically identify the best-quality phase for each individual artery segment from all available phases in prospectively or retrospectively gated cCTA exams, develop innovative vessel-sector- profile analysis and vessel lumen analysis to detect NCPs that cause stenosis or positive remodeling, estimate the total NCP volume, and explore calibration method to quantify plaque density by phantom studies. To demonstrate the usefulness of CADe, a preclinical reader study will be conducted to compare radiologists' detection accuracy of NCPs with and without CADe.  The major innovations of this project include (1) being the first CADe system to automatically detect non-calcified plaques including those cause positive remodeling or stenosis in cCTA, (2) development of new machine learning techniques including the vessel-stitching method, vessel-sector-profile analysis, multiscale enhancement response, and dynamic balloon tracking specifically suited for coronary arterial trees, and (3) conducting the first ROC study to evaluate the effect of CADe on radiologists' detection of NCPs.  Narrative:  Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in both men and women in the United States. If the proposed CADe system is successfully developed, it will (1) provide an accurate, efficient, and consistent tool to assist clinicians in detecting and quantifying non-calcified plaques (NCP) including those causing positive remodeling and/or stenosis for an individual patient, (2) help clinicians estimate the total NCP burden and study its significance, in analogy to that of the total calcium score, which may lead to improved clinical management of the vulnerable plaques, and (3) accelerate studies to develop new treatment options of coronary heart disease by providing a monitoring tool of treatment response. The proposed CADe system can thus serve as a foundation for these broader future applications and improve the efficacy of cCTA. Improved detection and management of NCPs may reduce the risk of myocardial infarctions and will have strong and long-lasting impact on health care.",Computer-aided detection of non-calcified plaques in coronary CT angiograms,8586273,R01HL106545,"['Acute myocardial infarction', 'American', 'Angiography', 'Arterial Fatty Streak', 'Arteries', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Calcified', 'Calcium', 'Calibration', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Catheters', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary artery', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Procedures', 'Radiation', 'Reader', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Recording of previous events', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Reduction', 'Rupture', 'Scanning', 'Stenosis', 'Stratification', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thrombosis', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trees', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Visual', 'Woman', 'computer aided detection', 'density', 'design', 'detector', 'improved', 'innovation', 'men', 'pre-clinical', 'prospective', 'radiologist', 'response', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'virtual']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2014,610289,-0.03849519062909304
"Improving Adherence and Outcomes by Artificial Intelligence-Adapted Text Messages     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Uncontrolled hypertension is a major cause of morbidity and mortality and many patients fail to take their antihypertensive medication as prescribed. We propose to use artificial intelligence (AI) to allow short message service (SMS or text messages) interventions to adapt to patients' adherence needs and substantially improve medication taking. The aims of the study are to: (1) develop AI methods for adaptive decision-making in human- centered environments and demonstrate the feasibility of the resulting AI-enhanced SMS medication adherence intervention, (2) demonstrate that the intervention can ""learn"" by adapting the SMS message stream according to patients' medication taking over time, and (3) examine potential intervention impact as measured by improvements in medication adherence and systolic blood pressures. We will recruit 100 patients with uncontrolled hypertension and antihypertensive medication non-adherence. Adherence and other covariates will be measured via surveys at baseline, 3- and 6 months; blood pressures will be measured at baseline and 6 months. Participants will be given an electronic pill-bottle adherence monitor. Participants will receive SMS messages designed to motivate antihypertensive medication adherence. Message content and frequency will adapt automatically using AI algorithms designed to automatically optimize expected pill bottle opening. For Aim 1, the first 25 patients will be enrolled to develop and test alternative RL algorithms and fine-tune the system parameters. For Aim 2, we will examine changes in the probability distribution over message-types and compare that distribution with patients' reasons for non-adherence reported at baseline. For Aim 3, we will examine changes in self-reported medication non-adherence and blood pressure and automatically-reported pill bottle openings. This pilot study will establish the feasibility and potential impact of this novel approach to mobile health messaging for self-management support. The results will be used to support an R01 application for a larger and more definitive trial of intervention impacts.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Uncontrolled high blood pressure is a major cause of death and illness and many patients fail to take their blood pressure medications as prescribed.

"Early CSF detection of FTLD DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) is the second most common cause of dementia among subjects under the age of 65. There are two main FTLD subtypes: FTLD associated with lesions immunoreactive to TDP-43 (FTLD-TDP), and FTLD associated with Tau-immunoreactive lesions (FTLD-Tau). Currently, the exact FTLD pathology cannot be confidently defined until autopsy, and there is an urgent need for ante- mortem biomarker which reliably predict FTLD pathology. Over the past 30 months, I have identified and validated a panel of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) FTLD-TDP biomarkers that identified FTLD-TDP patients with 85% accuracy, including Tau phosphorylation, tripeptidyl peptidase 1 (TPP1) levels, and inflammatory protein levels (FAS, eotaxin-3, IL-23), with 85% accuracy in distinguishing between the two main FTLD subtypes. The identification and validation of these CSF alterations will serve as the basis of the current proposal to translate these markers towards clinical application through multi-site technical validation and advanced classification through machine-based learning, and to better characterize altered biochemical pathways in FTLD-TDP. First, I hypothesize that we can reduce the coefficient of variation for each FTLD-TDP biomarker to under 15% through a multi-site technical validation using 60 banked CSF samples. I will test this hypothesis in Aim 1 by determining technical factors (freeze-thawing, blood contamination, detergent use, protease inhibitor use, buffer condition) which reduce assay precision, and validating the assay at Penn. Second, I hypothesize that machine-based learning/support vector machine approach will better diagnose FTLD-TDP by taking into account non-linear effects of age, gender, and disease duration. I will test this hypothesis in Aim 2 by comparing the classification performance between more established algorithms and the support vector machine algorithm. Lastly, I hypothesize that these biomarker changes reflect altered biochemical pathways in FTLD-TDP. I will test this hypothesis by measuring brain and CSF levels of proteins involved in Tau phosphorylation, TPP1 maturation, and inflammation. As an exploratory Sub-aim 3a, I will determine if any of the changes from Aims 1 & 3 are detectable in asymptomatic subjects carrying familial FTLD-TDP mutations, to power an R01 application on longitudinal CSF biomarker changes in prodromal FTLD-TDP subjects. I will carry out this proposal with guidance from my mentoring team including Allan Levey, MD, PhD (Emory), John Trojanowski, MD, PhD (Penn), James Lah, MD, PhD (Emory), Jonathan Glass, MD (Emory), Leslie Shaw, PhD (Penn), and Eva Lee, PhD (Georgia Tech). I will also obtain formal training in biostatistics, bioinformatics, analytical chemistry, quality control, clinical trial design, geriatrics, and responsible conduct of research. Successful completion of the aims in the current proposal will establish the standard procedures to clinically  translate promising FTLD-TDP biomarkers, determine the best algorithm to diagnose FTLD-TDP using these biomarkers, and identify altered CSF and brain pathways related to these biomarker alterations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: FTLD is the second most common cause of dementia among subjects under the age of 65, and patients and their caregivers face unique challenges including poor judgment on the job, single parents suffering from FTLD with young children, and working spouses as caregivers. There is currently no reliable way to predict the underlying FTLD subtype, and as a result it is challenging to enroll the appropriate patients for substrate-specifi clinical trials (such as drugs targeting TDP but not Tau). This proposal will establish the standardized measurements of FTLD-TDP biomarkers towards translating this research panel into clinical testing, and identify biomarker changes which can be used even when symptoms are very mild. Early and accurate FTLD- TDP diagnosis will enhance future drug development and clinical trial design to alleviate the unique personal, social, and economic burden of FTLD.",Early CSF detection of FTLD,8723038,K23AG042856,"['Accounting', 'Adult', 'Adult Children', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Autopsy', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Buffers', 'Caregivers', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Collection', 'Controlled Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Detergents', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Drug Targeting', 'Economic Burden', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'Face', 'Freezing', 'Frontotemporal Lobar Degenerations', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Geriatrics', 'Glass', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Institutes', 'Judgment', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Occupations', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phosphorylation', 'Procedures', 'Protease Inhibitor', 'Proteins', 'Quality Control', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Sampling', 'Single Parent', 'Site', 'Spouses', 'Staging', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapy Clinical Trials', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Tube', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'age effect', 'base', 'brain pathway', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'design', 'drug development', 'human CCL26 protein', 'illness length', 'improved', 'inflammatory marker', 'interleukin-23', 'model design', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'protein TDP-43', 'public health relevance', 'research clinical testing', 'research study', 'response', 'responsible research conduct', 'social', 'tau Proteins', 'tau phosphorylation', 'tau-1', 'tool', 'tripeptidyl aminopeptidase']",NIA,EMORY UNIVERSITY,K23,2014,156324,-0.008463535097004248
"High Performance Automated System for Analysis of Fast Cardiac SPECT     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Coronary artery disease remains a major public health problem worldwide. It causes approximately 1 of every 6 deaths in the United States. Imaging of myocardial perfusion (delivery of blood to the heart muscle) by myocardial perfusion single photon emission tomography (MPS) allows physicians to detect disease before a heart attack, and predict risk in millions of patients annually. This is currently limited by the need fo visual interpretation, which is highly variable and depends on the physician's experience. The long-term objective of this program is to improve the interpretation of this widely used heart imaging technique-achieving higher accuracy for disease detection than it is possible by the best attainable visual analysis. This proposal builds on our prior work in conventional myocardial MPS, and focuses on fast, low-radiation MPS imaging (fast-MPS) obtained by new high-efficiency scanners. Specifically, we aim to: 1) develop new image processing algorithms for a fully automated analysis of fast-MPS. The algorithms will include better heart muscle detection by training with correlated anatomical data and a novel approach for mapping the probability of abnormal perfusion for each location of the heart muscle; 2) enhance the diagnosis of heart disease from fast-MPS by machine- learning algorithms that integrate clinical data, stress test parameters, and quantitative image features; 3) demonstrate the clinical utility of the new algorithms applied to automatic canceling of the rest portion of the MPS scan, when not needed. The new system will be more accurate than the clinical expert analysis in the detection of obstructive coronary disease. By immediately indicating whether a stress scan is normal, the system will allow for the automatic cancellation of the rest imaging portion when it is not needed (estimated in over 60% of all MPS studies). Our research will demonstrate that the computer decision regarding rest-scan cancellation is safe for the patient, both from a diagnostic and prognostic standpoint. This will lead to a wide adoption of low-dose stress-only imaging for MPS studies, which would reduce the amount of radiation that patients are exposed to, and allow for significant healthcare savings. It will additionally lead to a paradigm shift in the practice of nuclear cardiology, which will ultimately result in better selection of patients who need intervention, and reduce the number of deaths due coronary artery disease.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Imaging of myocardial perfusion (heart muscle blood flow) at rest and stress allows physicians to detect disease and predict risk in millions of patients in the US each year, but it is currently limited by the need of visual interpretation, which is dependent on doctor's experience. The investigators propose to develop and validate an automated, highly-accurate and objective computer system which will outperform even experienced physicians in interpreting these images using latest generation scanners and novel machine learning computer tools. The computer will be able to better select patients needing treatment and automatically indicate the normal stress-scan immediately, and more accurately than physicians allowing automatic cancellation of the rest imaging, when not needed; this will result in large healthcare savings and reduced radiation to the patients.            ",High Performance Automated System for Analysis of Fast Cardiac SPECT,8762268,R01HL089765,"['Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Blood', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Computer Systems', 'Computers', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Generations', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Diseases', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'Myocardium', 'Nuclear', 'Patient Selection', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Photons', 'Physicians', 'Probability', 'Public Health', 'Radiation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Savings', 'Scanning', 'Stress', 'Stress Tests', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Training', 'United States', 'Visual', 'Work', 'experience', 'heart imaging', 'image processing', 'improved', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'tomography', 'tool']",NHLBI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2014,653934,-0.002249047416866193
"Automated Web-Based Behavioral Diagnostics of Cognitive Impairment    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alzheimer's disease affects an estimated 5.3 million Americans currently, and this number is expected to grow significantly in the coming decade. A critical goal of Alzheimer's disease research is to improve current methods of diagnosis so that patients can be identified sooner and, therefore, obtain greater advantage from available therapies. The major goal of this project is to develop and validate an automated, web-based method for early diagnosis of cognitive decline and memory loss. We will build on current research that has demonstrated a clear link between performance on the Visual Paired- Comparison Task (VPC) and diagnosis of MCI, and we will extend the impact of this finding by developing a suite of software tools and analysis methods that will improve the accuracy and extend the accessibility of cognitive diagnostics with a web-based VPC task that can be widely deployed. Although the VPC task is promising as a diagnostic aid, clinical application is severely limited by the need to use an eye tracker to precisely monitor subjects' eye movements. Unfortunately, eye trackers are expensive, require trained personnel, and are not widely available. However, our preliminary findings show that it is possible to produce picture examination behavior that is similar to eye-movements, using modified versions of the VPC task that could be administered by anyone, on any computer with an internet connection. In addition, powerful machine learning techniques from computer science can help accurately analyze and diagnose the resulting behavior. An important contribution from this work will be the possibility of predicting oncoming cognitive decline in MCI patients sooner than is now possible, that is, at a time when the nervous system is less compromised and more likely to benefit from therapeutic intervention. In support of this objective, we propose three aims: 1) Develop and investigate appropriate representation of eye movement characteristics and corresponding machine learning-based classification techniques for effective identification of the patient status, 2) Develop and validate a web-based version of the VPC task, and 3) explore the feasibility of our task as an automatic screening instrument for the general elderly population. Successful completion of these aims has the potential to dramatically alter the current practice of clinical translational research as well as the current methods used for diagnosing cognitive deficits. This would enable thousands and potentially millions of patients and potential research subjects to take the test as part of their routine checkup, requiring nothing more than a computer with an internet connection.

"Hand Sensorimotor Function and Carpal Tunnel Syndrome    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The median nerve is susceptible to compression in the wrist, leading to carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). CTS is the most common compression neuropathy and have an immense impact on national health care, worker productivity, and quality of life. Despite its high prevalence and public health cost, our understanding of CTS is limited, and the management of CTS awaits improvement. The central notion of this project is that hand sensorimotor function is sensitive to peripheral median neuropathy and that the central nervous system is affected by CTS, causing the associated sensorimotor deficit. We will investigate this notion with quantifiable sensorimotor data from novel biomechanical and neurophysiological studies. This project has three aims consisting of biomechanical, neurophysiological and translational research. The first aim is to investigate CTS-induced pathokinematic and pathokinetic performance using dexterous manual tasks of thumb opposition, reach-to-pinch, precision grip, and finger pressing. The second aim is to investigate the neurophysiological implications of chronic peripheral neuropathy (i.e., CTS) on the central nervous system by evaluating corticomuscular coupling and stretch reflex. The third aim is to identify novel biomechanical and neurophysiological markers for CTS cases using machine learning and classification algorithms. The results of this project will elucidate the pathological mechanisms and behavioral manifestations of CTS and aid in the development of new strategies for diagnosis, evaluation, rehabilitation, and treatment of this disorder. More generally, CTS as a chronic neuropathy serves as an effective model to study sensorimotor mechanisms of the peripheral and central nervous systems. In addition, the methodology developed in this project is applicable to other neuromuscular disorders.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:   Carpal tunnel syndrome is highly prevalent and costly. One of the distinct consequences of carpal tunnel syndrome is that patients experience inexplicable dropping of objects and clumsiness while performing simple daily tasks. In this project, we propose to study the sensorimotor deficit using novel biomechanical and neurophysiological experiments. The results of this project will elucidate the pathological mechanisms and manifestations of carpal tunnel syndrome. This project is clinically translational to aid in the development of new strategies for diagnosis, evaluation, rehabilitation, and treatment of this disorder.

"Computational Approach to Personalized Anemia Management     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Effective anemia management in End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) is a complex task due to large variation in erythropoietic response among the ESRD patients. Evidence shows that excessive doses of Erythropoiesis Stimulating Agents (ESA), used in hypo-responsive patients, coincide with increased cardiovascular complications. In addition to health risks, reimbursement restrictions imposed by Medicare demand additional vigilance in ESA administration. Iron is one of the most important elements affecting the erythropoietic response. The ongoing blood losses associated with hemodialysis treatments, increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, and access complications, as well as poor iron absorption lead to iron depletion in ESRD patients. Standard anemia management protocols do not fully address the synergistic nature of interactions between erythropoietin and iron. Personalized strategies for coordinated ESA and iron dosing are therefore necessary to achieve the desired clinical outcome, reduce patient risk exposure, and improve the cost-effectiveness of treatment. Our long-term goal is the advancement of biomedical computing to personalize medicine and pharmacologic management of chronic conditions. The objective of this project is to address the challenge of multiple drug dosing personalization with a specific application to ESA and iron management in anemia of ESRD. The central hypothesis is that a computational approach can be developed to perform coordinated personalized dosing of erythropoiesis stimulating agents and iron in order to achieve desired clinical outcomes and minimize patient exposure resulting in optimal care. The rationale behind the proposed research is that computational models quantifying the interaction between iron and erythropoietin can be applied through the principles of control theory and machine learning, to derive personalized dosing strategies for both agents. The main objective will be accomplished through three specific aims: 1) quantification of the erythropoietin-iron interaction through clinically relevant computational models, 2) application of such models to derive algorithms for coordinated personalized ESA and iron dosing, 3) validation of these algorithms through an ""in sillico"" trial for a wide range o simulated subjects and clinical conditions. The expected outcome of this project is a new systematic approach to the management of ESRD anemia using multiple agents resulting in improved patient care and decreased cost which will be broadly applicable to other therapeutic areas.          The proposed research is relevant to public health because personalized dosing of multiple therapeutic agents broadly applicable to many chronic conditions is ultimately expected to improve cost-effectiveness of treatment and minimize patient risk. The proposed research is relevant to the NIH mission because it contributes toward advancement of personalized medicine, one of the top priorities of the NIH.

"Ancillary Comparative Effectiveness of Atrial Fibrillation Ablation Surgery    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This proposal describes an ancillary study to a recently initiated comparative effectiveness trial ""Surgical Ablation versus No Surgical Ablation for Patients with Persistent or Longstanding Persistent Atrial Fibrillation Undergoing Mitral Valve Surgery"" (NCT00903370), which is part of the NHLBI-sponsored Cardiothoracic Surgery Network (CTSN). Its aims are to perform a time-sensitive substudy of continuous heart rhythm monitoring and to develop and apply novel statistical tools to assess ablation effectiveness in groups of patients. As such, it will provide critical new knowledge to support a secondary objective of the parent trial: to inform rhythm monitoring and analysis strategies for future trials of rhythm control in atrial fibrillation (AF).  Great enthusiasm for innovative tissue-destroying (ablation) procedures to treat AF has led to technology outstripping science. Mechanisms of AF (which afflicts >3 million Americans) remain poorly understood, methods to assess its cure are primitive, and guidelines for analyzing rhythm outcomes are flawed due to lack of appropriate statistical methodology. Why? After ablation procedures, AF may recur in episodes of varying duration. Yet current monitoring consists of ""snapshots"" of semiannual rhythm recording (Holter), or more frequent-but short-transtelephonic monitoring (TTM). Ideally, an implantable monitoring device could detect all these episodes over a patient's lifetime; however, even if this were possible, statistical methods to analyze this series of occurrences in groups of patients for comparative effectiveness of AF therapies or to identify risk factors are poorly developed. Right now a window of opportunity exists to make important strides in more thorough AF assessment and proper data analysis because the CTSN has just launched a randomized trial of surgical AF therapies that includes weekly TTM of atrial rhythm as well as traditional 6- and 12-month Holter assessment. We propose a time-sensitive substudy of implanting an FDA-approved miniature loop recorder to capture AF episodes continuously. These data will be used in the development of a suite of new analytic methods for aggregating data such as these across time and across patients to characterize time course and identify modulating factors. They will then be used to assess the trial's rhythm endpoints and suggest designs for more informative future trials with substantially reduced sample size. We have assembled a team of clinicians and statisticians, including individuals who designed the parent trial, who are experienced in implanting the monitoring device, and who are experts in analytic methods research, to develop and apply novel methods to these several types of rhythm data. We will leverage developments from an intramural NHLBI machine learning program at Cleveland Clinic and State of Ohio-funded Atrial Fibrillation Innovation Center. The analytic methods have wide applicability to the important field of longitudinal data analysis.    A chaotic heart rhythm called atrial fibrillation (AF), which affects more than 3 million Americans, especially the elderly, causes strokes, and commonly accompanies heart valve disease. AF treatments outstrip scientific understanding of the rhythm and how to assess treatment success across time in clinical trials. Thus, the Institute of Medicine has placed trials of AF treatment in the first tier of 100 comparative effectiveness priorities for the nation. An NIH-sponsored trial of surgical treatment of AF is has just been launched, and we propose a substudy of an implanted rhythm monitoring device (Medtronic REVEAL XT) and new methods of AF analysis for groups of patients that will help assess the trial's endpoints and inform future trials. Thus, this ancillary study application proposes to (1) collect, in a subset of patients, more refined rhythm data than proposed in the parent trial, (2) develop generalizable new methods of analysis, and (3) apply these methods to both the data collected through continuous monitoring as well as the follow-up data collected in the parent trial through Holter and trans-telephonic monitoring.

"A Novel eFace System to Prevent the Risks of Facial Distortion after CMF Surgery     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The number of patients suffering from craniomaxillofacial (CMF) deformities and requiring surgical correction is escalating. CMF deformities may involve skeleton, overlying soft-tissues, or the both. Patients with CMF deformities often have psychological problems. The goal of CMF surgery is to reconstruct a normal facial appearance and function, and the outcome of the surgery is judged as such. The current problem is that we do not have a reliable way of simulating the soft-tissue-change following skeletal reconstruction. In treating patients with isolated skeletal defects, the current practice is to normalize the skeleton, hoping for optimal facial appearance. However, because the thickness and contour of the soft-tissue envelope varies from patient to patient, this approach is not reliable. The problem is even bigger in patients with composite defects. For example, in the scenario of a patient with a skeletal deformity and a mild soft-tissue defect, a surgeon would have to know, before surgery, how to overcorrect the skeleton to camouflage the soft-tissue defect. But, this information can only be attained by having an accurate planning system to simulate soft-tissue changes. In addition, from patient's perspective, the final facial appearance is the most apparent to them. Therefore, it is extremely important, for both doctors and patients, to accurately simulate soft-tissue-deformation.  Simulation methods must be accurate and fast. Attaining both is difficult because these attributes are inversely related, the more accurate the model, the longer it takes to prepare and run. Among the most effective, they are empirical-based model, mass spring model, finite element model, and mass tensor model. Unfortunately they are either too inaccurate or too slow, and clinically unacceptable.  Our hypothesis is that facial soft-tissue changes following virtual osteotomy can be accurately simulated by our innovative approach using an anatomically detailed modeling and mapping routine, along with statistical modeling technique. To test our hypothesis, we propose to develop an open source novel imaging informatics platform, eFace system, to accurately simulate soft-tissue-change following virtual osteotomies, and thus to significantly improve the outcomes of patients undergoing facial reconstruction. This approach can not only maintain the integrity of complex facial anatomy to accurately simulate the facial soft tissue deformation, but also significantly improve the computational efficiency in order to fit the requirement for clinical use  This project presents an innovative approach to model the facial soft-tissue deformation. If successful, it will allow accurate simulation of soft-tissue changes after virtual osteotomy. Patients will also be able to foresee the postoperative face preoperatively (patient education) and regain their psychological confidence. Finally, eFace will have significant impact and applications in orthodontics, plastic surgery, general surgery, growth/aging prediction, and forensic science.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In the US and throughout the world, the number of patients requiring surgical correction for facial deformities, which involves skeleton, overlying soft tissu, or both, is escalating every year. 2. Currently, while surgeons are able to accurately plan bone reconstructive surgery, they have to use  their visual imagination with clinical experience to mentally predict the facial soft tissue changes  following the bone surgery because they do not have a reliable way of simulating the soft-tissue-change  that is resulted from skeletal reconstruction. 3. We are proposing to develop an open source novel imaging informatics platform, eFace system, to accurately simulate soft-tissue-change following virtual skeletal surgery and thus to significantly improve the outcomes of patients undergoing facial reconstruction.            ",A Novel eFace System to Prevent the Risks of Facial Distortion after CMF Surgery,8656620,R01DE021863,"['Address', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Appearance', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Deformity', 'Development', 'Elements', 'Face', 'Figs - dietary', 'Forensic Sciences', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Imagination', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Orthodontics', 'Osteotomy', 'Outcome', 'Patient Education', 'Patients', 'Plastic Surgical Procedures', 'Plastics', 'Postoperative Period', 'Property', 'Reconstructive Surgical Procedures', 'Reporting', 'Residual state', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Severities', 'Simulate', 'Skeleton', 'Speed', 'Statistical Models', 'Surgeon', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'balance testing', 'base', 'bone', 'craniomaxillofacial', 'experience', 'imaging informatics', 'improved', 'improved functioning', 'innovation', 'meetings', 'novel', 'open source', 'prevent', 'psychologic', 'public health relevance', 'reconstruction', 'simulation', 'skeletal', 'skeletal surgery', 'soft tissue', 'system architecture', 'virtual']",NIDCR,METHODIST HOSPITAL RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2014,393538,-0.004636192449203487
"Motion, Artifact Cancelling MIMO Method for Ambulatory Respiratory Rate Monitorin     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Shortness of breath and difficulty in breathing are directly associated with deteriorating conditions in patients with heart failure (HF) and/or chroni obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Continuous monitoring of respiratory status in these patients can alert caregivers to administer early interventions to manage disease symptoms, thus preventing catastrophic events and improving quality of life. Unfortunately, continuous monitoring of respiratory rate and pattern is often overlooked or neglected in clinical practice due to the general difficulty in performing these measurements, especially in non-intubated ambulatory settings. Present measurement methods that capture the patient's airway are most accurate but difficult to administer and often intolerable for the patient, whereas methods that rely on capturing chest motion historically suffer from poor accuracy due to motion artifacts.  We propose a MIMO-based motion artifact cancelling multi-lead impedance measurement method for robust ambulatory respiratory rate monitoring. We have recently demonstrated that respiration and motion artifacts are theoretically separable in ambulatory subjects with multi-lead impedance measurements. The motion artifacts are sporadic and localized high energy non-stationary events compared to respiratory signals. Due to the limited dynamic range and quantization errors of the conventional data acquisition system, source separation algorithms struggle to extract reliable respiratory signal information. The proposed MIMO system approach overcomes these limitations by integrating statistical learning directly within analog to digital conversion process. As a result, this miniaturized hardware realization method enables continuous, real-time and power-efficient tracking of the respiratory signal corrupted by motion artifacts.  Preliminary study of the MIMO based algorithm has shown promising results for ambulatory respiratory rate monitoring. In this research we plan to develop the optimized hardware prototype of the MIMO system to validate the performance under real ambulatory conditions. We believe that the MIMO based multi-lead imped- ance measurement method is likely to be accepted by both clinicians and patients due to routine use of electrodes. Going forward, in our future work we envision integrating the proposed research with ECG monitoring sharing same set of electrodes to provide continuous and accurate cardiorespiratory information for general ward as well as for home health/wellness monitoring of ambulatory patients.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Continuous monitoring of respiratory status in COPD and HF patients can alert caregivers to administer early interventions to manage disease symptoms, thus preventing catastrophic events and improving quality of life. In ambulatory patients, accuracy remains an issue for non-intubated methods relying on chest motion due to physical motion artifacts.

"ICP Elevation Alerting Based on a Predictive Model Hosting Platform DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recurring acute ICP elevations occur frequently and unpredictably among severe brain injury patients. ICP elevation can cause cerebral ischemia and lead to deadly brain herniation if untreated. Hence, prompt recognition and treatment of rising ICP are critical in managing severe brain injury patients. However, existing protocols in most neurocritical care units are reactive where bedside nurses, in response to simple threshold-crossing alarms, have to check numerical display of ICP on monitors to manually establish whether the alarm is a true one before initiating treatment. Acute ICP elevation is accompanied by distinctive ICP pulse morphological changes. By utilizing ICP pulse morphological metrics as input, we can accurately recognize precursors to ICP elevation to alert nurses and free them from a cognitively demanding process of establishing whether a consistent ICP elevation triggers the alarm. We therefore propose to deploy a previously developed accurate ICP elevation prediction model on an open-source model hosting platform to monitor continuous ICP signals and alert bedside nurses. Using this alerting system, we will further investigate the principal physiological abnormalities associated with acute ICP elevation showing different precursory ICP patterns prior to onset of elevation. We will pursue the following three aims: 1) To develop an alerting system for ICP elevation based on a model hosting platform; 2) To investigate whether the ICP alerting system helps nurses more efficiently manage ICP. 3) To detect consistent physiological abnormalities associated with acute ICP elevation. Our long-term goal is to advance intensive care monitoring so that continuous signals from monitors are fully explored to integrate with the rest of clinical data in an electronic medical record (EMR) system to enhance clinical decision making. This project represents an effort piloting a platform-based approach towards overcoming translational barriers that impede the process of making advanced predictive analytics available at point of care. Therefore, broad impacts from this project are related to future efforts at leveraging this open model hosting platform to facilitate the translation of additional predictive models in other ICUs. Recurring acute intracranial pressure (ICP) elevation occurs frequently, up to more than 20 in a 12-hour nursing shift, and unpredictably among severe brain injury patients. These acute ICP elevations needs prompt treatment before they impair blood flow to the brain and cause deadly brain herniation. The present work is built upon our previously developed algorithm of detecting acute ICP elevation and an open software platform for hosting predictive algorithms to further develop and evaluate a real-time ICP elevation alerting system that will provide accurate alerts of impending ICP elevation. Rigorous human factor engineering principles and techniques will be adopted in developing this system and we will further leverage this real-time alerting system to investigate the principal physiological abnormalities that are associated with accurate ICP elevation.",ICP Elevation Alerting Based on a Predictive Model Hosting Platform,8732711,R01NS076738,"['Acute', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Blood flow', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Caring', 'Cerebral Ischemia', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Intensive Care', 'Intracranial Hypertension', 'Intracranial Pressure', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Metric', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Nature', 'Nurses', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Plumbing', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Rest', 'Signal Transduction', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Trust', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical decision-making', 'cost', 'design', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'open source', 'point of care', 'predictive modeling', 'response', 'usability']",NINDS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2014,435641,0.008303624983965356
"Statistical methods for biosignals with varying domains     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Clinical care and large observational studies are characterized by periods of intense health monitoring during hospital visits followed by long periods of low-intensity or no-monitoring between visits. Data obtained during in-hospital visits come from a host of new technologies, such as very densely sampled biosignal recordings (EEG, ECG, health scores) and high resolution multi-modality imaging (MRI, CT, PET). A major characteristic of this type of data is that it is collected for a period of time that is subject-spcific. Indeed, the in-hospital length and amount of monitoring varies between subjects, and is highly informative both for studying health outcomes in the hospital and after discharge. One among many examples is a recent study of subjects admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). For each subject the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, a commonly- used scoring system to measure organ dysfunction in the ICU, was collected daily for each subject for the duration of their ICU stay. The ICU length of stay is different by subject and likely to be highly informative of current and future health outcomes. In this application, a set of relevant problems are conceptualized and distilled to statistical aims to address specific complexities associated with this type of data sampling. Specifically, the proposal addresses the following fundamental unsolved problems in studies that collect high density biosignals: 1) introducing statistical models for the association between high density biosignals with uneven support and health outcomes; 2) developing functional registration-by-prediction models that transform the support of biosignals to provide best prediction of health outcomes; and 3) developing models for describing the cross-sectional and longitudinal variability of biosignals obtained in studies with rare -but intense- health monitorin. While focus lies on research studies that collect quasi- continuous ultra-high resolution biosignals for subject-specific lengths of time, methods will be generalizable to many other studies with similar data sampling structures. 2         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project provides analytic methods for biological and health signals that are measured often for unequal periods of time (e.g. disease severity scores during hospital stays, EEG data during sleep, reaching hand movement after stroke). Special emphasis is given to the study of the association between these biosignals and health outcomes. 4                ",Statistical methods for biosignals with varying domains,8742367,R01HL123407,"['Address', 'Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Applications Grants', 'Biological', 'Characteristics', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electroencephalography', 'Event', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Length', 'Length of Stay', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Observational Study', 'Organ', 'Organ failure', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Severity of illness', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Study Subject', 'Survival Analysis', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Visit', 'Width', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'clinical care', 'density', 'experience', 'hazard', 'imaging modality', 'indexing', 'kinematics', 'member', 'new technology', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'statistics', 'ultra high resolution']",NHLBI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2014,419500,-0.007935034774988683
"Michigan Hepatotoxicity Clinical Research Network Renewal 2013     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Drug Induced Liver Injury Network (DILIN) was established in 2003 to advance understanding and research into the causes, pathogenesis, and natural history of DILI. The ongoing Retrospective study has collected 109 DNA samples from subjects with liver injury attributed to one of 8 drugs. In addition, 1215 patients with liver injuy attributed to over 100 individual drugs and herbal and dietary supplements (HDS) have been enrolled and followed for at least 6 months in the ongoing DILIN Prospective study. Manuscripts describing the presenting features and clinical outcomes in the overall cohort and with DILI attributed to specific agents have been published. Ancillary studies exploring the chemical content of implicated HDS products have been initiated. The collected DNA, lymphocytes, serum, plasma, and liver tissue have also been used to conduct informative mechanistic studies. The primary aim of the current application is to continue to recruit and enroll suspected DILI patients as early as possible after liver injury onset for collection of biological samples tobe used in genetic, immunological, transcriptomic, and proteomic studies. It is hypothesized that these studies will lead to improved biomarkers of DILI susceptibility, mechanisms, and outcomes. We also propose novel studies of liver elastography to longitudinally assess disease severity and a pilot clinical trial for patients with severe acute DILI. Recruiting and enrolling cases within 2 weeks of DILI onset at the University of Michigan will be accomplished via use of natural language processing algorithms to search inpatient and outpatient electronic medical records as well as the referral of patients from the 140 physician member Michigan Hepatotoxicity Research Network. A second aim of this application is to continue to explore the role of host genetic variation in DILI susceptibility and outcomes using next generation sequencing techniques in high causality score cases. Exome arrays, whole genome, and whole exome sequencing are proposed to identify rare genetic polymorphisms associated with DILI susceptibility followed by expression system and pathway analysis studies. The third aim of this application is to further develop an accurate and reliable computerized causality assessment instrument that will have improved sensitivity and specificity compared to expert opinion and other currently used methods. The coefficients for specific variables of this instrument will be developed from the DILIN database and tested and validated using future DILIN cases and other acute cases of non-DILI hepatitis. The fourth aim of this application is to further develop the LiverTox website as a comprehensive and authoritative resource on DILI. A LiverTox Executive Committee is proposed to oversee and coordinate the development of a computerized causality assessment instrument as well as the development and maintenance of chapters on liver injury due to prescription drugs and HDS products. Finally, a LiverTox website portal is proposed to allow for the submission of bona-fide DILI cases for causality assessment and potential enrollment into future DILIN studies.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The Michigan Hepatotoxicity Research Network proposes to improve our understanding of the causes, mechanisms, and outcomes of drug induced liver injury via the continued enrollment of adult and pediatric patients into the ongoing DILIN Prospective and Retrospective studies. The collection of early blood and urine samples from well-characterized DILI patients will allow for innovative studies of patient, drug and environmental risk factors. Further development of a computerized diagnostic instrument and expansion of the LiverTox website is also planned which will provide doctors, researchers, and the general public an authoritative and up-to-date resource that can help accelerate DILI research in the US and abroad.",Michigan Hepatotoxicity Clinical Research Network Renewal 2013,8717634,U01DK065184,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Anabolic steroids', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Ancillary Study', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Budesonide', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Chemicals', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Enrollment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Etiology', 'Exclusion', 'Expert Opinion', 'Floxacillin', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'General Population', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Hepatitis', 'Hepatotoxicity', 'Histopathology', 'Immunologics', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Injury to Liver', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Liver', 'Lymphocyte', 'Maintenance', 'Manuscripts', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Molecular', 'Monograph', 'Natural History', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Plasma', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Prospective Studies', 'Proteomics', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Recovery', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severity of illness', 'Site', 'Specimen', 'Speed', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Valproic Acid', 'Variant', 'Writing', 'chemical property', 'cohort', 'computerized', 'design', 'dietary supplements', 'elastography', 'exome', 'exome sequencing', 'follow-up', 'genetic variant', 'genome analysis', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'isoniazid', 'liver injury', 'meetings', 'member', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'repository', 'screening', 'transcriptomics', 'web site']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U01,2014,371508,-0.003292544246654424
"Noninvasive Assessment of Neuromuscular Disease using Electrical Impedance     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The neuromuscular disorders include a wide group of conditions ranging from relatively mild focal problems, such as carpal tunnel syndrome, to severe, generalized diseases, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Current methods for evaluating these disorders remain limited to a variety of tests and procedures that are either invasive or remarkably qualitative in nature. One newer technique, electrical impedance myography (EIM), offers the prospect of obtaining quantitative data on muscle condition painlessly and non-invasively. However, no commercial devices specifically tailored for EIM use exist, with nearly all previous EIM work relying upon off-the-shelf bioimpedance devices designed for ""whole-body"" rather than single-muscle assessment. In Phase 1 of this SBIR, Convergence Medical Devices, Inc (CMD) developed an initial prototype system to test proof-of-principle innovative concepts in circuit design and data acquisition to provide highly sensitive and accurate data at an extended frequency range (out to 10 MHz) and over multiple angles relative to the major muscle fiber direction. This work was followed by supplemental work that produced the first hand-held device with robust electronics capable of similar measurements with a detachable, interchangeable electrode array. In this 3-year Phase 2 SBIR, CMD proposes to further refine that technology so as to assist in disease diagnosis and for following disease progression, with a specific focus on amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. In Aim 1 of the proposed grant, testing of multiple electrode array designs will be performed on a group of normal subjects and those with ALS to determine which electrode array designs offer the greatest reproducibility and ability to discriminate healthy from diseased individuals. In Aim 2, the device and the 3 ""best"" array designs identified in Aim 1 will be tested in 30 ALS patients, 30 patients with syndromes mimicking ALS (e.g., polyradiculopathy and motor-predominant neuropathy), and 30 subjects with suspected/possible ALS to determine the single best array design for diagnosis and to determine its sensitivity and specificity. This study will take place at CMD and four external sites and will be managed by the Northeast ALS trials Consortium (NEALS), the premier organization for overseeing clinical trials in ALS. In Aim 3, the 30 suspected/possible ALS patients recruited in SA2 and 30 additional suspected/possible ALS patients will be assessed monthly using EIM and the 3 arrays identified in SA1. All subjects will also undergo standard measurements of disease progression including handheld dynamometry, ALS Functional Rating Scale, and spirometry. The best array design for assessing disease progression will be identified and compared to conventional markers of disease progression to determine EIM's sensitivity to disease status. Thus, at the conclusion of this research program, we anticipate having developed and vigorously tested an EIM device and associated electrode designs that together will serve as a powerful new diagnostic and monitoring tool for neuromuscular disease.          The neuromuscular disorders are a group of conditions that impact the lives of millions of people in the United States alone. In this study, Convergence Medical Devices, in collaboration with neurologists at several medical centers, will develop and test a new device based on the concept of electrical impedance myography, a technique that offers the promise of rapid and accurate disease assessment. With the completion of this study, a new, painless tool will be developed and studied that will assist in individual patient care and will speed drug testing in clinical trials in diseases ranging from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and muscular dystrophy to radiculopathy and polyneuropathy.

"Development of a Multi-Modal Neuroimaging Biomarker for Amyotrophic Lateral Scler     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive degenerative motor neuron disease involving the motor cortex, corpus callosum, cortical spinal tract and spinal anterior horn neurons. The disease has a uniformly fatal outcome, although the clinical presentation and course is quite heterogeneous, with median survival times between 2 - 4 years. Approximately 30,000 people in the United States are living with ALS. There is no definitive diagnostic test for ALS. Confident diagnosis is primarily based on clinical assessment and relies on the detection of upper motor neuron (UMN) and lower motor neuron (LMN) signs in multiple body segments, together with a history of progression of symptoms. Evaluation of LMN pathology may be supplemented by electromyography, but UMN pathology can remain occult as it is only assessed using clinical examination which can lead to diagnostic uncertainty. Unfortunately, there is on average a one- year delay between the onset of symptoms and diagnosis for this rapidly progressive disease; this delay prevents early treatment with emerging disease-modifying drugs. Thus, reliable biomarkers for the early diagnosis and disease prognostication are needed.  Conventional magnetic resonance imaging techniques provide limited and inconsistent information in ALS patients. Therefore, there has been and continues to be great interest in using advanced neuroimaging techniques to establish improved markers of the disease. Although advanced neuroimaging techniques such as magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and resting state functional connectivity (fcMRI) have identified differences between ALS patients and healthy controls, they lack sufficient accuracy to reliably classify individual patients. To meet this important unmet need, the proposed study will use novel advanced neuroimaging techniques to develop a multimodal biomarker of ALS, and validate a discrimination and prediction model to refine the diagnostic clinical workup for ALS.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: There are no definitive tests for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and many of these patients have a delayed diagnosis preventing early intervention with new emerging treatments. Furthermore, disease prognosis is challenging due to the variability of the natural history of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. This study will use multiple advanced neuroimaging methods to build a robust diagnostic test and prognostic model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. We will use a novel statistical approach to develop and validate the models.            ",Development of a Multi-Modal Neuroimaging Biomarker for Amyotrophic Lateral Scler,8695570,R01NS082304,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Anterior', 'Anterior Horn Cells', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical assessments', 'Corpus Callosum', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Electromyography', 'Evaluation', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Heterogeneity', 'Horns', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Motor Neuron Disease', 'Motor Neurons', 'Natural History', 'Neuraxis', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Process', 'Progressive Disease', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Riluzole', 'Spinal', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Transcend', 'Uncertainty', 'United States', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'diagnosis evaluation', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'interest', 'meetings', 'neuroimaging', 'neurotransmission', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'screening', 'spinal tract', 'treatment trial']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2014,616625,-0.010727918566981439
"Optical Tomographic Imaging of Peripheral Arterial Disease     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to build and test a dynamic vascular optical tomographic imaging (DVOTI) system that can be used to detect and monitor peripheral arterial disease (PAD). PAD is estimated to affect approximately 8 to 12 million individuals in the United States. However, the disease is considerably under-diagnosed, since most patients are asymptomatic and no single reliable screening modality has been established. Most of the undiagnosed and untreated patients are diabetics. They commonly suffer from peripheral neuropathy and hence do not sense and report symptoms (such as pain) that are early signs of the disease. Consequently more than 60% (~65,000 per year) of all lower extremity amputations in the United States are performed in diabetic patients with PAD. With the number of diabetic patients expected to triple and reach almost 100 million by 2050, the problems related to undiagnosed PAD will only rise in the years to come  The most widely used diagnostic test for PAD, determination of the ankle-brachial index (ABI) in conjunction with pulse-volume recordings (PVR), is known to be unreliable for diabetics. And even in non- diabetics, ABI with PVR and all other existing diagnostic tests (such as Duplex Ultrasound or Magnetic resonance angiography), only provides accurate information about proximal occlusions in major arteries of the leg. However, none of these tests assess the distal perfusion of the foot where most complications, such as ulcers and gangrene, typically occur. Monitoring the success of surgical interventions, such as angioplasty or bypass surgery, suffers from the same shortcomings, as physicians are limited to the same suite of tests that are inadequate to assess the perfusion of the foot.  Dynamic VOTI promises to overcome the limitations of current diagnostic and monitoring techniques and has the potential to initiate a paradigm shift concerning how vascular diseases are assessed. In preliminary studies we have shown that DVOTI can provide three-dimensional time-series images that provide valuable information about the perfusion of the vascular bed in feet of PAD patients. The near-infrared light used in the instrument has no adverse health effects and measurements can be repeated frequently to monitor post interventional progress. Therefore, we believe that DVOTI will prove to be a safe and accurate method to diagnose and monitor PAD in non-diabetic and diabetic patients.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to build and test a novel optical imaging system that will allow for the diagnosis and monitoring of peripheral artery disease (PAD), which affects approximately 8 to 12 million individuals in the United States. The disease is considerably under-diagnosed, especially in diabetic patients, the elderly, and patients with kidney disease. The system will address an unmet need to directly assess the degree of blood perfusion in the feet, where most PAD-related complications occur, which lead to over 65,000 amputations each year.",Optical Tomographic Imaging of Peripheral Arterial Disease,8724239,R01HL115336,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Air', 'Algorithms', 'Amputation', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Angioplasty', 'Ankle', 'Arteries', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Vessels', 'Bypass', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Classification', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diffusion', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Distal', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Ensure', 'Gangrene', 'Geometry', 'Head', 'Health', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Lead', 'Leg', 'Light', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Angiography', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Peripheral Nervous System Diseases', 'Peripheral arterial disease', 'Physicians', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Preventive', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stroke', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment outcome', 'Ulcer', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Vascular Diseases', 'blood perfusion', 'data acquisition', 'design', 'diabetic', 'diabetic patient', 'evaluation/testing', 'experience', 'foot', 'healthy volunteer', 'image reconstruction', 'indexing', 'instrument', 'light emission', 'non-diabetic', 'novel', 'older patient', 'optical imaging', 'post intervention', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'success', 'theories', 'tissue phantom', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'vascular bed']",NHLBI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2014,341074,0.005962835461614206
"Health Information Technology in Heart Failure Care     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Patients with heart failure experience four million hospitalizations per year in the United States. Of these hospitalizations, approximately three-quarters, or three million hospitalizations annually, are for causes other than heart failure. Patients with heart failure who are hospitalized for other causes are at high risk of post- discharge mortality possibly in part because they are less likely to receive guideline recommended care than patients who are hospitalized primarily for heart failure. Health information technology (HIT) has the potential to improve patient care by enhancing clinician compliance with evidence-based guidelines. Specifically, clinical decision support systems (CDSS) have been used to improve care for patients in hospitals, including those hospitalized for heart failure. Despite their utility, CDSSs have not been developed to apply more broadly to patients with heart failure who are hospitalized for other causes. This is clearly a gap for the millions of patients with heart failure who might experience improved outcomes if they were to receive guideline recommended care. The purpose of this study is to develop and test a CDSS for hospitalized patients who have heart failure, regardless of reason for hospitalization. The firt aim is to develop an Electronic Health Record (EHR) based algorithm to identify patients with heart failure using a variety of computational techniques including natural language processing. The second aim is to develop a CDSS to support delivery of guideline recommended care to hospitalized patients with heart failure using human computer interaction techniques. The third aim is to implement and test the effectiveness of the CDSS on processes of care for patients with heart failure who are hospitalized for other causes. The central hypothesis is that this decision support system will increase adherence to guideline recommended care, ideally improving outcomes as a result. The candidate, Saul Blecker, MD, MHS, is a general internist and clinician investigator at NYU School of Medicine. The candidate proposes a program of career development and training to achieve the following objectives: 1) develop expertise in medical informatics; 2) gain skills in human computer interaction; 3) develop expertise in implementation research. The candidate's primary mentor, Stuart Katz, MD, MS, is a seasoned mentor and researcher in heart failure. His co-mentor is Gilad Kuperman, MD, PhD, a leader in health information technology and medical informatics. Donna Shelley, MD, MPH, an expert in implementation and effectiveness research, will serve as an additional co-mentor. This mentorship team will work closely together to guide Dr. Blecker toward his research goal of leveraging HIT to improve the quality care for patients with heart failure.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Patients with heart failure are hospitalized three million times annually for other causes. These hospitalizations are associated with poor quality of care and high morbidity and mortality. We propose to leverage health information technology to improve outcomes for these patients by creating a novel system of reminders to ensure that hospitalized patients with heart failure receive guideline recommended care.            ",Health Information Technology in Heart Failure Care,8805722,K08HS023683,[' '],AHRQ,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,K08,2014,158241,0.02217424005533187
"Phase 2 Clinical Trial of Coralmyn for Coral Snake Bite (BB-IND 13926,01/02/09)  Abstract Background: Each year, poison control centers report approximately 75 bites by coral snakes (Micrurus and Micruroides species) in the United States. More than half of these occur in Florida, with the rest concentrated in the southeastern states, westward as far as Texas. Before the introduction of anti-coral antivenom by Wyeth in 1967, approximately 10% of Micrurus bites were potentially fatal, due to ventilatory failure caused by neurotoxins active at the neuromuscular junction. Wyeth Ayerst has recently ceased production of this antivenom. In October of 2009, the last vials will expire, leaving the U.S. without a licensed supplier of antivenom. Objectives: Licensure of a new antivenom product, Coralmyn. Specific Aims: (1) Demonstrate the safety of Coralmyn in patients bitten by Micrurus coral snakes, by monitoring recipients for Type I and Type III immune reactions. (2) Demonstrate the value of plasma venom levels as a surrogate endpoint in coral snake bites by relating venom levels to severity of envenomation, before and after treatment. (3) Demonstrate that cost of treatment is different for patients presenting to hospitals with and without antivenom in stock, and use patient cost data to complete a pharmacoeconomic model comparing distribution methodologies applicable to Phase 3 or 4 study design. Research Design and Methods: This will be an open-label Phase 2 clinical trial of Coralmyn (anti-coral serum injectable solution, Instituto Bioclon, S.A. de C.V.) in male and female human patients of any age who present for emergency care following bites by coral snakes of genus Micrurus. Using grant funds, as many hospitals as economically feasible (at least 3 in Florida) will be provided with antivenom with which to enroll patients promptly in the study, using a central IRB. Patients presenting to other sites may enroll in the study either by interhospital transfer or by emergency delivery of antivenom to out-of-network hospitals. In all cases, clinical observations and plasma for venom levels will be collected at study enrollment and hourly until start of study drug. Following infusion of antivenom, clinical observations and plasma collection will be repeated at intervals until hospital discharge; and telephone follow-up will continue through day 22. Clinical and financial data will be extracted by examination of patient records including standardized data collection sheets completed prospectively by hospital staff and extracted into Case Report Forms secondarily by study staff at a central site. Plasma will be frozen and held for batch analysis every six months, using a Micrurus-specific ELISA assay. Statistical analysis of safety indicators will be conducted using Cox Proportional Hazard or survival models. Venom levels will be analyzed using a combination of logistic regression and ANOVA and compared with neurological assessments using a Generalized Linear Mixed Model. Cost data will be entered into a decision-tree model constructed in TreeAge HealthcarePro, and sensitivity analysis will be performed using MonteCarlo simulation.  Project Narrative: Bites by coral snakes can be fatal if the bitten person does not receive antivenom promptly, but the only U.S. manufacturer of coral snake antivenom has stopped making it. This study will test the safety of a new antivenom in patients bitten by coral snakes, it will show whether testing for venom in the bloodstream is a useful way to determine how bad of a bite a person has, and it will show whether it is cost-effective to stock investigational antivenom in just a small number of places if there is no licensed antivenom for hospitals to buy. Results of the study will help doctors, the manufacturer, and the FDA to move forward toward getting a new antivenom for use in the U.S.","Phase 2 Clinical Trial of Coralmyn for Coral Snake Bite (BB-IND 13926,01/02/09)",8520023,R01FD003706,[' '],FDA,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R01,2014,250000,0.023353712327099548
"Informatics for Integrating Biology & the Bedside (i2b2) DESCRIPTION (PROVIDED BY APPLICANT): The large and growing size of the healthcare system makes it imperative to understand what is happening to us, the recipients of healthcare, to be able to efficiently conduct research to improve healthcare delivery and to improve the state of biomedicine by advancing its science. i2b2, ""Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside"" seeks to provide this instrumentation using the informational by products of healthcare and the biological materials accumulated through the delivery of healthcare. This complements existing efforts to create prospective cohort studies or trials outside the delivery of routine healthcare. In the first round of i2b2, we demonstrated that we could identify known adverse events and phenotypically select and then genotype patients for genetic association at approximately 1/10* of the price and less than l/10 of the time usually entailed to develop such populations for study. The challenge we have set ourselves for the next methodological challenge in i2b2 is the development of Virtual Cohort Studies (VCS) encompassing the population of a healthcare system as study subjects and asking questions of comparative effectiveness, unforeseen adverse events and identification of clinically relevant subpopulations including both clinical and genome-scale measures. We will be comparing the results of the VCS to those of carefully planned and executed cohort studies such as the Framingham Heart Study. VCS will require multiple methodological advances and tools development including in the disciplines of natural language processing, temporal reasoning, predictive modeling, biostatistics and machine learning. VCS methods will be tested by two driving biology projects, the first studying a collection of autoimmune diseases and the second type 2 diabetes. In both projects, VCS methods will be applied to investigate the components of cardiovascular risk from the genetic to the epigenetic and including the full range of clinical history including medications exposure. A systems/integrative approach will be taken to identify commonalities in these risk profiles across these disparate disease domains. VCS methods will be shared with i2b2 user community under open source governance while i2b2 user community contributions are folded into the i2b2 toolkit. Public Health Relevance: The i2b2 model of using existing clinical data for high throughput, cost effective, and timely research promises to rapidly leverage our nation's ability to better understand the existing disease burden and how best to achieve cost-effective clinical effectiveness, including new drug targets, new uses of existing drugs and improved management of existing disease.",Informatics for Integrating Biology & the Bedside (i2b2),8519533,U54LM008748,"['Adverse event', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biocompatible Materials', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical effectiveness', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Drug Targeting', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Framingham Heart Study', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genotype', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Informatics', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Population Study', 'Price', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Science', 'Study Subject', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'burden of illness', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'clinically relevant', 'comparative effectiveness', 'cost effective', 'genetic association', 'health care delivery', 'improved', 'instrumentation', 'open source', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'tool development', 'virtual']",NLM,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,U54,2013,3017637,-0.014919944620494164
"Computer-aided detection of non-calcified plaques in coronary CT angiograms   Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in both men and women in the United States. Over 16 million Americans have coronary heart disease (CHD), causing about 0.5 million deaths each year. The most common CHD is coronary artery disease which is mainly caused by atherosclerosis. Clinical evidence in recent years shows that noncalcified plaques (NCPs) are more vulnerable to rupture than calcified plaques. Plaque rupture and the thrombosis that follows is the main cause of acute myocardial infarction. Multidetector coronary CT angiography (cCTA) has the potential to help clinicians in early detection and in quantification of NCPs. cCTA may thus be useful for CHD detection, risk stratification, monitoring, and evaluation of the effectiveness of risk reduction treatment. However, many of these potential applications have not been utilized clinically.  The goal of this project is to develop a computer-aided detection (CADe) system to serve as a second reader for assisting clinicians in detection and quantification of NCPs in cCTA exams. Our specific aims are to (1) develop machine learning methods for detection of NCPs causing stenosis and/or positive remodeling along coronary arteries, and (2) evaluate the effect of CADe on radiologists' detection of NCPs on cCTA by observer ROC study. To achieve these aims, we will collect a database of cCTA cases for training and testing the CADe system, define the search space by designing 3D multiscale coronary artery response enhancement, segmentation, and dynamic balloon vessel tracking methods, develop a unique vessel- stitching method to automatically identify the best-quality phase for each individual artery segment from all available phases in prospectively or retrospectively gated cCTA exams, develop innovative vessel-sector- profile analysis and vessel lumen analysis to detect NCPs that cause stenosis or positive remodeling, estimate the total NCP volume, and explore calibration method to quantify plaque density by phantom studies. To demonstrate the usefulness of CADe, a preclinical reader study will be conducted to compare radiologists' detection accuracy of NCPs with and without CADe.  The major innovations of this project include (1) being the first CADe system to automatically detect non-calcified plaques including those cause positive remodeling or stenosis in cCTA, (2) development of new machine learning techniques including the vessel-stitching method, vessel-sector-profile analysis, multiscale enhancement response, and dynamic balloon tracking specifically suited for coronary arterial trees, and (3) conducting the first ROC study to evaluate the effect of CADe on radiologists' detection of NCPs.  Narrative:  Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in both men and women in the United States. If the proposed CADe system is successfully developed, it will (1) provide an accurate, efficient, and consistent tool to assist clinicians in detecting and quantifying non-calcified plaques (NCP) including those causing positive remodeling and/or stenosis for an individual patient, (2) help clinicians estimate the total NCP burden and study its significance, in analogy to that of the total calcium score, which may lead to improved clinical management of the vulnerable plaques, and (3) accelerate studies to develop new treatment options of coronary heart disease by providing a monitoring tool of treatment response. The proposed CADe system can thus serve as a foundation for these broader future applications and improve the efficacy of cCTA. Improved detection and management of NCPs may reduce the risk of myocardial infarctions and will have strong and long-lasting impact on health care.",Computer-aided detection of non-calcified plaques in coronary CT angiograms,8392109,R01HL106545,"['Acute myocardial infarction', 'American', 'Angiography', 'Arterial Fatty Streak', 'Arteries', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Calcified', 'Calcium', 'Calibration', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Catheters', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary artery', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Procedures', 'Radiation', 'Reader', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Recording of previous events', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Reduction', 'Rupture', 'Scanning', 'Stenosis', 'Stratification', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thrombosis', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trees', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Visual', 'Woman', 'computer aided detection', 'density', 'design', 'detector', 'improved', 'innovation', 'men', 'pre-clinical', 'prospective', 'radiologist', 'response', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'virtual']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2013,552793,-0.03849519062909304
"Exploring the Feasibility of Computational Markers to Predict Atrial Fibrillation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Postoperative atrial fibrillation (PAF) affects a large fraction of patients undergoing cardiac surgery. It is associated with increased postoperative mortality and morbidity, and also results in longer and more expensive hospital stays. While treatments such as prophylactic administration of beta-adrenergic blockers and amiodarone can reduce the incidence of PAF, existing tools to match patients to treatments that are appropriate for their risk need to be improved. Many high-risk patients may benefit from more aggressive treatment than they receive presently. Conversely, many low-risk patients are currently treated in excess of their actual risk of developing PAF. The aim of our research is to develop novel computational markers that can be used to risk stratify patients undergoing cardiac surgery for PAF. Our research uses sophisticated signal processing and machine learning techniques to discover information in the electrocardiogram (ECG) signal related to autonomic and impulse conduction abnormalities. We describe how this information can be combined with existing metrics to identify high risk patients. In addition, we propose the creation of a large public dataset of ECG signals with detailed patient meta-data and outcomes for research by the broader scientific community on predicting PAF. The specific aims of this proposal are: (1) To develop a public database with ECG signals and detailed patient metadata for research on predictive PAF. We will collect ECG data from over 900 patients undergoing cardiac surgery at the University of Michigan Medical Center during the first 12 months of this project with an expected PAF incidence of around 30%. We will share this data and other clinical information (i.e., demographics, comorbidities, laboratory reports, information related to the procedure, and the outcome of PAF) in a de- identified manner with the broader research community through PhysioNet; and (2) To develop and validate novel ECG-based risk markers for PAF. We will explore metrics based on the sympathovagal modulation of the heart, e.g., heart rate turbulence (HRT) and deceleration capacity (DC), which have shown recent promise in predicting ventricular arrhythmias. We will also develop new metrics based on the shape of the ECG to assess atrial myocardial instability. These approaches will be validated on the data collected in Aim 1, and will be used to develop models based on non-parametric machine learning techniques to accurately assess PAF risk.           Postoperative atrial fibrillation commonly occurs in patients undergoing cardiac surgery (e.g., coronary artery bypass graft or valve repair). It is associated with an increased risk of both mortality and morbidity, and increases the cost of hospitalization significantly. Successful management of patients undergoing cardiac surgery therefore relies on the ability of clinicians to estimate the risk of postoperative atrial fibrillation, and ideally, to anticipate and prevent this event. We propose to develop low-cost, and widely applicable methods that would improve the ability of physicians to identify patients at high risk of postoperative atrial fibrillation. They key concept for this proposal is that ECG signals contain valuable information that can help predict high or low risk cases using sophisticated techniques from signal processing and machine learning. This information can be used to develop clinical tools to improve management of patients undergoing cardiac surgery. In addition to developing these tools, we also propose the creation of a large public database that can help other researchers with an interest in predicting postoperative atrial fibrillation.",Exploring the Feasibility of Computational Markers to Predict Atrial Fibrillation,8484439,R21LM011026,"['Address', 'Adrenergic beta-Antagonists', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Amiodarone', 'Arrhythmia', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Blinded', 'Bradycardia', 'Cardiac Surgery procedures', 'Clinical', 'Coagulation Process', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Coronary Artery Bypass', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Deceleration', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Equilibrium', 'Event', 'Heart', 'Heart Atrium', 'Heart Rate', 'Hospitalization', 'Incidence', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Laboratories', 'Length of Stay', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical center', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Postoperative Period', 'Prevention', 'Procedures', 'Prophylactic treatment', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Marker', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Techniques', 'Universities', 'Ventricular Arrhythmia', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'data sharing', 'demographics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'interest', 'millisecond', 'mortality', 'novel', 'prevent', 'prophylactic', 'repaired', 'tool', 'valve replacement']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R21,2013,152303,-0.00983881166334922
"CHRiSS: Cardiac Health Risk Stratification System     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): SUMMARY This project aims to produce and beta-test a clinical decision support application for end- stage heart failure, titled CHRiSS: Cardiac Health Risk Stratification System. It will be designed for patients with progressive heart failure who may eventually become candidates for ventricular assist device (VAD) therapy. The software will be build upon existing machine learning and data mining technology, developed by the PI and colleagues, designed to predict 90-day mortality following VAD implantation. This Phase- 1 effort will entail development of graphic user interfaces for both patients and clinicians to incorporate personalized prognostic information into a functional decision-support utility. The inference algorithm will also be expanded to encompass adverse events, and risk of readmission. In this Phase-1 feasibility project, CHRiSS will be programmed and beta-tested at West Penn Allegheny Health System (WPAHS). This will entail semi- structured interviews to collect relevant expert knowledge, and mining the electronic medical records (EMR) to calibrate the prognostic algorithm to the institution-specific data. Successful completion of this Phase I project will lead to a multi-center trial in which the software is fully validated. Ultimate succes of this project will result in a software application that will optimize the benefit of VAD therapy to public health, while reducing cost by reducing the unacceptably high rate of adverse events and unnecessary readmissions.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Narrative Heart-assist devices are becoming more commonly used to treat people with severe cardiac failure - who otherwise have few options to return to a normal life. It is estimated that tens of thousands of Americans could benefit from this therapy annually; however, only a few thousand are performed per year. This project aims to develop a software application to better inform patients and doctors about the risks and benefits of this therapy. It will assist patients and doctors to work together when weighing options - with respect to both survival and quality of life. The long-term benefits would be to improve the efficiency of delivering this therapy, thereby reducing the cost, and expanding its distribution to the many people that need it.            ",CHRiSS: Cardiac Health Risk Stratification System,8592756,R41HL120428,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Businesses', 'Cardiac', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Computer software', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Cost Effectiveness Analysis', 'Cost Savings', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Education', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Foundations', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health system', 'Heart failure', 'Heart-Assist Devices', 'Hospitals', 'Incidence', 'Institution', 'Intensive Care', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Length of Stay', 'Life', 'Life Style', 'Machine Learning', 'Marketing', 'Medical', 'Medicare', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Needs Assessment', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Postoperative Period', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Risk', 'Savings', 'Software Tools', 'Staging', 'Stratification', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Update', 'Work', 'computer human interaction', 'cost', 'data mining', 'design', 'graphical user interface', 'implantation', 'improved', 'mortality', 'outcome forecast', 'patient population', 'preference', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'satisfaction', 'success', 'tool', 'trend', 'usability', 'ventricular assist device']",NHLBI,BLENDERHOUSE,R41,2013,150000,-0.009090693660840341
"Early CSF detection of FTLD DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) is the second most common cause of dementia among subjects under the age of 65. There are two main FTLD subtypes: FTLD associated with lesions immunoreactive to TDP-43 (FTLD-TDP), and FTLD associated with Tau-immunoreactive lesions (FTLD-Tau). Currently, the exact FTLD pathology cannot be confidently defined until autopsy, and there is an urgent need for ante- mortem biomarker which reliably predict FTLD pathology. Over the past 30 months, I have identified and validated a panel of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) FTLD-TDP biomarkers that identified FTLD-TDP patients with 85% accuracy, including Tau phosphorylation, tripeptidyl peptidase 1 (TPP1) levels, and inflammatory protein levels (FAS, eotaxin-3, IL-23), with 85% accuracy in distinguishing between the two main FTLD subtypes. The identification and validation of these CSF alterations will serve as the basis of the current proposal to translate these markers towards clinical application through multi-site technical validation and advanced classification through machine-based learning, and to better characterize altered biochemical pathways in FTLD-TDP. First, I hypothesize that we can reduce the coefficient of variation for each FTLD-TDP biomarker to under 15% through a multi-site technical validation using 60 banked CSF samples. I will test this hypothesis in Aim 1 by determining technical factors (freeze-thawing, blood contamination, detergent use, protease inhibitor use, buffer condition) which reduce assay precision, and validating the assay at Penn. Second, I hypothesize that machine-based learning/support vector machine approach will better diagnose FTLD-TDP by taking into account non-linear effects of age, gender, and disease duration. I will test this hypothesis in Aim 2 by comparing the classification performance between more established algorithms and the support vector machine algorithm. Lastly, I hypothesize that these biomarker changes reflect altered biochemical pathways in FTLD-TDP. I will test this hypothesis by measuring brain and CSF levels of proteins involved in Tau phosphorylation, TPP1 maturation, and inflammation. As an exploratory Sub-aim 3a, I will determine if any of the changes from Aims 1 & 3 are detectable in asymptomatic subjects carrying familial FTLD-TDP mutations, to power an R01 application on longitudinal CSF biomarker changes in prodromal FTLD-TDP subjects. I will carry out this proposal with guidance from my mentoring team including Allan Levey, MD, PhD (Emory), John Trojanowski, MD, PhD (Penn), James Lah, MD, PhD (Emory), Jonathan Glass, MD (Emory), Leslie Shaw, PhD (Penn), and Eva Lee, PhD (Georgia Tech). I will also obtain formal training in biostatistics, bioinformatics, analytical chemistry, quality control, clinical trial design, geriatrics, and responsible conduct of research. Successful completion of the aims in the current proposal will establish the standard procedures to clinically  translate promising FTLD-TDP biomarkers, determine the best algorithm to diagnose FTLD-TDP using these biomarkers, and identify altered CSF and brain pathways related to these biomarker alterations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: FTLD is the second most common cause of dementia among subjects under the age of 65, and patients and their caregivers face unique challenges including poor judgment on the job, single parents suffering from FTLD with young children, and working spouses as caregivers. There is currently no reliable way to predict the underlying FTLD subtype, and as a result it is challenging to enroll the appropriate patients for substrate-specifi clinical trials (such as drugs targeting TDP but not Tau). This proposal will establish the standardized measurements of FTLD-TDP biomarkers towards translating this research panel into clinical testing, and identify biomarker changes which can be used even when symptoms are very mild. Early and accurate FTLD- TDP diagnosis will enhance future drug development and clinical trial design to alleviate the unique personal, social, and economic burden of FTLD.",Early CSF detection of FTLD,8593988,K23AG042856,"['Accounting', 'Adult', 'Adult Children', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Autopsy', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Buffers', 'Caregivers', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Collection', 'Controlled Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Detergents', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Drug Targeting', 'Economic Burden', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'Face', 'Freezing', 'Frontotemporal Lobar Degenerations', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Geriatrics', 'Glass', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Institutes', 'Judgment', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Occupations', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phosphorylation', 'Procedures', 'Protease Inhibitor', 'Proteins', 'Quality Control', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Sampling', 'Single Parent', 'Site', 'Spouses', 'Staging', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapy Clinical Trials', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Tube', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'age effect', 'base', 'brain pathway', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'design', 'drug development', 'human CCL26 protein', 'illness length', 'improved', 'inflammatory marker', 'interleukin-23', 'model design', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'protein TDP-43', 'public health relevance', 'research clinical testing', 'research study', 'response', 'responsible research conduct', 'social', 'tau Proteins', 'tau phosphorylation', 'tau-1', 'tool', 'tripeptidyl aminopeptidase']",NIA,EMORY UNIVERSITY,K23,2013,156324,-0.008463535097004248
"Techniques to Integrate Disparate Data: Clinical Personalized Pragmatic Predictio DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): An unsolved problem in health informatics is how to apply the past experiences of patients, stored in large-scale medical records systems, to predict the outcomes of patients and to individualize care. One approach to prediction, heretofore impractical, is rapidly finding a patient cohort ""similar enough"" to an index case that the health experiences and outcomes of this cohort are informative for prediction. This task is formidable because of large variability of the vast numbers of patient attributes with the added complexity of sequences of patient encounters evolving over time. Epidemiological considerations such as confounding by indication for treatment also come into play. The objective of this research effort is to (1) create a modular test bed that uses a ""big data"" systems architecture to support research in rapid individualized prediction of outcomes from large clinical repositories and (2) to  explore various approaches to making ""pragmatic"" near-term predictions of outcomes. Using the Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) Informatics and Computing Infrastructure database (VINCI), a research database with records of tens of millions of patients, we will explore two synergistic strategies for rapidly finding a cohort of patients that are similar enough to an index  patient to predict near-term treatment response and/or adverse effects in an elastic cloud environment: 1) use of temporal alignment of critical events including use of gene sequence alignment methods to relax requirements for exact temporal matching; and, 2) use of conceptual distance metrics to model the degree of content similarity of case records. The initial domain of application will be treatment of Type 2 diabetes. The approach will apply open source ""big data"" methodologies, including Hadoop and Accumulo, to store and filter ""medical log"" files. The content of these ""logs"" will be processed by a combination with strategies including conceptual markup of events using natural language processing tools, matching of event streams, and statistical data mining methods to rapidly retrieve and identify patients that are sufficiently similar to an index case to be able to make personalized yet pragmatic clinical predictions of outcomes. RELEVANCE (See instructions): This proposal studies how to use experience of past patients, stored in electronic medical records systems, to help clinicians make practical decisions on the care of complex patients with type 1 diabetes. Research applies methods adapted from Internet search engines and from studies of the human genome to determine what it means for one patient's disease experiences to be similar to and relevant to another's. n/a",Techniques to Integrate Disparate Data: Clinical Personalized Pragmatic Predictio,8599828,R01GM108346,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Adverse effects', 'Algorithms', 'Beds', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biosensing Techniques', 'Budgets', 'Caring', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Child', 'Child health care', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinic Visits', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer Systems', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Coupled', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Element', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disasters', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Exclusion', 'Extensible Markup Language', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Germ-Line Mutation', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Human Development', 'Human Genome', 'Imagery', 'Informatics', 'Information Systems', 'Institutes', 'Instruction', 'Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Internet', 'Language', 'Letters', 'Location', 'Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Medicine', 'Metadata', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Oncogenes', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Privacy', 'Process', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Records', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Support', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Source', 'Specialist', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translational Research', 'Triage', 'United States National Library of Medicine', 'Variant', 'Veterans', 'Visualization software', 'Vocabulary', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'base', 'bench to bedside', 'cancer type', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'data integration', 'data mining', 'design', 'emergency service responder', 'experience', 'genome analysis', 'genome sequencing', 'improved', 'indexing', 'interoperability', 'medical information system', 'novel', 'open source', 'parallel processing', 'performance tests', 'processing speed', 'repository', 'research study', 'response', 'sugar', 'system architecture', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor progression', 'virtual']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R01,2013,568249,-0.007537917908620076
"Automated Web-Based Behavioral Diagnostics of Cognitive Impairment    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alzheimer's disease affects an estimated 5.3 million Americans currently, and this number is expected to grow significantly in the coming decade. A critical goal of Alzheimer's disease research is to improve current methods of diagnosis so that patients can be identified sooner and, therefore, obtain greater advantage from available therapies. The major goal of this project is to develop and validate an automated, web-based method for early diagnosis of cognitive decline and memory loss. We will build on current research that has demonstrated a clear link between performance on the Visual Paired- Comparison Task (VPC) and diagnosis of MCI, and we will extend the impact of this finding by developing a suite of software tools and analysis methods that will improve the accuracy and extend the accessibility of cognitive diagnostics with a web-based VPC task that can be widely deployed. Although the VPC task is promising as a diagnostic aid, clinical application is severely limited by the need to use an eye tracker to precisely monitor subjects' eye movements. Unfortunately, eye trackers are expensive, require trained personnel, and are not widely available. However, our preliminary findings show that it is possible to produce picture examination behavior that is similar to eye-movements, using modified versions of the VPC task that could be administered by anyone, on any computer with an internet connection. In addition, powerful machine learning techniques from computer science can help accurately analyze and diagnose the resulting behavior. An important contribution from this work will be the possibility of predicting oncoming cognitive decline in MCI patients sooner than is now possible, that is, at a time when the nervous system is less compromised and more likely to benefit from therapeutic intervention. In support of this objective, we propose three aims: 1) Develop and investigate appropriate representation of eye movement characteristics and corresponding machine learning-based classification techniques for effective identification of the patient status, 2) Develop and validate a web-based version of the VPC task, and 3) explore the feasibility of our task as an automatic screening instrument for the general elderly population. Successful completion of these aims has the potential to dramatically alter the current practice of clinical translational research as well as the current methods used for diagnosing cognitive deficits. This would enable thousands and potentially millions of patients and potential research subjects to take the test as part of their routine checkup, requiring nothing more than a computer with an internet connection.

"Hand Sensorimotor Function and Carpal Tunnel Syndrome    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The median nerve is susceptible to compression in the wrist, leading to carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). CTS is the most common compression neuropathy and have an immense impact on national health care, worker productivity, and quality of life. Despite its high prevalence and public health cost, our understanding of CTS is limited, and the management of CTS awaits improvement. The central notion of this project is that hand sensorimotor function is sensitive to peripheral median neuropathy and that the central nervous system is affected by CTS, causing the associated sensorimotor deficit. We will investigate this notion with quantifiable sensorimotor data from novel biomechanical and neurophysiological studies. This project has three aims consisting of biomechanical, neurophysiological and translational research. The first aim is to investigate CTS-induced pathokinematic and pathokinetic performance using dexterous manual tasks of thumb opposition, reach-to-pinch, precision grip, and finger pressing. The second aim is to investigate the neurophysiological implications of chronic peripheral neuropathy (i.e., CTS) on the central nervous system by evaluating corticomuscular coupling and stretch reflex. The third aim is to identify novel biomechanical and neurophysiological markers for CTS cases using machine learning and classification algorithms. The results of this project will elucidate the pathological mechanisms and behavioral manifestations of CTS and aid in the development of new strategies for diagnosis, evaluation, rehabilitation, and treatment of this disorder. More generally, CTS as a chronic neuropathy serves as an effective model to study sensorimotor mechanisms of the peripheral and central nervous systems. In addition, the methodology developed in this project is applicable to other neuromuscular disorders.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:   Carpal tunnel syndrome is highly prevalent and costly. One of the distinct consequences of carpal tunnel syndrome is that patients experience inexplicable dropping of objects and clumsiness while performing simple daily tasks. In this project, we propose to study the sensorimotor deficit using novel biomechanical and neurophysiological experiments. The results of this project will elucidate the pathological mechanisms and manifestations of carpal tunnel syndrome. This project is clinically translational to aid in the development of new strategies for diagnosis, evaluation, rehabilitation, and treatment of this disorder.

"Computational Approach to Personalized Anemia Management     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Effective anemia management in End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) is a complex task due to large variation in erythropoietic response among the ESRD patients. Evidence shows that excessive doses of Erythropoiesis Stimulating Agents (ESA), used in hypo-responsive patients, coincide with increased cardiovascular complications. In addition to health risks, reimbursement restrictions imposed by Medicare demand additional vigilance in ESA administration. Iron is one of the most important elements affecting the erythropoietic response. The ongoing blood losses associated with hemodialysis treatments, increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, and access complications, as well as poor iron absorption lead to iron depletion in ESRD patients. Standard anemia management protocols do not fully address the synergistic nature of interactions between erythropoietin and iron. Personalized strategies for coordinated ESA and iron dosing are therefore necessary to achieve the desired clinical outcome, reduce patient risk exposure, and improve the cost-effectiveness of treatment. Our long-term goal is the advancement of biomedical computing to personalize medicine and pharmacologic management of chronic conditions. The objective of this project is to address the challenge of multiple drug dosing personalization with a specific application to ESA and iron management in anemia of ESRD. The central hypothesis is that a computational approach can be developed to perform coordinated personalized dosing of erythropoiesis stimulating agents and iron in order to achieve desired clinical outcomes and minimize patient exposure resulting in optimal care. The rationale behind the proposed research is that computational models quantifying the interaction between iron and erythropoietin can be applied through the principles of control theory and machine learning, to derive personalized dosing strategies for both agents. The main objective will be accomplished through three specific aims: 1) quantification of the erythropoietin-iron interaction through clinically relevant computational models, 2) application of such models to derive algorithms for coordinated personalized ESA and iron dosing, 3) validation of these algorithms through an ""in sillico"" trial for a wide range o simulated subjects and clinical conditions. The expected outcome of this project is a new systematic approach to the management of ESRD anemia using multiple agents resulting in improved patient care and decreased cost which will be broadly applicable to other therapeutic areas.          The proposed research is relevant to public health because personalized dosing of multiple therapeutic agents broadly applicable to many chronic conditions is ultimately expected to improve cost-effectiveness of treatment and minimize patient risk. The proposed research is relevant to the NIH mission because it contributes toward advancement of personalized medicine, one of the top priorities of the NIH.

"Neurophysiologically Based Responsive Pharmacotherapy for Epilepsy     DESCRIPTION: Despite taking daily medications, over 1/3 of patients with epilepsy continue to have seizures, and many  more experience significant adverse side effects from antiepileptic drugs (AED). Though patients may spend as little as 0.01% of their time actually having seizures, they must maintain chronic therapeutic AED levels for years to decades. The reason AEDs are taken daily for seizures that only occur sporadically, and in many  cases infrequently, is because patients do not know when a seizure will strike. Arguably the unpredictability of seizures and the adverse cognitive and physical side effects associated with AEDs, are the most disabling aspects of epilepsy. We now have compelling evidence from humans that seizures are not random events, but rather are associated with intracranial EEG (lEEG) changes that occur tens of minutes to hours before clinical events. This research has lead NeuroVista Inc. to develop a seizure advisory system (SAS) that uses iEEG and machine learning algorithms to track the probability of seizure occurrence. Using patient specific algorithms NeuroVista's SAS can forecast periods of increased and decreased seizure likelihood with high sensitivity and specificity, benchmarked against a chance predictor. NeuroVista's SAS has been validated in humans undergoing IEEG monitoring for epilepsy surgery, and has recently been approved for a human pilot clinical trial in Australia.  We propose to use the NeuroVista's SAS device to guide the delivery of AEDs. We hypothesize that intelligent delivery of AEDs at times of increased seizure likelihood will effectively prevent clinical seizures.  During periods of low seizure likelihood AEDs would not be required, reducing side effects. In this proposal we develop and test neurophysiologically-based responsive pharmacotherapy in naturally occurring canine epilepsy as the first step in creating a new treatment paradigm for medically resistant human partial epilepsy.  Naturally occurring canine partial epilepsy is an ideal model for developing this therapy because of the clinical, physiological, and pharmacological similarities between canine and human partial epilepsy. In addition, dogs are large enough to tolerate implantation of the human SAS device. This project will lead to submission of an investigational device exemption to conduct a first-in-human clinical trial of SAS guided responsive AED therapy.

"Ancillary Comparative Effectiveness of Atrial Fibrillation Ablation Surgery    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This proposal describes an ancillary study to a recently initiated comparative effectiveness trial ""Surgical Ablation versus No Surgical Ablation for Patients with Persistent or Longstanding Persistent Atrial Fibrillation Undergoing Mitral Valve Surgery"" (NCT00903370), which is part of the NHLBI-sponsored Cardiothoracic Surgery Network (CTSN). Its aims are to perform a time-sensitive substudy of continuous heart rhythm monitoring and to develop and apply novel statistical tools to assess ablation effectiveness in groups of patients. As such, it will provide critical new knowledge to support a secondary objective of the parent trial: to inform rhythm monitoring and analysis strategies for future trials of rhythm control in atrial fibrillation (AF).  Great enthusiasm for innovative tissue-destroying (ablation) procedures to treat AF has led to technology outstripping science. Mechanisms of AF (which afflicts >3 million Americans) remain poorly understood, methods to assess its cure are primitive, and guidelines for analyzing rhythm outcomes are flawed due to lack of appropriate statistical methodology. Why? After ablation procedures, AF may recur in episodes of varying duration. Yet current monitoring consists of ""snapshots"" of semiannual rhythm recording (Holter), or more frequent-but short-transtelephonic monitoring (TTM). Ideally, an implantable monitoring device could detect all these episodes over a patient's lifetime; however, even if this were possible, statistical methods to analyze this series of occurrences in groups of patients for comparative effectiveness of AF therapies or to identify risk factors are poorly developed. Right now a window of opportunity exists to make important strides in more thorough AF assessment and proper data analysis because the CTSN has just launched a randomized trial of surgical AF therapies that includes weekly TTM of atrial rhythm as well as traditional 6- and 12-month Holter assessment. We propose a time-sensitive substudy of implanting an FDA-approved miniature loop recorder to capture AF episodes continuously. These data will be used in the development of a suite of new analytic methods for aggregating data such as these across time and across patients to characterize time course and identify modulating factors. They will then be used to assess the trial's rhythm endpoints and suggest designs for more informative future trials with substantially reduced sample size. We have assembled a team of clinicians and statisticians, including individuals who designed the parent trial, who are experienced in implanting the monitoring device, and who are experts in analytic methods research, to develop and apply novel methods to these several types of rhythm data. We will leverage developments from an intramural NHLBI machine learning program at Cleveland Clinic and State of Ohio-funded Atrial Fibrillation Innovation Center. The analytic methods have wide applicability to the important field of longitudinal data analysis.    A chaotic heart rhythm called atrial fibrillation (AF), which affects more than 3 million Americans, especially the elderly, causes strokes, and commonly accompanies heart valve disease. AF treatments outstrip scientific understanding of the rhythm and how to assess treatment success across time in clinical trials. Thus, the Institute of Medicine has placed trials of AF treatment in the first tier of 100 comparative effectiveness priorities for the nation. An NIH-sponsored trial of surgical treatment of AF is has just been launched, and we propose a substudy of an implanted rhythm monitoring device (Medtronic REVEAL XT) and new methods of AF analysis for groups of patients that will help assess the trial's endpoints and inform future trials. Thus, this ancillary study application proposes to (1) collect, in a subset of patients, more refined rhythm data than proposed in the parent trial, (2) develop generalizable new methods of analysis, and (3) apply these methods to both the data collected through continuous monitoring as well as the follow-up data collected in the parent trial through Holter and trans-telephonic monitoring.

"A Novel eFace System to Prevent the Risks of Facial Distortion after CMF Surgery     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The number of patients suffering from craniomaxillofacial (CMF) deformities and requiring surgical correction is escalating. CMF deformities may involve skeleton, overlying soft-tissues, or the both. Patients with CMF deformities often have psychological problems. The goal of CMF surgery is to reconstruct a normal facial appearance and function, and the outcome of the surgery is judged as such. The current problem is that we do not have a reliable way of simulating the soft-tissue-change following skeletal reconstruction. In treating patients with isolated skeletal defects, the current practice is to normalize the skeleton, hoping for optimal facial appearance. However, because the thickness and contour of the soft-tissue envelope varies from patient to patient, this approach is not reliable. The problem is even bigger in patients with composite defects. For example, in the scenario of a patient with a skeletal deformity and a mild soft-tissue defect, a surgeon would have to know, before surgery, how to overcorrect the skeleton to camouflage the soft-tissue defect. But, this information can only be attained by having an accurate planning system to simulate soft-tissue changes. In addition, from patient's perspective, the final facial appearance is the most apparent to them. Therefore, it is extremely important, for both doctors and patients, to accurately simulate soft-tissue-deformation.  Simulation methods must be accurate and fast. Attaining both is difficult because these attributes are inversely related, the more accurate the model, the longer it takes to prepare and run. Among the most effective, they are empirical-based model, mass spring model, finite element model, and mass tensor model. Unfortunately they are either too inaccurate or too slow, and clinically unacceptable.  Our hypothesis is that facial soft-tissue changes following virtual osteotomy can be accurately simulated by our innovative approach using an anatomically detailed modeling and mapping routine, along with statistical modeling technique. To test our hypothesis, we propose to develop an open source novel imaging informatics platform, eFace system, to accurately simulate soft-tissue-change following virtual osteotomies, and thus to significantly improve the outcomes of patients undergoing facial reconstruction. This approach can not only maintain the integrity of complex facial anatomy to accurately simulate the facial soft tissue deformation, but also significantly improve the computational efficiency in order to fit the requirement for clinical use  This project presents an innovative approach to model the facial soft-tissue deformation. If successful, it will allow accurate simulation of soft-tissue changes after virtual osteotomy. Patients will also be able to foresee the postoperative face preoperatively (patient education) and regain their psychological confidence. Finally, eFace will have significant impact and applications in orthodontics, plastic surgery, general surgery, growth/aging prediction, and forensic science.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In the US and throughout the world, the number of patients requiring surgical correction for facial deformities, which involves skeleton, overlying soft tissu, or both, is escalating every year. 2. Currently, while surgeons are able to accurately plan bone reconstructive surgery, they have to use  their visual imagination with clinical experience to mentally predict the facial soft tissue changes  following the bone surgery because they do not have a reliable way of simulating the soft-tissue-change  that is resulted from skeletal reconstruction. 3. We are proposing to develop an open source novel imaging informatics platform, eFace system, to accurately simulate soft-tissue-change following virtual skeletal surgery and thus to significantly improve the outcomes of patients undergoing facial reconstruction.            ",A Novel eFace System to Prevent the Risks of Facial Distortion after CMF Surgery,8439794,R01DE021863,"['Address', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Appearance', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Deformity', 'Development', 'Elements', 'Face', 'Figs - dietary', 'Forensic Sciences', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Imagination', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Orthodontics', 'Osteotomy', 'Outcome', 'Patient Education', 'Patients', 'Plastic Surgical Procedures', 'Plastics', 'Postoperative Period', 'Property', 'Reconstructive Surgical Procedures', 'Reporting', 'Residual state', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Severities', 'Simulate', 'Skeleton', 'Speed', 'Statistical Models', 'Surgeon', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'balance testing', 'base', 'bone', 'craniomaxillofacial', 'experience', 'imaging informatics', 'improved', 'improved functioning', 'innovation', 'meetings', 'novel', 'open source', 'prevent', 'psychologic', 'public health relevance', 'reconstruction', 'simulation', 'skeletal', 'skeletal surgery', 'soft tissue', 'system architecture', 'virtual']",NIDCR,METHODIST HOSPITAL RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2013,387788,-0.004636192449203487
"ICP Elevation Alerting Based on a Predictive Model Hosting Platform DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recurring acute ICP elevations occur frequently and unpredictably among severe brain injury patients. ICP elevation can cause cerebral ischemia and lead to deadly brain herniation if untreated. Hence, prompt recognition and treatment of rising ICP are critical in managing severe brain injury patients. However, existing protocols in most neurocritical care units are reactive where bedside nurses, in response to simple threshold-crossing alarms, have to check numerical display of ICP on monitors to manually establish whether the alarm is a true one before initiating treatment. Acute ICP elevation is accompanied by distinctive ICP pulse morphological changes. By utilizing ICP pulse morphological metrics as input, we can accurately recognize precursors to ICP elevation to alert nurses and free them from a cognitively demanding process of establishing whether a consistent ICP elevation triggers the alarm. We therefore propose to deploy a previously developed accurate ICP elevation prediction model on an open-source model hosting platform to monitor continuous ICP signals and alert bedside nurses. Using this alerting system, we will further investigate the principal physiological abnormalities associated with acute ICP elevation showing different precursory ICP patterns prior to onset of elevation. We will pursue the following three aims: 1) To develop an alerting system for ICP elevation based on a model hosting platform; 2) To investigate whether the ICP alerting system helps nurses more efficiently manage ICP. 3) To detect consistent physiological abnormalities associated with acute ICP elevation. Our long-term goal is to advance intensive care monitoring so that continuous signals from monitors are fully explored to integrate with the rest of clinical data in an electronic medical record (EMR) system to enhance clinical decision making. This project represents an effort piloting a platform-based approach towards overcoming translational barriers that impede the process of making advanced predictive analytics available at point of care. Therefore, broad impacts from this project are related to future efforts at leveraging this open model hosting platform to facilitate the translation of additional predictive models in other ICUs. Recurring acute intracranial pressure (ICP) elevation occurs frequently, up to more than 20 in a 12-hour nursing shift, and unpredictably among severe brain injury patients. These acute ICP elevations needs prompt treatment before they impair blood flow to the brain and cause deadly brain herniation. The present work is built upon our previously developed algorithm of detecting acute ICP elevation and an open software platform for hosting predictive algorithms to further develop and evaluate a real-time ICP elevation alerting system that will provide accurate alerts of impending ICP elevation.

"Motion, Artifact Cancelling MIMO Method for Ambulatory Respiratory Rate Monitorin     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Shortness of breath and difficulty in breathing are directly associated with deteriorating conditions in patients with heart failure (HF) and/or chroni obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Continuous monitoring of respiratory status in these patients can alert caregivers to administer early interventions to manage disease symptoms, thus preventing catastrophic events and improving quality of life. Unfortunately, continuous monitoring of respiratory rate and pattern is often overlooked or neglected in clinical practice due to the general difficulty in performing these measurements, especially in non-intubated ambulatory settings. Present measurement methods that capture the patient's airway are most accurate but difficult to administer and often intolerable for the patient, whereas methods that rely on capturing chest motion historically suffer from poor accuracy due to motion artifacts.  We propose a MIMO-based motion artifact cancelling multi-lead impedance measurement method for robust ambulatory respiratory rate monitoring. We have recently demonstrated that respiration and motion artifacts are theoretically separable in ambulatory subjects with multi-lead impedance measurements. The motion artifacts are sporadic and localized high energy non-stationary events compared to respiratory signals. Due to the limited dynamic range and quantization errors of the conventional data acquisition system, source separation algorithms struggle to extract reliable respiratory signal information. The proposed MIMO system approach overcomes these limitations by integrating statistical learning directly within analog to digital conversion process. As a result, this miniaturized hardware realization method enables continuous, real-time and power-efficient tracking of the respiratory signal corrupted by motion artifacts.  Preliminary study of the MIMO based algorithm has shown promising results for ambulatory respiratory rate monitoring. In this research we plan to develop the optimized hardware prototype of the MIMO system to validate the performance under real ambulatory conditions. We believe that the MIMO based multi-lead imped- ance measurement method is likely to be accepted by both clinicians and patients due to routine use of electrodes. Going forward, in our future work we envision integrating the proposed research with ECG monitoring sharing same set of electrodes to provide continuous and accurate cardiorespiratory information for general ward as well as for home health/wellness monitoring of ambulatory patients.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Continuous monitoring of respiratory status in COPD and HF patients can alert caregivers to administer early interventions to manage disease symptoms, thus preventing catastrophic events and improving quality of life. In ambulatory patients, accuracy remains an issue for non-intubated methods relying on chest motion due to physical motion artifacts.

"Early Detection of Keratoconus    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Keratoconus is the most common degenerative disease affecting the cornea. This condition tends to develop around puberty and to progress over the next few decades, but its clinical history can be quite variable. As keratoconus develops, the cornea thins and bulges. Eventually, a corneal transplant may be needed to maintain vision. In its earliest stages, the disease is particularly difficult to detect, even using state-of-the-art diagnostic techniques such as anterior/posterior surface topography. This is of great importance to the corneal refractive surgeon because surgical treatment of an occult keratoconic cornea will weaken it and greatly accelerate the occurrence of symptoms. Because of the difficulty in differentiating early keratoconus from atypical normal corneas, many normal eyes deemed 'suspicious' are denied treatment. At the same time, some keratoconic eyes are missed and operated upon, with disastrous consequences. Early detection of keratoconus may also benefit patients because of the recent development of methods for strengthening the corneal stroma and preventing disease progression. We have developed a technique based on the use of high resolution ultrasound for imaging the cornea and measuring the thickness of its component layers, including the epithelium (about 50 microns in thickness) and the stroma (about 500 microns in thickness). We have shown that the epithelium, which is the surface layer of the cornea, will remodel itself to smooth out underlying irregularities. In early keratoconus, as the anterior stromal surface begins to bulge forward, the epithelium will thin above the apex of the bulge and thicken around it, to maintain a smooth anterior surface. This compensatory mechanism prevents anterior surface topography from detecting keratoconus in its early stages. We have also developed methods for characterizing the elastic properties of the cornea by inducing and measuring surface displacements in response to a pulse of acoustic radiation force. We will further develop and test this technique and apply it clinically in conjunction with the Ocular Response Analyzer, an instrument that causes a similar effect by use of an air pressure pulse. This proposal will involve analysis of topographic and pachymetric patterns and elastic properties in normal, keratoconus and keratoconus-suspicious eyes. We will develop an index based on multivariate analysis of these patterns based on unambiguously classified cases, and validate the risk index on suspicious cases based on clinical documentation of disease progression. Our goal is to reduce the percentage of screened cases deemed keratoconus- suspicious by at least a factor of two by allowing an unambiguous diagnosis of early keratoconus. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Keratoconus (KC) is a corneal dystrophy will in many cases ultimately require corneal transplantation to maintain vision. Early detection, which is not possible with current technology, would allow early treatment and prevent sever damage to KC corneas inadvertently operated upon for correction of vision. Our aim is to combine measurements of corneal elasticity, topography and epithelial thickness to develop means for early detection of KC.

In addition, 1215 patients with liver injuy attributed to over 100 individual drugs and herbal and dietary supplements (HDS) have been enrolled and followed for at least 6 months in the ongoing DILIN Prospective study. Manuscripts describing the presenting features and clinical outcomes in the overall cohort and with DILI attributed to specific agents have been published. Ancillary studies exploring the chemical content of implicated HDS products have been initiated. The collected DNA, lymphocytes, serum, plasma, and liver tissue have also been used to conduct informative mechanistic studies. The primary aim of the current application is to continue to recruit and enroll suspected DILI patients as early as possible after liver injury onset for collection of biological samples tobe used in genetic, immunological, transcriptomic, and proteomic studies. It is hypothesized that these studies will lead to improved biomarkers of DILI susceptibility, mechanisms, and outcomes. We also propose novel studies of liver elastography to longitudinally assess disease severity and a pilot clinical trial for patients with severe acute DILI. Recruiting and enrolling cases within 2 weeks of DILI onset at the University of Michigan will be accomplished via use of natural language processing algorithms to search inpatient and outpatient electronic medical records as well as the referral of patients from the 140 physician member Michigan Hepatotoxicity Research Network. A second aim of this application is to continue to explore the role of host genetic variation in DILI susceptibility and outcomes using next generation sequencing techniques in high causality score cases. Exome arrays, whole genome, and whole exome sequencing are proposed to identify rare genetic polymorphisms associated with DILI susceptibility followed by expression system and pathway analysis studies. The third aim of this application is to further develop an accurate and reliable computerized causality assessment instrument that will have improved sensitivity and specificity compared to expert opinion and other currently used methods. The coefficients for specific variables of this instrument will be developed from the DILIN database and tested and validated using future DILIN cases and other acute cases of non-DILI hepatitis. The fourth aim of this application is to further develop the LiverTox website as a comprehensive and authoritative resource on DILI. A LiverTox Executive Committee is proposed to oversee and coordinate the development of a computerized causality assessment instrument as well as the development and maintenance of chapters on liver injury due to prescription drugs and HDS products. Finally, a LiverTox website portal is proposed to allow for the submission of bona-fide DILI cases for causality assessment and potential enrollment into future DILIN studies.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The Michigan Hepatotoxicity Research Network proposes to improve our understanding of the causes, mechanisms, and outcomes of drug induced liver injury via the continued enrollment of adult and pediatric patients into the ongoing DILIN Prospective and Retrospective studies. The collection of early blood and urine samples from well-characterized DILI patients will allow for innovative studies of patient, drug and environmental risk factors. Further development of a computerized diagnostic instrument and expansion of the LiverTox website is also planned which will provide doctors, researchers, and the general public an authoritative and up-to-date resource that can help accelerate DILI research in the US and abroad.            ",Michigan Hepatotoxicity Clinical Research Network Renewal 2013,8627692,U01DK065184,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Anabolic steroids', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Ancillary Study', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Budesonide', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Chemicals', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Enrollment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Etiology', 'Exclusion', 'Expert Opinion', 'Floxacillin', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'General Population', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Hepatitis', 'Hepatotoxicity', 'Histopathology', 'Immunologics', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Injury to Liver', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Liver', 'Lymphocyte', 'Maintenance', 'Manuscripts', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Molecular', 'Monograph', 'Natural History', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Plasma', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Prospective Studies', 'Proteomics', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Recovery', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severity of illness', 'Site', 'Specimen', 'Speed', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Valproic Acid', 'Variant', 'Writing', 'chemical property', 'cohort', 'computerized', 'design', 'dietary supplements', 'elastography', 'exome', 'exome sequencing', 'follow-up', 'genetic variant', 'genome analysis', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'isoniazid', 'liver injury', 'meetings', 'member', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'repository', 'screening', 'transcriptomics', 'web site']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U01,2013,321402,-0.003292544246654424
"Noninvasive Assessment of Neuromuscular Disease using Electrical Impedance     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The neuromuscular disorders include a wide group of conditions ranging from relatively mild focal problems, such as carpal tunnel syndrome, to severe, generalized diseases, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Current methods for evaluating these disorders remain limited to a variety of tests and procedures that are either invasive or remarkably qualitative in nature. One newer technique, electrical impedance myography (EIM), offers the prospect of obtaining quantitative data on muscle condition painlessly and non-invasively. However, no commercial devices specifically tailored for EIM use exist, with nearly all previous EIM work relying upon off-the-shelf bioimpedance devices designed for ""whole-body"" rather than single-muscle assessment. In Phase 1 of this SBIR, Convergence Medical Devices, Inc (CMD) developed an initial prototype system to test proof-of-principle innovative concepts in circuit design and data acquisition to provide highly sensitive and accurate data at an extended frequency range (out to 10 MHz) and over multiple angles relative to the major muscle fiber direction. This work was followed by supplemental work that produced the first hand-held device with robust electronics capable of similar measurements with a detachable, interchangeable electrode array. In this 3-year Phase 2 SBIR, CMD proposes to further refine that technology so as to assist in disease diagnosis and for following disease progression, with a specific focus on amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. In Aim 1 of the proposed grant, testing of multiple electrode array designs will be performed on a group of normal subjects and those with ALS to determine which electrode array designs offer the greatest reproducibility and ability to discriminate healthy from diseased individuals. In Aim 2, the device and the 3 ""best"" array designs identified in Aim 1 will be tested in 30 ALS patients, 30 patients with syndromes mimicking ALS (e.g., polyradiculopathy and motor-predominant neuropathy), and 30 subjects with suspected/possible ALS to determine the single best array design for diagnosis and to determine its sensitivity and specificity. This study will take place at CMD and four external sites and will be managed by the Northeast ALS trials Consortium (NEALS), the premier organization for overseeing clinical trials in ALS. In Aim 3, the 30 suspected/possible ALS patients recruited in SA2 and 30 additional suspected/possible ALS patients will be assessed monthly using EIM and the 3 arrays identified in SA1. All subjects will also undergo standard measurements of disease progression including handheld dynamometry, ALS Functional Rating Scale, and spirometry. The best array design for assessing disease progression will be identified and compared to conventional markers of disease progression to determine EIM's sensitivity to disease status. Thus, at the conclusion of this research program, we anticipate having developed and vigorously tested an EIM device and associated electrode designs that together will serve as a powerful new diagnostic and monitoring tool for neuromuscular disease.          The neuromuscular disorders are a group of conditions that impact the lives of millions of people in the United States alone. In this study, Convergence Medical Devices, in collaboration with neurologists at several medical centers, will develop and test a new device based on the concept of electrical impedance myography, a technique that offers the promise of rapid and accurate disease assessment. With the completion of this study, a new, painless tool will be developed and studied that will assist in individual patient care and will speed drug testing in clinical trials in diseases ranging from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and muscular dystrophy to radiculopathy and polyneuropathy.

"Optical Tomographic Imaging of Peripheral Arterial Disease     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to build and test a dynamic vascular optical tomographic imaging (DVOTI) system that can be used to detect and monitor peripheral arterial disease (PAD). PAD is estimated to affect approximately 8 to 12 million individuals in the United States. However, the disease is considerably under-diagnosed, since most patients are asymptomatic and no single reliable screening modality has been established. Most of the undiagnosed and untreated patients are diabetics. They commonly suffer from peripheral neuropathy and hence do not sense and report symptoms (such as pain) that are early signs of the disease. Consequently more than 60% (~65,000 per year) of all lower extremity amputations in the United States are performed in diabetic patients with PAD. With the number of diabetic patients expected to triple and reach almost 100 million by 2050, the problems related to undiagnosed PAD will only rise in the years to come  The most widely used diagnostic test for PAD, determination of the ankle-brachial index (ABI) in conjunction with pulse-volume recordings (PVR), is known to be unreliable for diabetics. And even in non- diabetics, ABI with PVR and all other existing diagnostic tests (such as Duplex Ultrasound or Magnetic resonance angiography), only provides accurate information about proximal occlusions in major arteries of the leg. However, none of these tests assess the distal perfusion of the foot where most complications, such as ulcers and gangrene, typically occur. Monitoring the success of surgical interventions, such as angioplasty or bypass surgery, suffers from the same shortcomings, as physicians are limited to the same suite of tests that are inadequate to assess the perfusion of the foot.  Dynamic VOTI promises to overcome the limitations of current diagnostic and monitoring techniques and has the potential to initiate a paradigm shift concerning how vascular diseases are assessed. In preliminary studies we have shown that DVOTI can provide three-dimensional time-series images that provide valuable information about the perfusion of the vascular bed in feet of PAD patients. The near-infrared light used in the instrument has no adverse health effects and measurements can be repeated frequently to monitor post interventional progress. Therefore, we believe that DVOTI will prove to be a safe and accurate method to diagnose and monitor PAD in non-diabetic and diabetic patients.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to build and test a novel optical imaging system that will allow for the diagnosis and monitoring of peripheral artery disease (PAD), which affects approximately 8 to 12 million individuals in the United States. The disease is considerably under-diagnosed, especially in diabetic patients, the elderly, and patients with kidney disease. The system will address an unmet need to directly assess the degree of blood perfusion in the feet, where most PAD-related complications occur, which lead to over 65,000 amputations each year.            ",Optical Tomographic Imaging of Peripheral Arterial Disease,8580503,R01HL115336,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Air', 'Algorithms', 'Amputation', 'Angioplasty', 'Ankle', 'Arteries', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Vessels', 'Bypass', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Classification', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diffusion', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Distal', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Ensure', 'Gangrene', 'Head', 'Health', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Lead', 'Leg', 'Light', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Angiography', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Peripheral Nervous System Diseases', 'Peripheral arterial disease', 'Physicians', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Preventive', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stroke', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment outcome', 'Ulcer', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Vascular Diseases', 'blood perfusion', 'data acquisition', 'design', 'diabetic', 'diabetic patient', 'evaluation/testing', 'experience', 'foot', 'healthy volunteer', 'image reconstruction', 'indexing', 'instrument', 'light emission', 'non-diabetic', 'novel', 'older patient', 'optical imaging', 'post intervention', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'success', 'theories', 'tissue phantom', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'vascular bed']",NHLBI,COLUMBIA UNIV NEW YORK MORNINGSIDE,R01,2013,469362,0.005962835461614206
"Mitigating risk in a closed loop system by exercise detection and miniaturization No abstract available PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In the US, approximately 1 million people have been diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. Diabetes is the leading cause of blindness, kidney failure, and non-traumatic amputation. Improving blood glucose control with a miniaturized closed loop (automated) system for use within real world situations including those in which patients move about freely and exercise, as proposed here, will decrease the risk of hypoglycemia and the risk of complications that can be debilitating, such as eye disease, and life-threatening, such as heart attacks.

"Informatics for Integrating Biology & the Bedside (i2b2) DESCRIPTION (PROVIDED BY APPLICANT): The large and growing size of the healthcare system makes it imperative to understand what is happening to us, the recipients of healthcare, to be able to efficiently conduct research to improve healthcare delivery and to improve the state of biomedicine by advancing its science. i2b2, ""Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside"" seeks to provide this instrumentation using the informational by products of healthcare and the biological materials accumulated through the delivery of healthcare. This complements existing efforts to create prospective cohort studies or trials outside the delivery of routine healthcare. In the first round of i2b2, we demonstrated that we could identify known adverse events and phenotypically select and then genotype patients for genetic association at approximately 1/10* of the price and less than l/10 of the time usually entailed to develop such populations for study. The challenge we have set ourselves for the next methodological challenge in i2b2 is the development of Virtual Cohort Studies (VCS) encompassing the population of a healthcare system as study subjects and asking questions of comparative effectiveness, unforeseen adverse events and identification of clinically relevant subpopulations including both clinical and genome-scale measures. We will be comparing the results of the VCS to those of carefully planned and executed cohort studies such as the Framingham Heart Study. VCS will require multiple methodological advances and tools development including in the disciplines of natural language processing, temporal reasoning, predictive modeling, biostatistics and machine learning. VCS methods will be tested by two driving biology projects, the first studying a collection of autoimmune diseases and the second type 2 diabetes. In both projects, VCS methods will be applied to investigate the components of cardiovascular risk from the genetic to the epigenetic and including the full range of clinical history including medications exposure. A systems/integrative approach will be taken to identify commonalities in these risk profiles across these disparate disease domains. VCS methods will be shared with i2b2 user community under open source governance while i2b2 user community contributions are folded into the i2b2 toolkit. Public Health Relevance: The i2b2 model of using existing clinical data for high throughput, cost effective, and timely research promises to rapidly leverage our nation's ability to better understand the existing disease burden and how best to achieve cost-effective clinical effectiveness, including new drug targets, new uses of existing drugs and improved management of existing disease.",Informatics for Integrating Biology & the Bedside (i2b2),8514121,U54LM008748,"['Adverse event', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biocompatible Materials', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical effectiveness', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Framingham Heart Study', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genotype', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Informatics', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Population Study', 'Price', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Science', 'Study Subject', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'burden of illness', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'clinically relevant', 'comparative effectiveness', 'cost effective', 'genetic association', 'health care delivery', 'improved', 'instrumentation', 'open source', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'tool development', 'virtual']",NLM,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,U54,2012,50000,-0.014919944620494164
"Machine Learning Tools for Prognostication in Melanoma    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of the study is to develop and validate a tool for reliable individualized prognostication of Stage III melanoma patients for use in the clinical setting.  Cutaneous melanoma is the sixth most common cancer in the United States, and its incidence rate is increasing faster than any other cancer. Nearly 69,000 new cases are expected be diagnosed in this country in 2010. While thin melanomas are typically cured with excision alone, thicker melanomas have a greater tendency to metastasize to the regional lymph nodes.  A diagnosis of Stage III melanoma is made if there is spread to the regional lymph nodes. Unfortunately, there is marked diversity in the natural history of Stage III melanoma, and outcomes within this group are extremely heterogeneous, with 5- year survival rates ranging from 23% to 87%. Similarly, treatment options range from intensive forms of systemic therapy to observation. Understanding patients' differences in clinical outcome is critical not only for calibrating therapeutic intensity to metastatic risk but also in the design and analysis of clinical trials.  There is a real void of reliable prognostic tools for Stage III melanoma. Based on novel machine learning approaches, the purpose of this study will be to develop and validate a reliable and individualized tool for prognostication of Stage III melanoma patients that can be used in the clinical setting.

"Computer-aided detection of non-calcified plaques in coronary CT angiograms   Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in both men and women in the United States. Over 16 million Americans have coronary heart disease (CHD), causing about 0.5 million deaths each year. The most common CHD is coronary artery disease which is mainly caused by atherosclerosis. Clinical evidence in recent years shows that noncalcified plaques (NCPs) are more vulnerable to rupture than calcified plaques. Plaque rupture and the thrombosis that follows is the main cause of acute myocardial infarction. Multidetector coronary CT angiography (cCTA) has the potential to help clinicians in early detection and in quantification of NCPs. cCTA may thus be useful for CHD detection, risk stratification, monitoring, and evaluation of the effectiveness of risk reduction treatment. However, many of these potential applications have not been utilized clinically.  The goal of this project is to develop a computer-aided detection (CADe) system to serve as a second reader for assisting clinicians in detection and quantification of NCPs in cCTA exams. Our specific aims are to (1) develop machine learning methods for detection of NCPs causing stenosis and/or positive remodeling along coronary arteries, and (2) evaluate the effect of CADe on radiologists' detection of NCPs on cCTA by observer ROC study. To achieve these aims, we will collect a database of cCTA cases for training and testing the CADe system, define the search space by designing 3D multiscale coronary artery response enhancement, segmentation, and dynamic balloon vessel tracking methods, develop a unique vessel- stitching method to automatically identify the best-quality phase for each individual artery segment from all available phases in prospectively or retrospectively gated cCTA exams, develop innovative vessel-sector- profile analysis and vessel lumen analysis to detect NCPs that cause stenosis or positive remodeling, estimate the total NCP volume, and explore calibration method to quantify plaque density by phantom studies. To demonstrate the usefulness of CADe, a preclinical reader study will be conducted to compare radiologists' detection accuracy of NCPs with and without CADe.  The major innovations of this project include (1) being the first CADe system to automatically detect non-calcified plaques including those cause positive remodeling or stenosis in cCTA, (2) development of new machine learning techniques including the vessel-stitching method, vessel-sector-profile analysis, multiscale enhancement response, and dynamic balloon tracking specifically suited for coronary arterial trees, and (3) conducting the first ROC study to evaluate the effect of CADe on radiologists' detection of NCPs.  Narrative:  Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in both men and women in the United States. If the proposed CADe system is successfully developed, it will (1) provide an accurate, efficient, and consistent tool to assist clinicians in detecting and quantifying non-calcified plaques (NCP) including those causing positive remodeling and/or stenosis for an individual patient, (2) help clinicians estimate the total NCP burden and study its significance, in analogy to that of the total calcium score, which may lead to improved clinical management of the vulnerable plaques, and (3) accelerate studies to develop new treatment options of coronary heart disease by providing a monitoring tool of treatment response. The proposed CADe system can thus serve as a foundation for these broader future applications and improve the efficacy of cCTA. Improved detection and management of NCPs may reduce the risk of myocardial infarctions and will have strong and long-lasting impact on health care.",Computer-aided detection of non-calcified plaques in coronary CT angiograms,8206668,R01HL106545,"['Acute myocardial infarction', 'American', 'Angiography', 'Arterial Fatty Streak', 'Arteries', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Calcified', 'Calcium', 'Calibration', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Catheters', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary artery', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Procedures', 'Radiation', 'Reader', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Recording of previous events', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Reduction', 'Rupture', 'Scanning', 'Stenosis', 'Stratification', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thrombosis', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trees', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Visual', 'Woman', 'computer aided detection', 'density', 'design', 'detector', 'improved', 'innovation', 'men', 'pre-clinical', 'prospective', 'radiologist', 'response', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'virtual']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2012,585438,-0.03849519062909304
"Exploring the Feasibility of Computational Markers to Predict Atrial Fibrillation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Postoperative atrial fibrillation (PAF) affects a large fraction of patients undergoing cardiac surgery. It is associated with increased postoperative mortality and morbidity, and also results in longer and more expensive hospital stays. While treatments such as prophylactic administration of beta-adrenergic blockers and amiodarone can reduce the incidence of PAF, existing tools to match patients to treatments that are appropriate for their risk need to be improved. Many high-risk patients may benefit from more aggressive treatment than they receive presently. Conversely, many low-risk patients are currently treated in excess of their actual risk of developing PAF. The aim of our research is to develop novel computational markers that can be used to risk stratify patients undergoing cardiac surgery for PAF. Our research uses sophisticated signal processing and machine learning techniques to discover information in the electrocardiogram (ECG) signal related to autonomic and impulse conduction abnormalities. We describe how this information can be combined with existing metrics to identify high risk patients. In addition, we propose the creation of a large public dataset of ECG signals with detailed patient meta-data and outcomes for research by the broader scientific community on predicting PAF. The specific aims of this proposal are: (1) To develop a public database with ECG signals and detailed patient metadata for research on predictive PAF. We will collect ECG data from over 900 patients undergoing cardiac surgery at the University of Michigan Medical Center during the first 12 months of this project with an expected PAF incidence of around 30%. We will share this data and other clinical information (i.e., demographics, comorbidities, laboratory reports, information related to the procedure, and the outcome of PAF) in a de- identified manner with the broader research community through PhysioNet; and (2) To develop and validate novel ECG-based risk markers for PAF. We will explore metrics based on the sympathovagal modulation of the heart, e.g., heart rate turbulence (HRT) and deceleration capacity (DC), which have shown recent promise in predicting ventricular arrhythmias. We will also develop new metrics based on the shape of the ECG to assess atrial myocardial instability. These approaches will be validated on the data collected in Aim 1, and will be used to develop models based on non-parametric machine learning techniques to accurately assess PAF risk.           Postoperative atrial fibrillation commonly occurs in patients undergoing cardiac surgery (e.g., coronary artery bypass graft or valve repair). It is associated with an increased risk of both mortality and morbidity, and increases the cost of hospitalization significantly. Successful management of patients undergoing cardiac surgery therefore relies on the ability of clinicians to estimate the risk of postoperative atrial fibrillation, and ideally, to anticipate and prevent this event. We propose to develop low-cost, and widely applicable methods that would improve the ability of physicians to identify patients at high risk of postoperative atrial fibrillation. They key concept for this proposal is that ECG signals contain valuable information that can help predict high or low risk cases using sophisticated techniques from signal processing and machine learning. This information can be used to develop clinical tools to improve management of patients undergoing cardiac surgery.

"Automated image-based biomarker computation tools for diabetic retinopathy    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In this STTR project, we present EyeMark, a set of tools for automated computation of biomarkers for diabetic retinopathy using retinal image photographs. Specifically, we will develop tools for computation of microaneurysm (MA) appearance and disappearance rates (jointly known as turnover rates) for use as a biomarker in monitoring progression of diabetic retinopathy (DR). The availability of a reliable image-based biomarker will have high positive influence on various aspects of DR care, including screening, monitoring progression, drug discovery and clinical research. There is ample published evidence that MA turnover rates are a good predictor of likelihood of progression to more severe retinopathy, establishing MA turnover as an excellent biomarker for diabetic retinopathy. Measuring this quantity involves two steps: careful alignment of current and baseline images, and marking of individual MAs. This process is very time consuming and prone to error, if done by entirely by human graders. The primary goal of this project is to overcome the above limitations by automating both the steps involved in MA turnover measurement: accurate image registration, and MA detection. We will develop end-too-end desktop software for automated computation of MA turnover and also provide intuitive visualization tools for clinicians to more effectively monitor diabetic retinopathy progression.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed tool will greatly enhance the clinical care available to diabetic retinopathy patients by providing an automated tool for computation of a biomarker in a non-invasive manner. This will enable identification of patients who are more likely to progress to severe retinopathy, thus helping prevent vision loss in such patients by timely intervention. Early identification is especially important in face of long backlog of diabetic patients waiting for an eye examination, and the fact that 90% of vision loss can be saved by early identification. The availability of an effective biomarker will also positively influence the drug discovery process by facilitating early and reliable determination of biological efficacy of potential new therapies.              The proposed tool will greatly enhance the clinical care available to diabetic retinopathy patients by providing an automated tool for computation of a biomarker in a non-invasive manner.

"Automated Web-Based Behavioral Diagnostics of Cognitive Impairment    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alzheimer's disease affects an estimated 5.3 million Americans currently, and this number is expected to grow significantly in the coming decade. A critical goal of Alzheimer's disease research is to improve current methods of diagnosis so that patients can be identified sooner and, therefore, obtain greater advantage from available therapies. The major goal of this project is to develop and validate an automated, web-based method for early diagnosis of cognitive decline and memory loss. We will build on current research that has demonstrated a clear link between performance on the Visual Paired- Comparison Task (VPC) and diagnosis of MCI, and we will extend the impact of this finding by developing a suite of software tools and analysis methods that will improve the accuracy and extend the accessibility of cognitive diagnostics with a web-based VPC task that can be widely deployed. Although the VPC task is promising as a diagnostic aid, clinical application is severely limited by the need to use an eye tracker to precisely monitor subjects' eye movements. Unfortunately, eye trackers are expensive, require trained personnel, and are not widely available. However, our preliminary findings show that it is possible to produce picture examination behavior that is similar to eye-movements, using modified versions of the VPC task that could be administered by anyone, on any computer with an internet connection. In addition, powerful machine learning techniques from computer science can help accurately analyze and diagnose the resulting behavior. An important contribution from this work will be the possibility of predicting oncoming cognitive decline in MCI patients sooner than is now possible, that is, at a time when the nervous system is less compromised and more likely to benefit from therapeutic intervention. In support of this objective, we propose three aims: 1) Develop and investigate appropriate representation of eye movement characteristics and corresponding machine learning-based classification techniques for effective identification of the patient status, 2) Develop and validate a web-based version of the VPC task, and 3) explore the feasibility of our task as an automatic screening instrument for the general elderly population. Successful completion of these aims has the potential to dramatically alter the current practice of clinical translational research as well as the current methods used for diagnosing cognitive deficits. This would enable thousands and potentially millions of patients and potential research subjects to take the test as part of their routine checkup, requiring nothing more than a computer with an internet connection.

"Computational Approach to Personalized Anemia Management     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Effective anemia management in End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) is a complex task due to large variation in erythropoietic response among the ESRD patients. Evidence shows that excessive doses of Erythropoiesis Stimulating Agents (ESA), used in hypo-responsive patients, coincide with increased cardiovascular complications. In addition to health risks, reimbursement restrictions imposed by Medicare demand additional vigilance in ESA administration. Iron is one of the most important elements affecting the erythropoietic response. The ongoing blood losses associated with hemodialysis treatments, increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, and access complications, as well as poor iron absorption lead to iron depletion in ESRD patients. Standard anemia management protocols do not fully address the synergistic nature of interactions between erythropoietin and iron. Personalized strategies for coordinated ESA and iron dosing are therefore necessary to achieve the desired clinical outcome, reduce patient risk exposure, and improve the cost-effectiveness of treatment. Our long-term goal is the advancement of biomedical computing to personalize medicine and pharmacologic management of chronic conditions. The objective of this project is to address the challenge of multiple drug dosing personalization with a specific application to ESA and iron management in anemia of ESRD. The central hypothesis is that a computational approach can be developed to perform coordinated personalized dosing of erythropoiesis stimulating agents and iron in order to achieve desired clinical outcomes and minimize patient exposure resulting in optimal care. The rationale behind the proposed research is that computational models quantifying the interaction between iron and erythropoietin can be applied through the principles of control theory and machine learning, to derive personalized dosing strategies for both agents. The main objective will be accomplished through three specific aims: 1) quantification of the erythropoietin-iron interaction through clinically relevant computational models, 2) application of such models to derive algorithms for coordinated personalized ESA and iron dosing, 3) validation of these algorithms through an ""in sillico"" trial for a wide range o simulated subjects and clinical conditions. The expected outcome of this project is a new systematic approach to the management of ESRD anemia using multiple agents resulting in improved patient care and decreased cost which will be broadly applicable to other therapeutic areas.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to public health because personalized dosing of multiple therapeutic agents broadly applicable to many chronic conditions is ultimately expected to improve cost-effectiveness of treatment and minimize patient risk. The proposed research is relevant to the NIH mission because it contributes toward advancement of personalized medicine, one of the top priorities of the NIH.                    The proposed research is relevant to public health because personalized dosing of multiple therapeutic agents broadly applicable to many chronic conditions is ultimately expected to improve cost-effectiveness of treatment and minimize patient risk.

"Hand Sensorimotor Function and Carpal Tunnel Syndrome    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The median nerve is susceptible to compression in the wrist, leading to carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). CTS is the most common compression neuropathy and have an immense impact on national health care, worker productivity, and quality of life. Despite its high prevalence and public health cost, our understanding of CTS is limited, and the management of CTS awaits improvement. The central notion of this project is that hand sensorimotor function is sensitive to peripheral median neuropathy and that the central nervous system is affected by CTS, causing the associated sensorimotor deficit. We will investigate this notion with quantifiable sensorimotor data from novel biomechanical and neurophysiological studies. This project has three aims consisting of biomechanical, neurophysiological and translational research. The first aim is to investigate CTS-induced pathokinematic and pathokinetic performance using dexterous manual tasks of thumb opposition, reach-to-pinch, precision grip, and finger pressing. The second aim is to investigate the neurophysiological implications of chronic peripheral neuropathy (i.e., CTS) on the central nervous system by evaluating corticomuscular coupling and stretch reflex. The third aim is to identify novel biomechanical and neurophysiological markers for CTS cases using machine learning and classification algorithms. The results of this project will elucidate the pathological mechanisms and behavioral manifestations of CTS and aid in the development of new strategies for diagnosis, evaluation, rehabilitation, and treatment of this disorder. More generally, CTS as a chronic neuropathy serves as an effective model to study sensorimotor mechanisms of the peripheral and central nervous systems. In addition, the methodology developed in this project is applicable to other neuromuscular disorders.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:   Carpal tunnel syndrome is highly prevalent and costly. One of the distinct consequences of carpal tunnel syndrome is that patients experience inexplicable dropping of objects and clumsiness while performing simple daily tasks. In this project, we propose to study the sensorimotor deficit using novel biomechanical and neurophysiological experiments. The results of this project will elucidate the pathological mechanisms and manifestations of carpal tunnel syndrome.

"A novel use of web-based software to efficiently triage pre-surgical patients bas    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This is a Fast-Track application to develop a web-based, patient-centered software product that accurately assesses a patient's perioperative risk as a means of improving quality of care and reducing costs.       Approximately 40 million surgical procedures are performed annually in the United States [1]. To ensure the safety of patients undergoing these procedures, it is imperative to identify and mitigate perioperative risk. Unfortunately, the process used by most hospitals and surgical centers to evaluate pre-surgical patients falls short on two fronts. One is a failure to identify risk factors in a timely fashion, as most preoperative evaluations occur the day before or day of surgery. The second is a failure to properly identify risk factors due to incomplete or inaccurate preoperative evaluations. These shortcomings increase morbidity and mortality, increase healthcare cost, and lower patient satisfaction. Therefore, a standardized preoperative assessment delivered in a timely fashion is needed.       To address this need, we (MedSleuth, Inc.) have developed web-based software that utilizes a patent- pending algorithm to generate a customized patient survey, based on the patient's medication profile and successive responses to the survey. The survey output takes the form of a comprehensive medical history, triages patients based on health status, and provides the patient-specific information required by healthcare providers to identify and mitigate perioperative risk. Conservatively, it is estimated $10 billion could be saved annually (~25% of total spend) through our approach, with similarly sizable improvements in quality and satisfaction.       Our Phase I study will evaluate proof of concept for the first-generation software with one collaborating hospital system (Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School) over the course of a six- month period. Phase I will seek to prove (1) patients can successfully complete the web-based survey; (2) the output generated by the survey is accurate, comprehensive and relevant for making informed clinical decisions; (3) our assessment algorithm is equivalent or superior to the status quo in identifying perioperative risk; (4) patients and healthcare providers report high levels of satisfaction; and (5) preoperative evaluation costs can be substantially reduced.       In Phase II we will incorporate patient and healthcare provider feedback from Phase I to develop the more robust second-generation version of the web-based software. We will in turn test this second- generation software on a much larger patient population across multiple surgical sites to verify clinical accuracy and completeness, cost savings, and increased satisfaction. At the conclusion of Phase II, we expect to have a market ready product with documented outcomes.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A need exists for a system that can efficiently and effectively triage patients based on perioperative risk, thereby focusing resources on those patients with complex medical problems while improving quality and satisfaction for all. We (MedSleuth, Inc.) have developed a first-generation web-based patient- centric software product that standardizes and streamlines the way a patient's medical history is elicited and recorded. This is accomplished by applying patent-pending machine learning technology to tailor a real-time survey based on each patient's medication profile and successive responses during the survey. We hypothesize that (1) patients can successfully complete the web-based survey on their own; (2) clinicians find the output of the survey relevant, accurate, and superior to current methods for making informed clinical decisions related to the surgical procedure; (3) patients and healthcare providers report high levels of satisfaction with the survey; (4) quality of care is improved; and (5) costs are reduced.

"Ancillary Comparative Effectiveness of Atrial Fibrillation Ablation Surgery    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This proposal describes an ancillary study to a recently initiated comparative effectiveness trial ""Surgical Ablation versus No Surgical Ablation for Patients with Persistent or Longstanding Persistent Atrial Fibrillation Undergoing Mitral Valve Surgery"" (NCT00903370), which is part of the NHLBI-sponsored Cardiothoracic Surgery Network (CTSN). Its aims are to perform a time-sensitive substudy of continuous heart rhythm monitoring and to develop and apply novel statistical tools to assess ablation effectiveness in groups of patients. As such, it will provide critical new knowledge to support a secondary objective of the parent trial: to inform rhythm monitoring and analysis strategies for future trials of rhythm control in atrial fibrillation (AF).  Great enthusiasm for innovative tissue-destroying (ablation) procedures to treat AF has led to technology outstripping science. Mechanisms of AF (which afflicts >3 million Americans) remain poorly understood, methods to assess its cure are primitive, and guidelines for analyzing rhythm outcomes are flawed due to lack of appropriate statistical methodology. Why? After ablation procedures, AF may recur in episodes of varying duration. Yet current monitoring consists of ""snapshots"" of semiannual rhythm recording (Holter), or more frequent-but short-transtelephonic monitoring (TTM). Ideally, an implantable monitoring device could detect all these episodes over a patient's lifetime; however, even if this were possible, statistical methods to analyze this series of occurrences in groups of patients for comparative effectiveness of AF therapies or to identify risk factors are poorly developed. Right now a window of opportunity exists to make important strides in more thorough AF assessment and proper data analysis because the CTSN has just launched a randomized trial of surgical AF therapies that includes weekly TTM of atrial rhythm as well as traditional 6- and 12-month Holter assessment. We propose a time-sensitive substudy of implanting an FDA-approved miniature loop recorder to capture AF episodes continuously. These data will be used in the development of a suite of new analytic methods for aggregating data such as these across time and across patients to characterize time course and identify modulating factors. They will then be used to assess the trial's rhythm endpoints and suggest designs for more informative future trials with substantially reduced sample size. We have assembled a team of clinicians and statisticians, including individuals who designed the parent trial, who are experienced in implanting the monitoring device, and who are experts in analytic methods research, to develop and apply novel methods to these several types of rhythm data. We will leverage developments from an intramural NHLBI machine learning program at Cleveland Clinic and State of Ohio-funded Atrial Fibrillation Innovation Center. The analytic methods have wide applicability to the important field of longitudinal data analysis.    A chaotic heart rhythm called atrial fibrillation (AF), which affects more than 3 million Americans, especially the elderly, causes strokes, and commonly accompanies heart valve disease. AF treatments outstrip scientific understanding of the rhythm and how to assess treatment success across time in clinical trials. Thus, the Institute of Medicine has placed trials of AF treatment in the first tier of 100 comparative effectiveness priorities for the nation. An NIH-sponsored trial of surgical treatment of AF is has just been launched, and we propose a substudy of an implanted rhythm monitoring device (Medtronic REVEAL XT) and new methods of AF analysis for groups of patients that will help assess the trial's endpoints and inform future trials. Thus, this ancillary study application proposes to (1) collect, in a subset of patients, more refined rhythm data than proposed in the parent trial, (2) develop generalizable new methods of analysis, and (3) apply these methods to both the data collected through continuous monitoring as well as the follow-up data collected in the parent trial through Holter and trans-telephonic monitoring.

"Developing a Virtual Basic Laparoscopic Skill Trainer (VBLaST)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Development and Validation of a Virtual Basic Laparoscopic Skill Trainer (VBLaST) For the first time in the history of surgical education, a comprehensive program to teach and evaluate the cognitive and psychomotor aspects unique to laparoscopic surgery - the Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery (FLS) developed originally by the Society of American Gastrointestinal Endoscopic Surgery (SAGES) and subsequently by a joint committee which includes the American College of Surgeons (ACS) - is being embraced nationally for training and credentialing laparoscopic surgeons. As an example of its growing acceptance by the medical community, starting in 2009, the American Board of Surgeons has mandated that passing the FLS certifying examination will be required for taking the board examination in surgery. While the cognitive assessment in FLS is based on 75 multiple-choice questions, a proctored examination is used for the manual skills assessment which includes five tasks to be performed in a portable pelvic trainer box with built-in video camera: bimanual peg transfer, precise pattern cutting, use of ligating loops and suturing with intracorporeal and extracorporeal knot tying. In spite of the growing popularity of the FLS, there are several major problems with this box trainer paradigm: (1) the assessment is subjective, (2) there is no feedback during learning except when an experienced trainer is present, (3) a large number of qualified proctors must be engaged during test taking, (4) the training material must be constantly replaced, and (5) the test-takers must travel to one of the 27 Regional Test Centers or the Annual SAGES meeting or the ACS Clinical Congress. To overcome these problems and to enable greater dissemination, we propose to develop and validate a Virtual Basic Laparoscopic Skill Trainer (VBLaST) whereby tasks available in the FLS may be performed on PCs and laptops with inexpensive haptic (touch) interface devices, such as the Phantom(R) OmniTM. To develop the VBLaST a novel set of technologies must be developed including rapid, but highly realistic physics-based virtual interaction paradigms and statistical machine learning techniques to develop a ""virtual mentor"" which will provide real time automated feedback to the trainees. A comprehensive set of studies involving students, residents, fellows and practicing surgeons at Boston area hospitals (e.g., BIDMC, Tufts Medical Center, Cambridge Health Alliance, Harvard, MGH, Brigham & Women's, Lahey Clinic) will be undertaken to test the validity of the VBLaST as a training tool and establish its usefulness in transferring the acquired skills to the operating room. Once validated, the VBLaST will have exponential impact in reducing training costs and training time while improving patient safety and outcomes, A multidisciplinary team with collective expertise in physics-based interactive medical simulation, laparoscopic surgery and surgical education, and human factors engineering has been assembled to achieve the following Specific Aims: SA1) To develop a realistic virtual basic laparoscopic skill trainer (VBLaST) platform to perform all the tasks available in the FLS training tool box. SA2) To establish the validity of the VBLaST as a training tool. SA3) To evaluate the usefulness of the VBLaST as a training tool. SA4) To develop a web-based interface for the VBLaST.

"Informatics for Integrating Biology & the Bedside (i2b2) DESCRIPTION (PROVIDED BY APPLICANT): The large and growing size of the healthcare system makes it imperative to understand what is happening to us, the recipients of healthcare, to be able to efficiently conduct research to improve healthcare delivery and to improve the state of biomedicine by advancing its science. i2b2, ""Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside"" seeks to provide this instrumentation using the informational by products of healthcare and the biological materials accumulated through the delivery of healthcare. This complements existing efforts to create prospective cohort studies or trials outside the delivery of routine healthcare. In the first round of i2b2, we demonstrated that we could identify known adverse events and phenotypically select and then genotype patients for genetic association at approximately 1/10* of the price and less than l/10 of the time usually entailed to develop such populations for study. The challenge we have set ourselves for the next methodological challenge in i2b2 is the development of Virtual Cohort Studies (VCS) encompassing the population of a healthcare system as study subjects and asking questions of comparative effectiveness, unforeseen adverse events and identification of clinically relevant subpopulations including both clinical and genome-scale measures. We will be comparing the results of the VCS to those of carefully planned and executed cohort studies such as the Framingham Heart Study. VCS will require multiple methodological advances and tools development including in the disciplines of natural language processing, temporal reasoning, predictive modeling, biostatistics and machine learning. VCS methods will be tested by two driving biology projects, the first studying a collection of autoimmune diseases and the second type 2 diabetes. In both projects, VCS methods will be applied to investigate the components of cardiovascular risk from the genetic to the epigenetic and including the full range of clinical history including medications exposure. A systems/integrative approach will be taken to identify commonalities in these risk profiles across these disparate disease domains. VCS methods will be shared with i2b2 user community under open source governance while i2b2 user community contributions are folded into the i2b2 toolkit. Public Health Relevance: The i2b2 model of using existing clinical data for high throughput, cost effective, and timely research promises to rapidly leverage our nation's ability to better understand the existing disease burden and how best to achieve cost-effective clinical effectiveness, including new drug targets, new uses of existing drugs and improved management of existing disease.",Informatics for Integrating Biology & the Bedside (i2b2),8326732,U54LM008748,[' '],NLM,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,U54,2012,1282800,-0.014919944620494164
"ICP Elevation Alerting Based on a Predictive Model Hosting Platform    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recurring acute ICP elevations occur frequently and unpredictably among severe brain injury patients. ICP elevation can cause cerebral ischemia and lead to deadly brain herniation if untreated. Hence, prompt recognition and treatment of rising ICP are critical in managing severe brain injury patients. However, existing protocols in most neurocritical care units are reactive where bedside nurses, in response to simple threshold-crossing alarms, have to check numerical display of ICP on monitors to manually establish whether the alarm is a true one before initiating treatment. Acute ICP elevation is accompanied by distinctive ICP pulse morphological changes. By utilizing ICP pulse morphological metrics as input, we can accurately recognize precursors to ICP elevation to alert nurses and free them from a cognitively demanding process of establishing whether a consistent ICP elevation triggers the alarm. We therefore propose to deploy a previously developed accurate ICP elevation prediction model on an open-source model hosting platform to monitor continuous ICP signals and alert bedside nurses. Using this alerting system, we will further investigate the principal physiological abnormalities associated with acute ICP elevation showing different precursory ICP patterns prior to onset of elevation. We will pursue the following three aims: 1) To develop an alerting system for ICP elevation based on a model hosting platform; 2) To investigate whether the ICP alerting system helps nurses more efficiently manage ICP. 3) To detect consistent physiological abnormalities associated with acute ICP elevation.  Our long-term goal is to advance intensive care monitoring so that continuous signals from monitors are fully explored to integrate with the rest of clinical data in an electronic medical record (EMR) system to enhance clinical decision making. This project represents an effort piloting a platform-based approach towards overcoming translational barriers that impede the process of making advanced predictive analytics available at point of care. Therefore, broad impacts from this project are related to future efforts at leveraging this open model hosting platform to facilitate the translation of additional predictive models in other ICUs.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Recurring acute intracranial pressure (ICP) elevation occurs frequently, up to more than 20 in a 12-hour nursing shift, and unpredictably among severe brain injury patients. These acute ICP elevations needs prompt treatment before they impair blood flow to the brain and cause deadly brain herniation. The present work is built upon our previously developed algorithm of detecting acute ICP elevation and an open software platform for hosting predictive algorithms to further develop and evaluate a real-time ICP elevation alerting system that will provide accurate alerts of impending ICP elevation. Rigorous human factor engineering principles and techniques will be adopted in developing this system and we will further leverage this real-time alerting system to investigate the principal physiological abnormalities that are associated with accurate ICP elevation.              Recurring acute intracranial pressure (ICP) elevation occurs frequently, up to more than 20 in a 12-hour nursing shift, and unpredictably among severe brain injury patients.

"Early Detection of Keratoconus    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Keratoconus is the most common degenerative disease affecting the cornea. This condition tends to develop around puberty and to progress over the next few decades, but its clinical history can be quite variable. As keratoconus develops, the cornea thins and bulges. Eventually, a corneal transplant may be needed to maintain vision. In its earliest stages, the disease is particularly difficult to detect, even using state-of-the-art diagnostic techniques such as anterior/posterior surface topography. This is of great importance to the corneal refractive surgeon because surgical treatment of an occult keratoconic cornea will weaken it and greatly accelerate the occurrence of symptoms. Because of the difficulty in differentiating early keratoconus from atypical normal corneas, many normal eyes deemed 'suspicious' are denied treatment. At the same time, some keratoconic eyes are missed and operated upon, with disastrous consequences. Early detection of keratoconus may also benefit patients because of the recent development of methods for strengthening the corneal stroma and preventing disease progression. We have developed a technique based on the use of high resolution ultrasound for imaging the cornea and measuring the thickness of its component layers, including the epithelium (about 50 microns in thickness) and the stroma (about 500 microns in thickness). We have shown that the epithelium, which is the surface layer of the cornea, will remodel itself to smooth out underlying irregularities. In early keratoconus, as the anterior stromal surface begins to bulge forward, the epithelium will thin above the apex of the bulge and thicken around it, to maintain a smooth anterior surface. This compensatory mechanism prevents anterior surface topography from detecting keratoconus in its early stages. We have also developed methods for characterizing the elastic properties of the cornea by inducing and measuring surface displacements in response to a pulse of acoustic radiation force. We will further develop and test this technique and apply it clinically in conjunction with the Ocular Response Analyzer, an instrument that causes a similar effect by use of an air pressure pulse. This proposal will involve analysis of topographic and pachymetric patterns and elastic properties in normal, keratoconus and keratoconus-suspicious eyes. We will develop an index based on multivariate analysis of these patterns based on unambiguously classified cases, and validate the risk index on suspicious cases based on clinical documentation of disease progression. Our goal is to reduce the percentage of screened cases deemed keratoconus- suspicious by at least a factor of two by allowing an unambiguous diagnosis of early keratoconus. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Keratoconus (KC) is a corneal dystrophy will in many cases ultimately require corneal transplantation to maintain vision. Early detection, which is not possible with current technology, would allow early treatment and prevent sever damage to KC corneas inadvertently operated upon for correction of vision.

"Noninvasive Assessment of Neuromuscular Disease using Electrical Impedance     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The neuromuscular disorders include a wide group of conditions ranging from relatively mild focal problems, such as carpal tunnel syndrome, to severe, generalized diseases, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Current methods for evaluating these disorders remain limited to a variety of tests and procedures that are either invasive or remarkably qualitative in nature. One newer technique, electrical impedance myography (EIM), offers the prospect of obtaining quantitative data on muscle condition painlessly and non-invasively. However, no commercial devices specifically tailored for EIM use exist, with nearly all previous EIM work relying upon off-the-shelf bioimpedance devices designed for ""whole-body"" rather than single-muscle assessment. In Phase 1 of this SBIR, Convergence Medical Devices, Inc (CMD) developed an initial prototype system to test proof-of-principle innovative concepts in circuit design and data acquisition to provide highly sensitive and accurate data at an extended frequency range (out to 10 MHz) and over multiple angles relative to the major muscle fiber direction. This work was followed by supplemental work that produced the first hand-held device with robust electronics capable of similar measurements with a detachable, interchangeable electrode array. In this 3-year Phase 2 SBIR, CMD proposes to further refine that technology so as to assist in disease diagnosis and for following disease progression, with a specific focus on amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. In Aim 1 of the proposed grant, testing of multiple electrode array designs will be performed on a group of normal subjects and those with ALS to determine which electrode array designs offer the greatest reproducibility and ability to discriminate healthy from diseased individuals. In Aim 2, the device and the 3 ""best"" array designs identified in Aim 1 will be tested in 30 ALS patients, 30 patients with syndromes mimicking ALS (e.g., polyradiculopathy and motor-predominant neuropathy), and 30 subjects with suspected/possible ALS to determine the single best array design for diagnosis and to determine its sensitivity and specificity. This study will take place at CMD and four external sites and will be managed by the Northeast ALS trials Consortium (NEALS), the premier organization for overseeing clinical trials in ALS. In Aim 3, the 30 suspected/possible ALS patients recruited in SA2 and 30 additional suspected/possible ALS patients will be assessed monthly using EIM and the 3 arrays identified in SA1. All subjects will also undergo standard measurements of disease progression including handheld dynamometry, ALS Functional Rating Scale, and spirometry. The best array design for assessing disease progression will be identified and compared to conventional markers of disease progression to determine EIM's sensitivity to disease status. Thus, at the conclusion of this research program, we anticipate having developed and vigorously tested an EIM device and associated electrode designs that together will serve as a powerful new diagnostic and monitoring tool for neuromuscular disease.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The neuromuscular disorders are a group of conditions that impact the lives of millions of people in the United States alone. In this study, Convergence Medical Devices, in collaboration with neurologists at several medical centers, will develop and test a new device based on the concept of electrical impedance myography, a technique that offers the promise of rapid and accurate disease assessment. With the completion of this study, a new, painless tool will be developed and studied that will assist in individual patient care and will speed drug testing in clinical trials in diseases ranging from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and muscular dystrophy to radiculopathy and polyneuropathy.              The neuromuscular disorders are a group of conditions that impact the lives of millions of people in the United States alone.

"Assessing Indeterminate Thyroid Nodules With Electrical Impedance Measurements    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Thyroid nodules are present in a large fraction of healthy individuals. Between 4% and 7% of the United States adult population has palpable thyroid nodules, and up to 50% of American women older than age 50 have nodules that can be depicted on ultrasound. The vast majority (>95%) of thyroid nodules are benign. However, cancer risk increases with male gender, nodule size, extremes of age (< 30 and > 60 years), underlying autoimmune disease, nodule growth, personal or family history of thyroid cancer, and radiation exposure. Ultrasound imaging and Fine Needle Aspiration Biopsy (FNAB) remain the mainstays of thyroid nodule evaluation. Unfortunately, 25% of patients who ultimately undergo FNAB of a thyroid nodule have indeterminate cytology. Many of these patients will require at least partial thyroidectomy purely for the purpose of obtaining a definitive diagnosis. Given that only 30% of these will ultimately prove to be malignant on surgical pathology, the majority of these lobectomies could potentially be avoided if better non-invasive methods existed to evaluate indeterminate nodules. Electrical Impedance Scanning (EIS) has been previously investigated for non-invasive evaluation of thyroid nodules. The overall diagnostic accuracy of EIS was encouraging but not sufficient for routine clinical use. We have developed a modified approach termed here Resonance Electrical Impedance Spectroscopy (REIS) that should have substantially higher sensitivity and specificity for this very purpose. When using REIS technology to examine the breast, we obtained initial results that are significantly better in all respects than those obtained with traditional EIS. We believe that REIS technology will similarly improve the assessment of thyroid nodules. REIS hold promise as a reproducible modality for the risk stratification of the many patients with indeterminate thyroid nodules. It is a new non- invasive modality that may help reduce the number of diagnostic lobectomies and would be welcomed by patients with non-diagnostic FNA results. The purpose of this application is to design, assemble, and test in a preliminary clinical study a unique REIS based device for the assessment of thyroid nodules.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to design, assemble, and test in technical and preliminary human studies a non-invasive, easy to use device for measuring Resonance Electrical Impedance Spectroscopy (REIS) of FNA indeterminate thyroid nodules. We will assess the ability of this technology to accurately characterize these indeterminate nodules as benign or malignant prior to a ""diagnostic"" surgery.

"Phase 2 Clinical Trial of Coralmyn for Coral Snake Bite (BB-IND 13926,01/02/09)  Abstract Background: Each year, poison control centers report approximately 75 bites by coral snakes (Micrurus and Micruroides species) in the United States. More than half of these occur in Florida, with the rest concentrated in the southeastern states, westward as far as Texas. Before the introduction of anti-coral antivenom by Wyeth in 1967, approximately 10% of Micrurus bites were potentially fatal, due to ventilatory failure caused by neurotoxins active at the neuromuscular junction. Wyeth Ayerst has recently ceased production of this antivenom. In October of 2009, the last vials will expire, leaving the U.S. without a licensed supplier of antivenom. Objectives: Licensure of a new antivenom product, Coralmyn. Specific Aims: (1) Demonstrate the safety of Coralmyn in patients bitten by Micrurus coral snakes, by monitoring recipients for Type I and Type III immune reactions. (2) Demonstrate the value of plasma venom levels as a surrogate endpoint in coral snake bites by relating venom levels to severity of envenomation, before and after treatment. (3) Demonstrate that cost of treatment is different for patients presenting to hospitals with and without antivenom in stock, and use patient cost data to complete a pharmacoeconomic model comparing distribution methodologies applicable to Phase 3 or 4 study design. Research Design and Methods: This will be an open-label Phase 2 clinical trial of Coralmyn (anti-coral serum injectable solution, Instituto Bioclon, S.A. de C.V.) in male and female human patients of any age who present for emergency care following bites by coral snakes of genus Micrurus. Using grant funds, as many hospitals as economically feasible (at least 3 in Florida) will be provided with antivenom with which to enroll patients promptly in the study, using a central IRB. Patients presenting to other sites may enroll in the study either by interhospital transfer or by emergency delivery of antivenom to out-of-network hospitals. In all cases, clinical observations and plasma for venom levels will be collected at study enrollment and hourly until start of study drug. Following infusion of antivenom, clinical observations and plasma collection will be repeated at intervals until hospital discharge; and telephone follow-up will continue through day 22. Clinical and financial data will be extracted by examination of patient records including standardized data collection sheets completed prospectively by hospital staff and extracted into Case Report Forms secondarily by study staff at a central site. Plasma will be frozen and held for batch analysis every six months, using a Micrurus-specific ELISA assay. Statistical analysis of safety indicators will be conducted using Cox Proportional Hazard or survival models. Venom levels will be analyzed using a combination of logistic regression and ANOVA and compared with neurological assessments using a Generalized Linear Mixed Model. Cost data will be entered into a decision-tree model constructed in TreeAge HealthcarePro, and sensitivity analysis will be performed using MonteCarlo simulation.  Project Narrative: Bites by coral snakes can be fatal if the bitten person does not receive antivenom promptly, but the only U.S. manufacturer of coral snake antivenom has stopped making it. This study will test the safety of a new antivenom in patients bitten by coral snakes, it will show whether testing for venom in the bloodstream is a useful way to determine how bad of a bite a person has, and it will show whether it is cost-effective to stock investigational antivenom in just a small number of places if there is no licensed antivenom for hospitals to buy. Results of the study will help doctors, the manufacturer, and the FDA to move forward toward getting a new antivenom for use in the U.S.","Phase 2 Clinical Trial of Coralmyn for Coral Snake Bite (BB-IND 13926,01/02/09)",8081750,R01FD003706,[' '],FDA,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R01,2012,150000,0.023353712327099548
"Machine Learning Tools for Prognostication in Melanoma    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of the study is to develop and validate a tool for reliable individualized prognostication of Stage III melanoma patients for use in the clinical setting.  Cutaneous melanoma is the sixth most common cancer in the United States, and its incidence rate is increasing faster than any other cancer. Nearly 69,000 new cases are expected be diagnosed in this country in 2010. While thin melanomas are typically cured with excision alone, thicker melanomas have a greater tendency to metastasize to the regional lymph nodes.  A diagnosis of Stage III melanoma is made if there is spread to the regional lymph nodes. Unfortunately, there is marked diversity in the natural history of Stage III melanoma, and outcomes within this group are extremely heterogeneous, with 5- year survival rates ranging from 23% to 87%. Similarly, treatment options range from intensive forms of systemic therapy to observation. Understanding patients' differences in clinical outcome is critical not only for calibrating therapeutic intensity to metastatic risk but also in the design and analysis of clinical trials.  There is a real void of reliable prognostic tools for Stage III melanoma. Based on novel machine learning approaches, the purpose of this study will be to develop and validate a reliable and individualized tool for prognostication of Stage III melanoma patients that can be used in the clinical setting.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The purpose of the study is to develop and validate a tool for reliable individualized prognostication of Stage III melanoma patients for use in the clinical setting.           The purpose of the study is to develop and validate a tool for reliable individualized prognostication of Stage III melanoma patients for use in the clinical setting.         ",Machine Learning Tools for Prognostication in Melanoma,8114413,R21CA152775,"['Address', 'American Joint Committee on Cancer', 'Cancer Prognosis', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Country', 'Cutaneous Melanoma', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Disease', 'Disease Pathway', 'Dose', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Heterogeneity', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Interferons', 'Logic', 'Lymph Node Dissections', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Metastatic to', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Natural History', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Nodal', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Publications', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Subgroup', 'Survival Rate', 'Systemic Therapy', 'Therapeutic', 'Thick', 'Trees', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'advanced disease', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'clinical decision-making', 'design', 'editorial', 'flexibility', 'forest', 'hazard', 'lymph nodes', 'melanoma', 'minimally invasive', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'prognostic', 'tool']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R21,2011,193798,-0.0029577324972329512
"Computer-aided detection of non-calcified plaques in coronary CT angiograms    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in both men and women in the United States. Over 16 million Americans have coronary heart disease (CHD), causing about 0.5 million deaths each year. The most common CHD is coronary artery disease which is mainly caused by atherosclerosis. Clinical evidence in recent years shows that noncalcified plaques (NCPs) are more vulnerable to rupture than calcified plaques. Plaque rupture and the thrombosis that follows is the main cause of acute myocardial infarction. Multidetector coronary CT angiography (cCTA) has the potential to help clinicians in early detection and in quantification of NCPs. cCTA may thus be useful for CHD detection, risk stratification, monitoring, and evaluation of the effectiveness of risk reduction treatment. However, many of these potential applications have not been utilized clinically.  The goal of this project is to develop a computer-aided detection (CADe) system to serve as a second reader for assisting clinicians in detection and quantification of NCPs in cCTA exams. Our specific aims are to (1) develop machine learning methods for detection of NCPs causing stenosis and/or positive remodeling along coronary arteries, and (2) evaluate the effect of CADe on radiologists' detection of NCPs on cCTA by observer ROC study. To achieve these aims, we will collect a database of cCTA cases for training and testing the CADe system, define the search space by designing 3D multiscale coronary artery response enhancement, segmentation, and dynamic balloon vessel tracking methods, develop a unique vessel- stitching method to automatically identify the best-quality phase for each individual artery segment from all available phases in prospectively or retrospectively gated cCTA exams, develop innovative vessel-sector- profile analysis and vessel lumen analysis to detect NCPs that cause stenosis or positive remodeling, estimate the total NCP volume, and explore calibration method to quantify plaque density by phantom studies. To demonstrate the usefulness of CADe, a preclinical reader study will be conducted to compare radiologists' detection accuracy of NCPs with and without CADe.  The major innovations of this project include (1) being the first CADe system to automatically detect non-calcified plaques including those cause positive remodeling or stenosis in cCTA, (2) development of new machine learning techniques including the vessel-stitching method, vessel-sector-profile analysis, multiscale enhancement response, and dynamic balloon tracking specifically suited for coronary arterial trees, and (3) conducting the first ROC study to evaluate the effect of CADe on radiologists' detection of NCPs.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in both men and women in the United States. If the proposed CADe system is successfully developed, it will (1) provide an accurate, efficient, and consistent tool to assist clinicians in detecting and quantifying non-calcified plaques (NCP) including those causing positive remodeling and/or stenosis for an individual patient, (2) help clinicians estimate the total NCP burden and study its significance, in analogy to that of the total calcium score, which may lead to improved clinical management of the vulnerable plaques, and (3) accelerate studies to develop new treatment options of coronary heart disease by providing a monitoring tool of treatment response. The proposed CADe system can thus serve as a foundation for these broader future applications and improve the efficacy of cCTA. Improved detection and management of NCPs may reduce the risk of myocardial infarctions and will have strong and long-lasting impact on health care.           Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in both men and women in the United States.

"Automated Web-Based Behavioral Diagnostics of Cognitive Impairment    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alzheimer's disease affects an estimated 5.3 million Americans currently, and this number is expected to grow significantly in the coming decade. A critical goal of Alzheimer's disease research is to improve current methods of diagnosis so that patients can be identified sooner and, therefore, obtain greater advantage from available therapies. The major goal of this project is to develop and validate an automated, web-based method for early diagnosis of cognitive decline and memory loss. We will build on current research that has demonstrated a clear link between performance on the Visual Paired- Comparison Task (VPC) and diagnosis of MCI, and we will extend the impact of this finding by developing a suite of software tools and analysis methods that will improve the accuracy and extend the accessibility of cognitive diagnostics with a web-based VPC task that can be widely deployed. Although the VPC task is promising as a diagnostic aid, clinical application is severely limited by the need to use an eye tracker to precisely monitor subjects' eye movements. Unfortunately, eye trackers are expensive, require trained personnel, and are not widely available. However, our preliminary findings show that it is possible to produce picture examination behavior that is similar to eye-movements, using modified versions of the VPC task that could be administered by anyone, on any computer with an internet connection. In addition, powerful machine learning techniques from computer science can help accurately analyze and diagnose the resulting behavior. An important contribution from this work will be the possibility of predicting oncoming cognitive decline in MCI patients sooner than is now possible, that is, at a time when the nervous system is less compromised and more likely to benefit from therapeutic intervention. In support of this objective, we propose three aims: 1) Develop and investigate appropriate representation of eye movement characteristics and corresponding machine learning-based classification techniques for effective identification of the patient status, 2) Develop and validate a web-based version of the VPC task, and 3) explore the feasibility of our task as an automatic screening instrument for the general elderly population. Successful completion of these aims has the potential to dramatically alter the current practice of clinical translational research as well as the current methods used for diagnosing cognitive deficits. This would enable thousands and potentially millions of patients and potential research subjects to take the test as part of their routine checkup, requiring nothing more than a computer with an internet connection.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Alzheimer's disease affects an estimated 5.3 million Americans currently, and this number is expected to grow significantly in the coming decade.

"Hand Sensorimotor Function and Carpal Tunnel Syndrome    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The median nerve is susceptible to compression in the wrist, leading to carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). CTS is the most common compression neuropathy and have an immense impact on national health care, worker productivity, and quality of life. Despite its high prevalence and public health cost, our understanding of CTS is limited, and the management of CTS awaits improvement. The central notion of this project is that hand sensorimotor function is sensitive to peripheral median neuropathy and that the central nervous system is affected by CTS, causing the associated sensorimotor deficit. We will investigate this notion with quantifiable sensorimotor data from novel biomechanical and neurophysiological studies. This project has three aims consisting of biomechanical, neurophysiological and translational research. The first aim is to investigate CTS-induced pathokinematic and pathokinetic performance using dexterous manual tasks of thumb opposition, reach-to-pinch, precision grip, and finger pressing. The second aim is to investigate the neurophysiological implications of chronic peripheral neuropathy (i.e., CTS) on the central nervous system by evaluating corticomuscular coupling and stretch reflex. The third aim is to identify novel biomechanical and neurophysiological markers for CTS cases using machine learning and classification algorithms. The results of this project will elucidate the pathological mechanisms and behavioral manifestations of CTS and aid in the development of new strategies for diagnosis, evaluation, rehabilitation, and treatment of this disorder. More generally, CTS as a chronic neuropathy serves as an effective model to study sensorimotor mechanisms of the peripheral and central nervous systems. In addition, the methodology developed in this project is applicable to other neuromuscular disorders.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:   Carpal tunnel syndrome is highly prevalent and costly. One of the distinct consequences of carpal tunnel syndrome is that patients experience inexplicable dropping of objects and clumsiness while performing simple daily tasks. In this project, we propose to study the sensorimotor deficit using novel biomechanical and neurophysiological experiments. The results of this project will elucidate the pathological mechanisms and manifestations of carpal tunnel syndrome. This project is clinically translational to aid in the development of new strategies for diagnosis, evaluation, rehabilitation, and treatment of this disorder.                   Carpal tunnel syndrome is highly prevalent and costly.

"Neurophysiologically Based Responsive Pharmacotherapy for Epilepsy     DESCRIPTION: Despite taking daily medications, over 1/3 of patients with epilepsy continue to have seizures, and many  more experience significant adverse side effects from antiepileptic drugs (AED). Though patients may spend as little as 0.01% of their time actually having seizures, they must maintain chronic therapeutic AED levels for years to decades. The reason AEDs are taken daily for seizures that only occur sporadically, and in many  cases infrequently, is because patients do not know when a seizure will strike. Arguably the unpredictability of seizures and the adverse cognitive and physical side effects associated with AEDs, are the most disabling aspects of epilepsy. We now have compelling evidence from humans that seizures are not random events, but rather are associated with intracranial EEG (lEEG) changes that occur tens of minutes to hours before clinical events. This research has lead NeuroVista Inc. to develop a seizure advisory system (SAS) that uses iEEG and machine learning algorithms to track the probability of seizure occurrence. Using patient specific algorithms NeuroVista's SAS can forecast periods of increased and decreased seizure likelihood with high sensitivity and specificity, benchmarked against a chance predictor. NeuroVista's SAS has been validated in humans undergoing IEEG monitoring for epilepsy surgery, and has recently been approved for a human pilot clinical trial in Australia.  We propose to use the NeuroVista's SAS device to guide the delivery of AEDs. We hypothesize that intelligent delivery of AEDs at times of increased seizure likelihood will effectively prevent clinical seizures.  During periods of low seizure likelihood AEDs would not be required, reducing side effects. In this proposal we develop and test neurophysiologically-based responsive pharmacotherapy in naturally occurring canine epilepsy as the first step in creating a new treatment paradigm for medically resistant human partial epilepsy.  Naturally occurring canine partial epilepsy is an ideal model for developing this therapy because of the clinical, physiological, and pharmacological similarities between canine and human partial epilepsy. In addition, dogs are large enough to tolerate implantation of the human SAS device. This project will lead to submission of an investigational device exemption to conduct a first-in-human clinical trial of SAS guided responsive AED therapy.        Disclaimer:  Please note that the following critiques were prepared by the reviewers prior to the Study Section meeting and are provided in an essentially unedited form.

"A novel use of web-based software to efficiently triage pre-surgical patients bas    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This is a Fast-Track application to develop a web-based, patient-centered software product that accurately assesses a patient's perioperative risk as a means of improving quality of care and reducing costs.       Approximately 40 million surgical procedures are performed annually in the United States [1]. To ensure the safety of patients undergoing these procedures, it is imperative to identify and mitigate perioperative risk. Unfortunately, the process used by most hospitals and surgical centers to evaluate pre-surgical patients falls short on two fronts. One is a failure to identify risk factors in a timely fashion, as most preoperative evaluations occur the day before or day of surgery. The second is a failure to properly identify risk factors due to incomplete or inaccurate preoperative evaluations. These shortcomings increase morbidity and mortality, increase healthcare cost, and lower patient satisfaction. Therefore, a standardized preoperative assessment delivered in a timely fashion is needed.       To address this need, we (MedSleuth, Inc.) have developed web-based software that utilizes a patent- pending algorithm to generate a customized patient survey, based on the patient's medication profile and successive responses to the survey. The survey output takes the form of a comprehensive medical history, triages patients based on health status, and provides the patient-specific information required by healthcare providers to identify and mitigate perioperative risk. Conservatively, it is estimated $10 billion could be saved annually (~25% of total spend) through our approach, with similarly sizable improvements in quality and satisfaction.       Our Phase I study will evaluate proof of concept for the first-generation software with one collaborating hospital system (Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School) over the course of a six- month period. Phase I will seek to prove (1) patients can successfully complete the web-based survey; (2) the output generated by the survey is accurate, comprehensive and relevant for making informed clinical decisions; (3) our assessment algorithm is equivalent or superior to the status quo in identifying perioperative risk; (4) patients and healthcare providers report high levels of satisfaction; and (5) preoperative evaluation costs can be substantially reduced.       In Phase II we will incorporate patient and healthcare provider feedback from Phase I to develop the more robust second-generation version of the web-based software. We will in turn test this second- generation software on a much larger patient population across multiple surgical sites to verify clinical accuracy and completeness, cost savings, and increased satisfaction. At the conclusion of Phase II, we expect to have a market ready product with documented outcomes.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A need exists for a system that can efficiently and effectively triage patients based on perioperative risk, thereby focusing resources on those patients with complex medical problems while improving quality and satisfaction for all. We (MedSleuth, Inc.) have developed a first-generation web-based patient- centric software product that standardizes and streamlines the way a patient's medical history is elicited and recorded. This is accomplished by applying patent-pending machine learning technology to tailor a real-time survey based on each patient's medication profile and successive responses during the survey. We hypothesize that (1) patients can successfully complete the web-based survey on their own; (2) clinicians find the output of the survey relevant, accurate, and superior to current methods for making informed clinical decisions related to the surgical procedure; (3) patients and healthcare providers report high levels of satisfaction with the survey; (4) quality of care is improved; and (5) costs are reduced.           Project Narrative A need exists for a system that can efficiently and effectively triage patients based on perioperative risk, thereby focusing resources on those patients with complex medical problems while improving quality and satisfaction for all.

"Ancillary Comparative Effectiveness of Atrial Fibrillation Ablation Surgery    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This proposal describes an ancillary study to a recently initiated comparative effectiveness trial ""Surgical Ablation versus No Surgical Ablation for Patients with Persistent or Longstanding Persistent Atrial Fibrillation Undergoing Mitral Valve Surgery"" (NCT00903370), which is part of the NHLBI-sponsored Cardiothoracic Surgery Network (CTSN). Its aims are to perform a time-sensitive substudy of continuous heart rhythm monitoring and to develop and apply novel statistical tools to assess ablation effectiveness in groups of patients. As such, it will provide critical new knowledge to support a secondary objective of the parent trial: to inform rhythm monitoring and analysis strategies for future trials of rhythm control in atrial fibrillation (AF).  Great enthusiasm for innovative tissue-destroying (ablation) procedures to treat AF has led to technology outstripping science. Mechanisms of AF (which afflicts >3 million Americans) remain poorly understood, methods to assess its cure are primitive, and guidelines for analyzing rhythm outcomes are flawed due to lack of appropriate statistical methodology. Why? After ablation procedures, AF may recur in episodes of varying duration. Yet current monitoring consists of ""snapshots"" of semiannual rhythm recording (Holter), or more frequent-but short-transtelephonic monitoring (TTM). Ideally, an implantable monitoring device could detect all these episodes over a patient's lifetime; however, even if this were possible, statistical methods to analyze this series of occurrences in groups of patients for comparative effectiveness of AF therapies or to identify risk factors are poorly developed. Right now a window of opportunity exists to make important strides in more thorough AF assessment and proper data analysis because the CTSN has just launched a randomized trial of surgical AF therapies that includes weekly TTM of atrial rhythm as well as traditional 6- and 12-month Holter assessment. We propose a time-sensitive substudy of implanting an FDA-approved miniature loop recorder to capture AF episodes continuously. These data will be used in the development of a suite of new analytic methods for aggregating data such as these across time and across patients to characterize time course and identify modulating factors. They will then be used to assess the trial's rhythm endpoints and suggest designs for more informative future trials with substantially reduced sample size. We have assembled a team of clinicians and statisticians, including individuals who designed the parent trial, who are experienced in implanting the monitoring device, and who are experts in analytic methods research, to develop and apply novel methods to these several types of rhythm data. We will leverage developments from an intramural NHLBI machine learning program at Cleveland Clinic and State of Ohio-funded Atrial Fibrillation Innovation Center. The analytic methods have wide applicability to the important field of longitudinal data analysis. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  A chaotic heart rhythm called atrial fibrillation (AF), which affects more than 3 million Americans, especially the elderly, causes strokes, and commonly accompanies heart valve disease. AF treatments outstrip scientific understanding of the rhythm and how to assess treatment success across time in clinical trials. Thus, the Institute of Medicine has placed trials of AF treatment in the first tier of 100 comparative effectiveness priorities for the nation. An NIH-sponsored trial of surgical treatment of AF is has just been launched, and we propose a substudy of an implanted rhythm monitoring device (Medtronic REVEAL XT) and new methods of AF analysis for groups of patients that will help assess the trial's endpoints and inform future trials. Thus, this ancillary study application proposes to (1) collect, in a subset of patients, more refined rhythm data than proposed in the parent trial, (2) develop generalizable new methods of analysis, and (3) apply these methods to both the data collected through continuous monitoring as well as the follow-up data collected in the parent trial through Holter and trans-telephonic monitoring.

"Developing a Virtual Basic Laparoscopic Skill Trainer (VBLaST)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Development and Validation of a Virtual Basic Laparoscopic Skill Trainer (VBLaST) For the first time in the history of surgical education, a comprehensive program to teach and evaluate the cognitive and psychomotor aspects unique to laparoscopic surgery - the Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery (FLS) developed originally by the Society of American Gastrointestinal Endoscopic Surgery (SAGES) and subsequently by a joint committee which includes the American College of Surgeons (ACS) - is being embraced nationally for training and credentialing laparoscopic surgeons.

"Early Detection of Keratoconus    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Keratoconus is the most common degenerative disease affecting the cornea. This condition tends to develop around puberty and to progress over the next few decades, but its clinical history can be quite variable. As keratoconus develops, the cornea thins and bulges. Eventually, a corneal transplant may be needed to maintain vision. In its earliest stages, the disease is particularly difficult to detect, even using state-of-the-art diagnostic techniques such as anterior/posterior surface topography. This is of great importance to the corneal refractive surgeon because surgical treatment of an occult keratoconic cornea will weaken it and greatly accelerate the occurrence of symptoms. Because of the difficulty in differentiating early keratoconus from atypical normal corneas, many normal eyes deemed 'suspicious' are denied treatment. At the same time, some keratoconic eyes are missed and operated upon, with disastrous consequences. Early detection of keratoconus may also benefit patients because of the recent development of methods for strengthening the corneal stroma and preventing disease progression. We have developed a technique based on the use of high resolution ultrasound for imaging the cornea and measuring the thickness of its component layers, including the epithelium (about 50 microns in thickness) and the stroma (about 500 microns in thickness). We have shown that the epithelium, which is the surface layer of the cornea, will remodel itself to smooth out underlying irregularities. In early keratoconus, as the anterior stromal surface begins to bulge forward, the epithelium will thin above the apex of the bulge and thicken around it, to maintain a smooth anterior surface. This compensatory mechanism prevents anterior surface topography from detecting keratoconus in its early stages. We have also developed methods for characterizing the elastic properties of the cornea by inducing and measuring surface displacements in response to a pulse of acoustic radiation force. We will further develop and test this technique and apply it clinically in conjunction with the Ocular Response Analyzer, an instrument that causes a similar effect by use of an air pressure pulse. This proposal will involve analysis of topographic and pachymetric patterns and elastic properties in normal, keratoconus and keratoconus-suspicious eyes. We will develop an index based on multivariate analysis of these patterns based on unambiguously classified cases, and validate the risk index on suspicious cases based on clinical documentation of disease progression. Our goal is to reduce the percentage of screened cases deemed keratoconus- suspicious by at least a factor of two by allowing an unambiguous diagnosis of early keratoconus. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Keratoconus (KC) is a corneal dystrophy will in many cases ultimately require corneal transplantation to maintain vision. Early detection, which is not possible with current technology, would allow early treatment and prevent sever damage to KC corneas inadvertently operated upon for correction of vision. Our aim is to combine measurements of corneal elasticity, topography and epithelial thickness to develop means for early detection of KC.           PROJECT NARRATIVE Keratoconus (KC) is a corneal dystrophy will in many cases ultimately require corneal transplantation to maintain vision.

"Assessing Indeterminate Thyroid Nodules With Electrical Impedance Measurements    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Thyroid nodules are present in a large fraction of healthy individuals. Between 4% and 7% of the United States adult population has palpable thyroid nodules, and up to 50% of American women older than age 50 have nodules that can be depicted on ultrasound. The vast majority (>95%) of thyroid nodules are benign. However, cancer risk increases with male gender, nodule size, extremes of age (< 30 and > 60 years), underlying autoimmune disease, nodule growth, personal or family history of thyroid cancer, and radiation exposure. Ultrasound imaging and Fine Needle Aspiration Biopsy (FNAB) remain the mainstays of thyroid nodule evaluation. Unfortunately, 25% of patients who ultimately undergo FNAB of a thyroid nodule have indeterminate cytology. Many of these patients will require at least partial thyroidectomy purely for the purpose of obtaining a definitive diagnosis. Given that only 30% of these will ultimately prove to be malignant on surgical pathology, the majority of these lobectomies could potentially be avoided if better non-invasive methods existed to evaluate indeterminate nodules. Electrical Impedance Scanning (EIS) has been previously investigated for non-invasive evaluation of thyroid nodules. The overall diagnostic accuracy of EIS was encouraging but not sufficient for routine clinical use. We have developed a modified approach termed here Resonance Electrical Impedance Spectroscopy (REIS) that should have substantially higher sensitivity and specificity for this very purpose. When using REIS technology to examine the breast, we obtained initial results that are significantly better in all respects than those obtained with traditional EIS. We believe that REIS technology will similarly improve the assessment of thyroid nodules. REIS hold promise as a reproducible modality for the risk stratification of the many patients with indeterminate thyroid nodules. It is a new non- invasive modality that may help reduce the number of diagnostic lobectomies and would be welcomed by patients with non-diagnostic FNA results. The purpose of this application is to design, assemble, and test in a preliminary clinical study a unique REIS based device for the assessment of thyroid nodules.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to design, assemble, and test in technical and preliminary human studies a non-invasive, easy to use device for measuring Resonance Electrical Impedance Spectroscopy (REIS) of FNA indeterminate thyroid nodules. We will assess the ability of this technology to accurately characterize these indeterminate nodules as benign or malignant prior to a ""diagnostic"" surgery.           We propose to design, assemble, and test in technical and preliminary human studies a non-invasive, easy to use device for measuring Resonance Electrical Impedance Spectroscopy (REIS) of FNA indeterminate thyroid nodules.

"A novel use of web-based software to efficiently triage pre-surgical patients bas    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This is a Fast-Track application to develop a web-based, patient-centered software product that accurately assesses a patient's perioperative risk as a means of improving quality of care and reducing costs.       Approximately 40 million surgical procedures are performed annually in the United States [1]. To ensure the safety of patients undergoing these procedures, it is imperative to identify and mitigate perioperative risk. Unfortunately, the process used by most hospitals and surgical centers to evaluate pre-surgical patients falls short on two fronts. One is a failure to identify risk factors in a timely fashion, as most preoperative evaluations occur the day before or day of surgery. The second is a failure to properly identify risk factors due to incomplete or inaccurate preoperative evaluations. These shortcomings increase morbidity and mortality, increase healthcare cost, and lower patient satisfaction. Therefore, a standardized preoperative assessment delivered in a timely fashion is needed.       To address this need, we (MedSleuth, Inc.) have developed web-based software that utilizes a patent- pending algorithm to generate a customized patient survey, based on the patient's medication profile and successive responses to the survey. The survey output takes the form of a comprehensive medical history, triages patients based on health status, and provides the patient-specific information required by healthcare providers to identify and mitigate perioperative risk. Conservatively, it is estimated $10 billion could be saved annually (~25% of total spend) through our approach, with similarly sizable improvements in quality and satisfaction.       Our Phase I study will evaluate proof of concept for the first-generation software with one collaborating hospital system (Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School) over the course of a six- month period. Phase I will seek to prove (1) patients can successfully complete the web-based survey; (2) the output generated by the survey is accurate, comprehensive and relevant for making informed clinical decisions; (3) our assessment algorithm is equivalent or superior to the status quo in identifying perioperative risk; (4) patients and healthcare providers report high levels of satisfaction; and (5) preoperative evaluation costs can be substantially reduced.       In Phase II we will incorporate patient and healthcare provider feedback from Phase I to develop the more robust second-generation version of the web-based software. We will in turn test this second- generation software on a much larger patient population across multiple surgical sites to verify clinical accuracy and completeness, cost savings, and increased satisfaction. At the conclusion of Phase II, we expect to have a market ready product with documented outcomes.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A need exists for a system that can efficiently and effectively triage patients based on perioperative risk, thereby focusing resources on those patients with complex medical problems while improving quality and satisfaction for all. We (MedSleuth, Inc.) have developed a first-generation web-based patient- centric software product that standardizes and streamlines the way a patient's medical history is elicited and recorded. This is accomplished by applying patent-pending machine learning technology to tailor a real-time survey based on each patient's medication profile and successive responses during the survey. We hypothesize that (1) patients can successfully complete the web-based survey on their own; (2) clinicians find the output of the survey relevant, accurate, and superior to current methods for making informed clinical decisions related to the surgical procedure; (3) patients and healthcare providers report high levels of satisfaction with the survey; (4) quality of care is improved; and (5) costs are reduced.           Project Narrative A need exists for a system that can efficiently and effectively triage patients based on perioperative risk, thereby focusing resources on those patients with complex medical problems while improving quality and satisfaction for all.

"Early Detection of Keratoconus    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Keratoconus is the most common degenerative disease affecting the cornea. This condition tends to develop around puberty and to progress over the next few decades, but its clinical history can be quite variable. As keratoconus develops, the cornea thins and bulges. Eventually, a corneal transplant may be needed to maintain vision. In its earliest stages, the disease is particularly difficult to detect, even using state-of-the-art diagnostic techniques such as anterior/posterior surface topography. This is of great importance to the corneal refractive surgeon because surgical treatment of an occult keratoconic cornea will weaken it and greatly accelerate the occurrence of symptoms. Because of the difficulty in differentiating early keratoconus from atypical normal corneas, many normal eyes deemed 'suspicious' are denied treatment. At the same time, some keratoconic eyes are missed and operated upon, with disastrous consequences. Early detection of keratoconus may also benefit patients because of the recent development of methods for strengthening the corneal stroma and preventing disease progression. We have developed a technique based on the use of high resolution ultrasound for imaging the cornea and measuring the thickness of its component layers, including the epithelium (about 50 microns in thickness) and the stroma (about 500 microns in thickness). We have shown that the epithelium, which is the surface layer of the cornea, will remodel itself to smooth out underlying irregularities. In early keratoconus, as the anterior stromal surface begins to bulge forward, the epithelium will thin above the apex of the bulge and thicken around it, to maintain a smooth anterior surface. This compensatory mechanism prevents anterior surface topography from detecting keratoconus in its early stages. We have also developed methods for characterizing the elastic properties of the cornea by inducing and measuring surface displacements in response to a pulse of acoustic radiation force. We will further develop and test this technique and apply it clinically in conjunction with the Ocular Response Analyzer, an instrument that causes a similar effect by use of an air pressure pulse. This proposal will involve analysis of topographic and pachymetric patterns and elastic properties in normal, keratoconus and keratoconus-suspicious eyes. We will develop an index based on multivariate analysis of these patterns based on unambiguously classified cases, and validate the risk index on suspicious cases based on clinical documentation of disease progression. Our goal is to reduce the percentage of screened cases deemed keratoconus- suspicious by at least a factor of two by allowing an unambiguous diagnosis of early keratoconus. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Keratoconus (KC) is a corneal dystrophy will in many cases ultimately require corneal transplantation to maintain vision. Early detection, which is not possible with current technology, would allow early treatment and prevent sever damage to KC corneas inadvertently operated upon for correction of vision. Our aim is to combine measurements of corneal elasticity, topography and epithelial thickness to develop means for early detection of KC.           PROJECT NARRATIVE Keratoconus (KC) is a corneal dystrophy will in many cases ultimately require corneal transplantation to maintain vision.

"A web hospital comparison tool for patients considering kidney transplantation an    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal addresses the need for objective hospital quality ranking tools that are relevant to patients' experiences and customizable to their individual conditions. This need is created by market changes where patients are increasingly being made aware of differences in quality between providers who will improve their odds at success. Medicare, state governments, insurers and several private companies offer information on hospital quality and cost across many conditions and incorporating a variety of data, process and outcomes quality indicators. However, according to investors, bankers, industry analysts and entrepreneurs, comparison tools are still at an embryonic stage. They suffer from limited specificity, low resolution, conflicts of interest and misfit in the patient information finding process. This leads to patient confusion and perceptions that information is meaningless for decision making. PickCare (tm) is a hospital comparison tool that will address gaps that exist in current hospital ranking systems using advanced statistical and econometric models that have never been applied in this space. In phase 1 we developed Pickcare v2.0 in kidney transplantation and showed that: 1) these models improve specificity through customization to patient factors that our analysis unearths are most important; 2) our models improve resolution by using an expanded history of risk factors; 3) the user interface tested with patients/ family communicates the system's improved resolution as differences across hospitals that patients can understand, and its specificity as a message of hope and alternatives. In phase 2 we will expand to Pickcare v3.0 to 1) accommodate user feedback from phase 1, 2) scale to accommodate more treatments beginning with dialysis and 3) further imbed the system in patients' information finding process. The deliverable of Phase 2 will be version 3 of Pickcare to be released on-line for kidney transplantation and tested internally with recruited patients for dialysis. A manuscript describing how the system influences patient choice in kidney transplantation based on analysis of on-line user data will also be submitted for publication.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposal addresses the need for user-friendly web-based tools to help patients and their families choose between hospitals based on the quality of care they will receive. The tool is unique in that it is customized to patient conditions, it has high resolution to separate excellent, average and poor hospitals, it addresses patients' motivations to search for hospital information and builds trust by answering their questions independently of insurers or hospitals.           This proposal addresses the need for user-friendly web-based tools to help patients and their families choose between hospitals based on the quality of care they will receive.

"Biomechanics and Correction of Crouch Gait The goal of this work is to establish a scientific basis for treating crouch gait, one of the most common movement abnormalities among children with cerebral palsy. Crouch gait is characterized by persistent flexion of the knee. It is an inefficient means of locomotion; if not corrected it often leads to bone deformities and serious, life-long physical limitations. We will develop predictive tools to determine the probability that each of the common treatments for crouch gait will improve a subject's excess knee flexion. For each treatment, we will identify a set of predictive variables. We will then identify all subjects from a large database of patients who received the surgery and use these subjects' outcome data to choose a weighting coefficient for each of the biomechanics based predictive variables. We will assess the predictive accuracy when applied to a different set of subjects using cross validation. These tools will predict whether or not a particular surgery will improve a patient's excessive knee flexion. Our preliminary work suggests that 80% prediction accuracy is feasible The success of this project will result in rigorously tested methods to aid treatment planning for crouch gait, and will hopefully produce better, more predictable treatment outcomes. Although multi-joint movement abnormalities such as crouch gait are exceptionally complex, the development of statistical models that predict which patients will benefit from specific surgical treatments is an important and necessary step toward designing more effective treatments.  PROJECT RELEVANCE  Crouch gait is one of the most common movement abnormalities among children with cerebral palsy. Surgeries are frequently performed in an effort to improve crouch gait, but it is difficult to predict which patients will benefit from these procedures because the biomechanical factors that cause crouch gait are unknown. This project will result in simulations and statistical models to aid treatment planning for crouch gait, which will hopefully lead to better, more predictable treatment outcomes.",Biomechanics and Correction of Crouch Gait,7933826,R01HD033929,"['Acceleration', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Aftercare', 'Biomechanics', 'Braces-Orthopedic appliances', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Chi-Square Tests', 'Child', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Complex', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Deformity', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Exercise', 'Gait', 'Gastrocnemius Muscle', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Hip region structure', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Knee', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Limb structure', 'Locomotion', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Muscle Weakness', 'Musculoskeletal', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Orthopedic Surgery procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Posture', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Research', 'Role', 'Rotation', 'Soleus Muscle', 'Spastic', 'Statistical Models', 'Testing', 'Torsion', 'Treatment outcome', 'Validation', 'Walking', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'bone', 'common treatment', 'crouch gait', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'gait examination', 'hamstring', 'improved', 'joint mobilization', 'kinematics', 'knee pain', 'motor control', 'response', 'simulation', 'success', 'therapy design', 'tibia', 'tool', 'treatment planning']",NICHD,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2010,393526,0.004875873499009976
"Phase 2 Clinical Trial of Coralmyn for Coral Snake Bite (BB-IND 13926,01/02/09)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Each year, poison control centers report approximately 75 bites by coral snakes (Micrurus and Micruroides species) in the United States.  More than half of these occur in Florida, with the rest concentrated in the southeastern states, westward as far as Texas.  Before the introduction of anti-coral antivenom by Wyeth in 1967, approximately 10% of Micrurus bites were potentially fatal, due to ventilatory failure caused by neurotoxins active at the neuromuscular junction.  Wyeth Ayerst has recently ceased production of this antivenom.  In October of 2009, the last vials will expire, leaving the U.S. without a licensed supplier of antivenom.  Objectives: Licensure of a new antivenom product, Coralmyn.  Specific Aims: (1) Demonstrate the safety of Coralmyn in patients bitten by Micrurus coral snakes, by monitoring recipients for Type I and Type III immune reactions.  (2) Demonstrate the value of plasma venom levels as a surrogate endpoint in coral snake bites by relating venom levels to severity of envenomation, before and after treatment.  (3) Demonstrate that cost of treatment is different for patients presenting to hospitals with and without antivenom in stock, and use patient cost data to complete a pharmacoeconomic model comparing distribution methodologies applicable to Phase 3 or 4 study design.        This will be an open-label Phase 2 clinical trial of Coralmyn (anti-coral serum injectable solution, Instituto Bioclon, S.A. de C.V.) in male and female human patients of any age who present for emergency care following bites by coral snakes of genus Micrurus.  Using grant funds, as many hospitals as economically feasible (at least 3 in Florida) will be provided with antivenom with which to enroll patients promptly in the study, using a central IRB.  Patients presenting to other sites may enroll in the study either by inter-hospital transfer or by emergency delivery of antivenom to out-of-network hospitals.  In all cases, clinical observations and plasma for venom levels will be collected at study enrollment and hourly until start of study drug.  Following infusion of antivenom, clinical observations and plasma collection will be repeated at intervals until hospital discharge; and telephone follow-up will continue through day 22.  Clinical and financial data will be extracted by examination of patient records including standardized data collection sheets completed prospectively by hospital staff and extracted into Case Report Forms secondarily by study staff at a central site.  Plasma will be frozen and held for batch analysis every six months, using a Micrurus-specific ELISA assay. Statistical analysis of safety indicators will be conducted using Cox Proportional Hazard or survival models.  Venom levels will be analyzed using a combination of logistic regression and ANOVA and compared with neurological assessments using a Generalized Linear Mixed Model.  Cost data will be entered into a decision-tree model constructed in TreeAge HealthcarePro, and sensitivity analysis will be performed using MonteCarlo simulation.           Project Narrative: Bites by coral snakes can be fatal if the bitten person does not receive antivenom promptly, but the only U.S. manufacturer of coral snake antivenom has stopped making it. This study will test the safety of a new antivenom in patients bitten by coral snakes, it will show whether testing for venom in the bloodstream is a useful way to determine how bad of a bite a person has, and it will show whether it is cost-effective to stock investigational antivenom in just a small number of places if there is no licensed antivenom for hospitals to buy. Results of the study will help doctors, the manufacturer, and the FDA to move forward toward getting a new antivenom for use in the U.S.","Phase 2 Clinical Trial of Coralmyn for Coral Snake Bite (BB-IND 13926,01/02/09)",7765514,R01FD003706,[' '],FDA,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R01,2010,400000,0.02292454052472794
"Multi-institutional Consortium for CER in Diabetes Treatment and Prevention    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Project Summary /Abstract: The HMO Research Network's (HMORN) Diabetes Multi-Center Research Consortium (DMCRC) Coordinating Center proposes to build a national research network and a multi-system distributed database for conducting comparative effectiveness research (CER) in the treatment and prevention of diabetes mellitus. The network is comprised of 31 investigators from 12 integrated healthcare delivery systems and academic institutions who study diabetes mellitus, gestational diabetes mellitus, childhood and adult obesity, weight management, medical informatics and biostatistics. The network has broad experience conducting system-based interventions to improve treatment of diabetes or to support lifestyle changes to prevent diabetes, as well as broad experience conducting CER. The 12-system database will capture and standardize detailed demographic and longitudinal electronic health record (EHR)-derived clinical data on more than 750,000 persons with diabetes and a much larger membership without diabetes. Once constructed, the database will be used to conduct and publish surveillance data on trends (2005- 2012) in the incidence, prevalence, treatment and outcomes of diabetes in this population. It will also be used to conduct two CER studies. The first is a cluster randomized, multi-system intervention that will rapidly identify diabetes patients with ""early nonadherence"" to newly prescribed anti-diabetic, antihypertensive, and lipid-lowering medications. Early nonadherence refers to patient failure to fill either the first prescription of a new medication or the first refill, and has been shown to be more frequent than ""ongoing"" nonadherence. This information will be provided to population management outreach teams in 3-5 health systems via the EHR or other electronic database, along with training in counseling patients on adherence problems. Study outcomes of subsequent risk factor change and adherence to the new medication will be compared within each system to those for patients on teams that do not receive the new information. The second CER study is an observational evaluation of various communication, counseling and referral strategies as provided to women who have had an abnormal glucose test (fasting glucose or oral glucose tolerance test) in the first 6 months after a pregnancy complicated by gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and who are therefore at very high risk for developing Type 2 diabetes. Study outcomes include weight change over one year and self-reported physical activity four months after the abnormal test. In each study, we will collect process of care data by applying natural language processing (NLP) to clinical text in EHRs and survey patients for information on demographic, clinical, and behavioral variables. These NLP-derived and patient-reported variables will be studied as possible mediators of treatment effectiveness or as potential modifiers of effectiveness (i.e. variables that identify patient subgroups that benefit less from usual interventions. Variables that prove to be important as mediators or modifiers may be good candidates for routine collection and incorporation into EHR's and/or future diabetes registries.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A network of 32 health services and intervention scientists affiliated with the HMO Research Network propose to build a national database for conducting comparative effectiveness research on treatment and on approaches to preventing diabetes mellitus.

"Integrated Cardio-Renal Risk Prediction Models in Type 1 Diabetes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This application addresses broad Challenge Area (03) Biomarker Discovery and Validation, and the specific Challenge Topic that this application addresses is: 03-DK-101 Discovery of biomarkers for disease risk, progression or response to therapy in diseases of interest to NIDDK. The Challenge: Despite tremendous progress in treatment, patients with type 1 diabetes continue to die 15 years earlier, experience excess morbidity and have medical costs over 10 times higher than the general population. The risk of coronary artery disease and diabetic nephropathy is still greatly increased and responsible for 80% of deaths in these patients. Diabetic nephropathy and coronary artery disease are intertwined, suggesting common pathways, and yet current risk prediction is inadequate. Study Rationale: Nearly 25% of T1D patients develop end-stage renal disease. The conventional theory is that the sequence of events leading to diabetic nephropathy begins from microalbuminuria, progressing to overt proteinuria and eventual end-stage renal disease. Primary prevention with ACE/ARB treatment usually begins when persistent microalbuminuria is found. However, recent prospective studies using serial measurements of kidney function estimated from serum cystatin C have changed this paradigm by demonstrating that decline in glomerular filtration may begin in the absence of microalbuminuria or continue despite remission of microalbuminuria. By their mid 40's, over 70% of men and 50% of women with type 1 diabetes develop coronary artery calcification (CAC) - a marker of significant atherosclerotic plaque burden. Cardiovascular disease is particularly prevalent among patients with renal disease, but most cardiac events occur in patients with normal albumin excretion rates. Evidence has accumulated that diabetic nephropathy and CAC are parallel, rather than sequential, complications of type 1 diabetes, sharing a number of important predictors. Accurate prediction of the individual's global cardio-renal risk is needed to guide treatment choices. As a result, there is a recognized need for better risk partitioning, either from the discovery of additional biomarkers or the application of superior methods for discrimination of disease states. Our Approach: We are proposing to use the biobank of 652 adults with type 1 diabetes who have been thoroughly genotyped and prospectively followed for development of diabetic nephropathy and coronary artery disease by the Coronary Artery Calcification in Type 1 Diabetes study (CACTI, R01 HL61753, 1999- 2009) to develop and validate integrated biomarker prediction models for cardio-renal complications in type 1 diabetes. Our study aims are the investigation of biomarkers within the well-characterized CACTI cohort for 1) early progressive renal function decline, 2) the presence and progression of coronary artery calcium, and the 3) development of combined renal and cardiovascular disease burden. Renal disease and coronary artery disease (CAD) are the leading causes of death among adults with type 1 diabetes, but traditional screening tests (urinary albumin and serum creatinine) for renal disease are inadequate, and traditional CAD risk factors (dyslipidemia, hypertension, smoking, obesity) do not fully explain the increased burden of disease associated with type 1 diabetes. Renal and cardiovascular complications are intertwined, suggesting shared pathways. Increased systemic inflammation is present in type 1 diabetes and inflammatory mediators such as uric acid, vitamin D and bone metabolism markers have been suggested to play a role in both renal and cardiovascular diseases. As a result, it is of critical public health importance to discover and validate new biomarkers for cardio-renal disease among adults with type 1 diabetes.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Renal disease and coronary artery disease (CAD) are the leading causes of death among adults with type 1 diabetes, but traditional screening tests (urinary albumin and serum creatinine) for renal disease are inadequate, and traditional CAD risk factors (dyslipidemia, hypertension, smoking, obesity) do not fully explain the increased burden of disease associated with type 1 diabetes.

"AUTOMATIC QUANTITATIVE CT IMAGING OF PERICARDIAL FAT: A NOVEL ISCHEMIA PREDICTOR    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Every year, 1 million people in the US will experience a heart attack or sudden cardiac death. A large percentage of these patients have no prior symptoms of any kind but suffer from silent heart disease (ischemia), which may cause a heart attack at any time. Currently there is no reliable screening method to identify people who may have silent heart disease and therefore are at risk of ""heart attack"".       We seek to extract additional data from a non-invasive Computed Tomography (CT) scan of the heart (commonly used in most imaging centers), which will better identify patients who are ""vulnerable"" to sudden heart attack. These images are acquired without contrast agents, as a common screening test for measuring coronary calcium, another clinical marker of coronary artery disease. We will prove that additional information about cardiovascular risk can be obtained by quantifying pericardial fat surrounding the heart in these cardiac CT images. Although this information exists in the cardiac CT scans acquired today, it is ignored in clinical practice because currently there are no tools to measure it automatically and reliably, and no information regarding its significance for a given patient.       We will develop fully automated, accurate, new computer software for quantitation of pericardial fat from cardiac CT images acquired for routine assessment of coronary calcium. We plan to achieve complete automation and accuracy, by applying a combination of robust and effective algorithms in machine learning with anatomical knowledge. We aim to prove that the developed automatic software will be as accurate, and more reproducible than experienced imaging physicians in quantifying pericardial fat, and will accomplish the measurement in a fraction of the time. Such software could be immediately made available worldwide to standard imaging workstations. For the first time, this will allow its use as a standard practical imaging tool for cardiovascular risk assessment, without requiring additional time, imaging or radiation risk to the patient.       We will also show that this new quantitative information has important additional value compared to other clinical cardiovascular risk factors and information from blood samples (such as cholesterol, glucose and CRP), and the amount of calcium in the patient's coronary arteries seen on CT scans, and establish its significance in the prediction of silent heart disease.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This new research will allow accurate prediction of who might be more likely to have heart disease which may ultimately cause a heart attack. It will allow doctors to identify patients for whom appropriate treatment could be prescribed to avoid a heart attack, or more extensive testing, could be recommended, to confirm or rule out heart disease.          n/a",AUTOMATIC QUANTITATIVE CT IMAGING OF PERICARDIAL FAT: A NOVEL ISCHEMIA PREDICTOR,7588839,R21EB006829,"['Abdomen', 'Algorithms', 'Automation', 'Biochemical', 'Blood specimen', 'C-reactive protein', 'Calcium', 'Cardiac', 'Cholesterol', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Markers', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Contrast Media', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary artery', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Evaluation', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Glucose', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Heart Diseases', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Ischemia', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Patients', 'Pericardial body location', 'Physicians', 'Predictive Value', 'Radiation', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Scanning', 'Screening procedure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Visceral', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'clinical practice', 'experience', 'heart imaging', 'indexing', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'sudden cardiac death', 'tool', 'waist circumference']",NIBIB,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R21,2009,196375,0.004276222435750902
"Biomechanics and Correction of Crouch Gait The goal of this work is to establish a scientific basis for treating crouch gait, one of the most common movement abnormalities among children with cerebral palsy. Crouch gait is characterized by persistent flexion of the knee. It is an inefficient means of locomotion; if not corrected it often leads to bone deformities and serious, life-long physical limitations. We will develop predictive tools to determine the probability that each of the common treatments for crouch gait will improve a subject's excess knee flexion. For each treatment, we will identify a set of predictive variables. We will then identify all subjects from a large database of patients who received the surgery and use these subjects' outcome data to choose a weighting coefficient for each of the biomechanics based predictive variables. We will assess the predictive accuracy when applied to a different set of subjects using cross validation. These tools will predict whether or not a particular surgery will improve a patient's excessive knee flexion. Our preliminary work suggests that 80% prediction accuracy is feasible The success of this project will result in rigorously tested methods to aid treatment planning for crouch gait, and will hopefully produce better, more predictable treatment outcomes. Although multi-joint movement abnormalities such as crouch gait are exceptionally complex, the development of statistical models that predict which patients will benefit from specific surgical treatments is an important and necessary step toward designing more effective treatments. The positive economic impact of this project is to maintain employment for the project participants. We have already lost one talented bioengineer, F.E. Anderson, because of the funding gap in this project arising from severe NIH paylines. Funding for this project will provide employment for Ajay Seth, Carolyn Mazenko, and Jennifer Hicks for the next two years.",Biomechanics and Correction of Crouch Gait,7735516,R01HD033929,"['Aftercare', 'Arthralgia', 'Biomechanics', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Child', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Complex', 'Critiques', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Deformity', 'Development', 'Employment', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Hip region structure', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Knee', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Locomotion', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Movement', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Orthopedic Surgery procedures', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Probability', 'Research', 'Rotation', 'Statistical Models', 'Testing', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Walking', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'bone', 'common treatment', 'crouch gait', 'design', 'economic impact', 'effective therapy', 'improved', 'response', 'simulation', 'sound', 'success', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'treatment planning']",NICHD,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2009,390557,0.011365873647857499
"Early Detection of Keratoconus    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Keratoconus is the most common degenerative disease affecting the cornea. This condition tends to develop around puberty and to progress over the next few decades, but its clinical history can be quite variable. As keratoconus develops, the cornea thins and bulges. Eventually, a corneal transplant may be needed to maintain vision. In its earliest stages, the disease is particularly difficult to detect, even using state-of-the-art diagnostic techniques such as anterior/posterior surface topography. This is of great importance to the corneal refractive surgeon because surgical treatment of an occult keratoconic cornea will weaken it and greatly accelerate the occurrence of symptoms. Because of the difficulty in differentiating early keratoconus from atypical normal corneas, many normal eyes deemed 'suspicious' are denied treatment. At the same time, some keratoconic eyes are missed and operated upon, with disastrous consequences. Early detection of keratoconus may also benefit patients because of the recent development of methods for strengthening the corneal stroma and preventing disease progression. We have developed a technique based on the use of high resolution ultrasound for imaging the cornea and measuring the thickness of its component layers, including the epithelium (about 50 microns in thickness) and the stroma (about 500 microns in thickness). We have shown that the epithelium, which is the surface layer of the cornea, will remodel itself to smooth out underlying irregularities. In early keratoconus, as the anterior stromal surface begins to bulge forward, the epithelium will thin above the apex of the bulge and thicken around it, to maintain a smooth anterior surface. This compensatory mechanism prevents anterior surface topography from detecting keratoconus in its early stages. We have also developed methods for characterizing the elastic properties of the cornea by inducing and measuring surface displacements in response to a pulse of acoustic radiation force. We will further develop and test this technique and apply it clinically in conjunction with the Ocular Response Analyzer, an instrument that causes a similar effect by use of an air pressure pulse. This proposal will involve analysis of topographic and pachymetric patterns and elastic properties in normal, keratoconus and keratoconus-suspicious eyes. We will develop an index based on multivariate analysis of these patterns based on unambiguously classified cases, and validate the risk index on suspicious cases based on clinical documentation of disease progression. Our goal is to reduce the percentage of screened cases deemed keratoconus- suspicious by at least a factor of two by allowing an unambiguous diagnosis of early keratoconus. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Keratoconus (KC) is a corneal dystrophy will in many cases ultimately require corneal transplantation to maintain vision. Early detection, which is not possible with current technology, would allow early treatment and prevent sever damage to KC corneas inadvertently operated upon for correction of vision. Our aim is to combine measurements of corneal elasticity, topography and epithelial thickness to develop means for early detection of KC.           PROJECT NARRATIVE Keratoconus (KC) is a corneal dystrophy will in many cases ultimately require corneal transplantation to maintain vision.

"A web hospital comparison tool for patients considering kidney transplantation an    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal addresses the need for objective hospital quality ranking tools that are relevant to patients' experiences and customizable to their individual conditions. This need is created by market changes where patients are increasingly being made aware of differences in quality between providers who will improve their odds at success. Medicare, state governments, insurers and several private companies offer information on hospital quality and cost across many conditions and incorporating a variety of data, process and outcomes quality indicators. However, according to investors, bankers, industry analysts and entrepreneurs, comparison tools are still at an embryonic stage. They suffer from limited specificity, low resolution, conflicts of interest and misfit in the patient information finding process. This leads to patient confusion and perceptions that information is meaningless for decision making. PickCare (tm) is a hospital comparison tool that will address gaps that exist in current hospital ranking systems using advanced statistical and econometric models that have never been applied in this space. In phase 1 we developed Pickcare v2.0 in kidney transplantation and showed that: 1) these models improve specificity through customization to patient factors that our analysis unearths are most important; 2) our models improve resolution by using an expanded history of risk factors; 3) the user interface tested with patients/ family communicates the system's improved resolution as differences across hospitals that patients can understand, and its specificity as a message of hope and alternatives. In phase 2 we will expand to Pickcare v3.0 to 1) accommodate user feedback from phase 1, 2) scale to accommodate more treatments beginning with dialysis and 3) further imbed the system in patients' information finding process. The deliverable of Phase 2 will be version 3 of Pickcare to be released on-line for kidney transplantation and tested internally with recruited patients for dialysis. A manuscript describing how the system influences patient choice in kidney transplantation based on analysis of on-line user data will also be submitted for publication.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposal addresses the need for user-friendly web-based tools to help patients and their families choose between hospitals based on the quality of care they will receive. The tool is unique in that it is customized to patient conditions, it has high resolution to separate excellent, average and poor hospitals, it addresses patients' motivations to search for hospital information and builds trust by answering their questions independently of insurers or hospitals.           This proposal addresses the need for user-friendly web-based tools to help patients and their families choose between hospitals based on the quality of care they will receive.

"Novel Machine Learning Methods for Analysis of MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common cancer worldwide with as many as 500,000 new cases each year. Between 1981 to 1998, the 5-year patient survival rate with HCC only rose from 2% to 5%. This poor survival rate is in part related to the diagnosis of HCC at advanced stages, where effective therapies are lacking. Early detection of HCC improves patient survival. Patients with cirrhosis are typically the ones to develop HCC. Hence, monitoring cirrhotic patients can potentially decrease the cancer-related mortality rate. The poor sensitivity and specificity of currently available tools has prevented widespread implementation of HCC surveillance. Therefore, additional serum markers that provide higher sensitivity and specificity are needed to improve the detection rate of early HCC. The goal of this collaborative project is to identify a panel of serum biomarkers for early diagnosis of HCC. The long-term goal is to find and validate markers that would help identify HCC at a treatable stage in high-risk population of cirrhotic patients. This project will lead to the development of innovative mass spectral data preprocessing and biomarker selection methods that for the identification of candidate biomarkers specific to HCC by using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (MS) of low-molecular-weight (LMW) enriched sera. The specific aims of the project are the following: Aim 1: To develop algorithms for improved MALDI-TOF mass spectral data preprocessing including outlier screening, binning, smoothing, baseline correction, normalization, peak detection, and peak calibration. The proposed algorithms will enable us to reduce run-to-run variability in replicate spectra of a standard serum and to enhance the prediction accuracy in distinguishing HCC patients from cirrhotic patients or healthy individuals. Aim 2: To develop a novel algorithm that is superior to currently used biomarker selection methods by combining two popular machine learning methods, particle swarm optimization (PSO) and support vector machines (SVMs). The proposed algorithm will be used to identify HCC-specific markers from the preprocessed MALDI-TOF spectra. To avoid confounding effects, peaks will be removed prior to biomarker selection if they are associated with viral infection or covariates such as age, gender, smoking status, drinking status, and residency (urban or rural). From the remaining peaks, a small set of candidate biomarkers that accurately distinguishes HCC patients from cirrhotic patients will be identified. The capability of the algorithm to identify a small set of markers with high sensitivity and specificity is critical for establishment of clinical tests. Additionally, the algorithm will identify markers that distinguish various pairs (normal vs. cirrhosis, normal vs. HCC, cirrhosis vs. early-stage HCC, and cirrhosis vs. late-stage HCC). This will enable us to isolate HCC- specific markers and identify disease progression markers. Furthermore, the peptides represented by the selected candidate biomarkers will be identified.

"AUTOMATIC QUANTITATIVE CT IMAGING OF PERICARDIAL FAT: A NOVEL ISCHEMIA PREDICTOR    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Every year, 1 million people in the US will experience a heart attack or sudden cardiac death. A large percentage of these patients have no prior symptoms of any kind but suffer from silent heart disease (ischemia), which may cause a heart attack at any time. Currently there is no reliable screening method to identify people who may have silent heart disease and therefore are at risk of ""heart attack"".       We seek to extract additional data from a non-invasive Computed Tomography (CT) scan of the heart (commonly used in most imaging centers), which will better identify patients who are ""vulnerable"" to sudden heart attack. These images are acquired without contrast agents, as a common screening test for measuring coronary calcium, another clinical marker of coronary artery disease. We will prove that additional information about cardiovascular risk can be obtained by quantifying pericardial fat surrounding the heart in these cardiac CT images. Although this information exists in the cardiac CT scans acquired today, it is ignored in clinical practice because currently there are no tools to measure it automatically and reliably, and no information regarding its significance for a given patient.       We will develop fully automated, accurate, new computer software for quantitation of pericardial fat from cardiac CT images acquired for routine assessment of coronary calcium. We plan to achieve complete automation and accuracy, by applying a combination of robust and effective algorithms in machine learning with anatomical knowledge. We aim to prove that the developed automatic software will be as accurate, and more reproducible than experienced imaging physicians in quantifying pericardial fat, and will accomplish the measurement in a fraction of the time. Such software could be immediately made available worldwide to standard imaging workstations. For the first time, this will allow its use as a standard practical imaging tool for cardiovascular risk assessment, without requiring additional time, imaging or radiation risk to the patient.       We will also show that this new quantitative information has important additional value compared to other clinical cardiovascular risk factors and information from blood samples (such as cholesterol, glucose and CRP), and the amount of calcium in the patient's coronary arteries seen on CT scans, and establish its significance in the prediction of silent heart disease.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This new research will allow accurate prediction of who might be more likely to have heart disease which may ultimately cause a heart attack.

"Dysbiosis in Inflammatory Bowel Disease    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBDs), namely ulcerative colitis (DC) and Crohn's disease (CD), are chronic, lifelong, relapsing illnesses, affecting close to 1 million Americans. Despite the many clues that a dysbiosis may exist in IBD, the specific changes in the microflora of IBD patients are largely unknown. Amplicon length heterogeneity (ALH) is a sophisticated and well established PCR based technology that can be used as a screening tool to identify changes in the Bacterial microflora of IBD patients. We therefore have hypothesized that the ileocolonic microflora in IBD has an altered microbial composition compared to normal microflora. We have gathered preliminary data that shows statistical differences between controls and IBD as well as within IBD patients. Therefore, to test the above hypothesis, we are proposing the following 2 inter-related scientific aims: AIM 1. Identify bacterial fingerprint patterns associated with IBD using ALH. ALH patterns will be determined in a total of 160 IBD patients and health controls and will be analyzed using diversity indeces, multivariate reduction analysis and cluster analysis. ALH patterns associated with IBD will be determined using histograms, ecological software in conjunction with custom PERL scripts as well as supervised and unsupervised automated pattern recognition systems. AIM 2.Determine the bacterial contents of putatively IBD associated ALH fingerprint patterns using molecular cloning and sequencing.

ALH may enable a real-time survey of microfloral changes for the first time in medicine and may provide the first evidence linking IBD with specific microbial patterns.           n/a",Dysbiosis in Inflammatory Bowel Disease,7197734,R21DK071838,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Attention', 'Back', 'Bacteria', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biopsy Specimen', 'Bispecific Antibody 2B1', 'Celiac Disease', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cloning', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Colon', 'Colonoscopy', 'Colorectal', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Crohn&apos', 's disease', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Distal part of ileum', 'Effectiveness', 'Environment', 'Environmental Microbiology', 'Feces', 'Fingerprint', 'Flare', 'Flexible fiberoptic sigmoidoscopy', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Genus Cola', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Human body', 'Immunosuppressive Agents', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Intestines', 'Irritable Bowel Syndrome', 'Knowledge', 'Length', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Cloning', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mucous Membrane', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Numbers', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ', 'Organism', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Pattern Recognition Systems', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Population', 'Probiotics', 'Procedures', 'Race', 'Reaction', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Relapse', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research Personnel', 'Ribosomal RNA', 'Sampling', 'Schedule', 'Screening procedure', 'Soil', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Ulcerative Colitis', 'Visual', 'base', 'carcinogenesis', 'clinical application', 'computerized', 'cost', 'data mining', 'disabling disease', 'ileum', 'indexing', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'neglect', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'pathogen', 'prebiotics', 'programs', 'satisfaction', 'success', 'time use', 'tool', 'treatment effect']",NIDDK,RUSH UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R21,2007,222000,0.003925182002071264
"Mini Bone-Attached Robot for Joint Arthroplasty DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Medical robotics has the potential to revolutionize how surgical procedures on bony anatomy are performed. It can assist surgeons by preparing bones much more accurately than mechanical guides or freehand cutting. It can help improve patient outcomes by decreasing surgical errors. In the orthopaedics community, though, medical robots have not been very successful due to a variety of issues ranging from robot size, to surgical time, and soft-tissue difficulties. We propose to overcome these difficulties by utilizing a miniature robotic milling device that attaches directly to the bone.      Realizing the potential of minimally invasive procedures, the implant industry is currently in the process of redesigning implants and, together with surgeons, reexamining surgical procedures. It can be expected that the next generation of implants will be smaller and more suitable for eventual development of less invasive procedures. One example of such procedures in knee arthroplasty is patellofemoral resurfacing of the knee. Without lose of generality we will examine the capability of the robot in improving the accuracy of the femoral-component preparation for patellofemoral arthroscopy. From engineering point of this procedure simulates the future generation of orthopaedic arthroplasty where there will be a need to machine bone surface into a more complex shape that is not planar or spherical but complex surfaces. Therefore, the technology demonstrated by this research, though, will not be specific to the patellofemoral procedure, and will be adaptable to many other areas.      We propose to develop a miniature robot that will be rigidly affixed directly to the bone. The robot itself will scan the shape of the femur directly, removing any need for preoperative imaging or intraoperative registration and tracking of the bone. With the additional input of the direction of patellar tracking, we will automatically optimize the planned position of the implant to ensure that it is properly aligned and congruent with the surrounding healthy cartilage. Congruency is a requirement for this procedure to make certain that the patellar component does not impinge on the edge of the femoral component and lead to early failure of the implant. The robot will then mill out the cavity to within 1mm of the planned location, guaranteeing complete coverage of the area with a defined surface uniformity.      By validating the results generated with the proposed robot, first on wax blocks and then plastic bone phantoms, porcine bones, and finally on cadaver knees, we will show that the robot can deliver the accuracy required to precisely place the implant. This precise placement of the femoral component should reduce the possibility of impingement, patellar maltracking, and component loosening, and improve patient outcomes. n/a",Mini Bone-Attached Robot for Joint Arthroplasty,7117290,R01AR052700,"['arthroplasty', 'artificial intelligence', 'bioengineering /biomedical engineering', 'bioimaging /biomedical imaging', 'biomedical equipment development', 'clinical biomedical equipment', 'computer assisted patient care', 'computer simulation', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'femur', 'hip prosthesis', 'image guided surgery /therapy', 'joint prosthesis', 'knee', 'medical implant science', 'miniature biomedical equipment', 'phantom model', 'postmortem', 'robotics']",NIAMS,WESTERN PENNSYLVANIA HOSPITAL,R01,2006,140714,-0.0006212609107190169

"GeneRx - colorectal cancer recurrence prediction    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal cancer is the second most common cause of cancer death. Patients with less-advanced disease (stages l-lll) are either observed only or treated with adjuvant therapy to reduce the chance of recurrence after surgery. Currently, the decision to recommend adjuvant therapy is based almost entirely on conventional clinic pathological data. Most stage III patients are recommended to receive a fluorouracil based chemotherapy, whereas most stage l-ll patients are not. However, limitations in the prognostic power of the clinic pathological data alone likely leads to the unnecessary treatment of stage III patients who do not need it and the lost opportunity for treatment of stage II (and, potentially, stage I) patients that would benefit.  In addition, a significant percentage of stage II patients opt to receive chemotherapy despite the marginal evidence of benefit. An accurate prognostic test would help guide patients with high-risk disease to choose chemotherapy and improve the quality of life of low-risk patients by sparing them from the side effects. This proposal describes the innovative usage of multiple machine learning methodologies as part of a   comprehensive nonlinear model approach to predicting colorectal cancer recurrence based on a combination of standard clinic pathological data and data from multiple, carefully selected molecular markers. The ultimate product will consist of a panel of assays for the relevant molecular markers and the associated prognostic algorithm that predicts recurrence. Colorectal cancer patients and their oncologists will be able to use the results to guide their treatment decisions, resulting in positive impacts on life expectancy and quality of life.                  n/a",GeneRx - colorectal cancer recurrence prediction,6992244,R43CA117001,[' '],NCI,"PREDICTION SCIENCES, LLC",R43,2005,100000,-0.028986229498075965
"Multiparametric Computational Echocardiography DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    In the United States, myocardial ischemia is the underlying etiology in nearly 70% of the 5 million patients suffering from mechanical failure of the cardiac left ventricle (LV). Echocardiography (echo) is well suited for the analysis of LV function, however, the problem of conveying this clinically important information in a quantitative, objective, and reproducible manner persists.      To address this problem and respond to the NIH PA-00-117 solicitation for innovations in biomedical information science and technology, the long-term goal of the proposed R21/R33 project is to develop methods for 1) quantitative and objective measurement of LV function, 2) reproducible diagnostic interpretation based on these measurements, and 3) standardized topologic mapping and parametric display of the results. We defined 3 parameters of LV function: 1) rate of local deformation (strain rate), 2) amplitude of deformation (strain), and 3) time interval to the transition (crossover) point of cyclic deformation.      The practical implementation of the long-term objectives will be achieved through the development of a Multiparametric Computational Echo (MPCE) system. The main hypothesis of this R21/R33 project is that the MPCE system will a) precisely and accurately quantitate (R21 phase) and b) reproducibly clinically interpret (R33 phase) segmental LV function. This hypothesis will be tested on digital echo data from animal models and clinical cases of myocardial ischemia representing a wide range of segmental LV dysfunction.      Specific Aims (R21 phase):   Aim 1 - Develop algorithms for parametric analysis of local ventricular function (Year 1).   Aim 2 - Test precision and accuracy of local LV functional analysis using MPCE (Year 2).   Satisfaction of the predefined milestones will initiate the commencement of the R33 phase.

"Sedation Management in Pediatric Patients supported on * DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this two-year project is to pilot test an intervention to change sedation management in pediatric patients supported on mechanical ventilation for acute respiratory failure in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). While ensuring patient comfort is an integral part of pediatric critical care, analgesic and sedative use in this patient population can be associated with iatrogenic injury; specifically, comfort medications may depress spontaneous ventilation and prolong the duration of weaning from mechanical ventilation. Additionally, drug tolerance develops over time and may precipitate iatrogenic abstinence syndrome when the patient no longer requires sedation. Alternatively, suboptimal comfort management contributes to ventilator dysynchrony and unplanned endotracheal extubation. Our group has developed and validated a nurse-implemented sedation algorithm to guide titration of comfort medications that may optimize patient comfort and reduce the risk of under-medication, but this algorithm needs to be evaluated further. We will pilot test the sedation algorithm in a randomized controlled clinical trial of two matched pediatric intensive care units in two different hospitals. One hospital will be randomized to their usual standard practices for managing sedation, while the other will receive (a) multidisciplinary team education and consensus building, (b) multidisciplinary team identification of the patient's trajectory of illness and daily prescription of a sedation goal, (c) a nurse-implemented sedation algorithm to guide titration of comfort medications, and (d) team feedback on clinical performance.      We hypothesize that pediatric patients managed per sedation protocol will experience fewer days of mechanical ventilation than patients receiving usual care. Secondary outcomes include time to recovery from acute lung injury, duration of weaning from mechanical ventilation, occurrence of adverse events, total exposure to comfort medications, occurrence of iatrogenic opioid and benzodiazepine withdrawal symptoms, PICU length of stay, barriers to successful implementation of the intervention and PICU costs.    The overall objective of this study is to develop an intervention that can be implemented in any PICU that will provide comfort to intubated and mechanically ventilated infants and children that will not cause them harm.

"Optical Detection of Intravenous Infiltration  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): About 80% of hospital patients in the United States require IV therapy and 50% of IV lines fail due to infiltration, a clot in the cannula, an inflammatory response of the vein, or separation of the cannula from the vein. IV infiltration is usually accompanied by pain, erythema, and swelling at the cannula tip or the insertion site. Severe infiltration may lead to necrosis requiring skin debridement, skin grafting, or amputation. Early detection of infiltration prevents the occurrence of serious incidents that may require surgical correction. The long-term objective of this project is to develop an infiltration sensor for monitoring IV failures. The Phase II research design includes the development of an advanced prototype, improvement of algorithms, evaluation of the prototype on animal models and human measurements, investigation of its accuracy and utility, and the examination of the commercial potential. The innovation of this project lies in the use of an optical method coupled with the advanced development in fiber optics and algorithms for tissue optics to provide a means for noninvasive monitoring of the IV sites.

"AUTOMATED MINIMAL RESIDUAL DISEASE QUANTIFICATION Quantification of Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) is a general concern in oncology since this parameter is likely to give valuable information to clinicians to customize chemotherapeutic treatments and to anticipate possible relapses. An automated system will be developed for the quantification of MRD by using real-time PCR to quantify cancer cells in a background of non pathologic DNA. The system will be derived from an existing high-throughput sample handling system (developed by Meldrum and team) named Acapella. Acapella has a pipelined serial architecture which makes it possible to develop an adaptive PCR control algorithm ensuring a level of sensitivity and accuracy for the quantification results specified by the clinician. In the R21 phase of the project, a critical component of the system is the real-time thermocycler. It will provide DNA quantification results of greater precision than what is currently possible with commercial instruments such as the ABI PRISM 7700 Sequence Detector by taking advantage of a high performance custom fluorescence analyzer and sophisticated data analysis methods. The fluorescence analyzer will have a signal to noise ratio and a dynamic range of at least one order of magnitude larger than the optics used on commercial systems. This unique feature will permit precise measurements of the amplification kinetics during at least five cycles in the exponential phase of the reaction. The amplification yield will he derived from these data using statistical estimators customized to meet the requirements of real-time PCR data analysis. The sample DNA content will be derived from the amplification yield and the calibrated fluorescence measurements of the reaction kinetics. This new approach will make it possible to run series of real-time PCRs with more flexibility than would be possible if the assay was based on standard reactions required to have the same amplification yield as the clinical samples. PCR conditions will be adapted online without concerns about possible differences of amplification rate. The assay control algorithm will adapt the reaction DNA content, the primer selection, and the number of PCRs to meet the clinician requirements for particular patient DNA. During the R21 phase of the project a prototype of the real-time thermocycler will be developed to demonstrate the optic performance and the possibility to estimate the PCR amplification rates with 5% accuracy. A conceptual design of the fully integrated process from patient blood sample to MRD quantification data will be completed to allow assessment of expected performance, cost, and risks associated with the development of the fully engineered system. The development of the various hardware and software components along with their integration into the automated system will take place during the R33 phase of the project. Performance of the system will he evaluated on real biological samples provided by the UW Department of Laboratory Medicine.

"Predicting life-threatening events in CHIME infant data  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is the sudden death of an infant under one year old without any apparent warning signs.  It is the leading cause of death of infants between the age of one month and one year in the developed countries. Previous studies have indicated that SIDS victims may suffer from cardiorespiratory failure, which reflects immaturity of autonomic nervous system (ANS) control. Heart variability (HRV) has been shown to be a noninvasive and inexpensive way to assess the ANS. Increased heart rate and decreased heart rate variability have been observed in SIDS victims. While it is unclear whether there is a relationship between SIDS and infants who have apparent life-threatening events (ALTE) like apnea and bradycardia, there is a desire to gain a better understanding of the nature of ALTE, their frequency and severity, and the ability of home monitors to detect events and provide an alarm. The Collaborative Home Infant Monitoring Evaluation (CHIME) study group, formed by NIH, sought to study these issues through the collection of a massive clinical database, which includes physiological, signals from 529 infants recorded in polysomnographic (PSG) studies. The infants were then studied several months using a home monitor which recorded life-threatening events. A classification is available regarding which infants had verified, apparent life-threatening events. Given the wealth of information linking SIDS and heart rate variability (HRV), we desire to investigate whether heart rate variability is effective predictor for life-threatening events. This research will investigate whether HRV can differentiate infants at risk for future apparent life-threatening events (FALTE). First statistical methods will be used to determine if there is significant difference in HRV between normal and FALTE infant groups. Next, the major goal is to design a method to classify infants using HRV, exploring various prediction models including logistic regression, decision tree, and neural networks. The relationship between HRV parameters and all the affected factors will also be studied to provide a clearer understanding of the parameters, and to help determine how to use HRV as a classifier. Successful prediction of infants with future apparent life-threatening events could have clinical significance and provide physicians with an opportunity for treatment.   n/a",Predicting life-threatening events in CHIME infant data,6619652,R03HD042479,"['apnea', ' autonomic nervous system', ' bradycardia', ' clinical research', ' disease /disorder proneness /risk', ' heart rate', ' human data', ' infant human (0-1 year)', ' mathematical model', ' model design /development', ' patient monitoring device', ' polysomnography', ' statistics /biometry', ' sudden infant death syndrome']",NICHD,CLARKSON UNIVERSITY,R03,2003,78500,0.007450157879961884
"Long Term Glucose Sensing & Physiologic Insulin Delivery    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Approximately 4 million individuals with Type 1 diabetes are treated with insulin in the U.S. individual with diabetes are constantly challenged to measure their blood glucose and administer the appropriate insulin dose to achieve tight glucose control. Tight glucose control, achievable with intensive insulin therapy, dramatically reduces secondary complication of diabetes, but requires frequent painful blood samples and increases the risk of hypoglycemia. Thus, individuals with the disease have long awaited an automatic closed-loop system that would control their glucose without the need for constant intervention. In the present proposal, two closed-loop systems to achieve this goal are developed. Both systems use a long-term fully implantable glucose sensor. One of the systems links the sensor to a fully implantable intraperitoneal insulin pump; the second links the sensor to an external insulin delivery pump. It is anticipated that some patients may require the implantable pump and that others will want to have the option of which pump to use. The systems have a common goal - to emulate, as closely as possible; glucose control achieved in a healthy individual. To achieve this goal, a physiology-insulin-delivery algorithm is proposed that emulates B-cell responses to glucose observed in individuals with normal glucose tolerance. The B-cell response is optimally adjusted to overcome delays associated with intraperitoneal (fully implanted pump) or subcutaneous (external pump) insulin delivery. Digital filters are developed to optimally remove noise in the sensor signal. A method of tuning the system, consistent with the level of glucose tolerance achieved by the B-cell is developed. Performance and safety of each system is evaluated. If successful, the systems can be expected to revolutionize the treatment of diabetes by dramatically reducing the burden placed on individuals with type 1 diabetes, and by reducing the costs of treating hypoglycemia and secondary complications.         n/a",Long Term Glucose Sensing & Physiologic Insulin Delivery,6588873,R01DK064567,"['artificial endocrine pancreas', ' artificial intelligence', ' biomedical equipment development', ' biosensor device', ' clinical research', ' dogs', ' human subject', ' implant', ' insulin', ' insulin dependent diabetes mellitus', ' pancreatic islets']",NIDDK,MEDTRONIC MINIMED,R01,2002,664917,-0.01276067982498659

The Phase II research design includes the development of an advanced prototype, improvement of algorithms, evaluation of the prototype on animal models and human measurements, investigation of its accuracy and utility, and the examination of the commercial potential. The innovation of this project lies in the use of an optical method coupled with the advanced development in fiber optics and algorithms for tissue optics to provide a means for noninvasive monitoring of the IV sites. It will provide routine, automated, continuous, and real-time monitoring capabilities for patients undergoing IV therapy.   n/a",Optical Detection of Intravenous Infiltration,6550261,R44HL062008,"['artificial intelligence', ' blood coagulation', ' clinical research', ' diagnosis design /evaluation', ' fiber optics', ' human subject', ' intravenous administration', ' medical complication', ' necrosis', ' optics', ' patient monitoring device', ' swine', ' technology /technique development']",NHLBI,"CW OPTICS, INC.",R44,2002,250708,-0.020754021918243368
"Foot Pressure and Shear Data Visualization System DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Foot ulceration is a diabetic complication that results in over $1 billion worth of medical expenses per year in the United States alone. To better quantify the external forces involved in ulceration, researchers are developing new hardware systems that can measure both shear stress and vertical pressure. As these systems are commercialized, visualization software will be required for display and analysis of the 3-D stresses acting on the plantar surface. The proposed research will develop an advanced foot pressure and shear data visualization system, based on the innovative use of a deformed 2-D wire mesh to indicate stress, combined with more traditional vertical elevations and color-coding to indicate pressure. This new software will be adaptable to a variety of measurement systems, and will allow a clinician to see an accurate, 3-D representation of the maximum pressure and shear locations on the plantar surface. Also, novel analysis algorithms will be developed to identify areas where skin pressure and stress patterns (e.g., bunching, shearing, or stretching) are most likely to cause pathological consequences. Availability of this advanced software, in combination with new pressure/shear hardware measurement systems, will greatly improve the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of foot ulcers in diabetic patients.  PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: According to the American Diabetes Association, there are approximately 16 million patients in the United States with diabetes, with 800,000 new diagnoses each year.  For these patients, foot complications account for more hospitalizations than any other clinical problem, and plantar ulcerations are a major reason for subsequent foot amputation.   The proposed research will lead to a new commercial software product aimed primarily at the prevention and treatment of diabetic foot ulcers.   In addition, product applications can be extended to the estimated 1 million patients per year who develop pressure ulcer bedsores, as well as to prosthetic limb patients who are at risk of skin breakdown due to peripheral vascular disease. n/a",Foot Pressure and Shear Data Visualization System,6443499,R43DK061164,"['artificial intelligence', ' biomechanics', ' biomedical equipment development', ' clinical research', ' computer data analysis', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' decubitus ulcer', ' foot', ' mechanical pressure', ' mechanical stress', ' monitoring device']",NIDDK,"FOSTER-MILLER, INC.",R43,2002,119415,0.00927444112820495
"AUTOMATED MINIMAL RESIDUAL DISEASE QUANTIFICATION Quantification of Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) is a general concern in oncology since this parameter is likely to give valuable information to clinicians to customize chemotherapeutic treatments and to anticipate possible relapses. An automated system will be developed for the quantification of MRD by using real-time PCR to quantify cancer cells in a background of non pathologic DNA. The system will be derived from an existing high-throughput sample handling system (developed by Meldrum and team) named Acapella. Acapella has a pipelined serial architecture which makes it possible to develop an adaptive PCR control algorithm ensuring a level of sensitivity and accuracy for the quantification results specified by the clinician. In the R21 phase of the project, a critical component of the system is the real-time thermocycler. It will provide DNA quantification results of greater precision than what is currently possible with commercial instruments such as the ABI PRISM 7700 Sequence Detector by taking advantage of a high performance custom fluorescence analyzer and sophisticated data analysis methods. The fluorescence analyzer will have a signal to noise ratio and a dynamic range of at least one order of magnitude larger than the optics used on commercial systems. This unique feature will permit precise measurements of the amplification kinetics during at least five cycles in the exponential phase of the reaction. The amplification yield will he derived from these data using statistical estimators customized to meet the requirements of real-time PCR data analysis. The sample DNA content will be derived from the amplification yield and the calibrated fluorescence measurements of the reaction kinetics. This new approach will make it possible to run series of real-time PCRs with more flexibility than would be possible if the assay was based on standard reactions required to have the same amplification yield as the clinical samples. PCR conditions will be adapted online without concerns about possible differences of amplification rate. The assay control algorithm will adapt the reaction DNA content, the primer selection, and the number of PCRs to meet the clinician requirements for particular patient DNA. During the R21 phase of the project a prototype of the real-time thermocycler will be developed to demonstrate the optic performance and the possibility to estimate the PCR amplification rates with 5% accuracy. A conceptual design of the fully integrated process from patient blood sample to MRD quantification data will be completed to allow assessment of expected performance, cost, and risks associated with the development of the fully engineered system. The development of the various hardware and software components along with their integration into the automated system will take place during the R33 phase of the project. Performance of the system will he evaluated on real biological samples provided by the UW Department of Laboratory Medicine.

"Predicting life-threatening events in CHIME infant data  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is the sudden death of an infant under one year old without any apparent warning signs.  It is the leading cause of death of infants between the age of one month and one year in the developed countries. Previous studies have indicated that SIDS victims may suffer from cardiorespiratory failure, which reflects immaturity of autonomic nervous system (ANS) control. Heart variability (HRV) has been shown to be a noninvasive and inexpensive way to assess the ANS. Increased heart rate and decreased heart rate variability have been observed in SIDS victims. While it is unclear whether there is a relationship between SIDS and infants who have apparent life-threatening events (ALTE) like apnea and bradycardia, there is a desire to gain a better understanding of the nature of ALTE, their frequency and severity, and the ability of home monitors to detect events and provide an alarm. The Collaborative Home Infant Monitoring Evaluation (CHIME) study group, formed by NIH, sought to study these issues through the collection of a massive clinical database, which includes physiological, signals from 529 infants recorded in polysomnographic (PSG) studies. The infants were then studied several months using a home monitor which recorded life-threatening events. A classification is available regarding which infants had verified, apparent life-threatening events. Given the wealth of information linking SIDS and heart rate variability (HRV), we desire to investigate whether heart rate variability is effective predictor for life-threatening events. This research will investigate whether HRV can differentiate infants at risk for future apparent life-threatening events (FALTE). First statistical methods will be used to determine if there is significant difference in HRV between normal and FALTE infant groups. Next, the major goal is to design a method to classify infants using HRV, exploring various prediction models including logistic regression, decision tree, and neural networks. The relationship between HRV parameters and all the affected factors will also be studied to provide a clearer understanding of the parameters, and to help determine how to use HRV as a classifier. Successful prediction of infants with future apparent life-threatening events could have clinical significance and provide physicians with an opportunity for treatment.   n/a",Predicting life-threatening events in CHIME infant data,6607543,R03HD042479,"['apnea', ' autonomic nervous system', ' bradycardia', ' clinical research', ' disease /disorder proneness /risk', ' heart rate', ' human data', ' infant human (0-1 year)', ' mathematical model', ' model design /development', ' patient monitoring device', ' polysomnography', ' statistics /biometry', ' sudden infant death syndrome']",NICHD,CLARKSON UNIVERSITY,R03,2002,78500,0.007450157879961884
"HEART RATE RECOVERY AND MORTALITY  Although there has been considerable attention paid to the                                                                               prognostic significance of the heart rate rise during exercise, only recently        has it been noted that the heart rate fall after exercise, or ""heart-rate            recovery,"" may be an even more powerful predictor of outcome. Heart-rate             recovery after exercise is a consequence of central reactivation of vagal tone.      As impaired parasympathetic function has been associated with increased risk of      death, our hypothesis is that an impaired heart-rate recovery is a powerful and      independent predictor of mortality. Our group recently published the first           report linking heart-rate recovery to long-term mortality in the New England         Journal of Medicine. The proposed project will extend upon that report by            determining the optimal definition of heart-rate recovery, by showing that an        abnormal heart-rate recovery is an independent predictor of mortality in             diverse patient groups, and by developing accurate survival models that              incorporate heart-rate recovery. The overall aim of this project is to use           heart-rate recovery to substantially improve the prognostic value of the             exercise test. The specific aims of this project are: 1) Derive biologically         meaningful mathematical models of heart-rate recovery. Data from over 20,000         patients who have undergone exercise testing at Cleveland Clinic Foundation          between 1990 and 1998 will be used; all of these patients had their tests            performed on exercise workstations which recorded heart rates every 10 seconds       during and after exercise. Heart-rate recovery measures will be the difference       between heart rate at peak exercise and heart rate at different points during        recovery. Modeling will be based on exponential families, using stepwise             selection, bootstrapping, and information theory approaches. Correlates of           different patterns of heart rate recovery will be determined. 2) Using the           results of modeling of heart-recovery derived from the work in Specific Aim 1,       determine a prognostically defined optimal definition of abnormal heart rate         recovery and demonstrate that an abnormal heart rate recovery is a powerful and      independent predictor of mortality in diverse patient groups. Data from              exercise tolerance tests of over 40,000 patients studied at the Cleveland            Clinic Foundation between 1990 and 1999 will be analyzed. Statistical methods        to be used will include the nonparametric Kaplan-Meier product limit method and      the Cox proportional hazards model with bootstrap validation, which will             include use of the random forest technique. 3) Using completely parametric           techniques. develop predictive survival models in which heart-rate recovery is       included along with clinical data and other exercise findings, including             exercise capacity and heart rate changes during exercise. The advantages of the      parametric technique include: a) it allows for modeling of nonproportional           hazards that may permit differential strength of effect at different follow-up       times for different sets of risk factors; b) it generates absolute risk, not         just relative risk; and c) it permits patient-specific prediction. All the data      needed for this project are already electronically available; that fact, along       with the work already done, lends confidence to the feasibility of this              project.                                                                                                                                                                  n/a",HEART RATE RECOVERY AND MORTALITY,6530749,R01HL066004,"['cardiovascular stress test', ' clinical research', ' diagnosis design /evaluation', ' disease /disorder proneness /risk', ' exercise', ' heart function', ' heart rate', ' human data', ' human mortality', ' information theory', ' long term survivor', ' mathematical model', ' model design /development', ' parasympathetic nervous system', ' prognosis', ' statistics /biometry', ' vagus nerve']",NHLBI,CLEVELAND CLINIC FOUNDATION,R01,2002,222000,-0.012692371977904205
"NONINVASIVE ASSESSMENT OF ATRIAL FIBRILLATION Atrial arrhythmias are extremely common and are often associated with            significant morbidity and mortality. The ability to develop and                  prescribe new treatments for atrial arrhythmias depends on the                   availability of better diagnostic tools that are simple, inexpensive,            and effective enough to support their use for screening large numbers            of patients.

"MODEL BASED INTERPRETATION OF INTRACARDIAC ELECTROGRAMS Catheter ablation is a medical procedure that involves the destruction of        small volumes of heart tissue with radiofrequency energy.  To be                 successful, catheter ablation requires precise localization of the tissue        to be destroyed. To accomplish this in a typical ablation procedure, five        catheters containing a total of 19 electrode pairs are utilized to record        potentials (called electrograms) from spatially distinct locations within        the heart throughout the cardiac cycle. Experienced cardiologists                interpret the electrograms to locate the conduction pathways responsible         for the arrhythmia. The pathways are destroyed by applications of                radiofrequency energy, thus treating the arrhythmia.                                                                                                              Ablation procedures are performed by highly trained and experienced              cardiology sub-specialists yet the massive amount of data produced during        these procedures creates a data overload problem that can impede the             performance of even the best practitioners. This may be evidenced by (1)         overlooking important signal features, (2) misinterpreting the signals,          and (3) misinterpreting catheter locations in the heart, all of which may        lead to increased procedure duration and/or applications of radiofrequency       energy to the wrong part of the heart.                                                                                                                            The purpose of this project is to develop a model-based system for               interpreting intracardiac electrograms in near real-time. The system is          intended to assist physicians in ""making sense"" of the enormous amounts of       data recorded during a cardiac electrophysiology study. New computer             algorithms for reasoning about the time- and space-varying nature of             intracardiac electrograms from underlying causal models of the heart will        be developed. The models can be represented as a graph of nodes connected        by arcs. The nodes represent specific an atomic regions of the heart while       the arcs represent the connections between the regions.                                                                                                           The analytic approach will be a variation of the hypothesize-and-test            paradigm. The control loop will be based on the ""tracking"" concept whereby       models will be tracked as long as the data supports the model. Rule-based        knowledge will be utilized to generate models based on the observed data.        The output of the system will be a series of ladder diagrams describing          the data. In the event that the data admits more than a single explanatory       model, ladder diagrams will be generated for all created models.                                                                                                  This proposal is an extension of the applicant's graduate and post-              doctoral project, which used the same approach to the simpler domain of          the interpretation of the body-surface electrocardiogram. The domain of          this proposal is more complex because it adds reasoning with a more              detailed three dimensional cardiac model to the temporal reasoning               required for previous work. Also, this domain requires the ability to            account for simultaneous activation of the heart at multiple locations,          which was performed at a rudimentary level in the previous work.                                                                                                  This project is important for three reasons: (1) it offers new knowledge-        based algorithms for reasoning about time- and space-varying data, (2) a         comprehensive and extensible model of the cardiac conduction will be             created that incorporates the spatial resolution necessary for                   interpreting intracardiac electrograms, and (3) a software tool such the         one proposed may help clinicians improve the quality of health care.              n/a",MODEL BASED INTERPRETATION OF INTRACARDIAC ELECTROGRAMS,6126011,R29LM006004,"['arrhythmia', ' artificial intelligence', ' computer assisted diagnosis', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' diagnosis design /evaluation', ' electrocardiography', ' heart catheterization', ' heart conduction system', ' human data', ' interactive multimedia', ' mathematical model', ' model design /development']",NLM,SOUTHWEST RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R29,2000,149839,0.007196539961236067
"AUTOMATED MINIMAL RESIDUAL DISEASE QUANTIFICATION Quantification of Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) is a general concern in oncology since this parameter is likely to give valuable information to clinicians to customize chemotherapeutic treatments and to anticipate possible relapses. An automated system will be developed for the quantification of MRD by using real-time PCR to quantify cancer cells in a background of non pathologic DNA. The system will be derived from an existing high-throughput sample handling system (developed by Meldrum and team) named Acapella. Acapella has a pipelined serial architecture which makes it possible to develop an adaptive PCR control algorithm ensuring a level of sensitivity and accuracy for the quantification results specified by the clinician. In the R21 phase of the project, a critical component of the system is the real-time thermocycler. It will provide DNA quantification results of greater precision than what is currently possible with commercial instruments such as the ABI PRISM 7700 Sequence Detector by taking advantage of a high performance custom fluorescence analyzer and sophisticated data analysis methods. The fluorescence analyzer will have a signal to noise ratio and a dynamic range of at least one order of magnitude larger than the optics used on commercial systems. This unique feature will permit precise measurements of the amplification kinetics during at least five cycles in the exponential phase of the reaction. The amplification yield will he derived from these data using statistical estimators customized to meet the requirements of real-time PCR data analysis. The sample DNA content will be derived from the amplification yield and the calibrated fluorescence measurements of the reaction kinetics. This new approach will make it possible to run series of real-time PCRs with more flexibility than would be possible if the assay was based on standard reactions required to have the same amplification yield as the clinical samples. PCR conditions will be adapted online without concerns about possible differences of amplification rate. The assay control algorithm will adapt the reaction DNA content, the primer selection, and the number of PCRs to meet the clinician requirements for particular patient DNA. During the R21 phase of the project a prototype of the real-time thermocycler will be developed to demonstrate the optic performance and the possibility to estimate the PCR amplification rates with 5% accuracy. A conceptual design of the fully integrated process from patient blood sample to MRD quantification data will be completed to allow assessment of expected performance, cost, and risks associated with the development of the fully engineered system. The development of the various hardware and software components along with their integration into the automated system will take place during the R33 phase of the project. Performance of the system will he evaluated on real biological samples provided by the UW Department of Laboratory Medicine. Results returned by the system will he compared with results of t(14; 18) PCR performed in this department with an ABI PRISM 7700 for the diagnosis of patients suffering from follicular lymphomas.  n/a",AUTOMATED MINIMAL RESIDUAL DISEASE QUANTIFICATION,6062376,R21CA084691,"['artificial intelligence', ' biomedical automation', ' biomedical equipment development', ' chromosome translocation', ' computer assisted diagnosis', ' diagnosis design /evaluation', ' fluorescence', ' high throughput technology', ' human tissue', ' minimal residual disease', ' neoplasm /cancer diagnosis', "" nonHodgkin's lymphoma"", ' nucleic acid quantitation /detection', ' polymerase chain reaction']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R21,2000,154460,-0.014471997674628223
"NONINVASIVE ASSESSMENT OF ATRIAL FIBRILLATION Atrial arrhythmias are extremely common and are often associated with            significant morbidity and mortality. The ability to develop and                  prescribe new treatments for atrial arrhythmias depends on the                   availability of better diagnostic tools that are simple, inexpensive,            and effective enough to support their use for screening large numbers            of patients.

"Machine learning driven transthoracic echocardiographic analysis and screening for cardiac amyloidosis Machine learning driven transthoracic echocardiographic analysis and screening for cardiac amyloidosis Cardiac amyloidosis (CA) is a serious but increasingly treatable cause of heart failure. Autopsy studies have estimated the prevalence of CA at approximately 25% of all octogenarians, and 15 to 20% of patients with aortic stenosis. Despite the increasing prevalence of CA within the general population and specific subpopulations, its diagnosis as a cause of heart failure is hampered by under recognition and subsequent underdiagnosis in clinical practice. Data suggest that the average time from onset of symptoms to diagnosis is 2 years and that patients report seeing an average of 5 physicians prior to establishing a definitive diagnosis. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) testing is the most common initial evaluation because of its wide availability. A recent utilization review in the Medicare population indicated over 7 Million echocardiographic tests are performed each year accounting for $1.2 Billion in healthcare costs. TTEs provide comprehensive information about cardiac structure and function, yet complexity of interpretation has limited its screening performance in patients with CA, and diagnosis can be challenging. Thus, our group seeks to offer a computer vision and machine learning based TTE analysis and screening solution for CA. We are uniquely positioned for accelerated development with a cohort of 359 patients with confirmed CA and 4,862 controls. In Phase I, we will build a deep learning neural network-based image processing pipeline. It maps the TTE sequence into a 2-dimensional space that allows for the identification of the 4-chamber peak diastolic and peak systolic images within the cardiac heartbeat cycle. This will enable our screening model to recognize regional myocardial wall motion changes and hypertrophic patterns that characterize amyloidosis in comparison to controls with normal cardiac function. The operational point defining the performance characteristics of our screening-oriented model (including sensitivity, specificity, and negative predictive value) will be optimized using an average weighted accuracy (AWA) approach which accounts for CA disease prevalence along with a desired false positive and false negative tradeoff. If we are successful, we envision a Phase II proposal to build and deploy an automated TTE analysis tool, and to evaluate it in a multi- center clinical study. This sets the stage for our long-term goal to implement a computer assisted TTE screening solution to improve identification and by extension care of patients with cardiac amyloidosis. PROJECT NARRATIVE While non-invasive echocardiography is a first line tool for diagnosis for many cardiovascular symptoms, it is underutilized for less common diseases such as cardiac amyloidosis which recently has been shown to be increasingly prevalent in general and specific subpopulations. In this project, we will develop and validate a novel computer-assistive echocardiographic analysis tool to recognize the presence of cardiac amyloidosis. It is our hope that this technology will enhance the screening and subsequent diagnosis of cardiac amyloidosis, ultimately, leading to improved patient outcomes.",Machine learning driven transthoracic echocardiographic analysis and screening for cardiac amyloidosis,10081836,R43HL154896,"['Accounting', 'Adult', 'Age-Years', 'Amyloid', 'Amyloidosis', 'Aortic Valve Stenosis', 'Area', 'Autopsy', 'Awareness', 'Biopsy', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Echocardiography', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Heart failure', 'Image', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Laboratories', 'Left Ventricular Hypertrophy', 'Left ventricular structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medicare', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Multi-site clinical study', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Myocardial', 'Octogenarian', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Review Literature', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Target Populations', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Ultrasonography', 'Utilization Review', 'Validation', 'Ventricular', 'Work', 'autoencoder', 'base', 'case control', 'classification algorithm', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'genetic analysis', 'heart function', 'image processing', 'imaging genetics', 'improved', 'neural network', 'neural network classifier', 'novel', 'point of care', 'screening', 'tool', 'two-dimensional']",NHLBI,"VIGILANT MEDICAL, INC.",R43,2020,249373,-0.0009098188177712495
"Improved Glaucoma Monitoring Using Artificial-Intelligence Enabled Dashboard Detecting functional and structural loss due to glaucoma is critical to making treatment decisions with the goal of preserving vision and maintaining quality of life. However, most of the approaches for glaucoma assessment through visual fields (VFs) or optical coherence tomography (OCT) measurements have several limitations that poses critical challenge to their clinical utility. Identifying glaucoma-induced changes from a sequence of VF or OCT data is challenging either if the patients is in the early stages of the disease with subtle manifested structural and functional signs or if the patients are in the later stages of the disease with significant VF variability and OCT flooring effect. A major limitation of the current glaucoma monitoring techniques is that they generate a binary outcome of whether the glaucoma is worsening or not while current high-throughput data (e.g., OCT) has more information than a binary outcome. Another major drawback of some of these approaches is that they rely on traditional paradigms for progression detection such as linear regression. However, rates of glaucomatous progression may be non-linear and rapid, particularly during the later stages of the disease. Another limitation is that ad-hoc rules are adopted to define glaucoma progression while objective criteria are required to define thresholds for progression. Finally, a major deficiency of most of these methods is that they lack advanced visualization and interpretation. We propose to address these limitations by developing artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled visualization tools for effectively monitoring the functional and structural loss in patients with glaucoma. This approach provides qualitative and quantitative means to monitor 1) global visual functional and structural worsening, 2) extent of loss in hemifields, and 3) local patterns of functional and structural loss on advanced 2-D visualization tools. To achieve these objectives, we have assembled a team of interdisciplinary experts with access to large clinically annotated glaucoma data. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that advanced interpretable machine learning applied to a complete profile of VFs in all test locations (e.g., 54 in 24-2 system) and OCT-derived measurements of retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) (e.g., 768 A-scans around the optic disc and 7 global sectoral regions) can objectively and automatically learn and quantify the most important features, yielding a more specific and sensitive means for monitoring of glaucoma worsening than current subjectively-specified or statistically-identified approaches. We also hypothesize that machine learning can provide interpretable models with several layers of glaucoma knowledge that may provide a promising complement to current glaucoma assessment tests. Our proposed studies may offer substantial improvements in prognosis and management of glaucoma through effective use of analysis and visualization to improve glaucoma management and making more informed treatment options. Current glaucoma assessment is hampered by several limitations including lack of visualization and interpretation, providing binary rather than more-informed results, utilizing traditional approaches for data analysis, and adopting ad-hoc assessment criteria. Glaucoma is best managed and treated if both functional and structural data is utilized and mined using advanced computational tools to generate more-informative quantitative results. We propose developing artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled visualization dashboards for qualitative and quantitative monitoring of global visual functional and structural worsening, extent of loss in hemifields, and local patterns of functional and structural loss on advanced interpretable 2-D and 3-D visualization maps.",Improved Glaucoma Monitoring Using Artificial-Intelligence Enabled Dashboard,10043768,R21EY031725,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Axon', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Computer Systems', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Eye', 'Floor', 'Glaucoma', 'Goals', 'Health', 'High Performance Computing', 'Image', 'Incidence', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Linear Regressions', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Ophthalmology', 'Optic Disk', 'Optic Nerve', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Quality of life', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Retinal Ganglion Cells', 'Savings', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Treatment Cost', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual Fields', 'Visualization', 'Visualization software', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'dashboard', 'field study', 'glaucoma test', 'hands-on learning', 'improved', 'large datasets', 'longitudinal dataset', 'multidimensional data', 'open source', 'outcome forecast', 'preservation', 'retinal nerve fiber layer', 'structured data', 'three-dimensional visualization', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'unsupervised learning']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE HEALTH SCI CTR,R21,2020,253379,-0.02057085694698953
"Deep learning to quantify glaucomatous damage on fundus photographs for teleophthalmology PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Candidate: Atalie Carina Thompson, MD, MPH is a current glaucoma fellow and Heed fellow with a long-term career goal of becoming an independent clinician-scientist and leader in the field of glaucoma and public health. She has a long-standing interest in addressing healthcare disparities in medicine, and in improving the diagnosis of glaucoma and other ophthalmic diseases through imaging technology. While obtaining a medical degree at Stanford, she received a fellowship to complete a master’s degree in public health with additional higher-level coursework in biostatistics and epidemiology. Her immediate goal in this proposal is to refine and validate a deep learning (DL) algorithm capable of quantifying neuroretinal damage on optic disc photographs and then to apply it in a pilot teleophthalmology program. With a K23 Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award, she will acquire additional didactic training and mentored research experience in glaucoma imaging, machine learning, biostatistics, clinical research, and the responsible conduct of research. Environment: The mentorship and expertise of the advisory committee, the extensive resources at the Duke Eye Center and Departments of Biostatistics and Biomedical Engineering, and the significant institutional commitment will provide her with the support needed to transition successfully into an independent clinician-scientist. Research: This proposal will test the hypothesis that a DL algorithm trained with SDOCT detects glaucoma on optic disc photographs with greater accuracy than human graders. In Specific Aim 1, a DL algorithm that quantifies neuroretinal damage on optic disc photographs will be refined. The main hypothesis is that the quantitative output provided by the DL algorithm will allow accurate discrimination of eyes at different stages of the disease according to standard automated perimetry, and will generate cut-offs suitable for use in a screening setting. In Specific Aim 2, the short-term repeatability and reproducibility of the DL algorithm in optic disc photographs acquired over a time period of several weeks will be determined. The hypothesis is that the test-retest variability of the predictions from the DL algorithm will be similar to the original measurements acquired by SDOCT. In Specific Aim 3, the DL algorithm will be applied to optic disc photographs obtained during a pilot screening teleophthalmology program in primary care clinics and assisted living facilities. The hypothesis is that the DL algorithm will be more accurate than human graders when a full ophthalmic examination is used as the gold standard. This work will constitute the basis of an R01 grant and will advance our understanding of the application of deep learning algorithms in glaucoma and teleophthalmology. PROJECT NARRATIVE Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness in the world. However, since the disease can be asymptomatic until later stages, many patients with glaucoma will not know they have glaucoma until they suffer substantial and irreversible visual field loss.

"Machine Learning Approach to Identify Candidates for Epilepsy Surgery Project Summary/Abstract Despite the widespread adoption of new drug classes to treat epilepsy, approximately one third of patients do not respond to anti-epileptic medication. Patients with drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE) suffer permanent memory and cognitive impairment from uncontrolled seizures. Only 8-10% of patients with DRE obtain long-term seizure freedom. About half of patients with DRE are eligible for surgical treatment, which results in seizure freedom in 58-73% of patients. However, it is difficult to determine when patients with DRE need surgery. DRE has a complex disease course that fluctuates according to weekly and monthly patterns. Further, neurologists report that they lack the resources (i.e. time) needed to analyze and interpret large amounts of electronic health record (EHR) data to determine surgical candidacy. This results in substantial delays in treatment - 6 years in pediatrics and 20 years in adults, on average - and contributes to avoidable morbidity and mortality. Automated systems are capable of assisting clinicians in identifying candidates for epilepsy surgery two years earlier in the disease course. One such system uses natural language processing to analyze free-text neurology notes in a real-time clinical setting. This system was able to increase the rate of surgical candidate identification by 46%, but it could still be improved in two important ways. First, the system is not able to incorporate results from EEG and MRIs - the most influential factors on surgical candidacy - into its recommendations. Second, it does not utilize rich information hidden in structured EHR data that captures epilepsy disease burden. A system that fuses information from all three data sources (neurology notes, EEG and MRI reports, and structured data) would drastically improve the accuracy and impact of the model. In the proposed research, I will first develop a deep learning (DL) approach for fusing multi-modal EHR data. Specifically, I will use recent advances in deep representation learning to produce richer features from both free- text and structured data. I will represent free-text in neurology notes and EEG and MRI reports with word embedding vectors, and medication, procedure, and visit codes with medical concept vectors. I will combine disparate data sources with a deep neural network to produce high-level representations of surgical candidacy. This will enable me to estimate patients' risk of future epilepsy surgery. Second, I will establish the generalizability of this approach using a neighboring hospital's EHR data and validate the system in a clinical setting. This contribution will be significant because it will increase the number of surgical candidates identified earlier in the disease course, thereby reducing epilepsy disease sequelae. This proposal will lay the groundwork for nationwide expansion of the DL system and generate the only automated DL system designed to improve the timeliness of surgical referral rates in the adult population. Project Narrative Automating the identification of patients with epilepsy who would benefit from surgical treatment is imperative to reducing morbidity and mortality from uncontrolled seizures. This research proposal will develop and clinically validate a generalizable deep learning framework for analyzing multi-modal electronic health record data to predict epilepsy surgery candidacy. Implementing this system into clinical care is expected to reduce the time to surgery by 45%, which would prevent one epilepsy-related death for every 58 patients who receive surgery.",Machine Learning Approach to Identify Candidates for Epilepsy Surgery,10066989,F31NS115447,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Antiepileptic Agents', 'Area', 'Benchmarking', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Disease', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Epilepsy', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Failure', 'Freedom', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Impaired cognition', 'Influentials', 'Intractable Epilepsy', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Memory impairment', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologist', 'Neurology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pediatrics', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Provider', 'Quality-Adjusted Life Years', 'ROC Curve', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Resources', 'Savings', 'Schedule', 'Seizures', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'candidate identification', 'case control', 'clinical care', 'cohort', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'electronic structure', 'improved', 'learning classifier', 'magnetic resonance imaging/electroencephalography', 'mortality', 'multidimensional data', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'novel drug class', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'prospective test', 'structured data', 'tool', 'vector']",NINDS,CINCINNATI CHILDRENS HOSP MED CTR,F31,2020,39617,-0.022997097591608784
"Machine learning for the automated identification and tracking of rare myocardial diseases PROJECT SUMMARY Although cardiac amyloidosis and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) are relatively rare causes of heart failure (HF), they are particularly challenging to detect and treat for several shared reasons: (1) on routine clinical imaging (i.e., echocardiography [echo]), they can be difficult to distinguish from superficially similar, more common forms of cardiac disease that cause left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy; (2) the diagnoses are often missed and thus patients can present late in the course of disease at a time when treatment is difficult; (3) objective, noninvasive metrics that reliably reflect disease progression have not been identified; and (4) the small number of known patients with these diseases can make epidemiology studies and clinical trials difficult to organize and conduct. For both cardiac amyloidosis and HCM, echo plays a critical role in both diagnosis and longitudinal monitoring given its ubiquitous clinical availability, safety, and low cost. More broadly, echo dominates the current landscape of routine cardiac imaging, with tens of millions of echos performed in the United States each year. However, the clinical challenges described above highlight several shortcomings of echo: it is limited in its ability to (1) diagnose disease at its early stages; (2) discriminate between morphologically similar diseases; and (3) quantify disease progression. This proposal seeks to address deficiencies in the current echo reading workflow, which is subjective and captures only a small fraction of the data available in each study. The overall objective of this application is to use advances in machine learning to develop and validate fully-automated echo image analytic approaches to diagnose and track rare cardiomyopathies, focusing on cardiac amyloidosis and HCM. Our proposal is centered on the hypothesis that highly scalable computer vision methods can be applied to echo studies to overcome limitations of the standard clinical echo reading workflow. Accordingly our aims are: (1) Apply an automated method for echo quantification and disease identification to detect and differentiate cardiac diseases that cause increased LV wall thickness; and (2) Characterize quantifiable echo measures of disease progression in cardiac amyloidosis and HCM and associate these with clinical outcomes. Our multidisciplinary team, which is composed of experts in cardiomyopathies, echocardiography, computer vision, and machine learning, will analyze echos and patient data from 2 large patient registries: the Multicenter Amyloid Phenotyping Study (MAPS) and the Sarcomeric Human Cardiomyopathy Registry (SHaRe) HCM Network, with validation using a repository of nearly 400,000 echos. The successful completion of our aims will result in an innovative tool for early diagnosis of myocardial diseases and tracking of disease progression. Importantly, our project will set the stage for conducting larger epidemiology studies of rare myocardial diseases by automating the identification of these patients, and thereby developing previously unattainable broad-based cohorts for these conditions. PROJECT NARRATIVE Rare heart diseases such as amyloidosis (due to abnormal deposition of a protein into the heart muscle) and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (due to a genetic mutation) are important causes of heart failure and sudden death in the general population. These heart diseases are difficult to diagnose, monitor, and treat because: (1) they appear superficially similar to more common forms of heart disease (e.g., high blood pressure) on imaging tests; (2) the optimal monitoring of disease progression over time has not been established; and (3) there is a lack of large-scale studies of patients with these diseases given their rarity. This project aims to use machine learning (artificial intelligence) of digital echocardiographic images to create a completely automated method for diagnosing and tracking these rare heart diseases with the ultimate goal of broad deployment of artificial intelligence algorithms in hospitals and clinics to help identify patients with these rare heart diseases earlier, better predict adverse outcomes, and increase the size and scope of patient registries to enhance research of these conditions.",Machine learning for the automated identification and tracking of rare myocardial diseases,9739345,R01HL140731,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithm Design', 'Amyloid', 'Amyloidosis', 'Arrhythmia', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiomyopathies', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinics and Hospitals', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communities', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Coronary heart disease', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Echocardiography', 'Face', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Information Retrieval', 'Inherited', 'Left', 'Left Ventricular Hypertrophy', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Myocardium', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Sudden Death', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Two-Dimensional Echocardiography', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Ventricular', 'adverse outcome', 'automated image analysis', 'base', 'career', 'clinical care', 'clinical imaging', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'cost', 'digital', 'disease diagnosis', 'epidemiology study', 'heart imaging', 'hypertensive heart disease', 'image processing', 'innovation', 'intelligent algorithm', 'interest', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel therapeutics', 'particle', 'patient registry', 'repository', 'response', 'statistical learning', 'tool']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2020,687210,0.022701095297248224
"Addressing variability in peripheral arterial disease outcomes using machine learning techniques Project Summary/Abstract: Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States, affecting over eight million Americans, of whom 100,000 a year suffer major amputation. Current guidelines dictate medical treatment and aggressive risk factor modification for all PAD patients, whether symptomatic or not, with revascularization attempts for patients with chronic limb threatening ischemia (CLTI) or lifestyle-limiting claudication. Despite strongly-worded standards of care, variability in PAD outcomes persists. Prior research has demonstrated that some demographic factors such as gender, race, and socioeconomic status are associated with worse PAD care and outcomes even when controlling for comorbidities. It is unknown what specific patient, provider, and healthcare system factors lead to these disparities. Efforts to understand which patients will suffer worse outcomes and disease progression have been hampered by contemporary outcomes research techniques. The majority of PAD outcomes research relies on administrative claims databases, procedural registries, or single center retrospective reviews. While each of these methods has some advantages, none offer the combination of patient- and disease-specific data, information about care provision on a provider and health-system level, and outcomes across a range of possible locations. Furthermore, use of any of these methods at the scale necessary to draw powerful conclusions is prohibitively time- and resource-intensive. The overall objective of this research is to use a novel natural language processing model to build a combined EHR/CMS database and to use that database to predict which PAD patients are at highest risk of poor outcomes with improved power and precision. This proposal contains plans for collaboration with Duke Forge, who bring expertise in natural language processing and machine learning in order to efficiently identify PAD patients within our EHR and efficiently abstract information about them. Once identified, these patients can be linked to their CMS outcomes, allowing for assessment of how patient-, physician-, and healthcare-specific factors affect PAD outcomes. Our central hypothesis is that natural language processing powered by machine learning will permit efficient identification of patients with PAD, thereby facilitating higher-powered and higher-quality investigation into disparities in PAD outcomes. This research will pave the way for future interventions targeting sources of outcome inequality, possibly including access to care, physician adherence to national guidelines, and patient preferences or health literacy. Project Narrative: Peripheral arterial disease affects more than eight million Americans, with over one hundred thousand amputations performed yearly. Despite the prevalence and morbidity of this disease, there is a lack of knowledge about which patients will require amputation, multiple surgeries or hospitalizations, or suffer cardiovascular- related death. This proposal uses natural language processing to improve on current research methodology in order to account for patient-specific, physician-specific, and system-specific factors in peripheral arterial disease care and outcomes.",Addressing variability in peripheral arterial disease outcomes using machine learning techniques,10066805,F32HL151181,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Affect', 'American', 'Amputation', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Demographic Factors', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease Progression', 'Documentation', 'Elements', 'Failure', 'Female', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitalization', 'Inequality', 'International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10)', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Ischemia', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life Style', 'Light', 'Limb structure', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Preferences', 'Patients', 'Peripheral arterial disease', 'Physicians', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Race', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Technics', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Source', 'Stroke', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Work', 'adjudicate', 'base', 'care outcomes', 'claudication', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'cost', 'demographics', 'design', 'effective intervention', 'health literacy', 'high risk', 'improved', 'low socioeconomic status', 'mortality', 'novel', 'patient subsets', 'tool', 'treatment effect']",NHLBI,DUKE UNIVERSITY,F32,2020,82476,-0.008060214862998205
"Leveraging Artificial Intelligence Solutions to Develop Digital Biomarkers for Precision Trauma Resuscitation PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  In the U.S., trauma is the leading cause of death for those 1-45 years old and hemorrhage remains the largest contributing factor to preventable death. Providers must rapidly identify those suffering from hemorrhage to optimize outcome, but internal bleeding remains difficult to diagnose even for experienced clinicians. Little is known on presentation about those suffering from occult hemorrhage and providers must quickly make treatment decisions in these time-pressured, time-sensitive clinical scenarios. This proposal seeks to develop through artificial intelligence, a type of advanced machine learning, prediction algorithms that could be deployed at the bedside of patients to assist clinicians with more timely recognition of hemorrhage. By doing so, we hypothesize that this approach (integrating diverse data sources that have not previously been combined to one another) could identify patterns in our patients that far surpass current capabilities to quickly detect and act on the critical components contributing to outcome. The ability to rapidly pinpoint these patterns and display them to the bedside clinician could allow more timely intervention and precise therapeutic approaches for hemorrhage control.  Beyond the challenges in rapidly identifying bleeding, current treatment of hemorrhage is rudimentary with a standard resuscitation approach for all patients. This reflects attempts to optimize outcome based upon the average treatment effect, rather than being adaptable for unique patient phenotypes. Hemorrhage is believed to initiate a complex chain of events involving crosstalk between the coagulation and inflammatory systems that are hypothesized to play a key role in outcome. Trauma has a known time zero of onset, making it an ideal model to study the immediate pathophysiologic changes associated with hemorrhage. This complex, individual patient biology is believed to explain why those suffering similar injury have differing outcomes. However, to date, these individual characteristics are poorly understood and not factored into initial treatment approaches. Through this proposal, I also seek to define novel digital biomarkers representing patient phenotypes that require precision resuscitation approaches to maximize outcome. Fundamental to reducing hemorrhagic deaths is the need to elucidate a deeper understanding of these mechanistic models of patient states. Strategies that help to identify novel patient phenotypes that could benefit from more tailored treatment pathways may provide important advances in decreasing preventable death.  The net result of this proposal will be a deeper insight into the mechanistic models contributing to evolving patient states following hemorrhage, and identify the key phenotypes or digital biomarkers associated with mortality, complications, and occult hemorrhage. Finding solutions to advance our resuscitation approaches following hemorrhage has potential to decrease complications, save lives, and reduce health care costs.

"Using Large Electronic Health Records and Advanced Analytics to Develop Predictive Frailty Trajectories in Patients with Heart Failure Candidate objective: My objective for this award is to become an independent quantitative scientist in analytical clinical research through structured training and mentored research experience. My goal is to become an academic leader and developer of advanced predictive models of health trajectories using electronic health records (EHR). Training objectives: I seek to sharpen my skill set as a clinical quantitative scientist using clinical informatics, EHR data warehouses, and advanced computational models. I will use the protected time provided by this award to gain proficiency in patient-clinician interactions, clinical informatics, natural language processing, and advanced survival analysis to accomplish my research aims. Background: Frailty is a complex clinical syndrome associated with aging and chronic illness. It decreases physiological reserves and increases vulnerability to stressors. The prevalence of frailty in patients with heart failure is 74%. The interplay of frailty and heart failure increases the risk for death, prolonged hospital stays, and functional dependence. One conceptual framework to operationalize frailty is accumulation of deficits: the frailty index (FI). The FI provides a risk score based on the assumption that the more ailments a patient has, the higher the risk of adverse outcomes, including mortality. Prior FI models have not been used in routine clinical practice due to the following limitations: insufficient number and range of clinical variables, lack of personalized deficit detection, use of data not commonly found in EHRs, insufficient use of longitudinal analytical models including survival analysis techniques, and the reduction of FI to a cross-sectional health status rather than a health trajectory. Research Aim: The overarching goal of this application is to develop a frailty trajectory (FT) for heart failure patients that provides information integrating prior functional impairment, current functional status, and future risk of mortality. In Aim 1, we will develop a novel cross-sectional FI that uses the full breadth of outpatient EHR data and innovative machine learning data science methods to predict mortality. In Aim 2, we will use serial cross-sectional FIs to build FTs and identify clusters of individuals following a similar progression of frailty over time. In Aim 3, we will compare the prognostic value of cross-sectional FI versus FT. The VA national EHR offers the ideal context for this study, as it provides longitudinal data since 1999 and can link to administrative data from non- VA sources, including linked Medicare databases. Mentoring & environment: A multidisciplinary mentoring team will supervise my training and will oversee my mentored research projects, formal coursework, directed reading, and career development. The proposed activities will provide a foundation for transitioning to an independent quantitative data scientist developing clinical decision aids to guide patient care. Baylor College of Medicine and the Center for Innovations in Quality, Effectiveness, and Safety have a national reputation of mentoring and supporting junior faculty members from diverse academic backgrounds to independent careers as clinical-investigators. Physical frailty is common in adults with heart failure and increases the risk for poor health outcomes. Clinicians need tools to identify adults with physical frailty as part of routine care to support early intervention to treat frailty and reduce this risk. This application seeks to develop a novel measure of physical frailty using data collected as part of routine clinical care and recorded in the electronic health record.",Using Large Electronic Health Records and Advanced Analytics to Develop Predictive Frailty Trajectories in Patients with Heart Failure,9953749,K25HL152006,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Admission activity', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'American', 'Award', 'Big Data', 'Biological Models', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Congestive Heart Failure', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Science', 'Data Scientist', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Aid', 'Decision Making', 'Dependence', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Faculty', 'Foundations', 'Frail Elderly', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Status', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Length of Stay', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medicare', 'Medicare claim', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Older Population', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Quality of Care', 'Reading', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Survival Analysis', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'advanced analytics', 'adverse outcome', 'analytical method', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'college', 'data warehouse', 'deep neural network', 'experience', 'frailty', 'functional disability', 'functional status', 'high risk', 'hospital readmission', 'indexing', 'individual variation', 'innovation', 'member', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'point of care', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic value', 'random forest', 'routine care', 'screening', 'signal processing', 'skills', 'stressor', 'support tools', 'tool']",NHLBI,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,K25,2020,143822,-0.04354299146008459
"Artificial intelligence assisted panoramic Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography for Retinopathy of Prematurity PROJECT SUMMARY The long-term goal of this project is to determine whether optical coherence tomography (OCT) and OCT angiography (OCTA) might lead more accurate and objective diagnosis, earlier intervention, and improved outcomes in retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). International consensus and National Institute of Health (NIH) funded clinical trials over the last 30 years have defined the phenotypic classifications, natural history, prognosis, and management of ROP. However, it is well established that due to the subjectivity of the ophthalmoscopic examination, and systematic bias between examiners, there is significant variation in treatment of the most severe forms of ROP in the real world. This leads to both under-treatment (and poor outcomes due to retinal detachment) and over-treatment (exposing neonates to the ocular and systemic risks of treatment). Roughly 20,000 babies per year develop retinal detachments (RD) due to ROP and there is strong evidence that most of these are preventable. In adult retinal vascular diseases, most notably diabetic retinopathy (DR), OCT and OCTA can detect and quantify disease features such as diabetic macular edema (DME) and retinal neovascularization (NV) before they are noted clinically, enabling earlier treatment and reducing the risk of blindness from RD. However, evaluating the use of this technology in neonates requires high speed and portable technology, and the commercially available handheld OCTs are too slow for ultra-widefield (UWF) OCT and OCTA imaging. Several groups (including our own) have published preliminary results using prototype 100 to 200 kHz swept- source (SS) OCT systems, however consistent data acquisition remains challenging due to the lack of fixation and subsequent motion in an awake neonate, which has limited the evaluation of the potential benefits of the technology in this population. Recently, there has been much interest in using artificial intelligence (AI) (specifically deep learning), which relies on high speed graphics processing units (GPUs) to provide real time OCT image processing, segmentation, and tracking. This application addresses 2 fundamental gaps in knowledge: (1) Can we overcome the technical challenges through the development of a faster ultrawide-field view SS-OCT system coupled with a GPU-enabled DL software system to enable consistent data acquisition in neonates? (2) Would quantitative objective metrics of ROP improve objectivity of ROP diagnosis and detect subclinical signs of disease progression which may enable earlier intervention and improved outcomes in the future. By leveraging our institution’s OCT, AI, and ROP expertise, we will address these questions in three specific aims: (1) Develop an ultra-high speed, handheld, panoramic ultra-widefield OCT/OCTA system. (2) Develop real time GPU accelerated intelligent image acquisition software. (3) Evaluate the clinical significance OCT derived biomarkers. Successful translation of this technology to the ROP population could improve the accuracy and objectivity of ROP diagnosis, and lead to earlier intervention and improved outcomes in patients with severe ROP. PROJECT NARRATIVE Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) and OCT angiography (OCTA) have proven the ability to detect subclinical disease, provide quantitative evaluation of disease progression, and improve outcomes in the leading causes of blindness in adults, age-related macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy. Technological and practical limitations have limited the application of this technology in routine use for non-sedated children undergoing routine screening for retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), the leading cause of blindness in children. The proposed project will develop an ultra-high speed, handheld OCT system with graphics processing unit (GPU) enabled real-time processing to improve the feasibility of panoramic ultra-widefield OCT/OCTA imaging in non-sedated neonates and evaluate the clinical utility of OCT-derived biomarkers in ROP.",Artificial intelligence assisted panoramic Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography for Retinopathy of Prematurity,9943875,R01EY031331,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Aftercare', 'Age related macular degeneration', 'Algorithms', 'Angiography', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological Markers', 'Blindness', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Coupled', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Dyes', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Fluorescein Angiography', 'Funding', 'Fundus', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Injections', 'Institution', 'Intelligence', 'International', 'Knowledge', 'Lasers', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Measurement', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Natural History', 'Neonatal', 'Ophthalmic examination and evaluation', 'Ophthalmoscopes', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Peripheral', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Primary Health Care', 'Publishing', 'Quantitative Evaluations', 'Retina', 'Retinal Detachment', 'Retinal Neovascularization', 'Retinopathy of Prematurity', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systematic Bias', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Visualization', 'accurate diagnosis', 'arm', 'awake', 'base', 'blind', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinically significant', 'data acquisition', 'deep learning', 'design', 'diabetic', 'disease classification', 'disorder of macula of retina', 'image processing', 'imaging Segmentation', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'instrument', 'interest', 'lens', 'macular edema', 'neonate', 'neovascularization', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'overtreatment', 'parallel computer', 'portability', 'prototype', 'real-time images', 'research clinical testing', 'routine screening', 'sample fixation', 'software systems', 'standard of care', 'treatment response', 'treatment risk']",NEI,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,341800,-0.008617485934597045
"A Quantitative Risk Model for Predicting Outcome and Identifying Structural Biomarkers of Treatment Targets in Oral Cancer on a Large Multi-Center Patient Cohort Post-resection prognostication for oral cavity cancers (OCC) is qualitative and potentially ambiguous. A significant subset (25-37%) of Stage I/II patients still develop local recurrence after treatment with surgery alone. The long-term goal of this proposal will be to create a Quantitative Risk Model (QRM) using machine learning and artificial intelligence to predict recurrence risk for Stage I/II patients using image-based biomarkers of aggression. The objective is to develop and validate state-of-the-art systems for biomarker imaging, quantification, and modeling to accurately predict risk of recurrence in cancer patients based on image analytics. The central hypothesis is that a quantitative, artificial intelligence approach to pathology will result in significantly greater prognostic value compared with manual microscope-based analysis. The rationale for this work is that tumor aggression can be predicted from patterns present in pathology images, given the existence of histological risk models that have been clinically validated in the past; however, these risk models are not in widespread use because they are less accurate, robust, and transportable to the larger community of pathologists. This proposal will test the central hypothesis through three specific aims: (1) Develop an analysis pipeline that can accurately predict recurrence risk for Stage I/II OCC patients and identify treatment targets (e.g. adaptive local immune response and angiogenesis); (2) Demonstrate robust performance across a multi-site data cohort collected from seven national and international centers; and (3) Distil the results of QRM analysis to synoptic pathology reporting, demonstrating the ability of QRM to interface with standard clinical reporting tools. The innovation for addressing these aims comes from a unique application of active learning for training artificial intelligence to recognize tissue structures, new features for quantifying tissue architecture based on the interface between tumor and host, and a novel approach for large cross-site validation. Moreover, this proposal develops a unique mapping between computational pathology and commonly-used synoptic reporting variables, enabling rapid uptake of this work into existing clinical workflows. This research is significant because it provides personalized outcome predictions for a niche group of undertreated patients with limited options and can serve as the foundation for designing future clinical trials through identification of treatment targets. Multi-site training and evaluation, combined with AI-to-report mapping, will be broadly applicable to a large group of computational approaches, bridging the gap between engineering research labs and clinical application. The expected outcome of this work is a trained model for predicting Stage I/II OCC recurrence, identification of treatment targets, and mapping to synoptic reports, as well as a broadly-applicable workflow for the broader computational pathology community. This project will have a large positive impact on patients and surgical pathologists by enabling rapid, accurate prognosis and directed treatment plans in an easy-to-use pipeline that integrates seamlessly into existing clinical workflows. We aim to develop a quantitative risk model for oral cavity cancer patients, 25-37% of whom will experience debilitating post-treatment recurrence. Using state-of-the-art machine learning and artificial intelligence methods, we will develop and validate our risk model on a large multi-site cohort of patients, and develop an AI-assisted synoptic report-filling tool for integrating into clinical practice. A computational pathology approach to characterizing disease will help identify patients for whom aggressive multimodality therapy will improve outcomes and post-treatment quality of life.",A Quantitative Risk Model for Predicting Outcome and Identifying Structural Biomarkers of Treatment Targets in Oral Cancer on a Large Multi-Center Patient Cohort,9974099,R01DE028741,"['Active Learning', 'Address', 'Aftercare', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological Markers', 'Blinded', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Communities', 'Companions', 'Consensus', 'Country', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Head and Neck Surgery', 'Head and neck structure', 'Histologic', 'Image', 'Immune response', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Medical Economics', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Modeling', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Oral Stage', 'Outcome', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Pathology Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Postoperative Period', 'Productivity', 'Quality of life', 'Radiation therapy', 'Randomized', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Salvage Therapy', 'Screening procedure', 'Semantics', 'Site', 'Slide', 'Specimen', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Surgical Pathology', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Workload', 'analysis pipeline', 'angiogenesis', 'base', 'cancer recurrence', 'cancer type', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'computational pipelines', 'deep learning', 'design', 'digital', 'digital pathology', 'expectation', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'feature extraction', 'high risk', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'international center', 'malignant mouth neoplasm', 'novel strategies', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'pathology imaging', 'patient oriented', 'predictive modeling', 'pressure', 'prognostic', 'prognostic value', 'quality assurance', 'quantitative imaging', 'screening', 'segmentation algorithm', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'tumor', 'uptake']",NIDCR,STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK AT BUFFALO,R01,2020,382900,-0.0027158576395414605
"Lupus Nephritis Neural Network, LuNN Up to 60% of adults and 80% of children with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) develop nephritis (LN), with 10–30% progressing to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The gold standard for diagnosis of LN is a renal biopsy. Histological parameters remain the best predictors of ESRD. Despite being the gold standard, histological diagnosis of LN has several shortcomings. In multiple inter-observer renal pathology assessment studies reported thus far, the inter- pathologist correlation coefficients, or concordance, in assessing most histological parameters have been sub-optimal. This has provided the impetus for the current proposal. We propose to leverage the power of computer vision and deep learning to build a classifier that rivals the best-trained renal pathologists in making a histological diagnosis of LN using current diagnostic criteria. We propose to train a deep convolutional neural network to distinguish the different LN classes, and to identify a full spectrum of histological attributes useful for diagnosis. We will compare the performance of the newly generated neural network in scoring glomerular/tubulo-interstitial features and LN classes, against a panel of human renal pathologists. Finally, we propose to build a neural network that can predict clinical outcome based on baseline renal pathology. Reliable and reproducible classification of LN could dramatically improve patient management and long-term renal and patient survival. Despite being the gold standard, histological diagnosis of lupus nephritis is imprecise, and marked by significant inter-pathologist discordance in readings. We propose to leverage the power of computer vision and deep learning to build a classifier that rivals the best-trained renal pathologists in making a histological diagnosis of lupus nephritis. Reliable and reproducible classification of LN could dramatically improve patient management and long-term renal and patient survival.","Lupus Nephritis Neural Network, LuNN",10246669,R56DK122036,"['Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Automobile Driving', 'Cellular Structures', 'Child', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'End stage renal failure', 'Feedback', 'Gold', 'Histologic', 'Human', 'Image', 'Kidney', 'Lupus', 'Lupus Nephritis', 'Machine Learning', 'Mus', 'Nephritis', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Reading', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Retrieval', 'Supervision', 'Systemic Lupus Erythematosus', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'diagnosis standard', 'falls', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'kidney biopsy', 'neural network', 'novel', 'predict clinical outcome', 'time interval', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'user-friendly', 'web portal']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF HOUSTON,R56,2020,100750,-0.02204668147000628
"TOPIC 409 PHASE I FY20 SBIR CONTRACT - TOPIC 409 - INTELLIGENT AUTOMATION INC. Cancer patients experience substantial functional impairments during and after treatments, often requiring rehabilitation and exercise interventions. However, a functional assessment of the specific deficits and impairments in the individual is needed to inform exercise therapy. The oncology workforce is challenged in its capacity to conduct such functional assessment, therefore limiting the ability of rehabilitation providers to identify and meet the needs of these individuals. This work seeks to develop a novel, low-cost PC/camera-based image/video-monitoring system that can a) continuously and unobtrusively monitor the physical health of a cancer patient in his/her natural environment, b) determine the existence and extent of functional deficits, and c) facilitate personalized rehabilitative interventions, providing a risk-stratified and personalized approach to cancer patient care. Based on patient’s daily activities or exercises, objective and quantitative clinically-relevant and laboratory-validated measures of physical performance (e.g., gait speed, balance, and fall risk) will be extracted by using state-of-the-art image-processing and machine-learning techniques, involving human-detection, pose-estimation, and deep-learning algorithms and fall-risk prediction models. By providing the patients and their clinicians with a real-time assessment of their physical performance, through a PCbased software and a Web portal, respectively, the system will facilitate proactive rehabilitation via clinician-approved, personalized health-care tips and exercise recommendations. n/a",TOPIC 409 PHASE I FY20 SBIR CONTRACT - TOPIC 409 - INTELLIGENT AUTOMATION INC.,10267589,5N91020C00042,"['Aftercare', 'Automation', 'Cancer Patient', 'Clinic', 'Computer software', 'Contracts', 'Detection', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Exercise', 'Exercise Therapy', 'Feedback', 'Gait speed', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Activities', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intuition', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Monitor', 'Oncology', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physical Performance', 'Physical assessment', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Recommendation', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Work', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cost', 'deep learning algorithm', 'design', 'exercise intervention', 'exercise rehabilitation', 'experience', 'fall risk', 'functional disability', 'image processing', 'machine learning algorithm', 'novel', 'personalized approach', 'personalized health care', 'physical conditioning', 'prototype', 'risk prediction model', 'software systems', 'web portal']",NCI,"INTELLIGENT AUTOMATION, INC.",N43,2020,399961,-0.023434588226847138
"Robot-Assisted 3D ICE Catheter for Cardiac Ablation ABSTRACT  Although the cardiac ablation procedure for atrial fibrillation has a wide adoption rate, it also has a high recurrence of arrhythmia primarily due to the creation of suboptimal lesions. The procedure is also associated with complications including cardiac perforation, tamponade, atrio-esophageal fistulas and thrombus. Repeated and prolonged X-ray exposure for the clinician can also lead to enhanced risk of cancer. A fluoroless approach using intracardiac echocardiography (ICE) is becoming a more widely adopted imaging option due to the absence of ionizing radiation and the possibility of real-time monitoring of the created lesions. However, the ICE- guided approach suffers from significant shortcomings, which include poor dexterity of the ICE catheter, difficulty in simultaneously manipulating the ICE and ablation catheters, unintuitive image orientation and noisy image quality. There is therefore an unmet need to overcome these shortcomings of the ICE-guided approach to enable better lesion creation and reduced complications associated with the cardiac ablation procedure. The long-term goal of this research is to develop robotic technologies, control and machine learning algorithms to enable ICE- guided cardiac ablation procedures. The objective is to develop a novel robotic manipulator, a steerable ICE catheter, and machine learning and control algorithms to manipulate the ICE catheter and monitor the created lesions in real-time. The rationale that underlies the proposed research is that the robot-assisted steerable ICE catheter with the catheter tracking algorithms will enable simultaneous manipulation of the ICE and ablation catheters. Further, the machine learning algorithms to monitor therapy will reduce the risk of complications, while ensuring the creation of necrotic lesions, thereby reducing the recurrence of AF. In this proposal, we plan to pursue the following specific aims: 1) Design, develop, and model a steerable 3D ICE catheter with enhanced dexterity. 2) Design and develop a robotic manipulator and associated control algorithms to allow for precise manipulation of the ICE catheter. 3) Develop machine-learning and vision-based algorithms integrated with a navigation system for tracking the ablation catheter, and monitoring therapy. 4) Validate the robotic ICE system in heart phantom and porcine models. The proposed research is significant since it will allow for better therapeutic outcomes by reducing recurrence rates and complications associated with cardiac ablation, and avoiding exposure of the patient and clinical care team to X-ray radiation. The proposed research is innovative in that it builds on state-of-the-art robotics technology, machine learning and vision algorithms to enable fluoroless ICE- guided cardiac ablation procedures. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The proposed study addresses an important and under-investigated area of treating atrial fibrillation using a completely fluoroless approach with ICE imaging.

"Leveraging Artificial-Intelligence to Profile and Enhance Phenotypic Plasticity for Second Injury Prevention: An Innovative Precision Medicine Platform to Revolutionize Injury Care Project Summary/Abstract The best predictor of future injury is previous injury. Unfortunately, this has not changed in a quarter century, despite the introduction of evidence-based medicine and the associated revisions to post-injury treatment and care. Nearly nine million sports-related injuries occur annually, and the majority of these require medical treatment and/or clinical intervention prior to clearance for the athlete to return to play (RTP). Even with formal care, injured athletes are two- to four times (in extreme cases 100 times) more likely to suffer a second injury for up to two years after RTP. This is even more alarming given that 65% of initial sports-related injuries affect children and young adults (ages 5-24 years), setting them up for a lifetime of negative health outcomes. These data implicate the initial injury event as the tipping point for a post-injury cascade of negative sequelae exposing athletes to more physical and psychological pain, higher medical costs and greater risk of severe long-term negative health throughout their life. Thus, an urgent need exists to revolutionize the current standard of post- injury care through better identification and targeting of deficits that underlie second injury risk to enable everyone to stay physically active and healthy for their whole lives. To address this need, we propose a pioneering approach that capitalizes on the biological concept of Phenotypic Plasticity (PP) to quantify an athlete’s functional adaptability across different performance environments. Here PP is computed based on both intrinsic and extrinsic factors that reflect the functional movement capability of the athlete. The overall objective of this proposal is, therefore, to develop a generalizable PP-based precision sports medicine approach for second injury prevention through the development of a systematic bioinformatics-driven approach for PP profile construction, and the training of genetic fuzzy artificial intelligence to establish treatment type and magnitude for precision enhancement of PP. The result of the proposed work will be a generalizable PP-based precision sports medicine approach via two expected outcomes: (1) a formalized phenotypic precision medicine approach to objectively quantify behavioral plasticity, and (2) the successful implementation of a platform leveraging genetic fuzzy artificial intelligence integrated with mixed reality for performance prediction. This platform will support delivery of personalized treatments for PP enhancement. These objectives are the critical first step for the development of a generalizable precision medicine approach that will revolutionize rehabilitation and finally stem the tide of second injury in sport. This contribution will be significant to push back against the initial injury tipping point and, in doing so, create a pathway for injured athletes to return safely to physical activity and to maintain a long-term healthy lifestyle. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because the proposed platform will lead to fewer young men and women who suffer from second injury and the negative effects that lead to poorer long-term health. The project is relevant to NIH’s mission because the knowledge gained will be used to optimize new precision assessment and treatment strategies to prevent injury, and this will enhance health and reduce the burden of athletic injury.",Leveraging Artificial-Intelligence to Profile and Enhance Phenotypic Plasticity for Second Injury Prevention: An Innovative Precision Medicine Platform to Revolutionize Injury Care,9989850,R21EB027865,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Athletic Injuries', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Model', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Combinatorial Optimization', 'Complex', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genomic approach', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Phenotype', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Public Health', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Series', 'Services', 'Sports', 'Sports Medicine', 'Stress', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Training', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior prediction', 'behavioral plasticity', 'complex biological systems', 'data fusion', 'environmental change', 'fitness', 'healthy lifestyle', 'improved', 'indexing', 'injured', 'injury prevention', 'injury recovery', 'innovation', 'light weight', 'medical specialties', 'mixed reality', 'multimodal data', 'novel strategies', 'personalized medicine', 'precision genetics', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'programs', 'psychologic', 'response', 'stem', 'success', 'treatment strategy', 'young adult', 'young man', 'young woman']",NIBIB,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R21,2020,312918,-0.01377467422436356
"Development and Deployment of Artificial Intelligence (AI) Driven Methods to Enable Chest X-ray Radiography as an Alternative Diagnostic Method for COVID-19 Pneumonia ABSTRACT In this competitive revision, within the same scope of developing and deploying algorithms to make a quantum leap in clinical diagnosis as that in our current U01EB021183, we would like to revise the original aims to add a new Aim to leverage our expertise in the areas of algorithm development and clinical translation to make immediate contributions to combat the COVID-19 pandemic.

"Automated acute pulmonary embolism detection and staging from CT Project Summary / Abstract Minnesota HealthSolutions (MHS) proposes a Phase I project to develop and validate a software product capable of automatically detecting and staging pulmonary embolisms (PEs) using clinically routine pulmonary CT angiograms (CTAs). The proposed system will combine state-of-the-art machine learning methods and the clinical expertise of MEDNAX Radiology into a system that integrates seamlessly into the Radiology workflow and standard patient care path to improve the treatment decisions of physicians in the emergency department. Pulmonary embolism is the third most common cause of death in hospital patients with an estimated incidence of 1 per 1,000 patients. CTAs are routinely used to detect PE today; however, there is significant variability in the detection rate among radiologists using CTA. Furthermore, despite the strong evidence that the RV/LV ratio is an important clinical biomarker it is rarely measured quantitatively in practice. A successful completion of this project would provide a workflow-integrated tool capable of faster PE detection and more accurate staging of right heart strain to guide the physician’s treatment decision.

"Quantifying the Metrics of Surgical Mastery: An Exploration in Data Science PROJECT SUMMARY In surgery, it is accepted that there may be a ten to twenty-year learning curve to reach mastery for certain procedures. We believe this timeline can and should be shortened to improve patient care. Our short-term goal is to make a major contribution to the emerging field of Surgical Data Science by building a database of mastery level surgical performance and generating a roadmap for multimodal data collection and analysis procedures. Sharing our process, procedures and results broadly, will help to change measurement culture in healthcare. Through our newly developed partnership (October 2019) with the American College of Surgeons, we have already experienced early success in starting the conversation through the “Surgical Metrics Project” (https://www.facs.org/education/surgical-metrics). Using a standardized data collection platform (a mastery-level hernia simulation), we will deploy and synchronize multiple data capture approaches (motion tracking, video, audio and validated surgical performance checklists) to build our database. Data analysis will quantify surgical mastery and consist of new applications and discoveries in machine learning. Hypothesis: Using multiple, synchronized data capture approaches and machine learning, it is possible to create a database of mastery level surgical strategies that can be translated into a value-added, surgical navigation tool for surgeons. To test this hypothesis, we will empirically investigate the following paraphrased aims: SPECIFIC AIM 1: Quantify surgical mastery (cognitive and technical) during a simulated laparoscopic ventral hernia (LVH) repair by using a post-procedure analysis of multi-modal performance metrics captured from hospital credentialed surgeons (N~125). SPECIFIC AIM 2: Establish validity evidence for surgical mastery metrics by comparing simulation-based LVH performance with operating room LVH performance from the same surgeons (N~60). SPECIFIC AIM 3: Empirically investigate the best implementation strategy for utilization of a surgical navigation tool designed to deliver value-added information regarding mastery-level surgical performance strategies to a new group of hospital credentialed surgeons (N~125).

"Leveraging modern analytic approaches to improve diabetes outcomes ABSTRACT Diabetic patients are at risk of developing diabetic heart disease, which may lead to complications in care. Diabetic heart disease patients not only have exceptionally high healthcare expenditures and resource utilization but also are likely to have poor patient outcomes. Studies have shown that early intervention of patients likely to develop diabetic heart disease is cost-effective and yields favorable health outcomes. Therefore, early identiﬁcation of diabetic patients at high-risk of developing diabetic heart disease is crucial to provide effective interventions. The commonly accepted methodology for diabetic heart disease risk prediction is the use of one or more risk scoring systems. However, these risk functions may not generalize well for the diabetes patient and may suffer from poor calibration when used on different cohorts. Moreover, the scoring systems have only been studied on coronary heart disease, one variant of diabetic heart disease while heart failure and diabetic cardiomyopathy remain important, yet insufﬁciently studied problems. Machine learning offers the ability to perform accurate predictive analytics and has been proposed as a way to identify and manage high-risk patients. The primary goal of this proposal is to develop a high-impact and practical risk prediction model that can be used to per- form early identiﬁcation of high-risk diabetic heart disease patients. Given the heterogeneity and complexity of patient information in electronic health records, the model needs to capitalize on the multi-dimensional temporal nature of pa- tient records to extract identifying characteristics of patients that will develop diabetic heart disease. To accomplish this, we will leverage modern machine learning approaches such as tensor factorization and natural language processing to model complex patient characteristics, provide a more complete representation of the patient, and uncover excellent predictors of diabetic heart disease risk. An existing dataset that contains the de-identiﬁed electronic health records of approximately 4,100 diabetic patients from the Emory Healthcare System to compare the predictive power of machine learning-based algorithms with the standard risk scoring systems. These algorithms will be evaluated on calibration, discrimination, and ease of interpretability. The results of this work will provide insight as to how to develop a machine learning–based prediction system that can identify high-risk diabetic heart disease patients. The study may also shed light on the best approaches for fusing data from multiple heterogeneous sources to build a better predictive model and potentially identify novel indicators of high- risk diabetic heart disease factors. Moreover, the work will help inform a larger multi-site study of diabetic heart disease risk prediction and develop methods to generalize the results to a broader spectrum of comorbidities. This project is consistent with the National Library of Medicine's mission to translate biomedical research into practice. PROJECT NARRATIVE Diabetic patients are risk of developing diabetic heart disease which can lead to high healthcare expenditure, high resource utilization, and poor patient outcomes. Existing diabetic risk prediction models can suffer from poor calibration and predictive accuracy.

"ARTERY Outcomes: tAilored dRug Titration through artificial intElligence: an inteRventional studY Need: Nearly half (34 million) of all hypertension (HTN) patients have their blood pressure (BP) uncontrolled. Despite medication and life-style management, the cost of HTN-associated hospitalizations is $113 billion, or 15% of all hospital costs. HTN is the leading cause for stroke, heart failure (HF) and myocardial infarction (MI) hospitalizations. Clinical trials have shown that active pharmacological treatment management of HTN to BP goal reduces the incidence of stroke by 35-40%, MI by 15-25%, and HF by up to 64%.  Solution: In response to the national “epidemic” of uncontrolled HTN, Optima Integrated Health has developed optima4BP. optima4BP is an artificial intelligence (AI) that transforms the episodic and reactive nature of uncontrolled BP pharmacological treatment management into a process that is continuous, proactive, and personalized. The innovation was developed with the physician in mind by simulating the in-office clinical reasoning treatment decision process. optima4BP is a physician decision support aid that safely and when needed optimizes the pharmacological treatment for HTN. optima4BP is interoperable in real-time with the EpicÒ Electronic Health Record (EHR), constantly evaluating the efficacy of patients’ current treatment and the requirement for optimization. When a treatment optimization is needed, optima4BP communicates directly with the treating physician by providing a recommendation in the EHR In-Basket that can be accepted or declined.  Goal of Direct to Phase II: ARTERY Outcomes [tailored drug titration through artificial intelligence: an interventional study] is a 12 months follow-up, randomized clinical trial (n=300) that: Evaluates optima4BP’s safety and efficacy in improving HTN control [Aim 1], and Ensures Data Systems Maintenance [Aim 2].  Aim 1. Evaluate optima4BP’s safety and efficacy in improving HTN control. We propose to conduct a randomized clinical trial (ARTERY Outcomes) at UC San Francisco Medical Center (UCSF MC). We will investigate the safety and efficacy of optima4BP in improving BP control compared to standard of care (SoC). The primary end-point will examine the reduction in systolic BP (SBP) between in-office start and end of study. Milestone: optima4BP reduces SBP by >6 mmHg than SoC. The safety of using optima4BP will be investigated as a secondary outcome in the context of reported adverse events (AEs).  Aim 2. Ensure data systems maintenance (DSM). DSM is a critical activity that includes optimization, error correction, deletion of discarded features and enhancement of existing features. UCSF MC and Optima IT teams will address (1) Data Acquisition upgrades and patches of any system/component within the data flow; and (2) Surveillance management that addresses systems errors, and performs audits/upgrades on the data repository [data warehouse]. Milestone: Ensure the validity of the collected-processed-analyzed data.  Commercial Application: With a growing need for value-based care, optima4BP is strongly positioned to support this specific care coordination model.

"Machine Learning in Atrial Fibrillation Project Summary  Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common heart rhythm disorder, affecting 2 million Americans in whom it may cause skipped heart beats, dizziness or stroke. Unfortunately, therapy for AF has limited success, likely because AF represents heterogenous and poorly characterized disease entities between individuals. A central challenge is that it is not clear why a specific therapy works in a given AF patient. This uncertainty makes it challenging to develop a patient-specific approach to tailor therapy for personalized medicine.  The premise of this project is that mechanistic data is increasingly available in AF patients at scales spanning tissue, whole heart and patient levels, yet rarely integrated. We set out to use machine learning (ML), a powerful approach proven to classify complex datasets, to integrate data to address 3 clinical unmet needs. First, electrograms are rarely used to guide therapy in AF, unlike organized rhythms, because they are difficult to interpret. Second, it is difficult to understand how arrhythmia is affected by any specific ablation strategy in AF, unlike organized rhythms. This makes it difficult to improve therapy. Third, it is difficult to identify whether an individual patient will or will not have success from AF ablation. We applied machine learning and novel objective analyses to these questions to develop strategies for personalized AF therapy.  We have 3 specific aims: (1) To identify components of AF electrograms using ML trained to monophasic action potentials (MAP); (2) To identify electrical and structural features of the acute response of AF to ablation near and remote from PVs; (3) To identify patients in whom ablation is unsuccessful or successful long-term, who are poorly separated at present. Each Aim will compare ML to traditional biostatistics, and use objective explainability analysis of ML to provide mechanistic insights.  This study has potential to deliver immediate clinical and translational impact. We will apply specific ML approaches, biostatistics, and computer modeling to our rich multiscale registry. We will develop practical and shareable tools, which we will prospectively test clinically, to deliver meaningful outcomes at tissue, whole heart and patient scales. Our team is experienced in electrophysiology, computer science, signal processing and biological physics. This project is likely to reveal novel multiscale AF phenotypes to enable personalized therapy. Machine Learning in Atrial Fibrillation Narrative Atrial fibrillation (AF) is an enormous public health problem that affects 2-5 million Americans, causing stroke, rapid heart beats, heart failure and even death. In this project, the applicant will apply numerical analysis and machine learning to detailed data acquired from patients undergoing therapy, to better define individual biological types of AF, which may provide a foundation for personalized patient-tailored diagnosis and therapy.",Machine Learning in Atrial Fibrillation,9995302,R01HL149134,"['Ablation', 'Action Potentials', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Arrhythmia', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Biological', 'Biometry', 'Biostatistical Methods', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dizziness', 'Drug Controls', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Genetic', 'Heart', 'Heart Atrium', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Label', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physics', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Registries', 'Science', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'base', 'computer science', 'convolutional neural network', 'demographics', 'digital', 'experience', 'heart rhythm', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'insight', 'learning classifier', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'personalized strategies', 'prospective', 'prospective test', 'response', 'signal processing', 'success', 'tool', 'translational impact', 'voice recognition', 'voltage']",NHLBI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,785591,-0.013434562325024687
"PRECEDE: PREsurgical Cognitive Evaluation via Digital clockfacEdrawing ABSTRACT Preoperative cognitive impairment is common among older adults preparing for surgery. Despite growing evidence that preoperative cognitive/neuronal integrity is a risk factor for perioperative insults and post- operative adverse outcomes, health care systems do not systematically pre-operatively screen for cognition. Clinical researchers have yet to identify a pragmatic approach to pre-operative cognitive screening. Our team members have developed the digital Clock Drawing Test (dCDT), a tool that captures subtle behavioral variables during a rapid (5-minute) clock drawing assessment. The data and benefit afforded by this tool have yet to be considered across perioperative contexts. We will apply the dCDT within a large number of pre- surgical patients (n=5,000 per year) coupled with novel machine learning algorithms to address three specific aims. Aim 1: examine range and distribution of preoperative neurocognitive impairment with older adult preoperative patients relative to non-surgical older adult demographically matched peers (available n=2,400 via NIH/Boston University Framingham Heart Study) using novel previously unobserved dCDT graphomotor and decision making variables; Aim 2: examine the predictive validity of presurgical dCDT variables on postoperative, clinician reported/hospital recorded events; Aim 3: examine pre to postoperative 6-week, 3- month, and 1-year change in dCDT and NIH PROMIS metrics for thoracic (n=70), orthopedic (n=70), major abdominal-pelvic patients (n=70), and non-surgery peers (n=70). For the observational studies (Aim 1 and 2), individuals > 65 years presenting to the UFHealth presurgical clinic will complete the dCDT as well as a three- word memory test and frailty assessment as part of the standard clinical evaluation. Surgical and anesthetic details will be acquired via the electronic medical record. Clinically-relevant outcomes will include complications, length of stay, cost of care, functional capacity, and mortality. Outcomes will be supplemented by a separate longitudinally-studied subgroup (Aim 3) completing NIH PROMIS metrics at 6 weeks, 3 months, and 1year after surgery. Analyses will focus on stratifying distributions and clusters of dCDT characteristics across numerous sociodemographic, surgical, and anesthetic factors. The predictive value of the dCDT will be modeled relative to clinical outcomes.

"Development of a Novel Diagnostic Test for Pulmonary Embolism Based on Artificial Intelligence and Spectral Analysis of Blood Pulmonary Embolism (PE) is a potentially life-threatening condition that affects adults of all ages yet can present with a myriad of symptoms, ranging from chest pain to shortness of breath, syncope, or seizure. Currently, physicians can assess for this condition with a blood test (D-dimer) which has high sensitivity but very poor specificity, thus resulting in a larger number of false positives. Alternatively, or in the case of a positive D-dimer, computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) or ventilation-perfusion (VQ) scan can be used, both of which are expensive and expose the patient to a significant amount of ionizing radiation. To develop a more specific blood test for PE, Biocogniv will apply state-of-the-art artificial intelligence (AI) to aggregate analysis of existing blood biomarkers measured on two commercially available multiplex immunoassay platforms, one of which is currently used in hospital labs. A sufficiently accurate, rapid and cost-effective test could be broadly applied (i.e., like troponin-I for myocardial infarction) to reduce overuse of CT, simplify ED decision making, and reduce the number of deaths from unrecognized PE. In this proposed Phase I single center study, Biocogniv will collaborate with the University of Vermont Medical Center (UVMMC) to demonstrate proof-of-concept for diagnosing PE in emergency department (ED) patients for whom there is sufficient concern for PE to warrant a D-dimer test as part of routine clinical care. Specific Aim I is to collect blood from 225 emergency department (ED) patients at UVMMC who were suspected of having PE (including 75 patients that are confirmed to have PE by CTPA), and analyze the blood plasma with quantitative immunoassays to create training and validation datasets for AI analysis. Immunoassays will be comprised of a set of 6 rapid FDA-cleared chemiluminescent immunoassays performed in parallel, and a 20-plex bead-based immunoassay panel targeting known cardiovascular and inflammatory markers associated with acute PE. Specific Aim II is to develop AI data models for two pretest populations—all D-dimer tested patients and just D-dimer positive patients—for bead-based and point-of-care immunoassay datasets (analyzed separately), then evaluate the performance of each data model on a subset of blood plasma data withheld for validation. As part of the evaluation of AI data model performance, the potential impact of study size on data model accuracy will be simulated by plotting specificity as a function of training sample number to show that adding more samples can improve test results. The performance of each approach (i.e., AI methodology applied to a given immunoassay panel for a given pretest population) will be compared and used to plan a Phase II multi-center study and to identify and attract a suitable instrumentation partner. Biocogniv’s end goal is to develop a rapid, highly specific and sensitive FDA cleared test for PE that will become the standard of care for initial diagnosis and triage of patients with potential pulmonary embolism, disrupting the $2B/year D-Dimer market and improving ED patient care. Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a potentially fatal condition that presents with non-specific symptoms (including chest pain, shortness of breath, and fainting) and is notoriously difficult to diagnose: as many as 1 in 3 Emergency Department (ED) patients ultimately diagnosed with PE are initially mis-diagnosed, and up to 1 in 3 PE deaths are only discovered upon autopsy. Biocogniv seeks to develop a new blood test for PE that is just as sensitive as the existing D-Dimer test, but that also has the higher specificity needed to screen and stratify all emergency department patients with PE-like symptoms. The expected impact of such a test would be to increase patient safety by reducing the overuse of radiative imaging, standardize clinical care processes, reduce costs and save lives.",Development of a Novel Diagnostic Test for Pulmonary Embolism Based on Artificial Intelligence and Spectral Analysis of Blood,10081921,R43HL154941,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Angiography', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Autopsy', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood Proteins', 'Blood Tests', 'Blood coagulation', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cessation of life', 'Chest Pain', 'Creatine Kinase MB Isoenzyme', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Deep Vein Thrombosis', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Dyspnea', 'Emergency Department patient', 'Evaluation', 'Fibrin fragment D', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Immunoassay', 'Intravenous', 'Ionizing radiation', 'Life', 'Lower Extremity', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Myoglobin', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Triage', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Process', 'Pulmonary Embolism', 'ROC Curve', 'Radiation', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Seizures', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Shortness of Breath', 'Specificity', 'Standardization', 'Symptoms', 'Syncope', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Travel', 'Troponin I', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Venous system', 'Vermont', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'clinical care', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'data modeling', 'improved', 'inflammatory marker', 'instrumentation', 'molecular marker', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'patient safety', 'performance tests', 'point of care', 'standard of care', 'targeted biomarker', 'ventilation']",NHLBI,BIOCOGNIV INC.,R43,2020,299749,-0.007437335003786769
"SCH: Leveraging Clinical Time Series to Learn Optimal Treatment of Acute Dyspnea  The ability to rapidly match the right patients to the right treatments at the right time is critical to ensuring patients  receive high quality care. The vast majority of machine learning applications in healthcare focus on diagnosing or  stratifying patients for a particular outcome. In contrast, reinforcement learning (RL) aims to learn how clinical states  (i.e., sets of signs, symptoms, and test results) respond to specific sequences of treatments, with the goal of optimizing clinical outcomes. RL does not aim to diagnose, but infers diagnosis based on a patient's response to  specific treatments--in many ways mimicking how clinicians operate in practice. This proposal will develop a novel  clinician-in-the-loop reinforcement learning (RL) framework that analyzes electronic health record (EHR) clinical time-series data to support physician decision making, iteratively providing physicians the estimated outcome of  potential treatment strategies. Our topic of focus for this work is the evaluation and treatment of patients hospitalized with acute dyspnea (shortness of breath) and signs of impending respiratory failure. Acute dyspnea is an ideal condition for an RL approach, since it can be due to three overlapping conditions: congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and pneumonia. Determining optimal treatment for these patients is clinically difficult, as a patient's presentation is frequently ambiguous, rapidly changing, and often due to multiple causes.  Inappropriate treatment may occur in up to a third of patients leading to increased mortality. While developing this  RL framework, we will also develop methods to learn more useful representations of high-dimensional clinical time-series data to improve the efficiency of RL model training. In addition, given the challenges of working with observational health data, we will develop new methods for evaluation of learned policies and develop new theory to better understand the limitations of RL using observational data. The project has four aims: 1) create a shareable, de-identified EHR time-series dataset of 35,000 patients with acute dyspnea, 2) develop techniques for exploiting invariances In tasks involving clinical time-series data to improve the efficiency of RL model training, 3) develop and evaluate an RL-based framework for learning optimal treatment policies for acute dyspnea, and 4) prospectively validate the learned treatment model. This research will result in new techniques for learning representations from time-series data and will study both the theoretical and practical limitations of RL using observational clinical data, leading to key advancements in ML and RL for clinical care. The tools developed for clinical decision support in this proposal have the potential for high impact because of their ability to generalize beyond the problem studied here to other conditions, laying the groundwork for clinical systems that directly impact society by aiding in the timely and appropriate treatment of patients. Hospitalization for sudden and severe shortness of breath (acute dyspnea) affects almost 2 million patients in the US each  year. Such patients can be difficult to treat, as their presentation may ambiguous, due to multiple causes that change over  time and require different types of therapies/treatments. In this proposal, we will develop novel reinforcement-learning  based approaches to quickly match patients to the best treatment based on his/her symptoms over time. The proposed  work could have a significant impact on health by shortening lhe time to appropriate treatments, leading to improved  patient outcomes.",SCH: Leveraging Clinical Time Series to Learn Optimal Treatment of Acute Dyspnea ,10015336,R01LM013325,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Blood Pressure', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Congestive Heart Failure', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Drops', 'Dyspnea', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Infrastructure', 'Learning', 'Linear Models', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morality', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Patient Rights', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Pneumonia', 'Policies', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Quality of Care', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiratory Failure', 'Rewards', 'Right to Treatments', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Series', 'Shortness of Breath', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Societies', 'Stream', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Theoretical Studies', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical database', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'health data', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary collaboration', 'learning algorithm', 'learning strategy', 'mortality', 'network architecture', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'patient response', 'patient stratification', 'prospective', 'success', 'supervised learning', 'support tools', 'theories', 'tool', 'treatment strategy']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2020,235205,0.010842315510154488
"Investigation of Stereotyped High-Frequency Oscillations with Computational Intelligence for the Prediction of Seizure Onset Zone in Epilepsy PROJECT SUMMARY Neurosurgical therapy of refractory epilepsy requires accurate localization of seizure onset zone (SOZ). In clinical practice, intracranial EEG (iEEG) is recorded in the epilepsy monitoring unit (EMU) over many days where multiple seizures are recorded to provide information to localize the SOZ. The prolonged monitoring in the EMU adds to the risk of complications and can include intracranial bleeding and potentially death. Recently, high frequency oscillations (HFO) of iEEG between 80 to 500 Hz are highly valued as a promising clinical biomarker for epilepsy. HFOs are believed to be clinically significant, and thus could be used for SOZ localization. However, HFOs can also be recorded from normal and non-epileptic cerebral structures. When defined only by rate or frequency, pathological HFOs are indistinguishable from physiological ones, which limit their application in epilepsy pre-surgical planning. In this proposal, to the best of our knowledge, we show of a recurrent waveform pattern that distinguishes pathological HFOs from physiological ones. In particular, we observed that the SOZ generates repeatedly a set of stereotyped HFO waveforms whereas the HFOs from nonepileptic regions were irregular in their waveform morphology. Based on these observations, using computational tools built on recent advances in sparse coding and unsupervised machine learning techniques, we propose to detect these stereotyped recurrent HFO waveform patterns directly from the continuous iEEG data of adult and pediatric patients and test their prognostic value by correlating the spatial distribution of detected events to clinical findings such as SOZ, resection zone and seizure freedom. We hypothesize that accurate detection of pathologic HFOs in brief iEEG recordings can identify the SOZ and eliminate the necessity of prolonged EMU monitoring and reduce the associated risks. With these motivations, in this project an interdisciplinary team composed of biomedical engineers, epileptologists and neurosurgeons will work together to develop and test novel computational tools to detect stereotyped HFOs and its subtypes in large iEEG datasets recorded with clinical electrodes. Developed algorithms and iEEG data will be shared with the research community to contribute to the reproducible research and help other research groups to develop novel methods. The results of this study will be essential for achieving our group's long term goal of developing an online neural signal processing system for the rapid and accurate identification of SOZ with brief invasive recording. PROJECT NARRATIVE Prolonged iEEG monitoring for SOZ localization does add to the risk of complications and may include serious issues, such as intracranial bleeding, meningoencephalitis, and eventually death. The intellectual merit of this project is to develop computational intelligence tools based on recent advances in sparse coding and unsupervised machine learning techniques to investigate stereotyped high frequency oscillations (HFOs) in long-term iEEG and test the hypothesis whether the automated detection of HFOs will yield accurate and fast identification of SOZ.",Investigation of Stereotyped High-Frequency Oscillations with Computational Intelligence for the Prediction of Seizure Onset Zone in Epilepsy,9974350,R01NS112497,"['Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Brain', 'Cerebrum', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Environment', 'Epilepsy', 'Event', 'Excision', 'Freedom', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Hemorrhage', 'High Frequency Oscillation', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Intractable Epilepsy', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Lesion', 'Meningoencephalitis', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Motivation', 'Motor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Neocortex', 'Neurosurgeon', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Recurrence', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Scheme', 'Seizures', 'Site', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Stereotyping', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translations', 'Visual', 'Work', 'awake', 'base', 'clinical biomarkers', 'clinical practice', 'clinically significant', 'computational intelligence', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'neurotransmission', 'novel', 'pediatric patients', 'prognostic value', 'prospective', 'signal processing', 'tool', 'unsupervised learning']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF HOUSTON,R01,2020,459252,0.006773617713749433
"Deep Learning for Automated Aortic Stenosis and Valvular Heart Disease Detection Using a Digital Stethoscope Abstract This SBIR Phase II project will develop a deep learning-based clinical decision support algorithm for detecting and diagnosing valvular heart disease based on heart sounds recorded using the Eko Core and Eko Duo Digital Stethoscopes. This screening tool will help to decrease the number of patients with valvular heart disease that remain undertreated simply because their condition is not diagnosed. Auscultation is commonly the method by which valvular heart disease is first detected, but cases often fail to be referred to echocardiography for diagnosis because clinicians fail to detect heart murmurs, particularly in noisy or rushed environments. To address this challenge, Eko had developed the Core, a digital stethoscope attachment that can be added in-line to a clinician’s existing stethoscope that amplifies heart sounds and Duo, a digital stethoscope in a handheld form factor with built-in single lead electrocardiogram. Both devices are designed to stream digitized phonocardiograms to a smartphone, tablet or personal computer. There, the signal can be analyzed with the decision support algorithm we will develop as part of this project. The specific aims of this study are: (1) to collect a database with condition- specific recording labels to enable deep learning for heart sounds though clinical data collection at six clinical sites, and (2) to develop and evaluate a collection of deep convolutional neural network-based algorithms trained on the database. These algorithms will (2a) distinguish between systolic, diastolic and continuous murmurs, (2b) classify aortic stenosis (AS), mitral regurgitation (MR), tricuspid regurgitation (TR), and innocent murmurs (2c) assess the severity of AS, MR and TR. By integrating these deep learning algorithms into Eko's mobile and cloud software platform, currently used by clinicians at over 1000 institutions worldwide, we anticipate this algorithm will enable more accurate screening for valvular heart disease in adult patients, leading to earlier diagnosis and better patient outcomes. Public Health Relevance Valvular heart disease is becoming an increasingly prevalent manifestation of poor cardiovascular health in both the developed and developing world. A highly-accurate clinical decision support algorithm that is able to detect and classify valvular heart disease will impact public health by reducing unnecessary referrals for echocardiography and promoting early and accurate diagnosis in underserved areas with limited access to specialty care.",Deep Learning for Automated Aortic Stenosis and Valvular Heart Disease Detection Using a Digital Stethoscope,10079904,R44HL144297,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Aortic Valve Stenosis', 'Area', 'Auscultation', 'Cardiac', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collection', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Device Designs', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Echocardiography', 'Eko', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health Personnel', 'Heart Sounds', 'Heart Valve Diseases', 'Heart murmur', 'Institution', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Medical Device', 'Methods', 'Mitral Valve Insufficiency', 'Modeling', 'Network-based', 'Outcome Study', 'Pathology', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Personal Computers', 'Phase', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Health Care', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Resources', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Specificity', 'Stethoscopes', 'Stream', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Tablet Computer', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Tricuspid Valve Insufficiency', 'accurate diagnosis', 'algorithm training', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'cardiovascular health', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical development', 'clinical research site', 'clinically significant', 'cloud software', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'deep neural network', 'diagnosis standard', 'digital', 'experience', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'medical specialties', 'point of care', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'sound']",NHLBI,"EKO DEVICES, INC.",R44,2020,938347,-0.0010874030498615708
"Deep Neural Networks To Treat Atrial Fibrillation PROJECT SUMMARY Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a major health problem affecting over 5 million people in the US leading to significant morbidity and even mortality. Therapy for this epidemic is suboptimal, with success of 30-70% at 1 year for most therapies. Despite great advances in understanding potential AF mechanisms, these insights have not yet translated into better AF therapy. The scientific focus of the project centers on the issue of identifying novel phenotypes for the heterogeneous conditions that currently fall under the rubric of AF. Machine learning is an approach well-suited to identify novel classifications from large diverse data sets that are traditionally difficult to separate. I will use machine learning and computational methods to analyze detailed clinical, structural, cardiac electrophysiological and biochemical features in patients with AF, to better predict responders and non-responders to various therapies. This may enable prospective guidance to tailor personalized therapy. In performing this project, I will grow as a physician-scientist focused on patient-oriented research in atrial fibrillation. The specific aims of the scientific project are as follows: First, I will create a novel disease taxonomy for AF that classifies patients successfully treated by risk factor modification, antiarrhythmic drug therapy, or diverse approaches to ablation, using computational methods and supervised learning on large training data from my collaborators. I will assess the predictive efficacy of these disease partitions in a testing cohort of patients referred for treatment of AF. Second, I will use advanced techniques in machine learning and patient-level analyses to explain why a certain strategy may fail or succeed in an individual, paving the way for clinical use. Third, in a pilot prospective clinical study, I will assess the feasibility and accuracy of these machine learning models. The findings from these experiments may provide an immediate clinical impact by delivering AF therapy options in a patient-specific manner that optimizes benefit while reducing risk. In addition, under the balanced and expert mentorship provided by this award, I will gain the necessary computational modelling, clinical research design and biostatistical methodology experience to design comprehensive studies and be competitive for independent funding. PROJECT NARRATIVE Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most prevalent heart rhythm disorder in adults, which may lead to significant morbidity, mortality and economic burden. The results of pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic therapy remain suboptimal, despite the fact that mechanistic data in patients are increasing on atrial structure, electrophysiology and clinical risk factors yet are rarely used to individualize AF therapy to each patient. In this project, computational methods and machine learning are proposed to harmonize large amounts of data, including clinical factors, imaging studies and cardiac signals, to provide tools to devise an individualized AF management strategy.",Deep Neural Networks To Treat Atrial Fibrillation,9995010,K23HL145017,"['Ablation', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Anti-Arrhythmia Agents', 'Arrhythmia', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Award', 'Biochemical', 'Biometry', 'Cardiac', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Computer Models', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Economic Burden', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Epidemic', 'Failure', 'Fatigue', 'Flecainide', 'Freedom', 'Funding', 'Health', 'Heart Atrium', 'Heart failure', 'Individual', 'Judgment', 'Lead', 'Life Style Modification', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nonpharmacologic Therapy', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pulmonary veins', 'Registries', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Syndrome', 'Taxonomy', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Triage', 'Work', 'clinical center', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical predictors', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'cost', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'diverse data', 'dofetilide', 'economic implication', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'falls', 'functional outcomes', 'heart rhythm', 'imaging study', 'individualized medicine', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'neural network', 'novel', 'patient oriented research', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'responders and non-responders', 'response', 'skills', 'success', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'unsupervised learning']",NHLBI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K23,2020,193536,0.002537557454948622
"Using Causal Inference and Machine Learning Methods to Predict Cognitive Behavioral Treatment Response PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Many patients with anxiety and fear disorders (AFDs) report minimal benefits when treated with an evidence- based psychotherapy (e.g., cognitive-behavioral therapy [CBT]) or pharmacotherapy (e.g., antidepressants; benzodiazepines). Conversely, some AFD patients are likely to benefit from virtually any treatment (e.g., supportive therapy). Using data collected in randomized controlled trials (RCTs), there has been limited progress determining how to use pre-treatment characteristics to match AFD patients to the treatment that is most likely to provide benefit. As a result, NIMH has forwarded Strategic Objectives focused on identifying treatment moderators and developing tools that predict differential treatment response. The broad goal of this proposed secondary data analysis is to apply causal inference and machine learning methods to prospective observational data to predict differential treatment response among patients with AFDs. The sample (n = 1,528) is from a longstanding NIMH-funded study of AFD patients who received: (a) CBT with concurrent pharmacotherapy, (b) CBT without pharmacotherapy, or (c) treatment as usual (TAU). Targeted maximum likelihood estimation (a causal inference method) and super learning (an ensemble machine learning method) will be used to accomplish the proposed Aims. Aim 1 will estimate the (overall) average effects of the three treatment types. Aim 2 will estimate “optimal treatment rules” to determine if differential treatment response can be meaningfully predicted based on a patient's multidimensional profile of pre-treatment symptoms. Aim 3 will estimate “optimal treatment rules” to determine if differential treatment response can be meaningfully predicted using all available pre-treatment covariates. The proposed study is highly innovative and could significantly impact the growing literature focused on predicting differential treatment effects and personalizing treatment for patients with AFDs. Although treatment effects estimates obtained using observational data and causal inference methods (i.e., adjusted for nonrandom treatment selection) are similar to those estimated in RCTs, this would be the first study to apply such methods to AFD patient data. This study will also be the first to use ensemble machine learning to develop composite moderators for AFDs (i.e., optimal treatment rules). In comparison, prior attempts to develop composite moderators have relied on less flexible model-building procedures prone to overfitting and unable to capture complex predictor-outcome associations (e.g., interactions among predictors; nonlinear associations). In achieving the proposed Aims, the current study would be a catalyst for future research using causal inference and machine learning to study predictors of differential treatment response among AFD patients. Results will be used to justify future research aimed at expanding and validating the models in larger observational samples and pragmatic RCTs (e.g., optimal treatment rules for specific medications/doses; timing of pharmacotherapy relative to CBT; second-wave CBT versus acceptance-based CBT). PROJECT NARRATIVE Some patients with anxiety and fear disorders may benefit only from certain evidence-based treatments, while others may benefit from virtually any treatment (e.g., talk therapy). The current study will use casual inference and machine learning methods to develop predictive models that identify the treatment(s) most likely to benefit a particular patient. The models developed in this study will serve as an important initial step toward efficient and personalized treatment for patients with anxiety and fear disorders.",Using Causal Inference and Machine Learning Methods to Predict Cognitive Behavioral Treatment Response,9912204,R21MH119492,"['Antidepressive Agents', 'Anxiety', 'Assessment tool', 'Benzodiazepines', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Fright', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Life Stress', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Onset of illness', 'Outpatients', 'Patient observation', 'Patients', 'Personality', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Procedures', 'Psychotherapy', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Sampling', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Severities', 'Supportive care', 'Symptoms', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Treatment outcome', 'Validation', 'anxiety treatment', 'base', 'catalyst', 'comorbidity', 'cost', 'depressive symptoms', 'effective therapy', 'evidence base', 'excessive anxiety', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'functional disability', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'model building', 'optimal treatments', 'outcome prediction', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'prospective', 'response', 'sociodemographics', 'stress reactivity', 'symptom treatment', 'treatment as usual', 'treatment disparity', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response', 'virtual']",NIMH,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),R21,2020,207977,0.004963582086133284
"International Consortium for Multimodality Phenotyping in Adults with Non-compaction Summary Non-compaction cardiomyopathy (NCCM) is a heterogeneous, poorly understood disorder characterized by a prominent inner layer of loose myocardial tissue. Patients with NCCM are at increased risk of heart failure, stroke, severe rhythm irregularities and death. Current imaging techniques cannot differentiate pathological from benign hypertrabeculation. In addition, current echo/MRI-based criteria of NCCM lead to over-diagnosis of NCCM, provide no prognostic value, and lead to implantation of defibrillators (ICD) and the use of anticoagulation without a positive benefit in many otherwise healthy individuals with non-compacted myocardium. For a growing population diagnosed with NCCM there is an urgent need for better risk stratification to appropriately allocate (or safely withhold) these impactful preventive measures. Our international consortium combines expertise in myocardial disease, cardiac imaging and advanced computer analytics from 5 centers dedicated to the care of patients with cardiomyopathies, and has the ultimate goal to improve care of patients with non-compaction cardiomyopathy. We hypothesize that comprehensive analysis of clinical, genetic, structural and functional information will improve risk stratification. In addition, we hypothesize that detailed structural analysis will allow for differentiation of pathological and benign patterns of non-compaction. In a large cohort of adult patients with suspected NCCM we will perform in-depth phenotyping, including clinical information, pedigree data, genetics, echocardiography and MRI, and follow patients for up to 3 years. We will apply machine-learning based analytics to develop predictive models and compare their performance to currently used models and treatment criteria. Secondly, in a subset of patients we will perform high-resolution cardiac CT for detailed structural characterization of the myocardial wall. Novel analytical methods will be developed to characterize the 3D architectural complexity based on pathophysiological hypothesis, but also using hypothesis-free analyses of raw images using deep learning techniques. In addition, we will investigate associations between myocardial structure and regional contractile function, as assessed by echo and MRI. The aim of this proposal is to identify a structural signature associated with pathological non-compaction and improve developed risk prediction models. This international consortium dedicated to NCCM will be the first to collect genetic and multi-modality imaging data. Discovery of pathological structural signatures through innovative imaging techniques, in relation to myocardial contractility, will advance our understanding of NCCM. There is an urgent clinical need for diagnostic techniques that detect pathological non-compaction and identify patients at risk of devastating complications. This study is clinically relevant because the developed predictive models may permit more effective, personalized preventive care in a growing number of individuals diagnosed with non-compaction cardiomyopathy. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to the public health because recognition of pathological myocardial non- compaction and identification of patients at risk for embolic stroke, ventricular arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death will allow for more effective use of life-saving measures, but also avoid unnecessary ICD implantations and anticoagulation in healthy individuals with benign hypertrabeculation. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the NIH's mission that pertains to the discovery of fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems and the application of that knowledge to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability.",International Consortium for Multimodality Phenotyping in Adults with Non-compaction,9977674,R01HL146754,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adult', 'Adverse event', 'Anticoagulation', 'Architecture', 'Arrhythmia', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Benign', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiomyopathies', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Defibrillators', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Disease', 'Echocardiography', 'Event', 'Family member', 'Foundations', 'Fractals', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Structures', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Heart failure', 'Histologic', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Left ventricular non-compaction', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medical Genetics', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Mutation', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial tissue', 'Myocardium', 'Nature', 'Non-compaction cardiomyopathy', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pennsylvania', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Preventive care', 'Preventive measure', 'Preventive therapy', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Savings', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Sudden Death', 'Techniques', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Ventricular Arrhythmia', 'accurate diagnosis', 'adjudicate', 'adjudication', 'adverse event risk', 'analytical method', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'deep learning', 'density', 'disability', 'embolic stroke', 'genetic pedigree', 'heart imaging', 'high risk', 'imaging genetics', 'implantation', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'patient subsets', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic value', 'prospective', 'radiomics', 'research clinical testing', 'risk prediction model', 'sudden cardiac death', 'thrombogenesis', 'young adult']",NHLBI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,805761,-0.017163742007536474
"Physically Realistic Virtual Surgery Physically Realistic Virtual Surgery Abstract While virtual reality (VR)-based surgical simulation technology is being developed to improve laparoscopic surgical training outside the operating room (OR), existing simulators focus mostly on technical skills (TS) of hand-eye coordination for isolated tasks and seldom on non-technical skills (NTS) associated with both cognitive skills of decision making, as well as interpersonal skills of communication, team-work and conflict resolution. To enable VR-based surgical simulators to also train for cognitive skills, in the previous grant period we successfully developed the next generation (Gen2) of laparoscopic surgical simulators that immerse the trainee in a virtual OR using a head-mounted display (HMD) system, and introduce distractions, interruptions and other stressors to capture the high-stress environment of the real OR. However, to the best of our knowledge, there exists no VR-based simulator for training interpersonal skills needed for the multidisciplinary integration of OR teams, which consist of surgeons, anesthesiologists, and perioperative nurses. Following the significant reduction of adverse events in other disciplines, such as aviation, by the introduction of mandatory simulation-based team training (e.g., crew resource management), the National Surgical Skills Curriculum developed by the American College of Surgeons (ACS) and Association of Program Directors in Surgery (APDS) has prescribed ten team-based training modules to be performed in a simulation facility (e.g., an OR endosuite) with scenario-based training on high- fidelity manikin simulators. However, such facility-based team training is extremely expensive and cumbersome, requires dedicated facility and faculty time, and entails significant planning and schedule coordination between trainees, technicians, and faculty. To overcome the challenges of facility-based OR team training, the goal of this project is to extend the immersive VR technology (Gen2) developed as part of our prior grant for a single user to the entire OR team, and harness recent advances in cloud computing, mobile device-based VR and artificial intelligence and machine learning to design, develop and evaluate a Virtual Operating Room Team Experience (VORTeX) simulation system. The VORTeX will allow the OR team to train together in a distributed fashion (i.e., not co-located in the same room or simulation facility) wearing mobile device-based HMD systems to develop further their NTS based on computer-generated simulation scenarios replacing the physical ones. Evaluation of the simulation scenarios will be performed asynchronously by a team of experts based on post-action replays. We will implement the VORTeX for a laparoscopic cholecystectomy crisis scenario, developed and validated by our Co-I Dr. Dan Jones at BIDMC and adopted as one of the team training modules of the ACS/APDS national surgical skills curriculum. We hypothesize that the VORTeX will be at least as good as or better than traditional facility-based simulation in providing non-technical skills training to OR teams. Project Narrative: The goal of this research is to develop and validate a comprehensive computer-based technology that will allow surgical trainees to practice their surgical skills on computer-based models. Surgical procedures and techniques, learnt and perfected in this risk-free manner before application to patients, will translate to fewer operating room errors, reduced patient morbidity and improved patient outcomes resulting in faster healing, shorter hospital stay and reduced post surgical complications and treatment costs.",Physically Realistic Virtual Surgery,9969824,R01EB005807,"['Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Adverse event', 'American College of Surgeons', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Aviation', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Board Certification', 'Boston', 'Client', 'Cloud Computing', 'Communication', 'Computer Models', 'Computers', 'Consensus', 'Decision Making', 'Discipline', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Effectiveness', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Faculty', 'Feedback', 'Floor', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Internet', 'Interruption', 'Israel', 'Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy', 'Length of Stay', 'Machine Learning', 'Manikins', 'Medical center', 'Minimally Invasive Surgical Procedures', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Operating Rooms', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Participant', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perioperative Nursing', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Schedule', 'Software Framework', 'Standardization', 'Stress', 'Surgeon', 'Surgical complication', 'System', 'Technical Expertise', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Translating', 'Treatment Cost', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'cloud platform', 'cognitive skill', 'cognitive training', 'computer generated', 'conflict resolution', 'design', 'distraction', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'eye hand coordination', 'handheld mobile device', 'head mounted display', 'healing', 'improved', 'instructor', 'interactive computing', 'member', 'multidisciplinary', 'next generation', 'novel', 'programs', 'simulation', 'simulation environment', 'skills', 'skills training', 'stressor', 'success', 'virtual', 'virtual environment', 'virtual reality', 'virtual reality environment', 'virtual surgery']",NIBIB,RENSSELAER POLYTECHNIC INSTITUTE,R01,2020,646125,-0.02134350252023007
"Sepsis Early Prediction and Subphenotype Illumination  Study (SEPSIS) PROJECT SUMMARY Sepsis, defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction in response to infection, is a devastating condition that contributes to up to half of hospital deaths and over $24 billion in healthcare costs in the U.S. annually. Over 750,000 patients develop sepsis in the U.S. each year, and survivors suffer long-term cognitive impairment and physical disability. Historically, sepsis research has focused on patients who are already critically ill. However, up to 50% of patients with sepsis receive their care on the inpatient wards, and only 10% of patients with sepsis are initially diagnosed in the intensive care unit (ICU). Because early intervention improves outcomes in sepsis, it is important to optimize the detection and treatment of sepsis outside the ICU.  The current sepsis paradigm has several problems. The first problem is that early identification of infection relies on clinician intuition, and caregivers often disagree regarding which patients are infected. This leads to delays in therapy and increased mortality in some patients and unnecessary therapies and adverse medication side effects in others. A second problem is that there is a lack of accurate tools to risk stratify infected patients outside the ICU after they are identified. Some patients with infection are treated outside the ICU and are later discharged home, while others develop life-threatening complications and die in the hospital. Accurate risk stratification of infected patients would bring additional critical care resources to the bedside of the high-risk patients that need them most. A third problem with the current sepsis paradigm is that it is often treated as a one-size-fits-all syndrome. However, patients with sepsis have a wide range of clinical presentations and outcomes due to the complex interactions between patient risk factors, the infectious organism, and the host immune response. These data suggest that the impact of timely and more aggressive interventions on outcomes may differ based on a patient's clinical phenotype. Identifying important subphenotypes of infected patients is critical to delivering more personalized care at the bedside.  The purpose of this project is to use data from the electronic health record and statistical modeling techniques to identify high-risk infected patients and important new subphenotypes of this syndrome. In Aim 1, we will develop a novel tool for identifying infected patients outside the ICU using modern machine learning techniques. In Aim 2, we will develop a tool for risk stratifying infected patients outside the ICU using machine learning methods. Finally, in Aim 3 we will use cluster analysis techniques to determine whether the benefit of early and more aggressive interventions varies based on clinical phenotype. Our project will provide clinicians with powerful new tools to identify high-risk infected patients and important new subphenotypes of this common and deadly syndrome. This work will help to deliver early, life-saving care to the bedside of septic patients and lead to future interventional trials aimed at decreasing preventable death.

"Enhanced Metadata Design, Architecture, and Learning (MeDAL) for Development of Generalizable Deep Learning-based Predictive Analytics from Electronic Health Records Sepsis, Septic Shock, and Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) are among the top causes of hospital mortality, morbidity, and an increase in duration and cost of hospitalization. Successful prevention and management of these conditions rely on the ability of clinicians to estimate the risk, and ideally, to anticipate and prevent these events. Acute care settings and in particular intensive care units (ICUs) provide an environment where an immense amount of data is acquired, and it is expected that with the advent of wearables and biometric patches even more data will be available in such settings. But at present, very little of these data are used effectively to prognosticate, and the existing predictive analytics risk scores suffer from lack of generalizability across institutions and performance degradation within the same institution over time. The PIs on this proposal recently demonstrated that a Deep Learning-based algorithm can reliably predict new sepsis cases in the emergency departments, general hospital wards, and ICUs by as much as 4-6 hours in advance and an area under the curve (ROC) of 0.85-0.90. Furthermore, through a 2-year pilot study funded via Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), we recently joined forces in a multicenter academic consortium to retrospectively validate this algorithm at each site. Our collaboration has resulted in a multi-center longitudinal EHR dataset of critically ill patients and has generated several important questions and findings related to design of portable and generalizable predictive analytics algorithms that are robust to problems arising from gaps, errors, and biases in electronic health records (EHRs) due to workflow-related factors (e.g. staffing-level), and heterogeneity of patient populations and measurement devices. We propose to continue our prior work by designing new deep learning architectures that are more robust to data missingness and biases introduced through the variability in process of care, 2) development of new learning methodologies to improve generalizability of the proposed models under data/population drifts (aka distributional changes), 3) enhanced metadata design to assist in quantifying ‘conditions for use’ of such algorithms via algorithmic controls, and 4) HL7 and FHIR-based prospective implementation and testing of these methodologies to provide real-world evidence for the effectiveness of the proposed approaches. Ultimately, these novel methodologies and tools will enhance our ability to use EHR and other types of continuously measured longitudinal data to predict adverse events, assess patients’ response to therapy, and optimize and personalize care at the beside. The proposed project is making use of computers to analyze data from sickest patients in hospitals. We want to develop methods that work across different demographics groups and hospital settings to identify patterns in the patient data which predict who is at risk for life- threatening conditions such as Sepsis and Acute Kidney Injury (AKI), and who might respond to various medications which could make them better. We have a very strong team of doctors and researchers who work closely together, covering all aspects of the proposed research, which we hope will help us improve the lives of the sickest patients in the hospitals.","Enhanced Metadata Design, Architecture, and Learning (MeDAL) for Development of Generalizable Deep Learning-based Predictive Analytics from Electronic Health Records",10265157,R56LM013517,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Antibiotics', 'Architecture', 'Area Under Curve', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biometry', 'Calibration', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Data Provenance', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Expenditure', 'Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'General Hospitals', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Expenditures', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Inflammation', 'Institution', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Learning', 'Length of Stay', 'Life', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Metadata', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Organ failure', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Estimate', 'Savings', 'Sepsis', 'Septic Shock', 'Site', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'Variant', 'Work', 'acute care', 'aging population', 'authority', 'base', 'cloud based', 'deep learning', 'demographics', 'design', 'improved', 'interest', 'novel', 'patient population', 'patient response', 'personalized care', 'portability', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'pressure', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'research and development', 'response', 'septic patients', 'theories', 'tool', 'treatment optimization', 'ward']",NLM,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R56,2020,393958,-0.0455098661445033
"Methods for High-Dimensional Statistical Inference and Individualized Risk Prediction under Semi-Competing Risks Project Summary/Abstract Patient care has been transformed by the availability of high-dimensional sources like electronic health records (EHR) and genomic data, allowing health care decisions to be tailored to individual patients. Statistical methods have been developed to efﬁciently use such high dimensional data, but critical gaps still remain. Several common models for survival analysis have recently been extended to accommodate high-dimensional variable selection and machine learning prediction methods, but similar tools have not yet been developed for the setting of semi- competing risks. In the semi-competing risks setting, interest focuses on jointly modeling both a terminal time- to-event outcome, as well as a non-terminal time-to-event outcome which can only occur for subjects who have not yet experienced the terminal event. Examples of this exist in severe pregnancy-related diseases such as pre-eclampsia (PE - further described below). PE and subsequent delivery are natural semi-competing risks, as PE can develop before delivery, but not after. Current methods do not provide analysts with data-driven tools for uncovering important covariates from high-dimensional data, and clinicians lack meaningful, personalized predictions of patients' joint probability of experiencing one or both outcomes prospectively through time.  This proposal addresses these methodological gaps with tools for high-dimensional inference and prediction. In Aim 1, I will address the challenge of variable selection by developing a suite of regularized estimators for se- lecting important covariates from large datasets into a semi-competing risks model, and evaluating performance by simulation. In Aim 2, I will create a deep feed forward neural network modeling framework for predicting individual patients' joint probabilities of experiencing one or both outcomes of interest across future time points. Together, these aims will improve personalization of health care decisions. Software will be developed that provides researchers practical and user-friendly tools for applying these methods. In Aim 3, I will apply these approaches for semi-competing risks to evaluate risk of PE, which is globally a leading cause of maternal and fetal/neonatal mortality and morbidity. Using EHR pregnancy data from 50,000 births between 2011-2020, I will use the proposed variable selection methods to develop a model identifying risk factors for PE along with factors affecting time-to-delivery among PE patients. Through this work, I will also build a deep learning model in order to jointly predict maternal PE and NICU admission of the infant, yielding personalized prediction plots to facilitate care decisions that balance maternal and fetal health risks. For ease of use by clinicians and patients, I will disseminate this prediction model using an interactive online tool. Project Narrative  Using personalized risk prediction to help clinicians and patients make health care decisions is a vital and rapidly growing way to improve outcomes and quality of care. However, in the common survival analysis setting known as semi-competing risks where both a non-terminal event and a terminal event are of interest, there lack adequate methods for modeling patients' joint risks using high-dimensional data sources such as electronic health records. The focus of this proposal is the development of statistical and machine-learning methods for this setting to predict individual patients' prospective joint risk over time of experiencing one or both outcomes of interest, and apply them to risk stratiﬁcation and individualized prediction of outcomes for preeclampsia in pregnant women.",Methods for High-Dimensional Statistical Inference and Individualized Risk Prediction under Semi-Competing Risks,9992419,F31HD102159,"['Address', 'Admission activity', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Birth', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Developed Countries', 'Developing Countries', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Equilibrium', 'Event', 'Fellowship', 'Fetal health', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Infant', 'Israel', 'Joints', 'Journals', 'Lasso', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuscripts', 'Maternal Health', 'Medical center', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Mothers', 'Neonatal', 'Neonatal Mortality', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Performance', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnant Women', 'Premature Birth', 'Probability', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Quality of Care', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Survival Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Woman', 'Work', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'falls', 'feedforward neural network', 'fetal', 'flexibility', 'genomic data', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'interactive tool', 'interest', 'large datasets', 'machine learning method', 'method development', 'multidimensional data', 'neonatal morbidity', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'personalized decision', 'personalized health care', 'personalized predictions', 'personalized risk prediction', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'simulation', 'skills', 'statistical and machine learning', 'tailored health care', 'theories', 'tool', 'unborn child', 'user-friendly']",NICHD,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,F31,2020,39120,-0.010231782154920382
"Machine Learning of Physiological Waveforms and Electronic Health Record Data to Predict, Diagnose, and Treat Hemodynamic Instability in Surgical Patients Project Summary / Abstract If one could accurately predict who, when and why patients develop cardiorespiratory instability (CRI) during surgery, then effective preemptive treatments could be given to improve postoperative outcome and more effectively use healthcare resources. But signs of shock often occur late once organ injury is already present. The goal of this proposal is to develop, validate, and test real-time intraoperative risk prediction tools based on electronic health record (EHR) data and high-fidelity physiological waveforms to predict CRI and make the databases of intraoperative data and waveforms used for these developments freely accessible. This is extremely relevant because although 5.7 million Americans are admitted to an Intensive Care Units (ICU) in one year, more than 42 millions undergo surgery annually. Previous and ongoing studies conducted in the ICU and in the step down unit have built the architecture to collect real-time high-fidelity physiological waveform data streams and integrate them with patient demographics from the EHR to build large data sets, and derive actionable fused parameters based on machine learning (ML) analytics as well as display information in real time at the bedside to drive clinical decision support (CDS) in the critical care setting. The goal of this proposal is to apply these ML approaches to the complex and time compressed environment of high-risk surgery where greater patient and disease variability exist and shorter period of time is available to deliver truly personalized medicine approaches. The work will be initiated using an already existing annotated intraoperative database from the University of California Irvine including EHR and high-fidelity waveform data. This operating room database already exists and needs only to be extracted. This data will be used for the initial training and development of the ML model that will then be tested on prospectively collected University of California Los Angeles and University of Pittsburgh Medical Center databases. Simultaneously, this approach will use existing knowledge of CRI patterns derived from previous step down unit / intensive care unit cohorts, MIMIC II data, University of California Irvine data, and animal studies to create smart alarms and graphic user interface for clinical decision support based on functional hemodynamic monitoring principles. The next step will then leverage the focus on the issues and strengths of the intraoperative environment, some of which can be listed as: 1) Known patients characteristics before surgery to define pre-stress baseline, allowing functional hemodynamic monitoring stress evaluations, preconditioning, and other preoperative calibrations, 2) High degree of direct observation and data density during most phases of surgery allowing close semi-autonomous monitoring and titration of novel treatment algorithms early, 3) Defined stages in the initial part of surgery (induction, intubation, skin incision) allowing ML approaches to build large common relational database registries, and 4) Defined surgical procedure and stressors (anesthesia induction, intra-abdominal air insufflation, and other surgery-specific interventions), which will alter the impact of CRI on measured variables. Project Narrative The purpose of this study is to first develop multivariable models through data-driven classification techniques to predict parsimoniously cardiorespiratory instability, etiology and response to treatment in patients undergoing high-risk surgery. Using high-fidelity intraoperative physiological waveform data augmented with extensive electronic health record derived annotation and applying machine learning approaches we will characterize and quantify common patterns in subjects destined to develop cardiorespiratory instability during high-risk surgery. We will use these inputs in simulated real-time bedside management to develop an iteratively designed prototype clinical decision support system suitable for intraoperative care.","Machine Learning of Physiological Waveforms and Electronic Health Record Data to Predict, Diagnose, and Treat Hemodynamic Instability in Surgical Patients",9846016,R01HL144692,"['Acute', 'Adopted', 'Air', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anesthesia procedures', 'Animals', 'Architecture', 'Calibration', 'California', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Homeostasis', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hospitals', 'Hypotension', 'Insufflation', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Intra-abdominal', 'Intraoperative Care', 'Intraoperative Period', 'Intubation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Operating Rooms', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perioperative', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Postoperative Complications', 'Postoperative Period', 'Process', 'Recommendation', 'Registries', 'Resources', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Shock', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin', 'Specificity', 'Stress', 'Surgical incisions', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Titrations', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'data integration', 'data streams', 'data structure', 'database structure', 'deep neural network', 'demographics', 'density', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'electronic data', 'graphical user interface', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'information display', 'insight', 'interoperability', 'iterative design', 'large datasets', 'machine learning algorithm', 'model development', 'mortality', 'neural network algorithm', 'novel', 'organ injury', 'patient population', 'personalized medicine', 'preconditioning', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'pressure', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'relational database', 'response', 'simulation environment', 'stressor', 'structured data', 'support tools', 'surgical risk', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2020,648089,-0.016135945856447103
"Characterizing patients at risk for sepsis through Big Data Characterizing Patients at Risk for Sepsis Through Big Data SUMMARY The goal of this KL2 research proposal is create an extension of an existing data-driven sepsis algorithm, the artificial intelligence sepsis expert (AISE), by forecasting the type and sequence of sepsis-specific organ failure using clinical data from the electronic medical record, then identifying the incremental benefit received by adding high-resolution data derived from cardiovascular waveforms (arterial waveform and electrocardiographic waves), and small molecule metabolite data over time to provide some mechanistic context. The most important data (features) used in real-time from AISE will be used as inputs for a fuzzy k- means clustering algorithm (“Saving Organs from Sepsis”, or SOS) using retrospectively-collected data, designed to better characterize patients at risk for sepsis by their organ failure. I have selected three organs in particular: shock, acute respiratory failure, and acute kidney injury (AKI). Principal component analyses (PCA) data from 2,375 ICU patients with sepsis will be projected onto a novel visual representation for patient phenotyping based on risk of (trajectory toward) different types of organ failure. I will identify if this SOS algorithm can accurately forecast new organ failure within 12 hours based on SOS. To better understand the impact of specific features on organ failure, I will test the ability of each high- resolution features, and metabolomics data to forecast septic shock. Among those who develop septic shock, I will measure all nine high-resolution features from the beginning of the ICU stay up to shock onset and compare those changes to those who develop sepsis but not septic shock, and those who do not develop sepsis. I will then see if the collective addition of high-resolution data improves performance of septic shock forecasting. Finally, I will conduct a prospective observational study to collect metabolomic information in a 60- patient study to identify the incremental improvement of adding metabolomics data to SOS for predicting septic shock, over SOS with just EMR and waveform data. The results of this work will provide preliminary data for further career development and NIH-funding. The long-term goal would be to build a model that optimizes the timing of appropriate therapy, thus decreasing the incidence of sepsis and associated organ failure. As a K23 candidate, I will use this award to acquire formal didactic training and more hands-on experience in machine learning, signal processing, metabolomics analysis. I will seek focused training that will complement my experience as a clinical trialist so that I can design high-quality studies to contribute to Big Data analytics in critical care research and practice. My overarching career goal is to become a leader in the application of Big Data analysis of critically ill patients to predict progression of disease, specifically sepsis. The Emory environment is an ideal place to develop these capabilities. Emory Healthcare houses over 200 medical, surgical, and subspecialty ICU beds, many of which are “wired” to store streaming data. In addition to the physical resources, my development will be enhanced by my superb mentorship team, led by Dr. Greg Martin. PROJECT NARRATIVE Sepsis, the body’s response to a life-threatening infection that causes damage to itself, is a leading cause of death in the U.S. and around the world, and failure of vital organs is one of the biggest contributors. This project is designed to predict organ failure specific to sepsis using cutting-edge artificial intelligence technology using readily-available information, and experimental blood tests.

"A Protocol-Driven, Digital Conversational Agent at the Hospital Bedside to Support Nurse Teams and to Mitigate Delirium and Falls Risk Abstract About 700,000 to 1 million falls per year occur during hospital stays in the US, costing hospitals $3 billion to $7 billion each year to treat. These costs are not reimbursed by the Centers of Medicare and Medicaid, resulting in significant financial losses for hospitals. Delirium, a major cause of falls, is highly prevalent (29%-64%) among hospitalized elders. Even without causing a fall, the average case of delirium increases the length of stay by 7.78 days, disrupting throughput and significantly reducing net hospital revenues. Including the common sequelae of post-discharge functional decline, delirium costs the national healthcare system over $130 billion per year. Due to the high cost and significant psychosocial needs of certain hospitalized patients, a widely-used intervention to mitigate risk is to assign hospital staff & nurses to serve as “patient sitters” at the bedside, at a cost of $1 million/year for a typical hospital. However, despite the workforce burden and expense, patient sitters often do not reliably execute risk-mitigating protocols, and the literature does not support their efficacy in preventing adverse events. In this SBIR Fast-Track proposal, we seek to develop an advanced, human-in-the-loop artificial intelligence (AI) avatar system to enhance the wellbeing of hospitalized patients, avoid adverse events including delirium and falls, and improve workforce efficiency by supporting nursing staff to work at the top of their license, potentially generating savings of $2,000,000 each year for a typical 300-bed hospital. This proposal aligns with NINR’s cross-cutting focus areas of Promoting Innovation and 21st Century Nurse Scientists, while applying the principles of patient self-management and wellness to the acute care environment, where the outcomes driven by our patient engagement and support platform will have an outsized, immediate cost benefit to enable rapid scaling and dissemination.

"An artificial intelligence-driven distributed stereotactic radiosurgery strategy for multiple brain metastases management PROJECT SUMMARY Brain metastases (BMs) are a life-threatening neurological disease, but current treatment regimens cannot manage multiple (>4) BMs (mBMs) without causing strong adverse effects. Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), utilizing potent dose to irradiate BMs and quick dose falloff to spare nearby tissues, has proven to be an effective treatment regimen for limited-number and small-size BMs. However, SRS could not avoid high toxic dose when BMs are multiple, clustered, or adjacent to critical organs. To safe and effectively treat mBMs with SRS requires addressing these urgent needs: 1) to identify the maximum tolerable SRS dose; 2) to study neurocognitive decline and design strategies to preserve patients’ post-treatment quality of life; and 3) to develop and implement high-quality streamlined mBMs SRS treatment and follow-up care. To address mBMs SRS management needs, we aim to develop and implement an artificial intelligence (AI)- driven treatment planning system (TPS) and conduct a therapeutic intervention clinical trial, both dedicated to improve mBMs SRS treatment quality and efficiency. The AI-driven TPS, namely AimBMs, will have three AI- based computational modules, including AI-Segtor for automatic segmentation, AI-Predictor for treatment outcome prediction and AI-Planner for spatiotemporal distributed SRS plan optimization. AimBMs is initially developed based on retrospective data and facilitate the mBMs distributed SRS prospective phase I/II clinical trials, while the clinical trial will provide critical clinical knowledge and evidence as feedback to improve AimBMs performance. The ultimate goal of the project is to translate the AimBMs to routine clinical practice to improve mBMs SRS treatment quality, patients’ post-treatment QoL, and clinical facility workflow. In response to PAR-18-560, we have formed a multidisciplinary collaboration between radiation oncologists and medical physicists to develop a novel AI-driven distributed SRS technology and conduct a cancer-targeted therapeutic intervention for managing mBMs. The project’s innovations include: 1) novel SRS treatment planning technological capability enabled by AI-based auto-segmentation, treatment outcome prediction, and spatiotemporal plan optimization; 2) novel AI learning capability to improve developed AI tools’ performance through the coherent clinical trial. The technology development will support the therapeutic intervention clinical trial, while the clinical trial is designated to improve the developed system performance. This seamlessly integrated development mode ensures the developed system is clinically practical. Upon completion, our newly developed AimBMs will lay a solid foundation for mBMs SRS management and benefit a wide population of patients with BMs. Moreover, the AI-based treatment planning and treatment delivery infrastructure built for mBMs SRS can be transferred to other tumor sites to generate an even broader clinical impact. PROJECT NARRATIVE Patients with multiple brain metastases, a cancer which has spread to multiple places in the brain, have poor survival or quality of life after single fraction stereotactic radiosurgery or whole brain radiotherapy. We will develop and study a new treatment strategy for multiple brain metastases using spatial and temporal fractionated stereotactic radiosurgery by frameless GammaKnife.

"Machine Learning to Optimize Management of Acute Hydrocephalus Patients 37,000 patients a year receive an external ventricular drain (EVD) in the setting of acute hydrocephalus in the US, generating in-hospital charges of $151,672 per patient, or $5.6 billion dollars a year. There is great motivation in the neurointensive care unit for the optimization of EVD management to reduce infection rates, accurately determine need for permanent shunting, and to do so efficiently in order to minimize duration of drainage and length of stay (LOS). Risk factors for ventriculitis include EVD duration, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sampling frequency, presence of intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), and insertion technique. Severe CSF disturbances in patients with IVH and EVDs limit the value of routine CSF analysis for ventriculitis prediction. And ventriculitis diagnosis is imprecise, with only a minority declaring culture positivity while all still demanding antibiotic treatment and delay of permanent shunt. This leads to unnecessary empiric antibiotic treatment and increased LOS (30.8 vs 22.6 days), with the associated cost ($30,335 more) and morbidity (e.g. Clostridium difficile infection, emergence of drug-resistant pathology). The process of determining permanent shunt dependence is variable between institutions, particularly around the decision of when to begin weaning the EVD or predicting delayed resolution. These decisions in the subacute period determine LOS and associated adverse events, exposure to radiography, and commitment to potentially unnecessary permanent foreign materials in the CNS, which then carry lifelong risks for infection and blockage. There is no accurate noninvasive test (that does not further introduce infection) to diagnose ventriculitis nor is there a timely method to predict need for permanent shunt after acute hydrocephalus. To fill this gap, we propose developing a quantitative model from intracranial pressure (ICP) waveform analysis to increase precision in the diagnosis of ventriculitis and accurately predict need for permanent shunt. In previous work, we were able to predict with good accuracy who would need permanent shunt placement using ICP waveform analysis collected during a 24 hour clamp trial. However, a complex model can only be justified if it achieves a diagnosis earlier or more accurately than traditional clinical methods. In preliminary work, we clustered raw ICP waveforms and found a pattern of waveforms specific for ventriculitis that appears 1 day before diagnostic cultures are sent. Our central hypothesis is that there is a temporal quantitative signal in ICP waveform reflective of intracranial dynamics that can be harvested to optimize acute hydrocephalus management. Impact and Significance: Noninvasive quantitative models based on ICP waveform analysis that diagnose ventriculitis and accurately predict need for permanent shunt would decrease the duration of EVD and the frequency of CSF sampling, two of the risk factors for ventriculitis, while also decreasing LOS, associated adverse events of ICU stay, and empiric antibiotics. There is no accurate noninvasive test to diagnose ventriculitis nor is there a timely method to predict need for permanent shunt after acute hydrocephalus. To fill this gap, we propose developing a quantitative model from intracranial pressure waveform analysis to increase precision in the diagnosis of ventriculitis and accurately predict need for permanent shunt. Accurate noninvasive sequential machine learning models could decrease external ventricular drain duration and cerebrospinal fluid sampling frequency, two of the risk factors for ventriculitis, while also decreasing length of stay and empiric systemic antibiotics.",Machine Learning to Optimize Management of Acute Hydrocephalus Patients,10057040,R21NS113055,"['Acute', 'Adverse event', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Caring', 'Cerebral hemisphere hemorrhage', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid Proteins', 'Clinical', 'Clostridium difficile', 'Closure by clamp', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Drainage procedure', 'Drug resistance', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Exposure to', 'Frequencies', 'Harvest', 'Healthcare', 'Hospital Charges', 'Hour', 'Hydrocephalus', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory', 'Information Retrieval', 'Institution', 'Intracranial Pressure', 'Learning', 'Length of Stay', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphology', 'Motivation', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurosurgeon', 'Output', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Process', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Shunt Device', 'Signal Transduction', 'Subarachnoid Hemorrhage', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Ventricular', 'Weaning', 'Work', 'base', 'cost', 'improved', 'infection rate', 'infection risk', 'intraventricular hemorrhage', 'long short term memory', 'recurrent neural network', 'vector']",NINDS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R21,2020,445500,-0.004645326489639682
"Therapeutic potential of vagal neurostimulation to reduce food intake Obesity affects almost 40% percent of US adults and is associated with high levels of comorbidities, including cancer, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Although effective treatments with minimal side effects are lacking, vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) can reduce body weight and suppress feeding behavior. There is little insight, however, into its mechanism and it is unclear whether VNS effects on feeding and body weight result from non-specific side effects, such as nausea. The current application directly addresses these issues by assessing gastrointestinal (GI) myoelectric changes as a potential mechanism for effects of VNS on feeding behavior, while comparing these responses to emetic activation. We plan to accomplish this by using a ferret model, which is a gold-standard for studying emesis, vagus nerve, and GI physiology. We will test the hypothesis that electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve can reduce food intake without triggering indicators of nausea, such as disrupted GI myoelectric responses, retching, and vomiting. We will complete three Aims. Aim 1: Define the individualized GI myoelectric patterns during feeding behavior using machine learning classification. Animals will be implanted with planar electrodes attached to the GI serosal surface from proximal gastric fundus to distal duodenum. We will use machine learning to classify GI myoelectric patterns of meal consumption compared to emetic-related states, including those elicited by intragastric emetine and high amplitude and frequency VNS known to trigger emesis. Aim 2: Test the efficacy of abdominal VNS on reducing meal size without triggering disruptions of GI myoelectric responses, retching, and emesis. Animals will be assessed for effects of abdominal VNS using a variety of stimulus parameters on feeding behavior and multi-site GI myoelectric recordings. Aim 3: Determine the efficacy of cervical VNS in controlling meal size without producing off-target effects (disruptions of GI myoelectric responses, retching, emesis, changes in heart rate, or blood pressure). We will test the impact of cervical VNS parameters on feeding behavior, GI myoelectric responses, retching, emesis, hear rate variability, and blood pressure. Our approach is innovative because we will use machine learning classification to detect individualized GI myoelectric response patterns in an awake free-moving animal for comparing therapeutic and off-target effects of VNS on feeding, GI activity, emesis, and cardiovascular function. This planned research is significant because VNS therapy can potentially provide a frontline treatment option for patients with high levels of obesity refractory to behavioral or pharmacological therapy, which unlike other surgical interventions for weight loss, such as gastric bypass, is potentially tunable and reversible by changing stimulation parameters, switching the device off, or complete removal. Obesity affects almost 40% percent of US adults, is associated with type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer, and has a health-care cost that could total nearly one trillion US dollars by 2030. The current project is designed to test vagus nerve stimulation to reduce food intake, while limiting adverse effects, such as nausea, vomiting, and disrupted gastrointestinal function.

"Integrated prediction of cardiovascular events by automated coronary plaque and pericoronary adipose tissue quantification from CT Angiography PROJECT SUMMARY Coronary artery disease remains the leading cause of death worldwide, and more than half of the individuals suffering myocardial infarction (heart attacks) have no premonitory symptoms. Studies of patients with coronary artery disease have traditionally focused only on the severity of narrowing (stenosis) of the coronary arteries by atherosclerotic plaques, rather than the adverse features of coronary plaques which are predisposed to rupture and precipitate myocardial infarction. Coronary CT Angiography (CTA) is a noninvasive test that allows assessment of both coronary stenosis and plaque characteristics. Currently, however, CTA is interpreted visually for stenosis. Quantitative measurements of CTA stenosis severity and plaque features are not part of current clinical routine.  We propose to develop novel image processing algorithms for fully automated, robust quantification of coronary plaque features from CTA. We also propose to automatically quantify the characteristics of adipose tissue around the coronary arteries (pericoronary adipose tissue, PCAT), which have been shown to differentiate rupture-prone, high-risk coronary plaques from stable ones. We propose to apply machine learning methods to efficiently combine stenosis, plaque and PCAT features, along with patient clinical data, into a new integrated risk score for the prediction of future adverse cardiovascular events. We will evaluate this risk score in the real-world, prospective, landmark SCOT-HEART trial (including all 2073 patients in the CTA arm of the trial), with added external validation in large multicenter patient registries, with available CTA scans, clinical data, and followup for cardiovascular events (fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction and cardiovascular death in a grand total of 7844 patients). We propose three specific aims: 1) To refine, expand and automate measurements of coronary plaque and lumen for the entire coronary artery tree, and to standardize measurement of plaque changes in serial CTA; 2) To evaluate the prognostic value of automatically-quantified plaque features and PCAT characteristics for the prediction of future MACE in the prospective SCOT-HEART trial and multicenter CTA registries; 3) To develop and evaluate with full external validation a new automated patient risk score—combining patient clinical data, CTA-measured quantitative plaque features and PCAT characteristics, using machine learning—for the prediction of future MACE events in the prospective SCOT-HEART trial and multicenter CTA registries.  The proposed work will enable automated, multi-faceted and reproducible analysis of plaque, stenosis and PCAT from CTA, combined with objective risk scores reflecting likelihood of adverse cardiovascular events. This work will provide a novel, personalized, real-world paradigm that objectively and accurately identifies individual patients at risk of future cardiovascular events, from routine CTA imaging. PROJECT NARRATIVE (lay language) In patients who are at risk of developing a heart attack, imaging of the heart with coronary Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA) allows doctors to noninvasively assess the narrowing of the coronary arteries caused by coronary plaque deposits, as well as the coronary plaques themselves. The researchers propose to develop and validate novel computerized scores derived from real-world CTA and clinical patient data using artificial intelligence, that will automatically identify the patients who are at highest risk of suffering a heart attack or cardiovascular death. This new research will allow physicians to more precisely identify patients for whom appropriate treatment could be prescribed, to reduce their risk of future adverse cardiovascular events.",Integrated prediction of cardiovascular events by automated coronary plaque and pericoronary adipose tissue quantification from CT Angiography,9981397,R01HL148787,"['Adipose tissue', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Angiography', 'Arterial Fatty Streak', 'Arteries', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Cardiac Death', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical assessments', 'Complex', 'Consumption', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary Stenosis', 'Coronary artery', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Event', 'Future', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Language', 'Longterm Follow-up', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Registries', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Rupture', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Stenosis', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trees', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'Work', 'acute coronary syndrome', 'arm', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'clinically significant', 'computerized', 'coronary calcium scoring', 'coronary computed tomography angiography', 'coronary event', 'coronary plaque', 'density', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'heart imaging', 'high risk', 'image processing', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'patient registry', 'prognostic significance', 'prognostic value', 'prospective']",NHLBI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2020,714763,5.529806044965045e-06
"Objective Quantification of Neural Damage for Screening, Diagnosis and Monitoring of Glaucoma with Fundus Photographs PROJECT SUMMARY Glaucoma is a progressive optic neuropathy and the leading cause of irreversible blindness in the world. As the disease remains largely asymptomatic until late stages, there is a pressing need to develop affordable approaches for screening before visual impairment occurs. Although sophisticated imaging technologies such as Spectral domain-optical coherence tomography (SDOCT) can provide highly reproducible and accurate quantitative assessment of glaucomatous damage, their application in widespread screening or non-specialized settings is unfeasible, given the high cost and operator requirements. Fundus photography is a low-cost alternative that has been used successfully in teleophthalmology programs. However, subjective human grading of fundus photos for glaucoma is poorly reproducible and highly inaccurate, as gradings tend to largely over- or underestimate damage. We propose a new paradigm for assessing glaucomatous damage by training a deep learning (DL) convolutional neural network to provide quantitative estimates of the amount of neural damage from fundus photographs. In our Machine-to-Machine (M2M) approach, we trained a DL network to analyze fundus photos and predict quantitative measurements of glaucomatous damage provided by SDOCT, such as retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness and neuroretinal rim measurements. Our preliminary results showed that the M2M predictions have very high correlation and agreement with the original SDOCT observations. This provides an objective method to quantify neural damage in fundus photos without requiring human graders, which could potentially be used for screening, diagnoses and monitoring in teleophthalmology and non- specialized point-of-care settings. In this proposal, we aim at refining and validating the M2M model in suitable, large datasets from population-based studies, electronic medical records, and clinical trial data. Our central hypothesis is that the M2M approach will be more accurate than subjective human gradings in screening, diagnosing, predicting and detecting longitudinal damage over time. In Aim 1, we will investigate the performance of the M2M model to screen for glaucomatous damage using large datasets from 6 population-based studies: Blue Mountains Eye Study, Los Angeles Latino Eye Study, Tema Eye Survey, Beijing Eye Study, Central India Eye and Medical Study and the Ural Eye and Medical Study, which will provide data on over 25,000 subjects of diverse racial groups. In Aim 2, we will investigate the ability of the M2M model to predict future development of glaucoma in eyes of suspects using the data from the Ocular Hypertension Treatment Study (OHTS). In Aim 3, we will investigate the ability of the M2M model in detecting glaucomatous progression over time using data from the Duke Glaucoma Registry, a large database of longitudinal structure and function data in glaucoma with over 25,000 patients followed over time. If successful, this proposal will lead to a validated, inexpensive, and widely applicable tool for screening, early diagnosis and monitoring of glaucoma, that could be applied under population-based settings and also at non-specialized point-of-care settings. Project Narrative Glaucoma is a leading cause of irreversible visual impairment in the world. This proposal will employ a novel artificial intelligence paradigm for quantifying neural damage on ocular fundus photographs for the purpose of screening, diagnosing and monitoring glaucoma damage. The approach will be validated on large datasets from population-based studies, electronic medical records and clinical trial data.","Objective Quantification of Neural Damage for Screening, Diagnosis and Monitoring of Glaucoma with Fundus Photographs",10047364,R21EY031898,"['Agreement', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Blindness', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Exhibits', 'Eye', 'Eye diseases', 'Fundus', 'Fundus photography', 'Future', 'Glaucoma', 'Human', 'Imaging technology', 'India', 'Investigation', 'Label', 'Latino', 'Los Angeles', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Names', 'Nature', 'Ocular Hypertension', 'Ophthalmology', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population Study', 'Race', 'Reference Standards', 'Registries', 'Reproducibility', 'Risk', 'Science', 'Screening procedure', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Visual impairment', 'algorithm training', 'clinical care', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'deep neural network', 'flexibility', 'hypertension treatment', 'intelligent algorithm', 'interest', 'large datasets', 'learning network', 'longitudinal database', 'novel', 'optic nerve disorder', 'point of care', 'population based', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'racial diversity', 'relating to nervous system', 'retinal nerve fiber layer', 'screening', 'time use', 'tool']",NEI,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R21,2020,241500,-0.02067898222393587
"Deep Learning and Fluid Dynamics Based Phenotyping of Expiratory Central Airway Collapse Project Summary/ Abstract Expiratory central airway collapse (ECAC), defined by >50% collapse of large airways during expiration, resulting from either cartilaginous weakening or redundancy of the posterior membranous wall of the trachea, is an increasingly recognized disorder associated with cigarette smoking and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Airflow obstruction in smokers primarily arises from increased resistance to airflow in the small distal conducting airways <2 mm in diameter. It is plausible that in a subset of smokers with and without COPD, central airway collapse results in additional resistance to airflow, resulting in substantial respiratory morbidity. Ninety-two million adults in the Unites States are active or past smokers, and ECAC is present in approximately 5% of current and former smokers. The presence of ECAC is associated with greater dyspnea, worse respiratory-quality of life and greater frequency of exacerbations after adjustment for underlying lung disease. Whether these patients will benefit from interventional therapies such as stenting or tracheopexy depends on whether the airflow resistance caused by ECAC contributes to symptoms, and this in turn depends on the relative contribution of central and small airways to overall airflow resistance. If the overall airflow resistance is primarily due to distal small airways obstruction in a given patient with ECAC, treating central airway collapse is unlikely to benefit such a patient. Our central hypothesis is that ECAC results in additional airflow obstruction beyond that incurred in the small airways, and that in a subset of patients the central airways are the major site of airflow obstruction and hence are amenable to therapy. The complex interplay of proximal and distal airway resistances and transpulmonary pressures does not lend itself to direct measurements in human subjects across a range of physiological pressure and flow changes. We propose a combination of CT-derived imaging and patient-personalized benchtop model and deep learning to answer these questions with the following specific aims. Aim 1 of this application will be to derive personalized patient- specific information on airway geometry and resistance using airway segmentation from computed tomography (CT) scans. We will calculate airway resistances in central and small airways using standard formulae. The goal of Aim 2 is to create bench-top simulations to understand the complex interplay between the resistance of small and large airways. In Aim 3, we will use deep learning to derive probability scores for clinically substantial ECAC from segmented airway images on computed tomography. The results of our study will enable patient-specific personalized therapies for ECAC. The mechanistic insights gained from this study will help identify patients with clinically significant ECAC and hence most likely to benefit from therapeutic interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE Expiratory central airway collapse (ECAC), greater than 50% collapse of the large airways during expiration, is present in 5% of chronic smokers, and is associated with substantial respiratory morbidity disproportionate to underlying lung disease. Resistance to airflow in smokers is thought to primarily occur in the small conducting airways. By using benchtop models and deep learning to determine the effect of central airway collapse on overall airway resistance and its contribution to airflow obstruction relative to small airway resistance, the proposed project will identify patients with ECAC who will benefit from intervention, and cause a paradigm shift in the therapy of these patients.",Deep Learning and Fluid Dynamics Based Phenotyping of Expiratory Central Airway Collapse,10013198,R21EB027891,"['3-Dimensional', '3D Print', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Air Movements', 'Airway Resistance', 'Area', 'Body mass index', 'Breathing', 'Caliber', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Dyspnea', 'Exhalation', 'Forced expiratory volume function', 'Frequencies', 'Generations', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Length', 'Liquid substance', 'Lung diseases', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Probability', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Pulmonary Function Test/Forced Expiratory Volume 1', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Resistance', 'Scanning', 'Site', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Spirometry', 'Stents', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Trachea', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Tube', 'United States', 'Visualization', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'airway obstruction', 'base', 'cartilaginous', 'cigarette smoking', 'clinical application', 'clinical predictors', 'clinically significant', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'expiration', 'human subject', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'patient subsets', 'personalized medicine', 'pressure', 'respiratory', 'respiratory morbidity', 'response', 'sex', 'simulation', 'three-dimensional modeling']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,R21,2020,187049,-0.004051564390979539
"A New Tool to Rapidly Diagnose Sepsis using Flow Imaging Microscopy and Machine Learning Project Summary  Sepsis is a serious condition induced by an infection, often by a bacterial pathogen, leading to organ damage or even death. Despite numerous advances in medicine over the years, the condition still affects millions of people in both developed and developing countries. In the US, sepsis affects 1.7M and kills over 265,000 people annually. Sepsis mortality rates in developing countries are substantially higher. In terms of demographics, sepsis affects humans of all age and race, but it is most pronounced at the age extremes (infants and the elderly) and patients whose immune system is already under strain due to other illnesses or immune system-weakening therapies, e.g., cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy.  Blood cultures are currently the default technique used in detecting and diagnosing the root cause of sepsis. However, blood-cultures can take upwards of 24-48 hours in order to obtain results. In that time, the patient can experience irreversible harm due to the condition if not treated properly. Unfortunately, precise and effective antibiotic treatment requires knowledge of the pathogen causing sepsis. Beyond a long time to get an answer, blood cultures often exhibit alarmingly high false negatives (failure to detect a pathogen causing sepsis) and typically do not precisely identify the pathogen causing sepsis.  Hence there have been several efforts aimed at detecting and identifying the broad range of potential pathogens causing sepsis and circumventing the need for blood cultures. However, many of the recently proposed methods for detecting and diagnosing sepsis exhibit one or more of the following drawbacks: (i) they lack high sensitivity (ability to detect a pathogen); (ii) they cannot accurately identify a broad range of pathogens from a single sam- ple; (iii) take a (relatively) long time; (iv) require a large volume of blood; or (v) cannot be used in the real-time monitoring of sepsis (either detecting pathogens known to cause sepsis or quantifying the patient's response to antimicrobial treatment).  We are proposing a new sepsis detection method, combining ﬂow imaging microscopy (a high-throughput technique for imaging millions of microscopic particles) and deep learning based image analysis (techniques leveraged in facial recognition and self-driving cars) to overcome the above mentioned limitations. The approach has proven capable of detecting a variety of bacterial species in low concentrations of mouse blood in less than 1 hour of processing time with as little as 50 L of blood. In this proposal, one of our aims is to optimize our approach and quantify the accuracy and limits of detection in human blood. Our patent pending approach has also been licensed to a major manufacturer of ﬂow imaging microscopes. Another aim of this research is to begin integration of our technology with an existing commercial instrument with the intention of providing a compact self- contained device that can be deployed at numerous hospitals world-wide. The implementation of our platform should have a major impact on antimicrobial treatment in all areas of the hospital. Project Narrative  Sepsis affects 1.7M US citizens (causing roughly 270k deaths) each year; the condition is also the most expensive condition treated in US hospitals costing approximately 24B USD each year. Current methods for detecting and determining the source of the infection causing sepsis are inaccurate, too slow, and do not provide detailed pathogen speciﬁc information needed for effective treatment. Our proposal aims at developing a fast approach, combining ﬂow imaging microscopy and deep learning, for detecting and determining the root cause of sepsis from blood samples (addressing many issues facing sepsis detection and diagnosis) which can deployed at a variety of hospitals worldwide.",A New Tool to Rapidly Diagnose Sepsis using Flow Imaging Microscopy and Machine Learning,10078833,R43EB029863,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bacteria', 'Bedside Testings', 'Blood', 'Blood Cells', 'Blood Volume', 'Blood specimen', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Classification Scheme', 'Colony-forming units', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Systems', 'Culture Techniques', 'DNA', 'Detection', 'Developed Countries', 'Developing Countries', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Face', 'Failure', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Guidelines', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Immune system', 'Infant', 'Infant Mortality', 'Infection', 'Intention', 'Knowledge', 'Legal patent', 'Length of Stay', 'Letters', 'Licensing', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Medicine', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Microfluidic Microchips', 'Microscopic', 'Microscopy', 'Mus', 'Newborn Infant', 'Optics', 'Organ', 'Organism', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Premature Birth', 'Preparation', 'Race', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Secure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sepsis', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'age group', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'chemotherapy', 'clinically relevant', 'data exchange', 'deep learning', 'demographics', 'detector', 'digital imaging', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'human DNA', 'human old age (65+)', 'image processing', 'improved', 'infant death', 'instrument', 'intrapartum', 'microscopic imaging', 'mortality', 'multi-drug resistant pathogen', 'nano', 'nanoproducts', 'neonatal sepsis', 'older patient', 'optic flow', 'particle', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'patient response', 'point of care', 'preterm newborn', 'processing speed', 'prototype', 'rapid diagnosis', 'real time monitoring', 'side effect', 'tool']",NIBIB,"URSA ANALYTICS, INC.",R43,2020,112402,-0.008475453041931971

"Mending a Broken Heart Allocation System with Machine Learning PROJECT ABSTRACT Heart transplantation is a life-saving treatment for end-stage heart failure, a devastating disease which kills over 250,000 Americans each year. Unfortunately, the supply of deceased donor hearts cannot meet demand, and over a third of candidates will die or be delisted without transplant. In the context of such scarcity, allocation must make the best use of scarce deceased donor hearts by ranking candidates from most to least medically urgent. In contrast to other organ transplant systems, there is currently no objective score used to rank heart transplant candidates on the waitlist. Instead, each candidate’s priority for transplantation is based on “Status,” a designation determined by the supportive therapy prescribed by their transplant center. I have previously shown that some heart transplant centers appear to overtreat candidates with intensive therapies at far higher rates than other centers. My preliminary data demonstrates that these practices have consequences for heart allocation effectiveness. High survival benefit centers reserve intense supportive therapy for candidates who have poor prognoses without transplant, saving lives by prioritizing the sickest patients. In contrast, low survival benefit centers list stable candidates and escalate the use of supportive therapies. Based on these data, there is a clear need for a new system to fairly allocate donor hearts. The overall objective of this K08 application is to develop and simulate a novel Heart Allocation Score (HAS) designed to objectively identify the candidates who gain the greatest survival benefit from heart transplantation. Previous attempts to develop such a score using conventional statistical methods have been inaccurate, but cutting-edge machine learning (ML) techniques outperform conventional regression models in many clinical contexts. In addition, a new open-source Heart Simulated Allocation Model (HSAM) is needed to compare policy alternatives because the available program is closed-source, inflexible, outdated, and structurally unable to simulate allocation scores developed with ML. My overall hypothesis is that a HAS developed with ML will lead to policy that optimizes heart allocation. I will test this hypothesis in three Aims. In Aim 1, I will use the complete national transplant registry dataset (N = 109,315 adult candidates) to predict waitlist survival, comparing ML prediction models to the current therapy-based system. In Aim 2, I will use the same registry to predict post-transplant survival for heart recipients, comparing conventional statistical methods to ML. In Aim 3, I will develop a) a new, open-source HSAM which I will use to b) compare current policy to a novel HAS policy constructed from the best prediction models from Aim 1 & 2. My overall career goal is to save lives by designing delivery systems that fairly and efficiently distribute scarce medical resources. To accomplish this, I plan to earn a PhD in Health Services Research focused on ML, simulation modeling, and health policy. Achieving the goals of this proposal will lead to the foundation of a novel heart allocation system that has the potential to save lives and equip me with the skills needed for future R01- level applications in the field of scarce healthcare resource allocation. PROJECT NARRATIVE: Heart transplantation is a potentially life-saving treatment for end-stage heart failure but unfortunately donors are scarce and only a fortunate minority of patients receive hearts. Current heart allocation policy relies on the intensity of treatment to decide who receives a heart, but this system cannot consistently identify the sickest candidates who stand to benefit the most from heart transplantation. This proposal aims to improve heart allocation by 1) developing a data-driven, objective heart allocation score with cutting-edge machine learning techniques, and 2) building novel, more flexible simulation software.",Mending a Broken Heart Allocation System with Machine Learning,9871727,K08HL150291,"['Adult', 'American', 'Charge', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Effectiveness', 'Ensure', 'Ethics', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health Policy', 'Health Resources', 'Health Services Research', 'Healthcare', 'Heart', 'Heart Transplantation', 'Heart failure', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Organ Transplantation', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Policies', 'Policy Analysis', 'Publishing', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Resource Allocation', 'Resources', 'Risk stratification', 'Savings', 'Scientist', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Supportive care', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Transplantation', 'United States Dept. of Health and Human Services', 'Update', 'Waiting Lists', 'base', 'career', 'clinical practice', 'design', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'health care delivery', 'high risk', 'improved', 'models and simulation', 'mortality risk', 'novel', 'open source', 'organ allocation', 'organ procurement transplantation network', 'post-transplant', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'simulation', 'simulation software', 'skills', 'tool', 'transplant centers', 'transplant registry']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,K08,2020,157896,0.024970096374153372
"Effects of Chronic Kidney Disease on Cardiovascular Disease and Dementia Among People with Diabetes: Causal Modeling with Machine Learning Approach PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Diabetes has been the major public health issues imposing substantial health and economic burden on individuals and society. Given the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in which United Nations has resolved to reduce morbidity and mortality from non-communicable diseases by one-third by year 2030, understanding the major risk factors of long-term adverse health outcomes such as cardiovascular disease (CVD) among patients with diabetes are imperative. While chronic kidney disease (CKD) and depression are closely interrelated with both diabetes and CVD, the causal link between these non-communicable diseases have not been sufficiently established. This is possibly due to (1) ill-defined temporality (i.e. unclear time- ordering of disease occurrence) and (2) their complex multifactorial and high-dimensional interaction with potential confounders such as demographic characteristics, socio-economic status, and comorbidities. The overall objective of this application is to investigate the causal relationship between diabetes and its complications including CKD. My specific aims are as follows: Aim 1 (F99 phase) assesses the causal relationship between depression and CVD among people with diabetes. After summarizing the previous literature, I will utilize longitudinal data to examine the joint effect of diabetes and depression on CVD sufficiently considering time-dependent exposure and confounders. Aim 2 (K00 phase) examines the causal pathway from diabetes to CKD, and to CVD mortality. I will develop the machine learning-based prediction model of CKD among people with diabetes, and then estimate the effect of CKD on CVD mortality using the obtained prediction model within causal inference structure. I will also investigate the extent to which CKD mediates the pathway from diabetes to CVD mortality. This study presents a timely opportunity to contribute to growing literature on how these non-communicable diseases (i.e. diabetes, depression, CKD, and CVD) interact with each other. Moreover, applications of machine learning in causal inference structure will contribute to the “precision health” concept by targeting high-risk populations and design effective interventions to prevent future non-communicable diseases and their complications. PROJECT NARRATIVE Diabetes, depression, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and Cardiovascular disease (CVD) are major health concerns imposing substantial health and economic burden on individuals and society. This study proposes to estimate the effects of depression on CVD events among people with diabetes (F99 phase) and investigate the causal relationship between diabetes, CKD, and CVD mortality using machine learning within the causal inference structure (K00 phase).

"Novel Non-Invasive Coronary Flow Patterning to Predict Early Coronary Microvascular Disease PROJECT SUMMARY  Coronary microvascular disease (CMD) is notoriously difficult to diagnose non-invasively, and current methods of assessing CMD utilize only the peak velocity of the coronary flow pattern. While new imaging techniques such as cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have improved the assessment coronary perfusion, there are currently no non-invasive methods that incorporate the coronary flow pattern over a complete cardiac cycle to definitively assess and predict the development of CMD.  Coronary blood flow (CBF) reflects the summation of flow in the coronary microcirculation, and our lab has begun to harness the full CBF pattern under varying flow and disease conditions (e.g. type 2 diabetes) to determine whether it might harbor novel clues leading to the early detection of CMD. Our past and preliminary data indicate an early onset of CMD in both type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and metabolic syndrome (MetS) that occurs prior to the onset of macrovascular complications and that are characterized by blood flow impairments and alterations in coronary resistance microvessel (CRM) structure, function, and biomechanics. Our data also uncovered innovative correlations between CRM structure/biomechanics and our newly-defined features of the coronary flow pattern, some of which were unique to normal or diabetic mice. We have initially utilized these CBF features, in the presence and absence of other factors such as cardiac function, to develop a mathematical model in collaboration with Drs. Christopher Bartlett and William Ray that to date demonstrated that 6 simple factors can predict a normal vs. diabetic coronary flow pattern with 85% predictive accuracy. Utilizing a multidisciplinary approach, these preliminary data strongly suggest that the coronary flow pattern and physiological modulators of it (e.g. coronary micovascular structure/function/biomechanics, cardiac function, etc), may be useful in directly diagnosing early CMD. Therefore, we hypothesize that dissecting the elements that influence coronary flow patterning will be critical determinants in the direct assessment of coronary microvascular disease using computational modeling. Using our previous publications and our preliminary data as guides, the hypothesis will be tested by addressing two specific aims: 1) Determine whether unique time-dependent CBF patterning in normal and T2DM is dictated by a combination of CRM remodeling and biomechanics, coronary flow pattern dynamics, and cardiac function, permitting the development of a computational model to accurately predict CMD; 2) Determine the reproducibility and robustness of the machine learning model in predicting CMD in a diet-induced obesity/diabetes mouse model. If successful, these studies will be the first to simultaneously examine the influence of CRMs, CBF, and cardiac structure/function on the distinct pattern of coronary flow, and it will determine whether a mathematical model may be useful in establishing a direct assessment of CMD to eventually enable clinicians to conduct a more direct non-invasive diagnosis of CMD for the prevention and/or treatment of heart disease.

"Improving the measurement and analysis of long-term, patient-centered outcomes following acute respiratory failure PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This Pathway to Independence Award application is submitted by a pulmonary and critical care epidemiologist committed to improving the quality of patient-oriented research for patients experiencing acute respiratory failure (ARF). Worldwide, millions of patients develop ARF annually. In the U.S., nearly one million patients with ARF require mechanical ventilation annually, accounting for a quarter of all intensive care unit (ICU) admissions. As improvements in ICU care reduce such patients’ in-hospital mortality rates, attention has shifted to the challenges ARF survivors face in regaining their prior cognitive, physical, and psychosocial functioning. However, there is a key barrier for randomized clinical trials (RCTs) testing new interventions to improve ARF survivorship – that is, the current lack of an endpoint that (1) captures long-term patient dispositions, (2) incorporates patient preferences and perspectives, and (3) is able to be analyzed without concern for statistical biases. The overarching goal of this research is to support clinical innovation by developing new approaches to measure and report long-term patient-centered outcomes that overcome the methodological barriers currently limiting ARF RCTs. The applicant will accomplish his goals under the mentorship of established researchers in critical care, patient-centered outcomes research, statistics, and informatics to assure his transition to a tenure-track faculty position in the R00 phase and his emergence as a leading pulmonary and critical care epidemiologist. First, the applicant will use an innovative combination of qualitative and quantitative research methods to elicit and integrate ARF survivors’ and their caregivers’ perspectives into a new patient-centered, long-term composite outcome measure (K99 phase). During the R00 phase, the applicant will recruit ARF survivors to participate in a prospective cohort, and follow these patients to describe the burden of ARF survivorship over 1-year using the new endpoint developed during the K99 phase. This endeavor will also provide key data that will facilitate sample size calculations in future ARF RCTs. Data from this cohort will additionally be used to develop an electronic health record (EHR)-based algorithm to predict risks for adverse long-term outcomes among ARF patients early in their ICU stays. Thus, this K99/R00 will augment ARF research by establishing a new outcome measure anchored in patient perspectives, improving the understanding and clinical prognostication of post-ICU morbidity following ARF, and facilitate the efficiency and clinical relevance of future ARF RCTs by enabling measurement of patients’ baseline risks for different outcomes. Concurrently, the didactic work, individual study, and hands-on learning in mixed-methods research, natural language processing, and predictive analytics will fill key training gaps for the applicant, thereby positioning him for a successful, independently-funded research career advancing the science of outcomes measurement and analysis for ARF RCTs. PROJECT NARRATIVE Randomized trials testing strategies to improve long-term outcomes for survivors of acute respiratory failure (ARF) are hampered by the lack of valid, patient-centered endpoints. Using interviews with ARF survivors and their caregivers, statistical simulation, consensus building among stakeholders, and a prospective cohort study, the applicant will develop, describe the epidemiology of, and predict a new patient-oriented outcome that will support trials of innovative approaches to improve ARF survivorship outcomes.","Improving the measurement and analysis of long-term, patient-centered outcomes following acute respiratory failure",9967226,R00HL141678,"['Accounting', 'Acute respiratory failure', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Competence', 'Consensus', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Face', 'Faculty', 'Financial Support', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Outcomes Research', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Preferences', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physical Function', 'Physicians', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Process', 'Property', 'Prospective Studies', 'Prospective cohort', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Provider', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Rogaine', 'Sample Size', 'Science', 'Statistical Bias', 'Structure', 'Survivors', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'care outcomes', 'career', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'design', 'emotional functioning', 'experience', 'hands-on learning', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'novel strategies', 'outcome prediction', 'patient health information', 'patient oriented', 'patient oriented research', 'prediction algorithm', 'prognostic', 'psychosocial', 'randomized trial', 'recruit', 'residence', 'simulation', 'statistics', 'structured data', 'survivorship', 'tenure track', 'unstructured data', 'ventilation']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R00,2020,249000,0.0023292454512018304
"Estimating Trajectory of Recovery in Cardiac Rehabilitation using Mobile Health Technology and Personalized Machine Learning Project Summary/Abstract The objective of our work leverages mobile health technology to develop machine learning models for longitudinal trajectories of recovery like those needed in cardiac rehabilitation. The investigation uses mobile health technology to quantify trajectories of recovery measures, personalizing understanding of exercise capacity and cardiac function. Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation programs reduce cardiovascular mortality risks and improve patient outcomes in such longitudinal fashion, through increased exercise capacity as measured by peak V02 improvements over the course of care. These programs have recently been extended to include heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) patients. Despite the reduction in mortality and readmissions, participation and adherence in cardiac rehabilitation programs remains a challenge, especially in underserved communities because of limited program availability, the distance and transportation access to a program, its hours of operation, as well as a lack of diversity and gender-dominated programs. Home-based programs using smartphones have shown to increase adherence and achieve similar outcomes. While home-based programs also improved resting heart rate, systolic blood pressure, and levels of physical activity achieved through metabolic equivalent of tasks and peak V02 at the end of the study, users expressed a desire to have individualized education and treatment. Home-based systems still do not achieve real-time interaction, feedback, and monitoring that center-based rehabilitation does through a lack of feedback and necessity of self-reported exertion values. A system is needed that quantify measures of exercise capacity, which can lead to recovery, dynamically throughout the course of treatment. This proposal develops an unobtrusive system, with new mobile health technology sensors, and trains analytic models that allow for personalized quantification of rehabilitation trajectories in HFrEF patients, which can monitor patient adherence and improvement in measures during exercise as well as while at rest. This system investigates the improvement over the course of a 12-week cardiac rehabilitation study and designs trajectories of recovery to understand improvements in peak V02 and exercise capacity in HFrEF patients by also measuring improvements of measurements of heart rate and blood pressure while at rest. This allows for an investigation of additional measures, over time, that may better quantify recovery in HFrEF patients that can be used for center-based rehabilitation or home-based rehabilitation. This can provide a significant enhancement of metrics that define recovery for HFrEF patients with estimations to metrics that are difficult to collect and evaluate. Project Narrative Quantification of trajectories of recovery for patients through wearable mobile health technologies can provide personal understanding of improvements and challenges faced in recovery by patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. Such a system will indicate to each patient the improvement in exercise capacity needed to continue preventing any recurrent events, allowing participants to have the understanding and individualized feeling they get from clinic visits and center-based cardiac rehabilitation at home or any other location they wish to participate in recovery activities. The exploration of additional markers of recovery can continue to provide quantification of heart failure conditions useful for clinicians and patients alike.",Estimating Trajectory of Recovery in Cardiac Rehabilitation using Mobile Health Technology and Personalized Machine Learning,10018016,R21EB028486,"['Achievement', 'Adherence', 'Behavior', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Pressure', 'Cardiac rehabilitation', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Characteristics', 'Chest', 'Clinic Visits', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'EFRAC', 'Education', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Exertion', 'Failure', 'Feedback', 'Feeling', 'Gender', 'Health Technology', 'Heart Rate', 'Heart failure', 'Home environment', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physical activity', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Proxy', 'Pulse Pressure', 'Recovery', 'Recurrence', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Rest', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transportation', 'Update', 'Visit', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'advanced analytics', 'analytical method', 'base', 'compliance behavior', 'design', 'exercise capacity', 'heart function', 'heart rate monitor', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'longitudinal analysis', 'mHealth', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'novel', 'operation', 'prevent', 'programs', 'rate of change', 'sensor technology', 'smart watch', 'wearable device', 'wearable sensor technology']",NIBIB,TEXAS ENGINEERING EXPERIMENT STATION,R21,2020,177045,-0.0166568851744724
"Wireless ultrasonic powering and monitoring of Left Ventricular Assist Devices through the Internet of Medical Things Project Summary The objective of this project is to demonstrate feasibility of a novel platform technology using ultrasonic waves for wireless powering and bidirectional real-time communication of a left ventricular assist device (LVAD). Heart failure (HF) has become a challenge of epidemic proportions to the healthcare system in the United States with poor prognosis for patients and elevated healthcare costs. LVADs are standard surgical therapy for advanced HF patients refractory to medical management. Despite extensive training and daily care, LVAD recipients still experience driveline infections (14-28%) at an annual cost of $20,000 and represents a clinically- significant adverse event and one of the primary causes of death. Transcutaneous energy transmission systems (TETS) are being developed to eliminate the LVAD’s driveline. Currently, TETS technology is limited by (1) low energy transfer efficiency, (2) power loss due to coil misalignment, (3) reduced data transmission rates with increasing depth of penetration, and (4) heating of tissue. Bionet Sonar’s software-defined ultrasonic wide band (UsWB) proprietary technology is capable of transmitting energy and data via ultrasonic waves through tissue, bone, and fluids at penetration depths significantly greater than RF waves and with greater reliability. Since increasing energy efficiency results in reduced energy storage requirements UsWB also enables reduction in size of implantable technologies. Bionet’s UsWB TETS (UTET) system includes: (1) energy transfer portal with internal and external intelligent piezo array-surfaces, (2) implantable controller with energy storage capacity, (3) external controller with IoMT portal, and (4) wearable power supply. These elements will enable wireless LVAD operation over wide range of clinical conditions with real-time data acquisition and diagnostics. Proof-of-concept for Bionet’s core technology was tested in vitro, demonstrating superior data transmission compared to RF (700kHz, 180kbit/s, 20cm tissue depth) and ultrasonic wireless recharging. In this Phase I study, feasibility of the fully-integrated wireless, UTET system for LVAD support will be demonstrated by completing the following specific aims: Specific Aim 1: Design and fabricate fully-integrated UTET system and demonstrate feasibility with clinical- grade LVAD in an in vitro model that mimics clinically-relevant implantable tissue depths and geometries. Specific Aim 2: Demonstrate feasibility of the fully-integrated UTET system with clinical-grade LVAD in an acute bovine model (n=2) at flow rates of 1-5 L/min for up to 8 hours. This proposal leverages the strengths of Bionet and the Cardiovascular Innovation Institute. Our long-term goal is to successfully translate the Bionet’s UTET system into clinical practice. The core platform technology may also be applied to other networked systems for the treatment of diverse etiologies opening a new frontier in multimodal patient treatment and use of Artificial Intelligence for patient care. Project Narrative Through this proposal a novel platform technology using ultrasonic waves for wireless powering and bidirectional real-time communication of a ventricular assist device will be developed. Ultrasound wideband technology will be used to create a system that doesn’t require a trans-cutaneous driveline to control and energize the pump of a ventricular assist device, thus, eliminating drive-line infections and improving quality of life of heart failure patients. This technology will not only improve patient outcomes and healthcare economics of this patient population, but may also enable other innovative therapies in other populations.",Wireless ultrasonic powering and monitoring of Left Ventricular Assist Devices through the Internet of Medical Things,10007683,R43HL152767,"['Acute', 'Adverse event', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Award', 'Benchmarking', 'Bluetooth', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Cattle', 'Cause of Death', 'Charge', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Elements', 'Energy Transfer', 'Engineering', 'Epidemic', 'Etiology', 'Family', 'Fatigue', 'Freezing', 'Future', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart failure', 'Heating', 'Hour', 'Implant', 'Infection', 'Innovative Therapy', 'Institutes', 'Intelligence', 'Internet', 'Lead', 'Legal patent', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Penetration', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Power Sources', 'Preclinical Testing', 'Pump', 'Quality of life', 'Refractory', 'Site', 'Skin', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Ultrasonic wave', 'Ultrasonics', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Wireless Technology', 'bone', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'clinically significant', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'data exchange', 'design', 'experience', 'frontier', 'health care economics', 'improved', 'in vitro Model', 'in vitro testing', 'innovation', 'left ventricular assist device', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'operation', 'outcome forecast', 'pathogen', 'patient population', 'phase 1 study', 'phase 2 study', 'pre-clinical', 'pressure', 'product development', 'radio frequency', 'sensor', 'software development', 'sonar', 'subcutaneous', 'transmission process', 'ventricular assist device', 'verification and validation', 'wireless communication']",NHLBI,BIONET SONAR,R43,2020,468992,0.0024796763587783387
"Prediction of COPD Progression by PRM PROJECT ABSTRACT  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a highly prevalent and heterogeneous disorder that afflicts nearly 30 million Americans. Current disease staging and therapy is based primarily on spirometry and clinical characteristics. Due to limitations in the standard phenotyping approaches, patients with similarly staged COPD may exhibit strikingly different progression patterns. Small airways disease (SAD), a treatable but occult component of COPD, is a significant contributor to airflow obstruction manifesting early in COPD. In recent years, SAD has been has been implicated as a precursor to the irreversible destruction of lung parenchyma, i.e. emphysema. The ability to predict if and when SAD will lead to emphysema would have an immediate clinical impact on the care of COPD patients. In 2012 we reported on the Parametric Response Map (PRM) analytical technique that when applied to paired inspiratory and expiratory CT scans is capable of simultaneously visualizing and quantifying the extent of “functional” SAD (fSAD) and emphysema in a single COPD patient. Since then we have made three key advances: first, PRM-derived fSAD is predictive of spirometric decline in COPD patients and emphysema development; second, we have validated in human lung samples that PRM- derived fSAD is a measure of small airway narrowing and loss; and finally, applying techniques to capture regional variation of fSAD within the lung, we have enhanced PRM (topological PRM [tPRM]) to provide a more sensitive measure of local disease severity than what is possible with the original PRM concept. Based on our findings, we postulate that PRM, or its advanced form tPRM, has the potential to predict long-term patient progression. The goal of this proposal will be to use baseline, Year 5 and recently available Year 10 COPDGene data to determine the ability of PRM to predict disease progression through three Specific Aims: 1) Characterize PRM-derived fSAD progression patterns over a 5 and 10 year period; 2) Determine how regional differences in disease distribution, as determined by tPRM, identify regional onset of local emphysema; and 3) Apply machine learning strategies to PRM/tPRM and other clinical metrics to develop models that predict patient disease trajectories. It is our expectation that PRM metrics will identify COPD patients at risk for more rapid disease progression but that utilizing regional information and machine learning strategies will further enhance our approach. The results of such analyses could both identify patients appropriate for more intense, targeted therapy at an early disease stage and contribute to our understanding of the progression of small airways disease and emphysema in COPD. PROJECT NARRATIVE  COPD is a highly prevalent but heterogeneous disorder with rising morbidity and mortality with efforts to develop effective treatments have been hampered by an inability to predict disease progression. This study proposes to apply statistical and deep learning strategies to evaluate novel CT-based analytic techniques as predictors of disease course in a COPD patient cohort.

"Predictive Analytics in Hemodialysis: Enabling Precision Care for Patient with ESKD ABSTRACT End stage kidney disease (ESKD) is a complex disease with individuals having variable life- expectancies, with 25% dying within 1 year and 41% surviving at least 5 years. While providers recognize that patients are different – and ought to be differently – there are no tools to reliably forecast individual life expectancy and aid in treatment individualization. Instead, providers are left with often unclear or incomplete guidelines on how best to manage patients. In order to provide precision care for patients on hemodialysis (HD), there is a critical need to be able to (1) dynamically assess life expectancy for medical decision-making; and (2) identify distinct clinical phenotypes to enhance clinical monitoring and care planning. Our central hypothesis is that there is heterogeneity in patient survivorship and disease trajectory that, when known, can be used to provide more personalized and effective care. By coupling novel machine learning approaches for survival prediction with granular clinical data on HD patients, we will be able to develop the analytic tools necessary to support precision care. At the completion of this proposal we will have tools to dynamically assess a patient's life expectancy and insights into heterogeneous disease phenotypes for patients with ESKD.

"Deriving high-quality evidence from national healthcare databases to improve suicidality detection and treatment outcomes in PTSD and TBI PROJECT SUMMARY Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has complex profiles of co-occurring medical conditions (comorbidities) and is associated with high risk of suicide, particularly among Veterans, in which it is a leading cause of death. There is a critical lack of advancement in PTSD pharmacotherapy, as illustrated by increased use of off-label medications and polypharmacy (multiple drugs used simultaneously). The consequent limited evidence on the relative risks and benefits of treatments creates a crisis in PTSD management. Moreover, PTSD and its major comorbidities [traumatic brain injury (TBI) and suicidality] often remain undocumented in electronic health records (EHR). There is also poor predictability of disease outcomes since there are frequent changes in pharmacological treatment and multiple modifying comorbidities. Our long-term goal is to improve diagnostics, secondary/tertiary prevention, and treatment outcomes of PTSD and its comorbidities via enhanced EHR utilization. To achieve our objectives, we will analyze EHR and administrative claims data from Veterans Administration (VA) and non-VA databases, collectively covering >2M PTSD and >2M TBI patients. Specifically, we aim to: (1) Identify undetected PTSD, TBI, and self-harm from EHRs (using machine learning with and without natural language language processing) to guide health service improvements. (2) Predict PTSD clinical course in the VA population through novel modeling of disease trajectories that account for time-varying treatments and biases (3) Compare the effectiveness of PTSD psychotropic monotherapies, polypharmacy, and psychotherapy to guide the choice of treatment for improved patient outcomes. By enhancing and validating a machine learning approach developed by our team, we will impute unrecorded PTSD, TBI, and self-harm from both datasets, and characterize factors associated with documentation disparities. We will model diseases trajectories with enhanced latent class analysis, focusing on self-harm, substance misuse, and psychiatric hospitalization in PTSD. With Local Control methodology innovations, we will compare the risk of PTSD in veterans with and without comorbid TBI. Finally, we will perform the largest comparative effectiveness studies (to date) of PTSD treatments on >100 monotherapy and polypharmacy regimens plus psychotherapy interventions. These studies will provide high-quality evidence on the risk of hospitalizations, substance misuse, and suicidal acts/self-harm. Successful completion of these investigations will improve the quality of decision making for providers and patients, and guide improved service delivery to the population of veterans and non-veterans with PTSD/TBI, and/or high risk of suicide. PROJECT NARRATIVE Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and its associated conditions (e.g., traumatic brain injury and suicidality) are often underdiagnosed, and have outcomes that are difficult to predict. Treatment of PTSD often involves frequent treatment changes with multi-drug regimens (polypharmacy) and off-label medications for which the relative risks and benefits are largely unknown. To address these problems, we will develop and apply methods to identify undiagnosed patients, predict disease trajectories, and compare the effectiveness of all common PTSD treatments using health records from millions of patients in Veterans Administration (VA) and non-VA databases.",Deriving high-quality evidence from national healthcare databases to improve suicidality detection and treatment outcomes in PTSD and TBI,10088135,R56MH120826,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease model', 'Documentation', 'Drug Combinations', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Event', 'Fostering', 'General Population', 'Glean', 'Goals', 'Health Services', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Label', 'Longterm Follow-up', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Mental Illness', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentally Ill Persons', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Military Personnel', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Polypharmacy', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Provider', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychotherapy', 'Regimen', 'Relative Risks', 'Reporting', 'Research Design', 'Residual state', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Safety', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Self-Injurious Behavior', 'Source', 'Suicide', 'Symptoms', 'Time', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States Department of Veterans Affairs', 'Veterans', 'analysis pipeline', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'comparative', 'comparative effectiveness study', 'compare effectiveness', 'data modeling', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'health record', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'language processing', 'multiple drug use', 'natural language', 'novel', 'off-label drug', 'outcome forecast', 'prevent', 'psychosocial', 'service delivery', 'sociodemographic factors', 'stress related disorder', 'substance misuse', 'suicidal act', 'suicidal risk', 'tertiary prevention', 'therapy design', 'time use', 'treatment choice', 'treatment comparison']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO HEALTH SCIS CTR,R56,2020,776198,-0.06122315589842295
"Magnetic Resonance Imaging Based Calf Muscle Perfusion To Assess Patients With Symptomatic Peripheral Artery Disease Abstract: Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is associated with impaired leg function, possible limb loss and an increased risk of cardiovascular events. Intermittent claudication (IC) is a classic PAD symptom occurring in 40% of symptomatic patients, and is associated with 5-, and 15-year mortality rates of 30% and 70%, respectively. PAD is a debilitating illness affecting more than 8.5 million Americans of age 40 and older and 202 million people globally. Despite the high prevalence, PAD patients are less likely to receive appropriate treatment for their atherosclerotic risk factors than patients with coronary artery disease. Advances in endovascular therapy have reduced risks associated with intervention, enabling revascularization as a routine procedure in patients with lower extremity ischemia. However, revascularization success rates vary substantially and numerous PAD patients do not improve at 1-year despite technically good revascularization. Previous findings suggest that alterations in the microcirculation due to a paucity of collateralization may contribute to functional impairment in PAD patients. We hypothesize that the change in microvascular perfusion can identify PAD patients who do not improve at 12-months after revascularization. We will utilize contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (CE-MRI) to assess skeletal muscle perfusion in PAD patients. The CE-MRI measures will be associated with hemodynamics and symptoms. The early identification of individuals with a likely poor prognosis post intervention could help to improve surgical treatment strategies. We will investigate the association of microvascular perfusion (Aim 1) and measures of arterial hemodynamics (Aim 2) with leg function and PAD symptoms. We will utilize machine learning methodologies to identify predictors of poor leg function and symptoms (Aim 3). Given the high incidence of PAD and the associated high risk of cardiovascular events, it is paramount to identify individuals who are less likely to improve following lower extremity revascularization. The data of this clinical imaging study will provide novel information on the etiology of microvascular blood flow in PAD. Relevance: The proposed research study is of considerable public health importance given that patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) have an increased risk of atherothrombotic cardiovascular events and mortality. The development of improved non-invasive imaging techniques to assess PAD may enable optimized treatment for individuals who are at an increased risk of future cardiovascular events.",Magnetic Resonance Imaging Based Calf Muscle Perfusion To Assess Patients With Symptomatic Peripheral Artery Disease,9997993,R01HL137763,"['Affect', 'Age', 'American', 'Ankle', 'Arteries', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical assessments', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Development', 'Disease Outcome', 'Early identification', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'High Prevalence', 'Hospitals', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Intermittent Claudication', 'Intervention', 'Ischemia', 'Leg', 'Legal patent', 'Limb structure', 'Literature', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Methodist Church', 'Methodology', 'Microcirculation', 'Muscle', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Oxygen', 'Partial Pressure', 'Participant', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perfusion', 'Peripheral arterial disease', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Pilot Projects', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Reference Values', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skeletal Muscle', 'Standardization', 'Superficial Femoral Artery', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Toes', 'Treadmill Tests', 'Ultrasonography', 'Validation', 'Veterans', 'Walking', 'atherosclerosis risk', 'base', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'comorbidity', 'contrast enhanced', 'contrast imaging', 'functional disability', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'post intervention', 'recruit', 'regional difference', 'research study', 'skeletal', 'success', 'successful intervention', 'support vector machine', 'symptomatic improvement', 'treadmill', 'treatment optimization', 'treatment strategy', 'two-dimensional']",NHLBI,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIV HERSHEY MED CTR,R01,2020,515780,0.0056565213224430665
"Data-Driven Framework for Classification and Surgical Planning of Spinal Deformity. PROJECT SUMMARY Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) impacts 2-4% of the adolescent population. AIS causes a three- dimensional deformity of the spinal column affecting the patients’ normal motion and posture and may cause lung and heart dysfunction, early onset osteoarthritis, and disc degeneration if left untreated. Spinal fusion surgery in progressive cases of scoliosis remains the main treatment option. The variation in patients’ pre-operative characteristics, the surgical implants, and the surgical maneuvers have resulted in a wide range of surgical outcomes, 20% of which remains to be less than satisfactory. As the suboptimal surgical outcomes can significantly impact the cost, risk of revision surgery, and long-term rehabilitation of the adolescent patients, objective patient-specific models that can predict the outcome of different surgical treatment scenarios and determine the optimal surgical intervention for individuals are of critical need. The central hypothesis of the proposed work is that identifying the key features of a 3D spinal curve before the operation and the intraoperative surgical interventions the influence the long-term outcomes can provide a quantitative framework for predicting the surgical outcomes in this patient population. To this end, we propose (i) to identify the patient-specific and surgeon modifiable predictors of the spinal fusion outcomes in an in-house database of surgical AIS patients using machine learning, (ii) to develop a probabilistic predictive model of the outcomes as a function of pre-operative patient condition and the surgical interventions and (iii) to develop a fully automated framework that allows online image processing and assigns a treatment option that probabilistically determines the surgical outcome for a new patient based on a prior learning algorithm. The innovation of this approach is in developing the first data-driven predictive model for surgical planning of AIS patients that allows comparing different treatment scenarios through a probabilistic predictive framework and recommending surgical intervention that leads to an optimal outcome for a given patient. This knowledge-based algorithm automatically extracts the spinal curve patterns from the medical images as a classifier. The exploitation of an automated image processing algorithm to develop a reduced ordered model of the spinal deformity allows a fast quantitative analysis appropriate for direct clinical dissemination. It is aimed to use this model as an assistive tool for personalized surgical decision making of the AIS patients in the clinical setups. This assistive tool, which will be trained and tested using a large database of the medical images of the AIS patients, can make significant contribution to the field by developing a quantitative approach that considers a combinations of surgical methods and provides recommendations to achieve an improved outcome of the spinal deformity surgery in the pediatric population. PROJECT NARRATIVE Severe spinal deformity in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) requires surgical fusion of the spinal column in order to correct and stabilize the spine. Variations in the spinal deformity manifestation and treatment strategies have challenged the outcome prediction of the surgical intervention in this patient population, resulting in unsatisfactory outcomes in 20% of the surgically treated AIS patients. The scope of this work proposes and validates an objective data-driven algorithm for automated feature extraction, classification, and knowledge- based outcome prediction of AIS patients with a variety of spinal deformities using artificial intelligence methods.",Data-Driven Framework for Classification and Surgical Planning of Spinal Deformity.,9978391,R21AR075971,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biomechanics', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Client satisfaction', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Deformity', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Guidelines', 'Hour', 'Idiopathic scoliosis', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Left', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Myocardial dysfunction', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Postoperative Period', 'Posture', 'Predictive Factor', 'Probability', 'Quality of life', 'Recommendation', 'Risk', 'Robotics', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Shapes', 'Spinal', 'Spinal Fusion', 'Spine surgery', 'Statistical Methods', 'Subgroup', 'Surgeon', 'Surgical Models', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Vertebral column', 'Work', 'adolescent patient', 'adverse outcome', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'cost', 'disability', 'early onset', 'feature extraction', 'flexibility', 'follow-up', 'image processing', 'implant design', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'instrumentation', 'intervertebral disk degeneration', 'knowledge base', 'learning algorithm', 'long-term rehabilitation', 'mathematical methods', 'neural network', 'operation', 'outcome prediction', 'patient population', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'satisfaction', 'scoliosis', 'standard of care', 'surgery outcome', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'two-dimensional']",NIAMS,CHILDREN'S HOSP OF PHILADELPHIA,R21,2020,232320,0.023218893330383458
"Effectiveness of Digital Versus In-Person Diabetes Prevention Programs 1 PROJECT SUMMARY  Millions of U.S. adults living with prediabetes, a high risk state for future type 2 diabetes, do not receive appropriate lifestyle counseling to lower their risk of type 2 diabetes. Mobile health (mHealth) technologies represent a potential scalable solution to address this far-reaching problem. The objective of this project is to compare the real-world effectiveness of a digital diabetes prevention program (dDPP) to standard of care in- person diabetes prevention programs (ipDPPs). This study will test a novel, fully-automated digital health platform (Sweetch Health, Ltd.) that uses artificial intelligence technology to provide just-in-time and adaptive lifestyle change coaching for prediabetic adults. Preliminary evidence from feasibility or observational studies suggests that JITAIs, which are often delivered via smartphone apps by virtue of their ability to provide continuous self-monitoring and feedback, can be effective. However, it is currently not known whether dDPPs that deliver a JITAI are as effective as ipDPPs in improving health outcomes in patients with prediabetes, a susceptible patient population that is positioned to benefit from such an intervention.  The overarching goal of this project, therefore, is to compare the effectiveness of the Sweetch digital diabetes prevention program (dDPP) to real-world in-person diabetes prevention programs (ipDPPs) for promoting weight loss, increasing physical activity, and reducing hemoglobin A1C in prediabetic adults. The proposed study addresses an evidence gap in the science of chronic disease prevention and health behavior change and is supported by promising short-term results from a previous pilot trial conducted by our team. Building on our previous study and leveraging the collective expertise of our multidisciplinary study team, we will conduct a randomized controlled trial of 382 overweight/obese, prediabetic adults ages 18-75 with 6 and 12 month follow-up visits: Arm 1 (N=191) will receive the fully automated Sweetch digital health kit (“dDPP” arm) and Arm 2 (N=191) will be referred to a local CDC-recognized ipDPP. Both arms will have physical activity measured serially during the trial using actimetry at baseline and 2 month intervals. We hypothesize that the dDPP will be more effective than the ipDPP for the outcomes of weight loss, physical activity, and lowering of hemoglobin A1C at 6 months, with sustained effects at 12 months. We further hypothesize that the overall engagement and acceptability will be greater in the dDPP, and that the superiority of the dDPP on clinical outcomes will be mediated by higher engagement in this arm.  This project will advance chronic disease prevention and behavioral science research by elucidating the extent to which fully-automated digital interventions using artificial intelligence technology can deliver effective, scalable, sustainable, and cost-effective health-promoting behavioral change interventions in high-risk populations. The implications of this fully-automated approach for scalability in diabetes prevention are profound. 2 PROJECT NARRATIVE  Prediabetes, a high risk state for future type 2 diabetes, currently affects nearly 1 in 3 Americans, the vast majority of whom do not receive appropriate lifestyle counseling to lower their risk for type 2 diabetes. In this project, we propose to evaluate the real-world effectiveness of a fully-automated digital diabetes prevention program for weight reduction, promotion of physical activity, and lowering of hemoglobin A1C (a measure of average blood glucose control) compared to standard of care in-person diabetes prevention programs. Since this digital diabetes prevention program uses artificial technology and requires no human component, it would potentially offer a breakthrough in improving population health in a scalable and cost- effective way, helping the tens of millions of affected U.S. patients and hundreds of millions of patients globally living with prediabetes.",Effectiveness of Digital Versus In-Person Diabetes Prevention Programs,10034797,R01DK125780,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'American', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Benchmarking', 'Blood Glucose', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Caloric Restriction', 'Cellular Phone', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetes prevention', 'Diet Monitoring', 'Effectiveness', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Favorable Clinical Outcome', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Promotion', 'Health Technology', 'Health behavior change', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Hybrids', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Life Style', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Overweight', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prediabetes syndrome', 'Prevention', 'Questionnaires', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Science', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Visit', 'Weight', 'Weight Gain', 'adult obesity', 'arm', 'base', 'blood glucose regulation', 'comparative effectiveness study', 'compare effectiveness', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'diabetes prevention program', 'digital', 'disorder prevention', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'interest', 'lifestyle intervention', 'mHealth', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient population', 'pilot trial', 'population health', 'program costs', 'programs', 'response', 'smartphone Application', 'standard of care', 'tool']",NIDDK,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,733116,-0.03268055486333042
"Deviceless and Autonomous Prospective Cardiac CT Triggering PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the leading cause of death worldwide. An estimated 3.8 million men and 3.4 million women die each year from CHD. Cardiac CT is a safe, accurate, non-invasive imaging modality used for diagnosing CHD and for planning therapeutic interventions. Cardiac CT exams are still challenging to perform due to the beating heart and the need to carefully time the scan based on cardiac phase and based on when the peak iodine contrast enhancement is reached. The overall exam duration and the complexity of performing these exams (contrasted with limited reimbursement levels) have limited patient access to cardiac CT to academic hospitals and specialized cardiac imaging centers. As compared to other CT exams, cardiac CT exams require additional patient preparation time, additional CT scans to track the bolus, and additional contrast agent to avoid missing the peak enhancement.  The goal of this project is to develop a smart cardiac CT scanner that autonomously determines the optimal scan time interval without ECG, traditional bolus tracking or timing bolus. Initial results show that it is possible to extract cardiac gating information from a few CT projection measurements prior to the diagnostic CT scan, without reconstruction. This is made possible by an innovative combination of fast X-ray tube pulsing and deep learning raw data analysis. This project builds on GE Research's experience with cardiac CT technologies, deep learning algorithms and X-ray tube physics, as well as the strong clinical cardiac CT expertise at the University of California San Diego.  The outcome of this project will be a clinical feasibility study of the autonomous triggering approach, which has the potential to simplify and increase patient access to cardiac CT, while reducing exam time, reducing con- trast agent volume, and ensuring robust image quality. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of this project is to develop a smart cardiac CT scanner that autonomously determines the optimal scan time interval without ECG, traditional bolus tracking or timing bolus.

"Development of a Machine Learning Model to Integrate Clinical, Laboratory, Sonographic, and Elastographic Data for Noninvasive Liver Tissue Characterization in NAFLD Abstract Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is exceptionally common, with an estimated one hundred million afflicted people in the United States. Detection and risk stratification of this very common disease remains a major challenge. Despite recent advances, including development of numerous therapeutic agents presently in phase 2 and 3 trials, NAFLD remains a silent disease in which the vast majority of patients accumulate progressive liver damage without signs or symptoms and, undiagnosed, receive no medical care. The NAFLD patients at highest risk of cirrhosis are those with moderate or greater liver fibrosis at the time of diagnosis, a group of patients who are described as having high risk non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (hrNASH). The current reference standard for identifying people with hrNASH is liver biopsy, which is expensive, invasive, and limited by interobserver variability. The focus of this project is to develop and validate low cost non-invasive diagnostic technology to diagnose hrNASH. We propose to accomplish this in three Specific Aims. First, we will expand and annotate an existing database of patients with chronic liver disease from 328 subjects to 1,000 subjects, ~40% of whom will have NAFLD. The database will contain ~20,000 images (~10,000 ultrasound elastography images and ~ 10,000 conventional ultrasound images) and multiple demographic and clinical data points for each subject (a total of ~30,000 clinical, laboratory, and demographic data points). We have previously developed advanced image processing techniques to make ultrasound elastography more accurate and less variable. We will use this large database to develop, customize and refine our image processing techniques for NAFLD evaluation (Aim 1), with the goal of improving ultrasound elastography diagnosis of hrNASH. Second, we will combine conventional ultrasound elastography imaging, conventional ultrasound imaging, our advanced image analysis techniques, and the demographic, clinical, and laboratory data in a machine learning model to predict hrNASH and will compare the performance of our predictive model with the FIB4, a widely-used blood test-based prediction rule (Aim 2). Third, we will validate our predictive model in an independent prospective cohort of NAFLD subjects undergoing biopsy for NAFLD risk stratification (Aim 3). We hypothesize that the combination of image processing-enhanced elastography and conventional ultrasound imagery combined with demographic, clinical, and laboratory data will have greater predictive power for hrNASH than clinical or sonographic data alone. The proposed predictive models have the potential to (1) reduce the number of liver biopsies performed for hrNASH detection, (2) facilitate recruitment for clinical trials of NAFLD therapeutics, and (3) improve care quality for the most common liver disease in the United States. Project Narrative In this project, we aim to create low-cost non-invasive technology to diagnose people with high risk non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (hrNASH), a common liver disease that has a high risk of cirrhosis. We will accomplish this goal by improving liver ultrasound imaging and by creating a prediction tool that integrates liver ultrasound, laboratory testing and clinical information. This prediction tool has the potential to reduce the need for liver biopsies.","Development of a Machine Learning Model to Integrate Clinical, Laboratory, Sonographic, and Elastographic Data for Noninvasive Liver Tissue Characterization in NAFLD",9850968,R01DK119860,"['Algorithmic Analysis', 'Area', 'Biopsy', 'Blood Tests', 'Caring', 'Cirrhosis', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Evaluation', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Laboratories', 'Liver', 'Liver Fibrosis', 'Liver diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase II/III Trial', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Prospective cohort', 'Quality of Care', 'ROC Curve', 'Reference Standards', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Running', 'Schedule', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Staging', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Therapeutic Clinical Trial', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'chronic liver disease', 'clinical care', 'cost', 'disorder subtype', 'elastography', 'hepatocellular injury', 'high risk', 'image processing', 'improved', 'liver biopsy', 'liver imaging', 'liver injury', 'non-alcoholic fatty liver disease', 'nonalcoholic steatohepatitis', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'patient population', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'screening', 'standard of care', 'tool']",NIDDK,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2020,442592,-0.0051059358514358
"A mobile sensing system to monitor symptoms during chemotherapy Cancer treatments can cause a variety of poorly-managed symptoms and toxicities that can impair quality of life and functioning and lead to early discontinuation of life-prolonging medical treatment. The goals of the proposed study are (1) to develop a novel mobile sensing system to passively monitor symptom burden during chemotherapy and (2) to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of using this system to recommend patient-provider communication. To accomplish Aim 1, we will enroll 200 oncology patients starting a new chemotherapy regimen and will collect smartphone and wearable sensor data continuously as well as daily patient-reported symptoms via smartphones for 90 days. Using machine learning methods, we will retrospectively analyze data from the first 100 participants and develop a generalizable and parsimonious population-level model to identify severe symptom days. For the second 100 participants, we will run these computational models in real-time and prospectively evaluate the accuracy of our classifications relative to patient-reported symptoms. For Aim 2, we will enroll 50 patients in a prospective single-arm trial of a system that uses inferences based on sensing and machine learning to recommend contact with providers and will evaluate patient accrual, attrition, and compliance as well as information from both patients and their providers about acceptability and perceived usefulness of the system. The scientific premise of this proposal is that mobile sensing of subtle fluctuations in behavior coupled with real-time computational modeling could enable earlier detection and ultimately better management of severe symptoms during cancer treatment. The proposed project builds on our prior research and completes the necessary development and feasibility work to support a large multisite trial comparing the mobile sensing system to standard of care to determine effects on symptom burden, quality of life, health care utilization, and survival. Public health relevance: Symptoms during cancer treatment are common, compromise patient quality of life and ability to tolerate treatment, and often go undetected at clinic visits. This project aims to combine smartphone and wearable sensor data with machine learning to remotely monitor symptoms during chemotherapy and to develop a system that automatically recommends patient-provider contact when severe symptoms are detected.",A mobile sensing system to monitor symptoms during chemotherapy,9962316,R37CA242545,"['Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chemotherapy-Oncologic Procedure', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinic Visits', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Computer Models', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Enrollment', 'Goals', 'Health Status', 'Heart Rate', 'Impairment', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Light', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Noise', 'Notification', 'Oncology', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Provider', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Running', 'Secure', 'Severities', 'Sleep', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Support System', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'cancer care', 'cancer therapy', 'care delivery', 'care outcomes', 'chemotherapy', 'common treatment', 'health care service utilization', 'improved', 'machine learning method', 'mobile computing', 'multi-site trial', 'novel', 'patient-clinician communication', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'sensor', 'standard of care', 'symptom management', 'trial comparing', 'wearable sensor technology']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R37,2020,361165,-0.003933731240594848

Current practice uses the Emergency Severity Index (ESI) score to group patients by resource utilization. ESI has significant limitations including: racial bias, poor relation to patient-centered outcomes, subjectivity, and failure to differentiate acute patients (poor specificity). As such, the ESI tool fails to identify patient-specific factors, that are present at the time of triage, to accurately predict critical conditions requiring life-saving treatments. Due to its time sensitivity, complex symptomology, variable outcomes, and a national cost burden of $21 billion, acute coronary syndrome (ACS) will be used as an exemplar time-sensitive condition to develop a new predictive machine learning algorithm to be used for ED triage. Of 800,000 new annual ACS cases in the United States, nurses fail to identify approximately 50% during triage. This suggests an urgent need to develop triage tools, specifically ones that correctly identify ACS early, which could potentially reduce mortality by 10%-20%. This project proposes to use big data analytics to address the critical gaps of the ESI tool and nurse failure to identify ACS at triage. A large cohort of patients presenting to 17 different EDs with symptoms suspicious of ACS will be used to create a multidimensional database, extracting routinely collected patient factors from the electronic health record data acquired at initial nurse triage. This project will use state-of-the-art machine learning approaches that incorporate the complex interactions between patient factors to identify patients with true critical coronary occlusion that require time dependent treatment. The innovation of this study stems from having access to a world renowned academic medical center that is able to conduct full-scale studies using electronic health records of over 4.2 million patient encounters. This project aligns with the NINR’s strategic vision for nurses to use emerging technologies (big data) to predict patient trajectories, inform interventions and support real time clinical decision making. By using advanced machine learning concepts, we will translate our final machine model into a robust clinical tool to assist nurses in making real time clinical decisions to accurately identity ACS events and initiate timely treatment, thereby improving patient outcomes. Study findings have potential to change the paradigm of ED nurse triage to be more objective and data-driven, thereby recognizing critical conditions at initial triage and eliminating unnecessary morbidity and mortality. PROJECT NARRATIVE Emergency department nurses triage over 136 million patients a year, using the Emergency Severity Index score that has significant limitations and often fails to identify patients with critical time-sensitive conditions such as acute coronary syndrome (ACS) approximately 50% of the time. To address these gaps, this project aims to develop a predictive algorithm using state-of-the-art machine learning concepts that incorporates the complex interactions between medical data available at nurse triage in order to identify patients with true critical coronary occlusion that requires time dependent treatment. Such a model can be translated into a robust clinical decision support tool to assist nurses in making real time clinical decisions to accurately identify ACS events and initiate timely treatment, thereby improving patient outcomes.",Modernizing Emergency Department Nurse Triage via Big Data Analytics,10051328,F31NR018589,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Area Under Curve', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'Chest Pain', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Coronary Occlusions', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dyspepsia', 'Dyspnea', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency Medicine', 'Emergency Nursing', 'Emergency Situation', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Goals', 'Hospitalization', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical History', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nature', 'Nausea and Vomiting', 'Nurses', 'Nursing Models', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Output', 'Palpitations', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'ROC Curve', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Retrospective cohort', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Savings', 'Severities', 'Specificity', 'Suggestion', 'Symptoms', 'Syncope', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Triage', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Vision', 'Work', 'acute coronary syndrome', 'advanced analytics', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'cohort', 'cost', 'follow-up', 'health record', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mathematical model', 'mortality', 'pain patient', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'primary outcome', 'racial bias', 'routine care', 'stem', 'support tools', 'symptomatology', 'tool']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,F31,2020,14320,0.002169096001884936
"Instrumental screening for dysphagia by combining high-resolution cervical auscultation with advanced data analysis tools to identify silent dysphagia and silent aspiration ABSTRACT Dysphagia (disordered swallowing) causes nearly 150,000 annual hospitalizations and over 220,000 additional hospital days, and prolongs hospital lengths of stay by 40%. Dysphagia risk is typically identified through subjective screening methods and those identified through screening undergo gold standard imaging testing such as videofluoroscopy (VF). However, screening methods over- or underestimate risk, and completely fail to identify patients with silent dysphagia (e.g., silent aspiration) that can cause pneumonia and other adverse events. Pre-emptive detection of silent or near-silent aspiration is essential. The long term goal is to develop an instrumental dysphagia screening approach based on high-resolution cervical auscultation (HRCA) in order to early predict dysphagia-related adverse events, and initiate intervention measures to mitigate them. The overall objective here is to develop accurate, advanced data analysis approaches to translate HRCA signals to swallowing events observed in VF images. Our strong preliminary data has led us to our central hypothesis: advanced data analytics tools are suitable approaches for the analysis of HRCA in order to automate dysphagia screening. The rationale is that a reliable, robust early-warning instrumental dysphagia screening approach will reduce adverse events in patients with silent aspiration/dysphagia, shorten length of stay and improve overall clinical outcomes. Guided by strong preliminary data, we will pursue the following three specific aims: (1) develop machine learning algorithms to differentiate HRCA signals produced by swallowing physiologic events from similar, non-swallow related signals produced during swallowing; (2) translate HRCA swallowing-signal signatures to actual swallow physiologic events to detect abnormal swallowing physiology; and (3) discriminate normal from abnormal airway protection and swallow physiology via machine-learning analysis of HRCA signals with similar accuracy as VF. Under the first aim, a machine learning approach will be used to detect pharyngeal swallowing events and differentiate them from speech, cough and other non- swallow events, with 90% accuracy, when compared to a human expert’s interpretation of our VF data sets. Under the second aim, objective swallowing physiology observations from VF will be matched to swallowing events observed with HRCA in order to show that abnormal swallow physiology and airway protection will produce distinctive HRCA signal signatures that predict the same events identified with VF. Under the third aim, analytical algorithms will be used to detect signs of disordered airway protection in HRCA signal signatures with 90% accuracy when compared to a human expert’s airway protection ratings from VF images. The approach is innovative, as it will produce analysis tools that will infer about dysphagia and aspiration based on the analysis of HRCA with unprecedented accuracy, before patients are placed in harm’s way. Our work is significant, because it will translate to an early-warning HRCA screening tool that predicts dysphagia- related adverse events in asymptomatic patients reducing medical adverse events, and length of stay. The proposed research is relevant to public health because dysphagia is related to nearly 150,000 annual hospitalizations and over 220,000 additional hospital days, it increases pneumonia incidence, prolongs hospital stays by 40% for patients with many diseases, and is prevalent in acute care hospitals and nursing homes. Choking (airway obstruction) and pneumonia due to aspiration (inhalation of swallowed food and liquids), are common results of dysphagia, and both are preventable when dysphagia is identified before patients are offered oral food, liquids or medications. The proposed research is relevant to the part of NIH’s mission that pertains to enhancing health, lengthening life and reducing illnesses, as we will develop new data analytics tools to be used along with high-resolution cervical auscultation in order to instrumentally screen for dysphagia and predict dysphagia-related adverse events before they can harm patients with dysphagia.",Instrumental screening for dysphagia by combining high-resolution cervical auscultation with advanced data analysis tools to identify silent dysphagia and silent aspiration,9935103,R01HD092239,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Aspirate substance', 'Aspiration Pneumonia', 'Auscultation', 'Biomechanics', 'Cervical', 'Choking', 'Clinical', 'Coughing', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Deglutition', 'Deglutition Disorders', 'Dehydration', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Device Designs', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disabled Persons', 'Disease', 'Equipment', 'Event', 'Food', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Group Homes', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Health', 'Hospital Nursing', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Inhalation', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Length of Stay', 'Life', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Malnutrition', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nature', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Nursing Homes', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Pneumonia', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Screening procedure', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speech', 'Stroke', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Water', 'Work', 'acute care', 'airway obstruction', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'clinical practice', 'clinically significant', 'image processing', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'kinematics', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality', 'patient safety', 'post stroke', 'predictive signature', 'predictive tools', 'screening', 'tool', 'translational impact', 'vibration']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2020,302394,0.007657351215185782
"Rethinking Electronic Fetal Monitoring to Improve Perinatal Outcomes and Reduce Frequency of Operative Vaginal and Cesarean Deliveries The essential role of electronic fetal monitoring (EFM) during labor is to prevent adverse outcomes due to fetal hypoxia and ischemia. Its established weaknesses include: 1) the obstetrician’s highly subjective visual interpretations of the signal patterns and 2) the widespread use of unproven surrogates for relevant fetal hypoxic and/or ischemic injury such as umbilical arterial pH, intrapartum stillbirth, newborn Apgar scores and neonatal seizures. This technology over the past 50 years has not been shown to decrease stillbirths or reduce the numbers of infants with cerebral palsy. EFM as it is presently used in the clinical setting has been associated with an extraordinary increase in the use of operative vaginal delivery and cesarean delivery. No functional algorithm has yet been developed that integrates clinical data collected in the antepartum period and during labor and any other patient specific data with the results of EFM. The main objective of the proposed research is to use recent breakthroughs in machine learning to drive the development of predictive analytics to support and improve the interpretation of EFM data, especially under real world conditions and in real time where clinicians must make timely decisions about interventions to prevent adverse outcomes. It is anticipated that the proposed research will result in significantly decreased use of operative vaginal delivery and cesarean delivery while more precisely defining the fetus at risk for developing metabolic acidosis and long term neurologic injury. The essential role of electronic fetal monitoring (EFM) of the fetal heart rate (FHR) during labor is to prevent adverse outcomes due to oxygen deficiency, but its weaknesses almost all stem from the obstetrician’s highly subjective visual interpretations of the signal patterns. The widespread use of this technology over the past 50 years has not been shown to decrease stillbirths or reduce the numbers of infants with severe hypoxic/ischemic neurological disorders, but it has been associated with an extraordinary increase in cesarean delivery rates. The main objective of the proposed research is to use recent breakthroughs in machine learning to drive the development of predictive analytics to support and improve the interpretation of FHR monitoring data, especially under real world conditions where clinicians must make timely decisions about interventions to prevent adverse outcomes.

"Personalized Statin Treatment Plan to Optimize Clinical Outcomes Using Big Data PROJECT SUMMARY An estimated 47% of Americans 65 years of age and older take statins, which are highly effective in lowering low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), and reducing all-cause mortality. Unfortunately, ~50% of patients prescribed statins do not obtain these critical benefits because they discontinue use within 1 year of treatment initiation. There, Statin discontinuation has been identified as a major public-health concern due to increased morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs associated with ASCVD. In clinical practice, statin-associated symptoms (SAS) often result in dose reduction or discontinuation of these life-saving medications. Currently, physicians employ reactive strategies to manage SAS concerns after they manifest, such as offering an alternative statin treatment plan (e.g., reducing dosage or changing medication) or a `statin holiday'. However, with numerous statin treatment strategies available and no means of optimizing their match to a given patient, physician decision-making is based on minimal patient data elements. Moreover, using a single patient's data to identify the optimal statin regimen and treatment plan is inadequate to ensure that the harms of statin use are minimized and the benefits are maximized. A decision- support system, by contrast, can use a vast number of variables from a large number of patients (“big data”) to match an optimal statin treatment plan to an individual patient prospectively. We propose to use complex patient information to develop and test an effective predictive model and tool, the personalized statin treatment plan (PSTP) platform, which could be used by physicians to optimize personalized statin treatment to minimize harms (SAS and statin discontinuation) while at the same time maximizing benefits (LDL reduction). The proposed study leverages data from the OptumLabs Data Warehouse (which includes more than 20 years of insurance claims and electronic health records data from more than 150 million patients across the United States), as well as clinical trial simulations, for model development, validation, and evaluation. We will address the following specific aims: 1) Develop and validate a deep-learning model to predict both SAS and statin discontinuation using linked insurance claims and EHR data; 2) Develop and validate the PSTP platform to identify statin treatment plans that optimize both LDL reduction (benefit) and SAS and statin discontinuation (harm) for a given patient profile; and 3) Evaluate the PSTP relative to current and guideline-driven practices using CTS to assess clinical benefits and harms. The proposed study will produce a precision-medicine tool to empower physicians to make proactive clinical decisions regarding statin treatment planning (i.e., selecting the statin drug and dosage optimized for a particular patient to maximize LDL reduction and minimize statin discontinuation and SAS) before any statin is prescribed. The implementation of such a tool would substantially improve public health by reducing statin discontinuation and sub-optimal clinical outcomes inherent in current reactive statin-prescribing strategies based on non-personalized statin treatment plans. PROJECT NARRATIVE About 50% of patients prescribed statins do not obtain critical benefits in lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, and reducing all-cause mortality because they discontinue use within 1 year of treatment initiation largely due to statin-associated symptoms. Statin discontinuation has been identified as a major public-health concern due to increased morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs associated with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.

"Optimizing stroke prevention for older adults with atrial fibrillation: Towards rigorous evaluation and judicious application of a new device PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Atrial fibrillation (AF) affects about 10% of older adults and accounts for a growing proportion of strokes. Lifelong oral anticoagulation, with warfarin or a non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant (NOAC), is recommended for stroke prevention in most AF patients. However, the drugs increase the risk of bleeding and the adherence to the lifelong drug therapy is poor, leaving many patients under-treated. The recently-approved Watchman device offers an attractive alternative to lifelong drug therapy for AF stroke prevention. However, the device has been studied in only two clinical trials, both of which compared it to warfarin. Little is known about how Watchman compares with the current mainstay therapy, NOACs, or how Watchman compares with no treatment in patients who have difficulties taking anticoagulation drugs. Furthermore, for preventive treatment with a high upfront cost and some procedural risks, a personalized approach is needed to target Watchman to patients who are most likely to benefit and avoid it in those who have little to gain. Therefore, the overall objective of this project is to address these evidence gaps and develop new prediction tools to optimize the use of Watchman for AF stroke prevention. In Aim 1, we will conduct comparative effectiveness studies using a large national administrative database (OptumLabs) that contains insurance claims for over two million patients with AF of all ages and races from all 50 states with linked EHRs in a subset. The findings will provide timely evidence to address the key unanswered questions highlighted in current practice guidelines and will facilitate the design, analysis, and interpretation of future clinical trials. In Aim 2, we will develop and validate machine-learning models to predict how Watchman compares with non-invasive therapies. We will develop the models using the OptumLabs data, and validate the models in two RCTs and two large health systems’ EHRs, thereby validating models in both clinical trial and routine practice settings. The new prediction models will provide personalized estimates for the benefits and harms, and thus, engage patients in making informed choices consistent with their preferences and ease clinicians’ cognitive burden. In Aim 3, we will assess how the Watchman decisions made in contemporary practice agree with those suggested by the new prediction models. We will use machine-learning methods to identify patient and provider characteristics associated with incongruent decisions. Such findings will highlight patient and provider groups who may particularly benefit from the decision support, thereby informing future implementation and translation efforts. We have assembled a team with complementary clinical and research expertise, a solid record of successful collaboration, and extensive experience in outcomes research and prediction modeling. We also have developed a web-based decision aid that is ready to translate the prediction models to reduce unwarranted variation in care delivery, patient outcomes, and medical costs. PROJECT NARRATIVE The findings will provide timely evidence to bridge the gaps between clinical trials and everyday practice. The new prediction models, once embedded in a decision aid, will bring personalized outcome estimates to shared decision making to promote evidence-based and patient-centered care. Therefore, the proposed project has great potentials to improve the care for millions of patients with AF at risk for stroke.",Optimizing stroke prevention for older adults with atrial fibrillation: Towards rigorous evaluation and judicious application of a new device,9882377,R01AG062436,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Anticoagulants', 'Anticoagulation', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Big Data', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Aid', 'Decision Making', 'Devices', 'Elderly', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Future', 'Health system', 'Hemorrhage', 'Judgment', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Modeling', 'Online Systems', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patient-Centered Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Practice Guidelines', 'Preventive treatment', 'Provider', 'Race', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk-Benefit Assessment', 'Signal Transduction', 'Solid', 'Stroke', 'Stroke prevention', 'Suggestion', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Variant', 'Warfarin', 'administrative database', 'care delivery', 'cognitive load', 'comparative effectiveness study', 'cost', 'design', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'improved', 'insurance claims', 'machine learning method', 'mortality risk', 'outcome prediction', 'personalized approach', 'personalized medicine', 'practice setting', 'predictive modeling', 'preference', 'preservation', 'routine practice', 'shared decision making', 'stroke risk', 'tool']",NIA,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2020,475350,-0.08107388068637769
"Pathophysiology Informed Biomarkers of Treatment Response in Early Psychosis (PIB) The introduction of Coordinated Specialty Care (CSC) has transformed the standard of care and elevated treatment outcome goals for young individuals experiencing the initial stages of a psychotic illness (EP). The response to treatment for EP individuals receiving CSC, however, remains highly variable. A substantial proportion show minimal symptom reduction despite receiving the full range of evidence-based practices comprising this treatment model. Currently, clinicians have no way to predict which EP individuals entering CSC will respond to treatment and published data show that expert clinicians perform no better than chance. Early identification of treatment non-responders has very high clinical significance and would inform and enhance clinical decision making during the first few months of care. Surprisingly, little research has been conducted on baseline predictors of treatment outcomes in EP individuals entering CSC. During the past two decades, considerable progress has been made using neuroimaging to investigate pathophysiological processes during the early phases of illness. Furthermore, limited data suggest that fMRI measures of brain activity and PET measures of increased dopamine synthesis are related to treatment outcomes in EP. We have recently demonstrated in a moderately large sample of EP patients entering CSC that the ability to activate the frontal parietal (FP) cognitive control network (measured using fMRI during the AX- CPT task) is a significant predictor of who will meet responder criterion after one year of CSC. We propose to replicate and extend this result by examining the predictive ability of this and two other promising MRI based measures linked to pathophysiological processes related to psychosis: 1) free water diffusion tensor imaging (FW) - a putative biomarker of neuroinflammation that is increased in EP individuals, and 2) midbrain neuromelanin (NM) scans, which index midbrain dopamine, shown to be decreased in Parkinson's disease and increased in schizophrenia. Each of these measures will be used individually to predict responder status for EP participants entering CSC. In addition to these analyses we will use novel deep learning methods to optimize the prediction of treatment response in EP individuals entering CSC and to obtain new insights into the mechanisms underlying these effects. Our goal is to leverage recent progress in the development of MRI based imaging biomarkers to develop a precision medicine tool that can identify early psychosis patients entering CSC who are at high risk for non-response and thereby inform treatment decision making for all patients in order to optimize the recovery of young individuals following the onset of psychotic illness. A substantial proportion of early psychosis EP individuals show minimal symptom reduction despite receiving the full range of evidence-based practices provided by coordinated specialty care (CSC). Currently, clinicians have no way to predict which EP individuals entering CSC will respond and who will not. In this project we will leverage recent progress in the development of pathophysiologically informed MRI based imaging biomarkers along with novel computational image analysis, to develop a precision medicine tool that can identify early psychosis patients entering CSC who are at high risk for non-response and thereby inform clinical decision making to optimize the recovery of young individuals following the onset of psychotic illness.",Pathophysiology Informed Biomarkers of Treatment Response in Early Psychosis (PIB),10060889,R01MH122139,"['Adjuvant', 'Admission activity', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Clozapine', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Dopamine', 'Early identification', 'Early treatment', 'Effectiveness', 'Enrollment', 'Evidence based practice', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Midbrain structure', 'Modeling', 'Noise', 'Parietal', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Psychotherapy', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Publishing', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Schizophrenia', 'Series', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment outcome', 'base', 'candidate marker', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinically significant', 'cognitive control', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'gray matter', 'high risk', 'imaging biomarker', 'indexing', 'ineffective therapies', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'medical specialties', 'medication compliance', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroinflammation', 'neuromelanin', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'predicting response', 'psychosocial', 'reduce symptoms', 'relating to nervous system', 'responders and non-responders', 'standard of care', 'support tools', 'tool', 'treatment responders', 'treatment response', 'water diffusion', 'white matter']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R01,2020,757956,-0.0025742744172667278
"Novel Techniques for Evaluating and Assessing Symptoms, Affect. Heart Rhythm and Functional Status in Patients with Atrial Fibrillation: miAfib Project Project Summary/Abstract Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most prevalent, major arrhythmia in the United States. It leads to an increased risk of stroke, congestive heart failure, and overall mortality. AF is also characterized by symptoms in a majority of patients that can result in significant decreases in health related quality of life and functional status, which are strong predictors of all-cause and cardiovascular hospitalizations in patients with AF. Therefore, improvement in symptoms is an important therapeutic goal in the management of patients with AF along with reducing the risk of stroke and mortality. However, previous studies evaluating symptoms in AF have been limited by their retrospective assessment of symptoms that limits our ability to assess the relationship between heart rhythm, symptoms, affect and functional status in real time. To address all of these gaps, we propose an innovative study that will intensively examine 100 patients with paroxysmal AF using a continuous heart rhythm recorder and a novel mobile application to collect data on symptom and affect ratings during multiple occasions across a day for three weeks. We will then be able to examine the relationship between symptoms, affect, heart rhythm as well as additional features within the ECG recording and assess their effect on functional status in patients with AF. We hypothesize that 1) some symptoms will be much more specifically indicative of being in AF (e.g. palpitations) than others (e.g. fatigue) 2) ECG features derived from signal processing and machine learning algorithms (especially those that serve as surrogates for autonomic function) will be more sensitive and specific for determining the presence and severity of symptoms compared to average heart rate 3) there will be a strong relationship between affect, and both symptoms and functional status . The overarching goal of this proposal is for candidate (Hamid Ghanbari, MD, MPH) to develop an independent research program examining symptoms and associated decline in functional status in patients with paroxysmal AF. The candidate will build upon his previous training by partnering with a team of mentors who are experts in ecological momentary assessment methodology, signal processing and machine learning, affect, and functional status to acquire expertise in evaluation of repeated, real-time assessments of symptoms and to explore novel ECG features that predict symptoms beyond the presence or absence of AF. In concert with the proposed study, the candidate will also pursue didactic training and one-on-one mentoring related to his research aims. This proposal will more clearly characterize symptoms and their physiological and psychological correlates and their subsequent influence on functional status in patients with AF. The insights obtained through this proposal could eventually lead to individualized behavioral and medical interventions that best address these symptoms and associated dysfunction. Project Narrative - Public Health Relevance Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most prevalent arrhythmia in the United States and is associated with an increase in the risk of stroke, congestive heart failure and overall mortality. Despite the importance of AF, our understanding of symptoms associated with AF is limited by studies that rely on evaluation of symptoms based on a single clinical visit.

"A Role for Glycemic Variation in Optimizing Management of Diabetes and Vascular Complications PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT A role for glycemic variation in optimizing management of diabetes and vascular complications It is well demonstrated that high glucose levels lead to more rapid development of macrovascular and microvascular complications in people with diabetes. However, there is less consistent evidence that lowering glucose levels to near normal levels prevent or slows vascular complications, particularly in more advanced stages of type 2 diabetes. The recent VADT, ACCORD, and ADVANCE trials demonstrated that intensive efforts to lower glucose had only modest effects on the rate of vascular complications. Why glycemic control strategies that focused on reduction of glucose levels and HbA1c did not have the anticipated success in reducing vascular outcomes is not clear. This has raised the possibility that (1) there are glycemic metrics beyond those that reflect average glucose control, such as HbA1c, that can explain this paradox, and (2) there exists heterogeneous treatment effects of intensive glycemic therapy for macrovascular and microvascular complications, with subgroups of patients who do less well with intensive treatment counter-balancing those that do respond. In recent reports we have demonstrated long-term glycemic variability was associated with risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) events, even after adjusting for traditional markers of glycemic control. Importantly, this appeared most relevant to those receiving intensive glycemic control. These preliminary findings support careful examination of determinants and consequences of glycemic variability. In this proposal, we therefore propose to (a) evaluate and compare the importance of glycemic variation, both short-term measured by 1,5-anhydroglucitol and long-term in the development of macro and microvascular complications; (b) to study whether intensive treatment is beneficial in preventing vascular outcomes when glycemic variation is constrained; (c) genetic variants associated with glycemic variation in T2D patients will explain additional risk in progression to vascular complications beyond the genetic variants associated with mean glycemic levels. PROJECT NARRATIVE The major goals of glucose-lowering therapy in T2D are to reduce the incidence and progression of both microvascular and macrovascular complications. However, several large clinical trials that focused on reduction of glucose levels and HbA1c did not have the anticipated success in reducing macrovascular outcomes. Our proposal focuses on filling the gap of identifying the role of glycemic variability (short-term and long-term) in optimizing management of diabetes and vascular complications.",A Role for Glycemic Variation in Optimizing Management of Diabetes and Vascular Complications,10040813,R21HL150374,"['Algorithms', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Equilibrium', 'Event', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Risk', 'Glucose', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'Goals', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Life Style', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Measures', 'Microvascular Dysfunction', 'Modeling', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Outcome', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Population', 'Principal Investigator', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Subgroup', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'base', 'blood glucose regulation', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'database of Genotypes and Phenotypes', 'diabetes management', 'genetic variant', 'genome-wide', 'glycemic control', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'macrovascular disease', 'patient subsets', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'random forest', 'secondary analysis', 'standard care', 'success', 'treatment arm', 'treatment effect']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R21,2020,122816,-0.007114140435060274
"Visible-light OCT angiography, velocimetry, and oximetry for characterizing retinal vascular alterations in glaucoma Project Summary Glaucoma damage to the optic nerve and impairment of vision are progressive and irreversible. Understanding mechanisms of glaucomatous injury will help to develop new approaches for treatments that can be used along with traditional therapies that lower intraocular pressure (IOP). Recent developments in optical coherence tomography (OCT) angiography have brought increased attention to the role of the inner retinal circulation in glaucoma. To improve our understanding of retinal vascular alterations in glaucoma, we can take advantage of recent developments in visible-light OCT (vis-OCT) to characterize simultaneously tissue structure, vessel density, blood flow and oxygenation. The goal of this project is to further advance vis-OCT by attaining capillary-level measurements, test the value of measuring their local alterations as early indicators of glaucoma and glaucomatous progression and use this to evaluate impaired retinal autoregulation from retinal ganglion cell (RGC) loss as a potential cause of increased susceptibility in advanced glaucoma. In Specific Aim 1 we will develop high-speed, high-sensitivity, high-resolution vis-OCT. The speed will be double that of the current system. A more stable supercontinuum laser will be used to improve system sensitivity, and a tighter focus will be used to improve lateral resolution. This will enable complete detection of capillaries that may be vulnerable to vascular dysfunction. Specific Aim 2 will develop quantitative OCT angiography, velocimetry and oximetry in capillaries as well as arteries and veins. Building on the high-resolution, high-contrast scans acquired in Aim 1, we will use machine learning to segment capillary plexuses, and advanced image processing to extract capillary architecture. Aided by this capillary architecture, we will automatically measure blood flow and oxygenation in capillary segments and incorporate them into a real-time platform. Specific Aim 3 will use this system to demonstrate that acute loss of RGCs, produced by optic nerve transection, alters retinal capillary plexus density, oximetry and velocimetry over time and that these changes precede altered oximetry and flow in larger retinal vessels. We will also show that loss of RGCs impairs the autoregulatory response to acute IOP challenge. In Specific Aim 4, we will demonstrate that optic nerve injury in a model of controlled, elevated IOP produces early alterations in capillary velocimetry, oximetry and autoregulation, show that they are more persistent with advanced injury, and demonstrate the pathophysiologic consequences of these observations. Successful development of this new technology will improve methods of early glaucoma diagnosis and detection of progression. Better understanding of retinal vascular factors that lead to increased susceptibility in advanced glaucoma will lead to improved treatments for these highly vulnerable patients. Project Narrative This project will develop advanced technology to image retinal capillaries and measure capillary blood flow and oxygen content. This may provide an early indicator of glaucoma progression and help study a potential cause of increased susceptibility to intraocular pressure in glaucoma patients.","Visible-light OCT angiography, velocimetry, and oximetry for characterizing retinal vascular alterations in glaucoma",9944107,R01EY031394,"['3-Dimensional', 'Abbreviations', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Angiography', 'Architecture', 'Arteries', 'Attention', 'Axon', 'Blindness', 'Blood Circulation', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood capillaries', 'Blood flow', 'Computer software', 'Defect', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Event', 'Eye', 'Glaucoma', 'Glossary', 'Goals', 'Homeostasis', 'Impairment', 'Injury', 'Intraocular pressure test', 'Lasers', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Lighting', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Noise', 'Optic Nerve', 'Optic Nerve Injuries', 'Optic Nerve Transections', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Oxygen', 'Oxygen saturation measurement', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physiologic Intraocular Pressure', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Progressive Disease', 'Rattus', 'Resolution', 'Retina', 'Retinal Ganglion Cells', 'Rodent Model', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Structure of central vein of the retina', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Veins', 'Velocimetries', 'Visible Radiation', 'Vision', 'Visual impairment', 'attenuation', 'automated segmentation', 'central retinal artery', 'data acquisition', 'deep learning', 'density', 'image processing', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'metabolic rate', 'new technology', 'novel strategies', 'preservation', 'pressure', 'prototype', 'response', 'retina blood vessel structure', 'retina circulation', 'retinal imaging', 'retinal ischemia', 'traditional therapy', 'vascular factor']",NEI,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,552591,-0.019864429896790967
"Development and Validation of Quantitative Anterior Segment OCT-based Methods to Evaluate Patients with Primary Angle Closure Disease PROJECT SUMMARY Primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG), the most severe form of primary angle closure disease (PACD), is a leading cause of permanent blindness worldwide. Gonioscopy, a qualitative and subjective angle assessment method, is the current clinical standard for diagnosing PACD despite its limited ability to quantify disease severity, especially in patients with early angle closure. Anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT) is a quantitative and objective imaging-based method for assessing the angle. However, there are limited methods for clinicians to apply AS-OCT to the care of angle closure patients. The primary objectives of this K23 career development proposal are: 1) to demonstrate the benefit of a quantitative anterior segment OCT-based approach to evaluating patients with PACD and develop classification models for PACD based on AS-OCT measurements; and 2) to provide an academic glaucoma specialist with the training and mentored research experience necessary to conduct independent clinical research. Achieving these objectives will provide critical skills and experiences necessary to establish an independent research program focused on applying AS-OCT imaging to improve the clinical care of patients with PACD. The proposed K23 application will provide additional training in four vital areas: 1) epidemiology and mechanisms of chronic disease; 2) classification of disease and prediction of disease risk; 3) biostatistical methods for clinical research; 4) machine learning and automated data analysis. The proposed research will use population-based data collected as part of the NIH-funded Chinese American Eye Study (CHES) to compare AS-OCT and gonioscopic assessments of angle width and determine the strength of association between these assessments and known PACD risk factors. The relationship between the degree of angle closure, measured by AS-OCT, and intraocular pressure (IOP), a sequela of angle closure and strong risk factor for glaucoma, will be characterized with CHES data and validated with data obtained by using a novel pupil control system on PACD patients recruited from the USC Roski Eye Institute (USCREI). Classification models for PACD stage and severity based on AS-OCT data from CHES will be developed using machine learning algorithms and validated with prospective data from USCREI patients with PACD. The results of the proposed research will provide the foundation for a future longitudinal study examining the benefit of using anterior segment OCT-based assessments and classification models to evaluate PACD patients and deliver targeted treatment to patients with higher risk for PACG. The ultimate goal of my research is to develop quantitative imaging-based diagnostic and treatment protocols that guide the standardized care of PACD patients and decrease the incidence of PACG and its associated ocular morbidity. PROJECT NARRATIVE The management of angle closure patients at risk for primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG), the most severe form of primary angle closure disease (PACD) and a leading cause of permanent vision loss worldwide, poses a significant challenge for eye care providers. Gonioscopy, a qualitative and subjective angle assessment method, is the current clinical standard for evaluating angle closure patients despite its limited ability to quantify PACD severity and predict progression to PACG.

"BDD CIS: Big Data Driven Clinical Informatics & Surveillance - A Multimodal Database Focused Clinical, Community, & Multi-Omics Surveillance Plan for COVID19 Abstract With South Carolina’s population already being vulnerable to poor health as evidenced by poor national health rankings, challenging rural geography and health professional shortages, the impact of the novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) will be long lasting in the state. Patient morbidity and mortality rates already continue to increase, with ongoing economic damage to health systems and businesses. The speed of transmission and geographical spread of COVID-19 across South Carolina and the United States is alarming, which combined with the novel nature of the disease justifies the need for accelerated research to combat this pandemic. As clinicians and frontline health workers battle to save lives, creating a data environment that accelerates research is key, and necessary to battle the disease. Access to such information will equip frontline health workers to continue the fight against the disease. This proposal will build the capacity for accelerated research and intelligence gathering by coalescing multiple state partners and leveraging relevant data for discoveries around COVID-19. To accomplish this, this proposal aims to (1) create a de-identified linked database system via REDCap and a mobile application (app) to collate surveillance, clinical, multi-omics and geospatial data on both COVID-19 patients and health workers treating COVID-19 patients in South Carolina; (2) examine the natural history of COVID-19 including transmission dynamics, disease progression, and geospatial visualization; and (3) identify important predictors of short- and long-term clinical outcomes of COVID-19 patients in South Carolina using machine learning algorithms. These aims will be accomplished through collaborations with multiple state agencies and stakeholders relevant to COVID-19 and the creation of a REDCap database and mobile app that allow for coalescing relevant data in a timely fashion, combined with leveraging of statewide integrated data warehouse capabilities. Project Narrative COVID-19 represents an opportunity to create and deploy a research system that allows accelerated research on any pandemic. While South Carolina is rural in nature, and has low health rankings, it has a powerful integrated health data infrastructure that allows for tracking short-and long-term clinical and health system impacts of pandemics like the novel coronavirus (COVID-19). The creation of multiple data sources at the individual level, coupled with innovative big data science techniques will advance important discoveries in disease surveillance, transmission, natural history and progression important for treatment and necessary for targeted intervention purposes in South Carolina.","BDD CIS: Big Data Driven Clinical Informatics & Surveillance - A Multimodal Database Focused Clinical, Community, & Multi-Omics Surveillance Plan for COVID19",10136980,R01AI127203,"['2019-nCoV', 'Active Learning', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Architecture', 'Archives', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'Businesses', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Chest', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Collaborations', 'Common Cold', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Confidentiality of Patient Information', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Discovery', 'Data Sources', 'Database Management Systems', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease Surveillance', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Economics', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Health', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'Health Professional', 'Health Sciences', 'Health system', 'High Resolution Computed Tomography', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intelligence', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multiple Partners', 'Natural History', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Precision Health', 'Provider', 'Recovery', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rural', 'SARS coronavirus', 'Secure', 'Series', 'Source', 'South Carolina', 'Speed', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'United States', 'Virus', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'big-data science', 'combat', 'data infrastructure', 'data management', 'data warehouse', 'deep learning', 'demographics', 'disability', 'disease natural history', 'disease transmission', 'experience', 'fight against', 'gene therapy', 'health data', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mobile application', 'mortality', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'multiple data sources', 'multiple omics', 'novel', 'novel coronavirus', 'novel virus', 'pandemic disease', 'patient privacy', 'precision medicine', 'response', 'systems research', 'time use', 'transmission process', 'trend', 'virology']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA AT COLUMBIA,R01,2020,626275,-0.044962508562836984
"Prediction of Clinical Deterioration Using a Bayesian Belief System Project Summary/Abstract Approximately 5-10% of hospitalized patients suffer significant clinical deterioration after admission, resulting in either transfer to the intensive care unit (ICU) or a ""code"" event (i.e., cardiac or pulmonary arrest). Delayed identification of these events result in increased morbidity and mortality. Unfortunately, existing prediction models result in multiple false alarms for every true positive alarm that they generate. In addition with every passing year, new monitoring systems are introduced that generate more false alarms, resulting in alarm fatigue which has been associated with patient deaths. The objective of this mentored career development proposal is to develop and assess novel computational algorithms that can predict the clinical deterioration of hospitalized patients earlier and more accurately than clinicians or conventional early warning systems, thereby allowing for timely intervention. Building upon our experience in the hematologic malignancy subpopulation of hospitalized patients, this new effort: 1) provides a foundation upon which to combine newer machine learning (ML) methods and clinical informatics to improve the capabilities of the model for an individual patient or specific subgroup; 2) assesses the impact and value of different variables from the electronic medical record (EMR) as part of the predictive model; and 3) broadens the evaluation of this approach to additional real-world patient populations, enabling insight into the translation of the models to clinical usage. The specific aims of this project are thus: Specific Aims Aim 1 To identify and extract model variables (features) from the EMR, evaluating different feature selection  methods to optimize different predictive criterion and their impact on ML algorithms. Aim 2 To develop an ML approach that handles multiple asynchronous data streams of longitudinal  information from the EMR, providing predictions on clinical deterioration in real-time. Aim 3 To explore clinician and rapid response team responses to early prediction of clinical deterioration. With successful completion of this proposal, the prediction model will be integrated into the EMR system. Future direction as part of a R01 proposal will involve external validation at other institutions and assessment of clinical impact on patient care. Relevance to Public Health Clinical deterioration in the hospital is often unexpected and is associated with increased mortality and morbidity, with the CDC reporting 17.2 million hospital admissions through the emergency department in 2010 suggesting that approximately 1 million people annually are at risk of clinical deterioration during their hospitalization. Existing early warning systems have not been able to accurately predict these events without creating an overwhelming amount of additional false positive alarms, resulting in alarm fatigue and potential harm. Our project, utilizing machine learning techniques with the large amount of available clinical data, will serve to develop a predictive model that can predict clinical deterioration earlier with a higher positive predictive value than current algorithms/models which, when implemented, will be able to provide hospitalized patients with an additional safety net.",Prediction of Clinical Deterioration Using a Bayesian Belief System,9999034,K01LM012873,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Admission activity', 'Algorithms', 'Belief System', 'Cardiac', 'Caring', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical assessments', 'Code', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Coupled', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Deterioration', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Fatigue', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Health Personnel', 'Heart Arrest', 'Hematologic Neoplasms', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Inpatients', 'Institution', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nature', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Science', 'Specificity', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'United Kingdom', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Workload', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'burnout', 'career development', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'clinical predictors', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'computer science', 'data streams', 'experience', 'feature selection', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'mental state', 'mortality', 'novel', 'patient population', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'response', 'safety net', 'skills']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,K01,2020,205524,-0.03648379550607712
"A Model for Predicting 2-Year Risk of Incident Late Age-related Macular Degeneration PROJECT SUMMARY Age-related macular degeneration (AMD), in the dry or wet form, is the leading cause of vision loss in the developed countries. The Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) showed that specific antioxidant vitamin supplementation reduces the risk of progression from intermediate stages to late AMD and maintains visual acuity in approximately 25% of patients. While treatment of wet AMD with Intraocular injections can be effective in maintaining vision, such treatments are costly and may be associated with significant cardiovascular risks, or even progression of dry AMD. Hence, it is critical to identify patients at the earlier stages. Unfortunately, there is no effective, automated screening tool to accomplish this, and the patients themselves may be asymptomatic. The goal of this SBIR Direct-to-Phase II proposal is to provide such tool. We have demonstrated the feasibility of AMD screening software ‘iPredictTM’ by successfully identifying 98.1% of individuals with early or intermediate stage AMD. iPredictTM also successfully predicted which individuals would develop late AMD within one year with 87.8% accuracy and two years with 88.4% accuracy. iPredictTM has prototype components for image analysis and machine learning. We also developed a HIPAA compliant telemedicine platform which will enable iPredictTM to perform large-scale screening from remote and rural areas. In order to bring the product to market, these components need to be integrated and tested which is the aim of our proposed Direct-to-Phase II proposal. We aim to develop the finished product which will be ready for the market. We also aim to evaluate the efficacy of iPredictTM in a clinical setup. The AMD preventative market is estimated around $5.4 billion in the U.S. alone. iPredictTM will capture the major market share with its best accuracy and be the first prediction tool for AMD. We aim to commercialize iPredictTM for the screening and prevention of AMD, saving millions of citizens from blindness and reduced quality of life. With iPredictTM’s improvements in speed of delivery, cost of care, and ease of access, the product will be a significant addition to the healthcare system. The iPredictTM’s telemedicine platform will allow large-scale screening from remote/rural areas, primary care clinics, optometry offices and ophthalmology clinics. PROJECT NARRATIVE Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) in its late forms, “dry” or “wet”, is the leading cause of blindness in developed countries. Early intervention and therapy can significantly reduce the progression of early to late AMD. Hence, the identification of patients with early AMD and referral to an ophthalmologist is critically needed to help prevent vision loss. To achieve this goal, we propose to develop an automated screening and prediction system that can be widely deployed to identify these individuals at risk of vision loss.",A Model for Predicting 2-Year Risk of Incident Late Age-related Macular Degeneration,10010769,R44EY031202,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Age related macular degeneration', 'American', 'Antioxidants', 'Blindness', 'Categories', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinics and Hospitals', 'Code', 'Color', 'Computer software', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Developed Countries', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Drusen', 'Ear', 'Early Intervention', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Eye diseases', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Fees', 'Goals', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Incentives', 'Individual', 'Injections', 'Intervention', 'Java', 'Lasers', 'Learning Module', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Minerals', 'Modeling', 'New York', 'Nonexudative age-related macular degeneration', 'Ophthalmologist', 'Ophthalmology', 'Optometry', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Primary Health Care', 'Provider', 'Pythons', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Retina', 'Retinal Degeneration', 'Retinal Diseases', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sales', 'Savings', 'Screening procedure', 'Severities', 'Side', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Smoking', 'Specialist', 'Speed', 'Sun Exposure', 'Supplementation', 'System', 'Telemedicine', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Trademark', 'Treatment Cost', 'Validation', 'Vision', 'Visit', 'Visual Acuity', 'Vitamins', 'age related', 'base', 'biobank', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'care costs', 'checkup examination', 'commercial application', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'photobiomodulation', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'research clinical testing', 'retinal imaging', 'rural area', 'screening', 'sociodemographic factors', 'software as a service', 'success', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NEI,"IHEALTHSCREEN, INC.",R44,2020,585067,-0.004046924859676579
"Precision immunoprofiling to reveal diagnostic biomarkers of latent TB infection PROJECT SUMMARY  Tuberculosis (TB) is among the leading causes of mortality worldwide with an estimated 2 billion individuals currently infected. Latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) is the most common form of TB infection affecting 13 million Americans. While many with LTBI remain asymptomatic, an estimated 10% of immunocompetent patients with LTBI will reactivate to active TB, and will become infectious. LTBI is treatable with a prolonged antibiotic treatment; however, potential side effects motivate the development of new diagnostic approaches that can identify with high specificity patients at the highest risk of reactivation, for who therapy would be most beneficial.  The tuberculin skin test (TST) and interferon-γ release assays (IGRAs) are commonly used for TB and LTBI screening. Both tests provide good measures of TB exposure; however, neither is effective at diagnosing LTBI (positive predictive values <5%). Moreover, neither provide any prognostic stratification based upon reactivation risk. Both the TST and IGRAs probe immunological memory to TB-related antigen challenges and we hypothesize that a more nuanced and personalized approach to monitoring immune responses to both TB- specific and non-specific antigens might reveal new approaches to LTBI diagnosis and patient stratification.  Enabling a new, individualized approach to LTBI diagnostics, we propose to combine high throughput, multiplexed inflammatory biomarker detection strategies and powerful bioinformatics tools that allow for the identification of previously obscured multi-marker diagnostic signatures of LTBI status and reactivation risk. Silicon photonic microring resonators are an enabling technology for biomarker analysis due to their intrinsic scalability and multiplexing capabilities. Applied to the detection of cytokine panels, this technology supports the rapid immune profiling of individual samples under both TB-specific and non-specific antigen stimulation conditions. Machine learning algorithms will be utilized to analyze the resulting dense data streams to facilitate selection of key diagnostic signatures forming the basis for predictive model development and deployment. This powerful analytical combination is supplemented by deep expertise in clinical diagnosis and treatment of TB and LTBI, and an enabling collaboration and connection to subjects from an international location with high TB burden and exposure in a healthcare worker population subjected to regularly-scheduled and repeated LTBI screening.  The resulting diagnostic workflow and machine learning feature selection approaches will reveal multiplexed biomarker signatures that have strong positive predictive correlation with LTBI status (+ or -). This approach will also further stratify LTBI+ subjects on the basis of reactivation potential, thus providing a fundamentally new approach to identifying subjects that are most likely to benefit from therapeutic intervention. The end result of this project will be a new precision medicine-based diagnostic strategy that is vastly superior to the current state-of-the-art and offers the potential to transform current clinical practice. PROJECT NARRATIVE Tuberculosis (TB) affects an estimated one third of the world’s population and an asymptomatic latent state of tuberculosis infection (LTBI) is extremely common. Unfortunately, there are not any good clinical tests that can definitely diagnose LTBI, making it difficult to identify patients that should be treated to prevent reactivation to active TB, which is infectious. We will integrate cutting edge measurement technologies and machine learning bioinformatic approaches to identify and test multiplexed biomarker signatures that will transform clinical TB management by enabling personalized diagnosis of LTBI and the stratification of individuals with the highest potential for reactivation.",Precision immunoprofiling to reveal diagnostic biomarkers of latent TB infection,10006790,R01AI141591,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Antigens', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Cytokine Network Pathway', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health Personnel', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunocompetent', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Immunologic Memory', 'Immunologic Monitoring', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory', 'Informatics', 'Interferons', 'International', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevention strategy', 'Regimen', 'Residual state', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Schedule', 'Silicon', 'Specificity', 'Stratification', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Translations', 'Tuberculin Test', 'Tuberculosis', 'Whole Blood', 'antigen challenge', 'base', 'bioinformatics tool', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical practice', 'cytokine', 'data streams', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'feature selection', 'high risk', 'immune function', 'immunoregulation', 'improved', 'individual variation', 'latent infection', 'machine learning algorithm', 'model development', 'monocyte', 'mortality', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel strategies', 'patient stratification', 'personalized approach', 'personalized diagnostics', 'photonics', 'precision medicine', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'response', 'screening', 'side effect', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'tuberculosis treatment']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2020,722295,0.0035230223778137375
"Public Insurance Design and Health at Older Ages PROJECT ABSTRACT Health insurance has been at the forefront of US public policy debate throughout the last decade. For elderly Americans, who benefit from nearly universal coverage under Medicare, decisions about the scope of their insurance coverage have been a central policy concern since Medicare’s inception in 1965. Medicare’s coverage is extensive, but by statute the program only covers medical services that are “reasonable and necessary,” which can be a controversial definition. Some decisions about what Medicare should cover have engendered intense debate, underscoring the importance of the program’s coverage decisions for millions of patients and doctors. The debate around the scope of Medicare coverage is likely to intensify in the coming decades as options for medical treatment, and testing, expand rapidly, the population ages, and public insurance systems grapple with how to address inequality in access to medical innovations. Yet, despite the importance of decisions about the scope of insurance coverage in and outside of Medicare, we know little about how the scope of coverage (as opposed to patient cost-sharing), affects treatment choices, clinical practice, and health outcomes for the elderly. The research outlined in this proposal aims to start filling this gap. The project investigates how the presence or lack of insurance coverage for specific procedural or pharmacologic therapies affects treatment decisions and health outcomes for the elderly with Alzheimer’s Disease and related Dementias (ADRD). This is a population that may be particularly vulnerable to changes and limits in insurance coverage, as the patients may have limited decision-making capacity and may be disproportionately exposed to treatments that are deemed experimental and lacking effectiveness to clear the “reasonable and necessary” threshold. Aim 1 of the project is to estimate the average effect of coverage decisions across prescription drugs and outpatient procedures on treatment decisions and health outcomes of elderly Medicare enrollees with ADRD. Aim 2 is to predict and characterize the subgroups of ADRD patients that are most likely to be affected by decisions that restrict the scope of insurance coverage using machine learning methods. The proposed empirical method is to use quasi- experimental variation that arises from natural experiments of abrupt changes in insurance coverage within different parts of the Medicare program. The analysis takes advantage of variation in the scope of formularies across Medicare Part D plans, as well as the variation in local coverage decisions for physician services and outpatient procedures under Medicare Part B. These sources of variation coupled with methods for quasi- experimental estimation of treatment effects and machine learning methods for heterogeneity analyses, allow estimating the response of treatment decisions and health of the elderly with ADRD across different drugs, procedures, and subgroups of ADRD patients. PROJECT NARRATIVE For elderly Americans, who benefit from nearly universal coverage under Medicare, decisions about the scope of their insurance coverage have been a central policy concern since Medicare’s inception in 1965 - Medicare’s coverage is extensive, but nevertheless incomplete as by statute the program only covers medical services that are “reasonable and necessary,” which can be hard to define. The debate around the scope of Medicare coverage is likely to intensify in the coming decades as options for medical treatment, and testing, expand rapidly, the population ages, and public insurance systems grapple with how to address inequality in access to medical innovations. In this project I investigate how changes in coverage for prescription drugs, physician office visits, and outpatient procedures affect the treatment received by elderly patients with Alzheimer’s Disease and related dementias (ADRD), who often face coverage limitations due to experimental nature of many ADRD treatments, and yet may be most vulnerable to unintended consequences of any coverage restrictions.",Public Insurance Design and Health at Older Ages,9928348,K01AG059843,"['Address', 'Admission activity', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'American', 'Amyloid', 'Anxiety', 'Barbiturates', 'Benzodiazepines', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Cost Sharing', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Drug Targeting', 'Economics', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Family Physicians', 'Formularies', 'Fracture', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Geriatrics', 'Gerontology', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Health Insurance', 'Heart', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'Inequality', 'Insurance', 'Insurance Coverage', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Learning Skill', 'Length of Stay', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicare', 'Medicare Part B', 'Mental Depression', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Movement', 'Natural experiment', 'Nature', 'Office Visits', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Outpatients', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Physicians', 'Policies', 'Policy Maker', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Procedures', 'Public Policy', 'Race', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Services', 'Skilled Nursing Facilities', 'Source', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic procedure', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universal Coverage', 'Variant', 'aging population', 'alternative treatment', 'bariatric surgery', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'comorbidity', 'decision-making capacity', 'design', 'experience', 'high dimensionality', 'innovation', 'insurance claims', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'older patient', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'public health insurance', 'response', 'socioeconomics', 'theories', 'tool', 'treatment choice', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response']",NIA,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K01,2020,126700,0.0006359227314093062
"The Dynamics of Human Atrial Fibrillation Project Summary  Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a major arrhythmia worldwide, causing palpitations, stroke and mortality, and affecting 2-5 million Americans. Unfortunately, therapy to eliminate AF has had limited success. In our last funding cycle, we focused on localized drivers as potential AF mechanisms. Mapping of drivers has now been validated by concurrent optical mapping of human AF, and their features and have been validated by several other methods in patients. Nevertheless, ablation results for these and other proposed mechanisms for AF outside the pulmonary veins are mixed. It is unclear if this reflects difficulties of AF mapping, or different mechanisms between patients.  The project will develop a novel mechanistic framework for AF that simplifies existing indices by building on scientific consensus that organized AF is easier to treat, and disorganized AF has worse prognosis. This concept spans many existing indices and may help to reconcile them. We have 3 specific aims: (1) To define if the impact of ablation depends on the extent of organizing surrounding the ablation site; (2) To establish candidate mechanisms for organized and disorganized AF zones in individual patients with specific profiles, using machine learning applied to known cases with and without ablation success in our large registry. This comprises detailed AF maps during ablation and after Maze surgery, clinical data and outcomes. (3) To use novel clinical tools to predict whether patients will respond to PVI, other ablation or Maze surgery based on whether targeted regions control larger atrial areas and their locations.  This study will deliver immediate translational and clinical impact, and directly enable personalized medicine for AF ablation. We use detailed clinical mapping in patients, signal processing and computer modeling to develop a novel mechanistic framework and widely applicable clinical tools. We will use tools including machine learning and statistics to classify mechanisms based upon outcomes from ablation in individual patients. We will make our data and code available online. Our team is experienced in electrophysiology, computer science, machine learning, biological physics and statistics. The proposal is thus highly feasible. The Dynamics of Human Atrial Fibrillation Narrative Atrial fibrillation (AF) is an enormous public health problem in the United States, affecting 2-5 million Americans and causing rapid heart beats, stroke, heart failure or death. In this project, the applicant will develop a novel framework to better understand human AF that builds on agreement between several concepts for the disease. The applicant will develop strategies to identify AF patients who will best respond to each of several therapies, to guide personalized therapy.",The Dynamics of Human Atrial Fibrillation,10071621,R01HL083359,"['Ablation', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Arrhythmia', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Biological', 'Biometry', 'Body Surface', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Computer Models', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Disease', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Fibrosis', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Heart Atrium', 'Heart failure', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Lesion', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Observational Study', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Palpitations', 'Paper', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physics', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Pulmonary veins', 'Registries', 'Right atrial structure', 'Rotation', 'Schools', 'Site', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Stroke', 'Structural defect', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical application', 'cohort', 'computer science', 'demographics', 'digital', 'experience', 'genomic data', 'hands-on learning', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome forecast', 'patient stratification', 'personalized medicine', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'response', 'signal processing', 'statistics', 'success', 'therapy development', 'tool']",NHLBI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,770947,-0.023897593011430185
"Operationalizing Machine Learning and Discrete Event Simulation Models to Improve Clinic Efficiency PROJECT SUMMARY Physicians often report feeling pressured to see more patients to maintain revenue, while having less available time for patient care. Systematic data-driven methods for efficiently scheduling patients are important as physicians are pressured to see more and more patients. We propose that real time prediction models of patient visit lengths, the likelihood of missing appointments, and of patient wait times will help schedule patients more efficiently. Clinics will be able to safely overbook to avoid empty slots from missed appointments, have guidance for scheduling urgent add-on patients, and provide wait time estimates for patients when there are delays. We will develop methodologies for accessing data needed for these predictions in real time and propose that the integration of these models into workflows will improve scheduling accuracy, patient wait time, and patient satisfaction, while also increasing clinic volumes. PROJECT NARRATIVE Physicians report feeling pressured to see more patients to maintain revenue, while having less available time for patient care. Machine learning and discrete event simulation model predictions can help schedule patients more efficiently, but need to be integrated into the EHR and scheduling workflows to be effective. This study will develop methodologies for accessing real time data in the electronic health record (EHR) for research applications and predictive models so they can be integrated into scheduling workflows, and then will evaluate their effectiveness for clinic efficiency and patient satisfaction.",Operationalizing Machine Learning and Discrete Event Simulation Models to Improve Clinic Efficiency,10030242,R01LM013426,"['Affect', 'Ambulatory Care Facilities', 'Appointment', 'Books', 'Childhood', 'Client satisfaction', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Event', 'Face', 'Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources', 'Feeling', 'Glaucoma', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Ophthalmology', 'Outpatients', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Schedules', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Production', 'Provider', 'Quality of Care', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Schedule', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Visit', 'Wait Time', 'Work', 'application programming interface', 'barrier to care', 'base', 'burnout', 'data access', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'electronic data', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'models and simulation', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'pressure', 'prospective', 'tool']",NLM,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,327250,-0.021451978514131602
"Early Mobilization: Operationalizing Big Data & Implementation Science to Lead Expansion to ICUs (E-MOBILE-ICU) PROJECT SUMMARY Almost 800,000 critically ill patients require mechanical ventilation every year and three quarters of the survivors suffer from persistent disability, which poses a major public health problem as critical care becomes more widely utilized and available. Although early mobilization, which engages patients in physical activity during mechanical ventilation, is a promising evidence-based intervention that may prevent disability, less than ten percent of pa- tients ever get out of bed. This proposal aims to apply precision medicine to identify patients who are most likely to benefit from early mobilization and elucidate how it can be implemented successfully to extend the benefits of early mobilization to critical care survivors at greatest risk for long-term disability. I hypothesize that this re- source-intensive intervention can be applied with greater precision to a subset of patients most likely to bene- fit, and that implementation science strategies can be devised to successfully drive adoption of this interven- tion beyond a clinical trial setting. I will test my hypothesis in three aims: Aim 1) I will identify the optimal critical illness phenotype for implementation of early mobilization by using cutting-edge machine learning methods; Aim 2) I will determine the effect of early mobilization on long-term functional disability to incentivize adoption of this practice; Aim 3) I will determine the barriers and facilitators of implementation of early mobilization across five institutions to identify the contextual features associated with successful implementation to inform strategies that can bridge the gap between evidence base and clinical practice. My long-term goal is to mitigate the com- plications of critical illness with clinical trials using precision-based methods to identify at-risk and yet apt-to- benefit populations paired with implementation science methodologies to illuminate how to bring these interven- tions to the bedside. To accomplish this, I have assembled an exceptional interdisciplinary team of mentors (Drs. Vineet Arora, Matthew Churpek, and John Kress) and advisors (Drs. Shyam Prabhakaran, Donald Hedeker, Laura Damschroder, and Matthias Eikermann) who have a track record of NIH-funding and successful mentor- ship of post-doctoral candidates. I intend to build on my foundation as an accomplished clinical trialist and have formulated an in-depth career development plan to gain expertise in machine learning methods to identify differ- ential treatment effects (Churpek and Prabhakaran), longitudinal data analysis, (Arora and Hedeker), and imple- mentation science methods (Arora, Prabhakaran, and Damschroder) to craft strategies that bring complex mul- tidisciplinary interventions from clinical trials (Kress and Eikermann) to everyday ICU care. Completion of this proposal will train me to fill an unmet need defined by a recent National Academy of Medicine publication which indicated that identification of differential treatment effects must be paired with rigorous implementation to help transition evidence base to routine clinical care. Equipped with advanced statistical skills and implementation science approaches, I will be able to design hybrid effectiveness-implementation trials to target and implement complex multidisciplinary interventions to vulnerable populations in future R01 level applications. PROJECT NARRATIVE Three-quarters of survivors of mechanical ventilation will develop persistent disability. Early mobilization engages patients in physical activity during mechanical ventilation to prevent disability, but has poor adoption into clinical practice.

"PROTECT: optima4BP 2.0: prediction of Optimal Treatment and Route to achieve and maintain BP Target Need. In the US, 40 million patients with hypertension (HTN) have their blood pressure (BP) uncontrolled. BP above clinical Target even for a few months increases the risk for stroke (35-40%), heart failure (HF) (up to 64%), myocardial infarction (MI) (15-25%). Physician-nurse-pharmacist resource-intensive demonstrations in achieving & maintaining BP Target have shown promising results, but their real-life deployment was found unsustainable long-term. As a result, a process-standardized and sustainable solution is acutely needed.  Solution. In response to this need, Optima Integrated Health developed optima4BP 1.0. It is a first-in-class artificial intelligence (AI) that simulates the process of clinical reasoning undertaken by the treating physician in optimizing the anti-HTN treatment towards BP Target. Just like the physician, optima4BP 1.0 cannot determine upfront the needed Optimal Treatment (OT) to achieve & maintain BP Target for 1-2 years. PROTECT [optima4BP 2.0: prediction of Optimal Treatment and route to achieve and maintain BP Target] proposes to establish upfront the personalized OT. The OT can then be used to select the shortest and safest treatment modification route needed to achieve & maintain BP Target. Phase II Goal. Build optima4BP 2.0.  Phase I. Phase I Prior Work demonstrated that k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN), an AI model, can predict with ≥ 80% confidence the correct anti-HTN treatment, when compared to physician decision.  Phase II. optima4BP 2.0 will predict the Optimal Treatment and route to achieve & maintain BP Target.  Optimal Treatment data-mining source. PROTECT will use the SPRINT (Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial, 2015) and ACCORD (Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes, 2010) clinical trial data. They represent the foundation of the most current anti-HTN treatment management national guidelines.  Aim 1. Build kNN. Hypothesis. kNN can predict the proximity (clinical relevance) of a patient to an Optimal Treatment (OT). Milestone. Achieve ≥ 90% accuracy of prediction to physician decision. Phase I Data Preparation protocol will be applied to the SPRINT & ACCORD data. Then, the kNN Ensemble Learning function will be built to select the Optimal Treatment with the highest demonstrated efficacy by comparing the choice from 3 computational approaches developed and tested during Phase I.  Aim 2. Build the Optimal Treatment Route (OTR). Hypothesis. Knowing the Current and Optimal Treatment (OT), an OTR can be built. Milestone. Safest Route: Achieve 100% exclusion of treatments that led to an adverse event in similar patient populations. Shortest Route: Achieve ≥30% reduction in number of treatment changes compared to physician route. The OTR will be built by comparing at each Step on the Route how similar each Candidate Treatment is to the OT through a computed similarity assessment.  optima4BP 2.0 aims to establish a process-standardized & sustainable solution with the goal of reducing the incidence of stroke, HF, MI and death resulting from uncontrolled hypertension. In the US, 40 million patients with hypertension have their blood pressure uncontrolled. We propose to build and test optima4BP 2.0 (Project Name: PROTECT) that will predict upfront the personalized optimal treatment and shortest treatment route required by a patient to achieve and maintain blood pressure target. Achieving and maintaining blood pressure target will reduce the incidence of adverse events [stroke (35-40%), heart failure (up to 64%), myocardial infarction (15-25%)] or death resulting from uncontrolled hypertension.",PROTECT: optima4BP 2.0: prediction of Optimal Treatment and Route to achieve and maintain BP Target,9901106,R44HL140624,"['Acute', 'Adverse drug event', 'Adverse event', 'Antihypertensive Agents', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Blood Pressure', 'California', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Confidential Information', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Drug Combinations', 'Enrollment', 'Euclidean Space', 'Exclusion', 'Foundations', 'Gender', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Heart failure', 'Hypertension', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Lipids', 'Logic', 'Medical center', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Names', 'Nature', 'Nurses', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacists', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Resources', 'Route', 'Safety', 'San Francisco', 'Seminal', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Stroke', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Visit', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'Women&apos', 's Role', 'Work', 'base', 'blood pressure intervention', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'clinical care', 'clinically relevant', 'commercial application', 'comparative efficacy', 'data mining', 'data quality', 'hypertension treatment', 'innovation', 'optimal treatments', 'patient population', 'prevent', 'processing speed', 'response', 'stroke incidence', 'stroke risk', 'success']",NHLBI,"OPTIMA INTEGRATED HEALTH, INC.",R44,2020,750249,-0.026613573527096028
"Improving Ethical Care for Patients who are Incapacitated with No Evident Advance Directives or Surrogates (INEADS) Most Americans do not have advance directives or appointed surrogates to guide their medical care in the event that they lose the capacity to make decisions for themselves. Healthcare teams are sometimes able to identify “default” surrogates, i.e., family or friends who can provide information about the patient's values, goals, preferences, and beliefs. However, a growing number of patients become decisionally incapacitated without any advance directives, appointed surrogates, or default surrogates, which leaves them vulnerable to receiving care that is unaligned with these tenets. Currently there is almost no data describing the prevalence of patients who are Incapacitated with No Evident Advance Directives or Surrogates (INEADS) or how clinical decisions are made for them. The proposed study will address this gap with two specific aims.  In Aim 1 we will determine (1a) what are the prevalence and characteristics of adults who are INEADS or at risk of becoming INEADS, and (1b) how clinical decisions are currently made for patients who are INEADS. For this aim we will retrospectively review electronic health records from an acute care database of ~40,000 hospitalizations and a home healthcare care database of ~89,000 community dwelling patients using a combination of structured data, natural language processing, and content analysis to answer the following questions: (i) What is the prevalence of patients who are currently INEADS and at risk of becoming INEADS in acute care and homecare settings; (ii) Who are the hospital and community personnel and policies involved, (iii) How do patient characteristics and diagnoses influence decisions, and (iv) What is the timeline for making decisions and how expeditiously are decisions reached?  In Aim 2 we will qualitatively explore the phenomenon of INEADS from clinical and patient perspectives. For this aim we will conduct: (1) focus groups with hospital- and community-based healthcare providers and hospital ethics boards, and (2) interviews with community-dwelling patients at risk of becoming INEADS. Sample questions to be explored include (i) What are the barriers and facilitators to formalizing and standardizing the clinical decision-making process for INEADS patients, and (ii) What are the barriers and facilitators to completing advance directives and designating surrogate decision makers among patients at risk of becoming INEADS?  The long-term goal of this project is to provide vulnerable INEADS patients with ethical care that is concordant with their goals and preferences. Knowledge gained from this pilot will inform (1) an intervention study to increase advance directive completion and surrogate designation among patients at risk of becoming INEADS, (2) the development, implementation, and evaluation of formalized decision-making processes for INEADS patients, and (3) the design, delivery, and testing of clinician education on best practices for caring for INEADS patients and patients at risk of becoming INEADS. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The majority of Americans do not have advance directives or healthcare proxies, and more adults are living independently without the support of family or friends. As a result, patients who lose the ability to make healthcare decisions for themselves may not have any voice in deciding what types of treatments they will receive. This study will investigate (1) how many patients in the hospital and community have no advance directives, surrogate decision makers, or ability to make decisions for themselves, and (2) how clinical teams make decisions for these patients.",Improving Ethical Care for Patients who are Incapacitated with No Evident Advance Directives or Surrogates (INEADS),10038963,R21NR019319,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Advance Directives', 'Advocate', 'American', 'Area', 'Belief', 'Bioethics', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Education', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ethics', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Family', 'Focus Groups', 'Friends', 'Geriatrics', 'Goals', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Home Care Services', 'Hospital Ethics', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Human Resources', 'Independent Living', 'Institutional Policy', 'Intervention Studies', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Care Team', 'National Institute of Nursing Research', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Palliative Care', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Preferences', 'Patients', 'Pilot Projects', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Proxy', 'Publishing', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Societies', 'Standardization', 'Statutes and Laws', 'Strategic Planning', 'Testing', 'TimeLine', 'Update', 'Voice', 'Work', 'acute care', 'base', 'care preference', 'clinical decision-making', 'cohort', 'court', 'design', 'end of life', 'end of life care', 'experience', 'family support', 'high risk', 'improved', 'patient population', 'preference', 'prevent', 'programs', 'social', 'structured data', 'surrogate decision maker']",NINR,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R21,2020,284481,-0.0029620096080916146
"Evaluating associations between trauma-related characteristics and functional recovery in individuals with spinal cord injury Project Summary World Health Organization established that every year, around the world, between 250,000 and 500,000 people suffer a spinal cord injury (SCI). While existing research suggests links between the injury event, early care, and rehabilitation outcomes, there still remains a critical knowledge gap – about how characteristics associated with trauma and acute phases of SCI can allow us to better understand functional recovery post- SCI. In the past, this research was partly hampered due to databases that either focused on trauma-care or inpatient rehabilitation. However, using advanced analytical methods, we are now in a position to combine databases that contain trauma and acute phase-related variables with patient-level characteristics to assess longitudinal functional recovery over time. Trauma and acute phase-related variables include type of trauma, cause of injury, process of care, clinical data, and outcome data during acute care. The overall objective of this study is to use trauma and acute phase-related variables to explain the longitudinal functional recovery of individuals with SCI, from acute to post-acute to community. This will be achieved by probabilistically linking the Pennsylvania Trauma Systems Outcomes Study (PTOS) database with the National Spinal Cord Injury Model Systems (SCIMS) database. The PTOS and SCIMS databases provide complimentary information about trauma and acute phases of SCI from acute hospital to inpatient rehabilitation facility (IRF) to community. The long-term goal of our research is to identify trauma and acute phase-related variables that can be utilized during acute care and post-acute rehabilitation interventions to improve clinical decision making, which in turn enhances rehabilitation programs.The central hypothesis of this proposal is that trauma and acute phase- related variables, combined with patient-level characteristics, will significantly predict longitudinal functional recovery in individuals post-SCI. Our hypothesis is guided by prior research and our pilot work with the PTOS database. A primary objective of this proposal is to examine the association between trauma and acute phase- related variables with functional improvements during IRF in individuals with traumatic SCI using machine learning ensemble methods (Aim 1). A secondary objective of this study is to develop longitudinal trajectories of functional recovery over a period of 1-year post-SCI taking into account trauma, acute phase, and patient- level characteristics during acute, post-acute, and community living using growth curve modelling (Aim 2).

"Integrate Dynamic System Model and Machine Learning for Calibration-Free Noninvasive ICP Project Summary  No clinical device exists for noninvasive intracranial pressure (nICP) assessment. Past attempts have focused on identifying ICP-related signals that are noninvasively measureable, but have done little to address the calibration problem. Without calibration, only ICP trending can be inferred at the best. However, noninvasive calibration is not trivial. A universal calibration will fail because individual patients require different calibration to obtain accurate results. On the other hand, the use of plain regression for individualized calibration is infeasible because ICP cannot be obtained noninvasively for a de novo patient to begin with.  Invasive ICP monitoring remains a standard of care and this can be leveraged to continuously grow a database of ICP, noninvasive signals, and different calibration equations, e.g., each built from a pair of invasive ICP and noninvasive signal in the database. Then nICP becomes feasible by selecting from a rich set of calibration equations the optimal choice for a de novo patient. In this project, we will pursue three aims that will lead to the development of an accurate noninvasive ICP system based on Transcranial Doppler. These aims are: 1) To implement and validate core algorithms needed for achieving accurate nICP; 2) To test if estimated nICP is sensitive to variations in ultrasound probe placement; 3) To test the generalizability of the proposed nICP approach.  Large epidemiologic surveys reveal that ICP is monitored in only about 58% of US patients when ICP monitoring is indicated. It is a smaller percentage (37%) in European patients and even fewer in developing countries. The proposed nICP approach does not have the high risks associated with invasive ICP, requires no onsite neurosurgical expertise, and can be economically deployed and readily practiced. Therefore, its potential impact is enormous. Project Narrative  No clinically accepted device exists for noninvasive intracranial pressure (ICP) assessment.

"In Vivo Knee Motion and ACL Biomechanics During Dynamic Activities Abstract: Radiographic evidence of OA is present in more than 50% of patients 10 years after ACL reconstruction. However, the etiology of early onset OA after ACL reconstruction is not well understood. While previous work has demonstrated changes in joint motion following reconstruction, it is unclear how these altered motions relate to changes in the local mechanical response of cartilage to in vivo loading. This information may be critical to understanding the onset of OA, as the mechanical response of cartilage affects cartilage homeostasis. In line with this mechanism, our pilot data indicates that regions of high cartilage strain measured in patients with ACL injury and reconstruction are susceptible to decreased cartilage thickness, a characteristic feature of OA. Importantly, these degenerative changes are observed as early as 18 months post-reconstruction. Therefore, in this proposal our overall hypothesis is that site-specific changes in the mechanical response of cartilage to loading following ACL injury and reconstruction are predictive of long-term cartilage degeneration. Specifically, we hypothesize that in regions of cartilage experiencing elevated strain during loading, early degeneration will be reflected by altered composition and decreased cartilage thickness. Thus, we will measure localized cartilage strain, composition, and thickness at four time-points: after ACL injury but prior to reconstruction, as well as at 3 months, 1 year, and 2 years after surgery. At each time point, a combination of high-speed biplanar radiography and MR imaging will be used to measure local cartilage strains during in vivo loading. To assess cartilage degeneration, we will use MRI to measure site-specific changes in composition (using T1rho and T2 relaxation times) and cartilage thickness. Additionally, our analyses will account for relevant biological variables such as age, sex, and BMI, and clinical factors such as graft placement characteristics and meniscus injuries. In addition to mechanical factors, biological factors such as joint inflammation and lubrication may also play a role in cartilage degeneration after ACL reconstruction. Therefore, synovial fluid and serum will be collected to measure inflammatory mediators and metabolic biomarkers. Using this data, we will develop a predictive model of cartilage degeneration after ACL reconstruction that utilizes both mechanical and biological factors, as well as other demographic and clinical characteristics, to predict declines in cartilage health. Furthermore, this comprehensive dataset will be used to develop clinical phenotypes to identify those at high risk for cartilage degradation after ACL reconstruction. Importantly, the development of these phenotypes will enable targeted treatment approaches focusing on surgical procedures, pharmaceutical targets, and non- pharmacological interventions such as physical therapy or weight loss in preventing cartilage degeneration. Therefore, our findings will both elucidate the role of alterations in the local mechanical response of cartilage on degeneration after ACL reconstruction and improve the identification and treatment of patients at high risk for cartilage degeneration. Project Narrative Early onset osteoarthritis (OA) is a major concern after ACL reconstruction. This project will develop a predictive model of cartilage degeneration after ACL reconstruction using a novel combination of mechanical factors, biological factors, demographics, and clinical characteristics.

"Maternal Antecedents and Electronic Fetal Monitoring in Term Asphyxia (MAESTRA) Neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) is a neurologic syndrome that results from reduced flow of oxygenated blood to the fetal or newborn brain. HIE occurs in 1-3 per 1,000 term births and may cause death or neurologic disabilities such as cerebral palsy. Electronic fetal monitoring (EFM) was developed in the 1970's to assess the adequacy of fetal oxygenation as a strategy to prevent HIE, and is now standard of care. Yet clinical trials report that EFM usage has not reduced the rate of CP, perinatal death or HIE, but is associated with a dramatic increase in cesarean deliveries. The currently used 3 Category fetal heart rate (FHR) classification system, based on simple rules designed to be easy to apply at the bedside, has some utility in predicting HIE. However, Category II FHR patterns that make up the vast majority of tracings are poorly predictive of HIE and confer “indeterminate” risk. Category III patterns are also of limited use in predicting HIE due to low sensitivity. There is an urgent need to develop better objective methods to assess EFM that would identify more fetuses at risk of HIE in time for corrective actions. Uterine tachysystole, or excessive frequency of uterine contractions, has been implicated as a preventable cause of HIE; yet studies report conflicting results. EFM research has been limited by an inability to access and manually analyze the large datasets needed to study HIE. We now have the ability to analyze digital EFM signals using automated methods to measure standard FHR patterns as well as to discover novel aspects of the tracing that may not be readily detectable by a clinician at the bedside. We hypothesize that modern signal processing and machine learning techniques can create highly predictive models of HIE by analyzing established and novel features of EFM tracings, in combination with demographic and pertinent clinical information from the mother and fetus. We propose a population-based retrospective cohort study of 350,000 infants born at ≥ 36 weeks gestation at Kaiser Permanente Northern California in 2010-19. Our specific aims are: 1) To create the MAESTRA Cohort dataset that links EFM recordings to HIE and neonatal acidosis among 350,000 infants born at ≥ 36 weeks gestation in 2010-19 at Kaiser Permanente Northern CA; 2) Using modern signal processing and machine learning techniques, to extract established and novel FHR and uterine contractility features from the EFM recordings, and to determine which of these features are most predictive of HIE and acidosis when combined with maternal and fetal clinical data; and 3) To perform external validation by applying the final predictive models to a historical dataset. We anticipate that machine learning techniques incorporating novel FHR and uterine contractility patterns over time, as well as pre- and perinatal clinical characteristics, will improve the predictive value of the EFM data that are already being collected as part of routine care. Our results will inform future clinical trials. Such an unprecedented large-scale multidisciplinary study will lead to improvements in our ability to use EFM data to prevent neonatal brain injury while minimizing unnecessary cesarean sections. MAESTRA Project Narrative Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) occurs when a baby gets reduced oxygen and blood flow to the brain, and can lead to death or long-term disabilities such as cerebral palsy. During labor and delivery, doctors are able to continuously record the heart rate of the fetus.

"Enabling of a wireless and remotely monitored bi-ventricular pacing device through the internet of medical things for heart failure patients Project Summary The objective of this project is to demonstrate feasibility of a novel platform technology using ultrasonic waves for wireless bidirectional real-time communication and powering of a cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) biventricular pacemaker with integrated ventricular pressure sensors. Heart failure (HF) has become a challenge of epidemic proportions to the healthcare system in the United States with poor prognosis for patients and elevated healthcare costs. Cardiac resynchronization therapy and home monitoring of vascular pressure through implantable wireless devices have shown to improve patient outcomes and reduce hospitalization of heart failure patients. None of the current solutions connect CRT treatment to remote monitoring due to limitations of wireless interconnected devices within the body. Bionet’s software-defined UsWB proprietary technology is capable of transmitting energy and data via ultrasonic waves through tissue, bone, and fluids at penetration depths significantly higher than radio frequency (RF) waves and with greater reliability. The Bionet platform includes: i) 2 Reprogrammable wireless pacing nodes coupled to MEMS pressure sensors; ii) Rechargeable system controller to coordinate with, recharge, and reprogram other implantable elements of the network through the ultrasonic interface; iii) External recharging and communication patch to act as a power/data gateway to interconnect the intra-body network with the Internet. An intelligent CRT device that can be remotely monitored by clinicians in order to optimize therapy using continuous real-time data will lead to improved HF treatment options and informed treatment decisions individualized for each patient (point-of-care). In this Phase I study, feasibility for wireless power and remote monitoring with the Bionet system will be demonstrated by completing the following Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1. Demonstrate in vitro feasibility of controlled pacing, recharging, and pressure sensing elements using ultrasounds at typical implantable tissue depths. Specific Aim 2. Demonstrate in vivo data and energy transmission for the system, allowing for controlled cardiac pacing using real time blood pressure data. In vivo experiments in porcine models (n=4) will be used to demonstrate the ability of the system to transmit data and energy from the subcutaneous controller to the pacing nodes and acquire real time intraventricular pressure data. This proposal leverages the strengths of Bionet and the Cardiovascular Innovation Institute. Our long-term goal is to successfully translate the Bionet’s system into clinical practice. The core platform technology may also be applied to other networked systems for the treatment of diverse etiologies opening a new frontier in multimodal patient treatment and use of Artificial Intelligence for patient care. Project Narrative Through this proposal a wireless remotely monitored bi-ventricular pacing devices will be developed using new core technology for the internet of medical things. Ultrasound wideband technology will be used to allow communication between the different implantable elements and recharge those same elements allowing for miniaturization. This technology will not only improve patient outcomes and healthcare economics of the heart failure patient population, but may also enable other innovative therapies in other populations.",Enabling of a wireless and remotely monitored bi-ventricular pacing device through the internet of medical things for heart failure patients,10007981,R43HL149451,"['Acute', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Award', 'Blood', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cadaver', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnostic', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Epidemic', 'Etiology', 'Failure', 'Family', 'Family suidae', 'Freezing', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart', 'Heart failure', 'Home environment', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Implant', 'In Vitro', 'Incidence', 'Industry', 'Innovative Therapy', 'Institutes', 'Intelligence', 'Internet', 'Intrabody', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Legal patent', 'Limb Prosthesis', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Medical', 'Medical Device', 'Miniaturization', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Monitor', 'Myocardium', 'Pacemakers', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Penetration', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiologic intraventricular pressure', 'Population', 'Preclinical Testing', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Quality of life', 'Stomach', 'System', 'Systolic heart failure', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Treatment Failure', 'Tremor', 'Tricuspid Valve Insufficiency', 'Ultrasonic wave', 'Ultrasonics', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Ventricular', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'bone', 'cardiac pacing', 'cardiac resynchronization therapy', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'data exchange', 'design', 'experimental study', 'frontier', 'health care economics', 'hospitalization rates', 'implantable device', 'improved', 'in vitro Model', 'in vitro testing', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'multimodality', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'patient population', 'personalized decision', 'phase 1 study', 'phase 2 study', 'point of care', 'pre-clinical', 'pressure', 'pressure sensor', 'product development', 'radio frequency', 'software development', 'sonar', 'subcutaneous', 'transmission process', 'treatment optimization', 'verification and validation']",NHLBI,BIONET SONAR,R43,2020,444327,0.01225281896344208
"Charting a New Course for Heart Failure: From Discovery to Data ABSTRACT Support is requested for a Keystone Symposia conference entitled Charting a New Course for Heart Failure: From Discovery to Data, organized by Drs. Mansoor Husain, Benoit G. Bruneau and Marc Pfeffer. The conference will be held in Keystone, Colorado from March 1-5, 2020. Heart failure is global health problem of increasing prevalence, high morbidity, and refractory mortality, for which there have been relatively few impactful therapeutic advances. This unique multidisciplinary conference will bring together leading clinicians and scientists to share the latest insights on genetic, environmental, iatrogenic and pathophysiological mechanisms of heart failure. The program includes specific sessions and workshops focused on advances in cardiac fibrosis, immunology, metabolism, regenerative medicine, biomedical engineering, and analytical approaches to large datasets of relevance to this disease. Although the program is diverse, each session will address a scientific frontier in heart failure biology of potential therapeutic relevance and will be framed to address an unanswered, important clinical question. This innovative format is purposefully planned to highlight translational opportunities in heart failure and to provide a forum that encourages dialogue between cardiovascular researchers and trainees with distinct perspectives, but who share a common goal of making an impact in heart failure. This conference will be paired with “New Insights into the Biology of Exercise.” These two Keystone Symposia conferences will share a joint session examining exercise physiology and how it affects cardiac energetics and hypertrophy, which will be of interest to audiences attending either conference. PROJECT NARRATIVE Heart failure is global health problem of increasing prevalence, high morbidity, and refractory mortality, for which there have been relatively few impactful therapeutic advances. However, the larger question of heart failure disease and its underlying mechanisms has resulted in a lack of effective therapies for a patient population which is increasing in size, age and clinical complexity.

"APPLYING ERROR-CORRECTED SEQUENCING TO DETECT MINIMAL RESIDUAL IN THE AAML 1031 STUDY Abstract  Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) accounts for half of all pediatric leukemia deaths and is the leading cause of leukemia-related death in adulthood. One reason for worse outcomes is the inability to properly assess for minimal residual disease (MRD) following therapy. Unlike ALL, AML presents with multiple subclonal populations without a singular clonal surface marker, and surface markers can change during therapy. The current gold standard for AML MRD is multi-parameter flow cytometry (MPFC), which is predictive of outcomes to frequencies of 0.001, yet 30% of MPFC-MRD-negative patients still relapse. Alternatively, every AML case harbors leukemia-specific mutations that could be markers of disease, except that next-generation sequencing has high error rate of ~1%. In this proposal, we will implement a novel, validated error-corrected sequencing (ECS) strategy, developed by the Druley lab in collaboration with Illumina, to improve MRD assessment of AML subclonal heterogeneity in 990 pediatric de novo AML cases from the Children's Oncology Group AAML1031 study. We hypothesize that using a highly sensitive sequencing method will improve identification of residual AML, provide important insights on subclonal heterogeneity in pediatric AML, improve understanding of the role of germline variability and gene function on relapses or refractory disease and facilitate personalized medicine. To interrogate this hypothesis, we propose the following aims: 1. Define subclonal heterogeneity at diagnosis and end of Induction 1 (EOI1) in 990 pediatric de novo  AML patients (n=1890). By using the largest prospective study of pediatric AML that has ever been  performed, we will perform ECS on 94 genes that are the most frequently mutated genes in pediatric and  adult AML at diagnosis and EOI1 to identify patterns of mutation associated with relapsed disease, FAB  subtypes or other cytogenetic features. 2. Correlate ECS-MRD with existing EOI1 MPFC-MRD for all participants in the COG AAML1031 study.  A major question is whether the “different from normal” cell population identified as residual disease by  MPFC is actually the same population(s) identified by ECS. We will define residual disease by ECS and  compare results to MPFC status (positive/negative), actual MPFC percentages (<0.001) and the clinical  outcomes (relapse risk, disease-free survival and overall survival) of study participants. 3. Integrate germline variation and all subclonal mutations into mechanistic groups that are frequently  mutated in pediatric AML and correlate with outcomes using unbiased machine learning  algorithms. Preliminary data tells us that every patient will have multiple subclones at diagnosis and EOI1  as well as germline variants in AML-associated genes, which may be important for outcome. In this aim, we  will take these mutations into account as well as MPFC, clinical features and cytogenetics for probabilistic  risk assessment using unsupervised machine learning algorithms for improved outcome prognostication. Narrative We have developed Error-Corrected Sequencing (ECS) that enables the highly accurate detection of leukemia- specific mutations in heterogeneous DNA samples to a limit of 0.0001. We will perform ECS with a panel of 94 frequently mutated genes in adult and pediatric AML in matched diagnostic and end of Induction 1 bone marrow samples from 990 pediatric de novo AML patients enrolled on the Children's Oncology Group AAML1031 protocol, which is the largest pediatric AML trial ever performed in North America. With these data, we can truly understand subclonal heterogeneity in pediatric AML, significantly improve minimal residual disease testing in pediatric AML, and integrate these data into an unbiased multivariate probability platform taking into account individual sequencing, flow cytometry, cytogenetic and clinical features to provide truly personalized cancer care.",APPLYING ERROR-CORRECTED SEQUENCING TO DETECT MINIMAL RESIDUAL IN THE AAML 1031 STUDY,9844413,R01CA211711,"['Acute Myelocytic Leukemia', 'Adult', 'Adult Acute Myeloblastic Leukemia', 'Alleles', 'BAY 54-9085', 'Biological Markers', 'Bone Marrow', 'Bortezomib', 'Categories', 'Cessation of life', 'Childhood', 'Childhood Acute Myeloid Leukemia', 'Childhood Leukemia', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Cytogenetics', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Enrollment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Exons', 'FLT3 gene', 'Family', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hematology', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Normal Cell', 'North America', 'Oncogenes', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pediatric Oncology Group', 'Phase', 'Point Mutation', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protein Tyrosine Kinase', 'Protein phosphatase', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reagent', 'Recurrent disease', 'Refractory Disease', 'Relapse', 'Residual Neoplasm', 'Residual Tumors', 'Residual state', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk stratification', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Spliceosomes', 'Surface', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'analytical method', 'base', 'chemotherapy', 'cohesion', 'design', 'digital', 'falls', 'functional group', 'gene function', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'insight', 'leukemia', 'leukemia treatment', 'machine learning algorithm', 'next generation', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'nucleocytoplasmic transport', 'outcome prediction', 'pediatric patients', 'personalized cancer care', 'personalized medicine', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'randomized trial', 'relapse risk', 'response', 'specific biomarkers', 'subclonal heterogeneity', 'transcription factor', 'unsupervised learning']",NCI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,352587,-0.007027276349782184
"Southern California Clinical Center of the Type 1 Diabetes in Acute Pancreatitis Consortium This application describes a robust Southern California-based Clinical Center for participation in the Type 1 Diabetes in Acute Pancreatitis Consortium (T1DAPC). Proposed protocols address the metabolic mechanisms and the genetic, protein, and imaging signature of patients with acute pancreatitis (AP) and recurrent acute pancreatitis (RAP) who are at high risk for future development of diabetes. AP is the most common cause of pancreatogenic diabetes. While meta-analyses have revealed an incidence rate of 23% for diabetes arising after AP, they have not shed light on the type of diabetes that develops, which may comprise autoimmune or idiopathic type 1 diabetes (T1DM), type 2 diabetes (T2DM), or a unique diabetes pathobiology. A detailed understanding of diabetes developing after AP will yield great benefit by facilitating novel approaches to predict, prevent, and treat this form of diabetes. The following aims are proposed to address these goals:  Specific Aim 1. Recruit a cohort of non-diabetic patients with a recent episode of AP or RAP and prospectively characterize their islet autoimmunity and glucose/insulin homeostasis using the frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test and mixed meal tolerance tests performed 1 month after hospital discharge, and at 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months, and yearly thereafter. The goals of this aim are to (a) determine the incidence of diabetes after AP, (b) identify the types of diabetes that develop after AP, (c) identify early metabolic trajectories associated with post-AP diabetes, (d) assemble the cohort that will be the platform for Aims 2-4.  Specific Aim 2. Evaluate genetic and protein risk factors for diabetes in patients with AP or RAP. This Aim will evaluate association of genetic risk scores for T1DM and T2DM with post AP diabetes. Thirteen candidate proteins, associated with post AP diabetes in preliminary studies, will be assessed for association with incident diabetes after AP, yielding a key set of proteins with utility not only in diabetes prediction but also targets for future preventive or therapeutic measures.  Specific Aim 3. Characterize the imaging phenotype that predicts development of diabetes after AP or RAP. Retrospective CT scans obtained during hospitalization for AP as well as CT and novel multiparametric MRI scans obtained 1 and 12 months afterward will undergo artificial intelligence analysis to identify the imaging biomarkers that signal diabetes risk.  Specific Aim 4. Develop a multi-factorial model to predict development of diabetes after AP or RAP. A wealth of data will be collected from Aims 1-3, which will be combined with clinical factors to build and validate (in independent datasets) an integrative predictive model of post AP diabetes. The goal is to create a model that can be used in clinical settings to identify those at highest risk, facilitating targeted measures to prevent diabetes.  This innovative research will be conducted by an experienced team of investigators in endocrinology, gastroenterology, imaging, physiology, and epidemiology to solve a problem of great public health significance. This is an application for the establishment of a Southern California Clinical Center to participate in the Type 1 Diabetes in Acute Pancreatitis Consortium, comprised of an expert team to carry out studies of the Consortium in Los Angeles County, the most populous and ethnically diverse county in the United States. Acute pancreatitis, one of the most frequent causes of hospitalization in the USA, greatly increases the risk of future development of diabetes, yet the type of diabetes is unclear. We propose studies to determine the metabolic mechanisms and the genetic, protein, and imaging signature of diabetes occurring after pancreatitis, which will provide the means to understand, prevent, and treat this form of diabetes.",Southern California Clinical Center of the Type 1 Diabetes in Acute Pancreatitis Consortium,10128180,U01DK127403,"['Address', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Autoantibodies', 'Autoimmune Process', 'Autoimmunity', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood', 'California', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Endocrinology', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Fasting', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Gastroenterology', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genotype', 'Glucose', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Homeostasis', 'Hormonal', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Insulin', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Intake', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Liquid substance', 'Los Angeles', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Necrosis', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Pancreas', 'Pancreatitis', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Preventive', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Set protein', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Swelling', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'United States', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'acute pancreatitis', 'base', 'chronic pancreatitis', 'clinical center', 'cohort', 'design', 'diabetes risk', 'ethnic diversity', 'experience', 'genetic association', 'genetic profiling', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'high risk', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insulin secretion', 'intravenous glucose tolerance test', 'islet', 'non-diabetic', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'pancreas imaging', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'response', 'type I and type II diabetes']",NIDDK,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,U01,2020,324613,-2.7100040190313864e-05
"Collaborative Platform for Developing Sepsis Products by Leveraging Sepsis Endotypes Developed Using a Unified Biomarker-Clinical Dataset Principal Investigator/Program Director (Last, first, middle): Reddy, Jr., Bobby Project Summary: Sepsis is a poorly understood clinical syndrome characterized by a dysregulation of the immune system’s response to infection. It is the leading cause of death and is the most expensive condition treated in U.S. hospitals, exerting a $20.3 billion burden in 2011, 5.2% of total costs to the healthcare system nationwide. One of the major challenges facing clinicians is to identify and recognize patients with sepsis and impending organ dysfunction. The clinical manifestations of sepsis are highly variable and the signs of infection and organ dysfunction can be subtle and may mimic other conditions. Sepsis is also highly time critical. Every 1-hour delay in antibiotics after emergency department (ED) triage or the onset of organ dysfunction or shock is associated with a 3–7% increase in the odds of a poor outcome. These conditions have created an environment where physicians have to diagnose a complex, heterogeneous condition in a short timeframe with limited information. There is currently a dire need for a tool that can quickly assess if a patient is at risk for sepsis. Prenosis is a company focused on elucidating the complexity of dysregulated host response to infection. In partnership with 4 hospitals, we have built the world’s largest and most rapidly growing dataset & data-rich biobank that combine time series biomarker data with clinical data for patients suspected of infection in hospital environments. This dataset & biobank currently have >2,000 patients, >70,000 proprietary biomarker measurements, >1,200,000 Electronic Medical Record (EMR) parameters, and >25,000 samples banked (all with accompanying full time series EMR data). We currently have executed contracts for 6 total hospital partnerships, with the potential to expand the dataset by >65,000 patients per year if our pipeline were at full capacity. In this proposed project, Prenosis will finalize the first version of the NOSISTM platform by growing our current proprietary dataset & biobank from its current size of about 2,000 patients to over 10,000 total patients (Aim 1). Using the current 2,000 patient dataset, we have demonstrated initial promising endotypes of sepsis that could be useful for a variety of critical clinical problems. As we grow the dataset to 10,000 patients, we will use unsupervised machine learning algorithms trained on roughly half of the patients (5,000) to definitively prove the robustness and usefulness of these endotypes. The other half of the patients (other 5,000) will be used as a multi-site validation cohort for the endotypes determined by the ML algorithms (Aim 2). We will also finalize the actual software platform for the NOSISTM product (Aim 3), including data security, restricted access by collaborators to train and jointly develop products, and templates for business partnerships with potential collaborators (with an initial focus on HIT companies and pharma companies). Principal Investigator/Program Director (Last, first, middle): Reddy, Jr., Bobby Project Narrative: At least 30 percent of antibiotics prescribed in the United States are unnecessary. This has obviously catastrophic implications for the future of humanity. Sepsis is the third leading cause of death in the United States with an annual toll of over 230,000 people. Survival rates have been reported to drop by 7.6% per hour appropriate treatment is delayed. This drastic drop in survival rate leads to vast over prescription of antibiotics in hospital settings. Prenosis is a company focused on elucidating the complexity of dysregulated host response to infection. In partnership with 4 hospitals, we have built the world’s largest and most rapidly growing dataset & data-rich biobank that combine time series biomarker data with clinical data for patients suspected of infection in hospital environments.

We currently have executed contracts for 6 total hospital partnerships, with the potential to expand the dataset by >65,000 patients per year if our pipeline were at full capacity. In this project, we are proposing work to finalize our NOSISTM product. NOSISTM is a software platform that allows collaborators (hospital IT departments, researchers, health information technology (HIT) companies, drug companies, and government agencies) to utilize the constantly growing proprietary Prenosis dataset & accompanying data-rich biobank. Using NOSISTM, collaborators can develop new sepsis screening technologies and clinical decision support tools, dramatically increase success of clinical drug trials, and revolutionize our scientific understanding of the endotypes of dysregulation of host response.",Collaborative Platform for Developing Sepsis Products by Leveraging Sepsis Endotypes Developed Using a Unified Biomarker-Clinical Dataset,10082229,R44GM139529,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Algorithms', 'Antibiotics', 'Award', 'Back', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood specimen', 'Businesses', 'Cause of Death', 'Charge', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Contracts', 'Data', 'Data Security', 'Data Set', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Derivation procedure', 'Diagnosis', 'Drops', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Excision', 'Fees', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Government Agencies', 'Health', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Infection', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Principal Investigator', 'Proteins', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Secure', 'Security', 'Security Measures', 'Sepsis', 'Series', 'Shock', 'Site', 'Survival Rate', 'Syndrome', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Triage', 'United States', 'University Hospitals', 'Validation', 'Work', 'algorithm training', 'base', 'biobank', 'clinical decision support', 'cohort', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'data de-identification', 'data hosting', 'encryption', 'health information technology', 'machine learning algorithm', 'payment', 'prevent', 'programs', 'response', 'sample collection', 'screening', 'specific biomarkers', 'success', 'support tools', 'tool', 'unsupervised learning']",NIGMS,"PRENOSIS, INC.",R44,2020,989523,-0.010244583296931774
"Virtual growing child 5-dimensional functional models for treating respiratory anomalies Thoracic Insufficiency Syndrome (TIS) is a group of serious disorders of the pediatric thorax resulting in an inability of the thorax to support respiration or lung growth. TIS is associated with at least 28 pediatric syndromes, with an estimated health care cost per patient that can easily exceed a million dollars. In TIS, three-dimensional deformity of the thoracic components anatomically and functionally reduces the volume available for ventilation. Pediatric specialists dealing with TIS currently face several serious challenges: (a) The complex interplay among dynamic and growing thoracic structures and its influence on thoracic function and growth are not understood at present. (b) The prime outcome measure for the corrective procedures has remained the radiographic Cobb angle of the spine, a 60-year old metric with poor correlation with lung dynamic function and limited true health assessment value. (c) A normative imaging database with functional metrics describing dynamics and growth of the thoracic structures of the normal pediatric population does not exist. Due to these hurdles, innovations in growth-modulating surgical techniques are difficult to achieve. Supported by extensive preliminary results based on dynamic MRI (dMRI) of patients and normal subjects, the overarching goal of this proposal is to develop novel dynamic functional metrics for TIS by establishing a normative database of dMRI images and anatomic and functional models and metrics, and to translate these to develop markers of TIS and of its corrective-surgery outcomes. The project has three aims. Aim 1: To develop a new methodology called The Virtual Growing Child (VGC) consisting of 4 key components: a) To build a normative database of dMRI images prospectively gathered from 200 normal children divided into 10 groups. b) To build population anatomic models involving key thoraco-abdominal objects following an established automatic anatomy recognition (AAR) technology and deep learning (DL) techniques. c) To develop and validate joint AAR-DL algorithms to segment these objects in dMRI images of TIS patients. d) To build a normative database of measurements derived from dMRI images describing normal thoracic architecture, dynamic function, and growth. The database will also include a full battery of Pulmonary Function Testing data and anthropometric measurements. Aim 2: To test retrospectively the utility of the VGC ensemble in deriving markers of TIS and its surgical treatment effects on a cohort of 100 TIS patients. Aim 3: To retrospectively test the utility of the VGC approach for planning surgery in 30 TIS patients by comparing VGC-guided surgical planning to the current planning method. The post-operative key dMRI parameters of patients whose surgical plan would have changed due to VGC data will be compared to those of patients whose plan did not change. Expected outcomes: (i) A unique registry of thoracic dMRI of 200 normal pediatric subjects, segmented objects, and the associated anatomic, dynamic, and developmental parameters. (ii) A validated VGC approach for studying TIS which can also be utilized for studying other pediatric and adult thoracic disorders. Thoracic Insufficiency Syndrome (TIS) is a group of serious disorders of the pediatric thorax. Currently there are no reliable and scientific functional metrics to describe these disorders and their treatment effects. This grant application proposes to build an innovative methodology called the Virtual Growing Child (VGC) based on dynamic MRI of the thorax, construct a comprehensive normative database of MRI images and associated measurements, and utilize the VGC methodology to scientifically characterize TIS and arrive at innovative surgical planning methods.",Virtual growing child 5-dimensional functional models for treating respiratory anomalies,9861454,R01HL150147,"['3-Dimensional', 'Abdomen', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Aftercare', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomic Models', 'Anatomy', 'Applications Grants', 'Architecture', 'Birth', 'Chest', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Deformity', 'Development', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Face', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health Care Costs', 'Image', 'Incidence', 'Joints', 'Life', 'Lung', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Names', 'Normalcy', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Orthopedic Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Population Group', 'Postoperative Period', 'Procedures', 'Pulmonary function tests', 'Registries', 'Respiration', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Rod', 'Scanning', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specialist', 'Spinal', 'Spinal Fusion', 'Spirometry', 'Structure', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thoracic Diseases', 'Tidal Volume', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Vertebral column', 'Vital capacity', 'age group', 'base', 'cohort', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'health assessment', 'innovation', 'novel', 'prospective', 'pulmonary function', 'respiratory', 'surgery outcome', 'treatment effect', 'ventilation', 'virtual']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2020,799509,-0.005443124014604343
"Clinical, Radiologic and Biochemical Factors Related to Diabetes Development after Acute Pancreatitis Abstract Nearly 40% of patients develop diabetes after an initial episode of acute pancreatitis (AP). Various studies have evaluated risk factors for the development of diabetes but they have shown inconsistent findings, suggesting methodologic shortcomings. The present proposal consists of three specific aims where we will attempt to determine the biochemical, radiologic and clinical factors related to the development of diabetes after AP. Aim 1: To identify autoantibodies associated with the progression of type 1 diabetes in patients after AP using a large human proteome array. Aim 2: To study the role of imaging, more specifically quantitative textural analysis to predict the development of type 1 diabetes after AP. Aim 3 is to build a machine learning model to predict type 1 diabetes after AP using patient-related risk factors, textural analysis on imaging and autoantibodies involved in disease progression. Our proposal will help us better understand diabetes after AP. Successful completion of this study has the potential to improve management for AP. Project Narrative Relevance to Public Health Statement Acute pancreatitis is increasing in incidence and can lead to diabetes in some patients. Diabetes is a morbid disease. We plan to study both established and novel risk factors for developing diabetes in patients with acute pancreatitis.","Clinical, Radiologic and Biochemical Factors Related to Diabetes Development after Acute Pancreatitis",10128083,U01DK127400,"['Acute', 'Acute Necrotizing Pancreatitis', 'Address', 'Antibodies', 'Autoantibodies', 'Autoantigens', 'Autoimmune Diabetes', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmune Responses', 'Autologous Transplantation', 'Beta Cell', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy Specimen', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical/Radiologic', 'Collection', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetes autoantibodies', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Glucagon', 'Goals', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Hypoglycemia', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'Insulin', 'Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediating', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Organ', 'Organ failure', 'Pancreas', 'Pancreatic Diseases', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Prediabetes syndrome', 'Process', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recovery', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Serological', 'Serum', 'Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Total Pancreatectomy', 'Visceral', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'acute pancreatitis', 'base', 'biomarker identification', 'clinical center', 'clinical risk', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'impaired glucose tolerance', 'improved', 'islet', 'macrovascular disease', 'model development', 'mortality', 'novel', 'nutrient absorption', 'predictive modeling', 'radiological imaging', 'radiomics', 'subcutaneous', 'systematic review']",NIDDK,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,U01,2020,286563,-0.006759710699300182
"Building a Platform for Precision Anesthesia for the Geriatric Surgical Patient PROJECT SUMMARY Perioperative neurocognitive disorders (PNCD) affect about 25% of patients in the period following surgery, and can persist for months or years in 10% of geriatric surgical patients. The presence of acute cognitive disturbances post-surgery increases the risk of patients eventually developing dementias such as Alzheimer's disease. Poor cognitive outcomes lead to longer hospital stays, decreased quality of life, and increased morbidity and mortality. Unfortunately, about half of elderly individuals require a surgical procedure at some time in their remaining years, and no interventions exist to prevent PNCD because the etiology is unclear. One of the main challenges in identifying the factors leading to chronic cognitive impairment is the lack of routine, comprehensive cognitive testing in the surgical care plan. This shortcoming is in part due to the lack of mobile, easy-to-use cognitive testing platforms. To establish the perioperative biomarkers contributing to cognitive decline, we will (1) integrate routine, comprehensive cognitive testing pre- and post-surgery, and (2) build a database and an analysis platform to mine this multidimensional dataset. Together, this aims to yield accurate models to pre-identify patients at risk and create targeted therapeutic interventions. We propose to build the foundational infrastructure for a precision medicine approach in geriatric surgical patients. In the R21 phase, we will build a novel comprehensive database of demographic and risk factor questionnaire responses, banked blood specimens, intraoperative electroencephalography (EEG), and inclusive cognitive testing. These data will be collected throughout the patient interaction, from the preoperative appointment through a year following the surgical procedure and available to other research teams. We will incorporate cognitive testing and collect large-scale data in the geriatric surgical setting, establishing a new precedent for subsequent multidisciplinary studies. This structure will afford us the opportunity to accurately track cognitive decline towards chronic conditions, such as dementia. In the R33 phase, we will develop an analysis platform capable of mining this multidimensional dataset. This phase will include EEG analysis and deep immune profiling using mass cytometry. Layered on these analyses we will build innovative machine learning tools to identify features and interactions contributing to both acute and chronic PNCD pathology. Our novel machine learning tools use prior knowledge to refine feature selection, thus addressing a common challenge faced by clinical research studies (having many measurements in a limited patient population), and will thus be of broad interest to other clinical research projects. PROJECT NARRATIVE Perioperative neurocognitive disorders (PNCD) affect about a quarter of geriatric surgical patients and increases the risk that those patients will go on to develop dementias such as Alzheimer's disease. However, no interventions exist to prevent PNCD, mostly because the etiology is unclear.

"A precision medicine framework to improve long-term outcomes in Sepsis Survivors PROJECT ABSTRACT Advances in acute care have decreased short-term mortality of sepsis, resulting in an increasing number of survivors who experience significant morbidity and mortality. Recurrent infections account for 60% of hospital readmissions after sepsis and are an important cause of long-term mortality. Identifying sepsis survivors at risk for infections and understanding predisposing factors are therefore important first steps to develop personalized interventions to improve long-term outcomes. The overall research goal is to develop innovative targeted interventions to improve long-term outcomes after sepsis. This proposal focuses on identifying subgroups of sepsis survivors (phenotypes) at high risk for infection-related hospital readmissions and deaths. It is hypothesized that the combination of host factors, disease characteristics, and interventions prior to and during sepsis will identify distinct phenotypes that are captured by clinical data. These clinical phenotypes likely have distinct pathophysiologic mechanisms (e.g., immunosuppression), predispose to different outcomes (e.g., recurrent infections), and patients with the same phenotype may respond similarly to targeted interventions such as immunomodulation. In Aim 1, three nationally representative datasets of sepsis survivors will be assembled and analyzed by machine learning techniques to identify valid clinical sepsis phenotypes. In Aim 2, phenotypes at high-risk for infection-related readmissions and deaths at 6 months will be identified, and underlying biomarker profiles for these phenotypes analyzed. In Aim 3, these high-risk phenotypes will be used to conceptualize and simulate an adaptive platform trial designed to test the efficacy of three different immunomodulatory drugs. An adaptive trial design was chosen, because it can test multiple interventions simultaneously and reduces the chances of exposing patients to ineffective or harmful interventions. The research plan is augmented by expert mentoring and rigorous didactic training. Together, this will provide the candidate with essential career development skills in the science of precision medicine, including machine learning methodologies, Bayesian statistics, and innovate clinical trial design. This proposal has potentially groundbreaking implications for the future treatment of sepsis survivors, because it deviates from the current “one-size fits all” approach and attempts to create the framework for personalized interventions. This framework sets the stage for future independent investigator (RO1) applications evaluating personalized treatments in adaptive clinical trials, and will uniquely position the candidate as a future leader in the field of long-term outcomes after critical illness. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project is important for public health because sepsis is a life-threatening infection that affects 30 million people worldwide each year. Long-term outcomes for patients who survive a hospital admission for sepsis are poor, and many patients develop new disabilities or worsening of preexisting health conditions. This proposal supports the NIH’s mission to enhance health and reduce illness and disability by trying to identify interventions for sepsis survivors at highest risk for poor outcomes.",A precision medicine framework to improve long-term outcomes in Sepsis Survivors,9897562,K23GM132688,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Asthma', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Biological Markers', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Complex', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Event', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor', 'HLA Antigens', 'Health', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Immunomodulators', 'Immunosuppression', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Integration Host Factors', 'Interleukin-7', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multicenter Studies', 'National Institute of General Medical Sciences', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Phenotype', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposing Factor', 'Probability', 'Public Health', 'Recombinants', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Science', 'Sepsis', 'Subgroup', 'Survivors', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Veterans', 'Whole Blood', 'Work', 'acute care', 'anti-PD-1', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical phenotype', 'cohort', 'design', 'disability', 'efficacy testing', 'experience', 'high risk', 'hospital readmission', 'immunomodulatory therapies', 'immunoregulation', 'improved', 'infection risk', 'innovation', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'mortality', 'novel', 'personalized approach', 'personalized intervention', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'programmed cell death ligand 1', 'recurrent infection', 'response', 'simulation', 'skill acquisition', 'trial design']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,K23,2020,187984,-0.01153947882092146
"Continuous Monitoring of COVID-19 Symptomatology for Elderly Patients in Long Term Care Facilities Using Advanced, Soft, and Flexible Sensors Mounted on the Suprasternal Notch PROJECT SUMMARY: COVID-19 is significantly more lethal in the elderly1 with the greatest risk in those cared for in long-term care facilities (LTCs) where mortality rates range from 19% to 72% worldwide. Monitoring COVID-19 infections in LTCs remains a particular challenging. The existing and a continued expected shortage of sufficient molecular COVID-19 testing coupled to false negative rates as high as 15% necessitates a critical need for new and complementary technologies that can surveil, alert, and track COVID-19 infections in this population. Our group are pioneers in the development of novel soft electronics. Our recent publication, supported by our active Phase I STTR, was published in Nature Biomedical Engineering detailing a next generation ultra-low profile, soft, and flexible sensor (ADAM) that continuously measures subtle acousto- mechanic signals generated by the body via an embedded high-frequency, 3-axis accelerometer in direct mechanical communication with the skin. The ADAM sensor communicates via Bluetooth with our custom mobile application for real time streaming as well as on sensor data storage enabling stand-alone operation. All data streams are cloud synchronized (HIPAA compliant). The highly novel soft, flexible nature allows for the ADAM sensor to be mountable on unusual locations of high information density. Specifically, we exploit the SN—the only location on the body where there is no dampening effect at the skin level with the intrathoracic cavity. This enables a SN- mounted ADAM sensor to capture heart rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR), temperature, physical activity (PA), swallow count, and talk time, along with additional novel respiratory biomarkers relevant to COVID-19. In this proposal, we propose to develop a new COVID-19 software package, machine learning enhancements to our cough algorithm, and validation in LTCs with both elderly patients and staff to evaluate usability, feasibility, and adherence. The high level of technology readiness with partner LTCs allows us to deploy efficiently to generate essential data for a future FDA Emergency Use Authorization. Our team of experts in engineering, dermatology, gerontology, and machine learning are highly qualified to develop this COVID-19 surveillance system that offers both commercial and clinical value with broad applicability to a wide range of other respiratory and chronic medical conditions after the pandemic subsides. PROJECT NARRATIVE COVID-19 is significantly more lethal in the elderly resident in long-term care facilities.

"Merging Temporal Changes in Clinical Informatics, Transcriptomics, and Cytokine Profiles to Understand the Host Response to Bacteremia As an ICU physician and an immunologist, I have devoted my research career to understanding sepsis,  a disease that affects nearly 2 million people annually in the USA. Sepsis is a life-threatening  condition that arises when the body's response to infection injures its own tissues. Great strides  have been made towards improving the clinical care of the septic patient, but the mortality rate  remains >20% for several reasons: First, each sepsis-causing pathogen, be it bacterial, viral, or  fungal, carries its own virulence factors that affect the host response, but unfortunately, much  research has focused on studying septic patients as a group, rather than distinguishing patients  based on microbiologic cause. Second, researchers often study patients once they manifest  sepsis-induced organ failure yet many people sustain infections due to common sepsis  pathogens, like Staphylococcus aureus, but never develop sepsis; understanding the ""appropriate""  response to a pathogen is critical to understanding the ""inappropriate"" response of  sepsis. Finally, much sepsis research occurs in silos; clinician researchers focus on the  electronic medical record, while basic scientists analyze biologic data. Too often, these  groups do not collaborate to share information, even though understanding the biologic  significance of clinical data may be of great value. To address these issues, I propose a unique  approach to understand the host response to infection that incorporates both biologic data and  clinical electronic medical record (EMR) data from patients with S. aureus bacteremia.  By limiting analysis of the host response to infections caused by a single pathogen at a single  site, we can control for the variability induced by pathogen-specific factors. In addition,  by studying all patients with S. aureus bacteremia, and not simply those patients with  sepsis, we can understand both the appropriate host response as well as the inappropriate host  response that characterizes the development of sepsis. With our bank of samples collected from S.  aureus bacteremia patients we will analyze both cellular mRNA transcripts and plasma  protein/cytokine levels, collected at different time points from each patient. We will  combine the results of these analyses with clinical data found in the EMR to provide a correlation  between the biology of the host response and its clinical manifestations. Our per-patient  data, then, will have unprecedented granularity which we can then use to apply machine learning  techniques to identify multi-faceted endotypes that predict outcomes (such as mortality). Once we  have built these endotype models, we will validate them using pilot data collected from newly  enrolled patients with either S. aureus or E. coli bacteremia. This approach will allow  us to identify factors common to the dysregulated host response across all infections, as well as  those that may be specific to the type of infection. Understanding both the  appropriate and the inappropriate host response to infection, and understanding which  aspects of the host response are pathogen-specific (and which are not) will allow development  of novel therapies for this devastating disease. The mortality rate due to severe sepsis exceeds 20%, yet in spite of 3 decades of research, we  still have a very limited understanding of the dysregulated host response that drives  this mortality. I will use my experience as a PhD-trained immunologist and ICU physician to  study the host response to the two most common causes of bacteremia in hospitalized patients, S.  aureus and E. coli. Understanding both appropriate and dysregulated host responses to infections as  manifested in both biological and clinical data will allow me to develop precision therapy to treat  this deadly disease.","Merging Temporal Changes in Clinical Informatics, Transcriptomics, and Cytokine Profiles to Understand the Host Response to Bacteremia",10022505,R03HL148295,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Allergic', 'Award', 'Bacteremia', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Consent', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Enrollment', 'Escherichia coli', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Goals', 'Hour', 'Immune', 'Immune Targeting', 'Immune response', 'Immunologist', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Leukocytes', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Messenger RNA', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Organ', 'Organ failure', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Plasma', 'Plasma Proteins', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Sepsis', 'Site', 'Staphylococcus aureus', 'Subgroup', 'Supportive care', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Validation', 'Viral', 'Virulence Factors', 'Work', 'base', 'biobank', 'career', 'clinical care', 'clinically significant', 'comorbidity', 'cytokine', 'experience', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'insight', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome prediction', 'pathogen', 'patient subsets', 'personalized therapeutic', 'prospective', 'response', 'septic', 'septic patients', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NHLBI,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R03,2020,79000,-0.0009888771972948415
"A Real-Time Computational System for Detecting ARDS Using Ventilator Waveform Data Project Summary:  Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a severe form of acute hypoxemic respiratory failure affecting 10% of patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) in the United States. In-hospital mortality of 35-46% has been reported across the spectrum of mild-severe ARDS, and one third of patients with initially mild ARDS will progress to moderate or severe ARDS. Over the last 20 years, multiple studies have reported improved outcomes for ARDS patients using specific ARDS targeted therapies. However, ARDS remains persistently under-recognized and challenging to diagnose. Only one third of ICU providers correctly identify ARDS on the first day when diagnostic criteria are met, and less than two thirds ever recognize the diagnosis in the ICU. This under recognition of ARDS may prevent some patients from receiving lifesaving therapies necessary for treating the disease. Attempts to automate ARDS diagnosis using rule- based algorithms have seen limited success, and require analysis of subjective data from patient histories, like chest scans, which limit diagnosis automation, timeliness, and study reproducibility.  To improve the current state of the art of ARDS detection technology, we intend to utilize objective and readily available data including both ventilator waveform data, (VWD) and electronic health record (EMR) data to 1) improve the recognition of ARDS, and 2) identify high-risk ARDS patients most likely to benefit from additional ARDS treatments. For this task, we will make use of an existing dataset of VWD from over 500 patients receiving mechanical ventilation, including 156 patients with confirmed ARDS. Our preliminary analyses using a machine learned model and a subset of lung physiology features derived solely from VWD, suggest that ARDS can be diagnosed in the absence of a chest scan or medical history. In Aim 1 of this proposal, we will improve our existing model used for discriminating ARDS by adding objective EMR data, and additional features extracted from VWD, such as patient respiratory compliance and airway resistance. Our next focus will be to predict worsening of ARDS severity in intubated patients based on Berlin criteria. So in Aim 2, we will evaluate the best tools for predicting increases in ARDS severity, and which types of temporal information yield the best predictive results.  We hypothesize that model development using additional objective data derived from VWD analysis and the EMR, along with advanced analytic techniques, will further improve ARDS diagnosis, and enable the prediction of clinical trajectories in patients with ARDS. The proposed work will yield innovative clinical decision support models that can be used to improve the state of the art in automated ARDS diagnosis. Our predictive modeling will also enable greater insight into the times when physicians can perform clinical interventions to arrest ARDS induced physiologic deterioration. Ultimately, these innovations could save lives by quickly detecting ARDS, and alerting physicians to begin or intensify ARDS focused therapies based on patient pathophysiologic state. Project Narrative: Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a highly lethal disease contracted by over 100,000 Americans each year. We seek to address whether we can create automated technologies to detect onset and change in severity of ARDS in critically ill patients using widely available ventilator waveform data. With these automated diagnostic testing technologies, doctors can promptly deliver necessary treatments for ARDS before the disease worsens.",A Real-Time Computational System for Detecting ARDS Using Ventilator Waveform Data,9980981,F31HL144028,"['Acute', 'Acute respiratory failure', 'Address', 'Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Affect', 'Airway Resistance', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Automation', 'Berlin', 'Chest', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Contracts', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Decision Support Model', 'Detection', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hour', 'Hypoxemia', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Medical History', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Provider', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Respiratory Failure', 'Sampling', 'Savings', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'United States', 'Ventilator', 'Work', 'adjudicate', 'advanced analytics', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical predictors', 'clinical translation', 'cohort', 'computer science', 'deep learning', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'markov model', 'model development', 'mortality', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'recurrent neural network', 'respiratory', 'success', 'targeted treatment']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,F31,2020,15376,-0.0011931679256609346
"Accelerating research to advance care for adults with congenital heart disease through development of validated scalable computational phenotypes PROJECT SUMMARY The advent of surgery to treat congenital heart disease (CHD) in the second half of the 20th century shifted the care paradigm from palliation of disease fatal in infancy to management of lifelong chronic disease through adulthood. There are now more than 1.5 million adults with CHD living in the United States. These patients have a substantial burden of cardiovascular and other medical comorbidities, as well as markedly increased risk for adverse outcomes such as arrhythmia, heart failure, cerebrovascular accident, and premature death. The emergence of this population requires new clinical care models as well as the development of novel research tools and infrastructures to address these patients' unique characteristics and healthcare needs. Adult CHD is characterized by substantial complexity, era-dependent heterogeneity in treatment strategies, and time-varying implications of lifelong disease. This burgeoning population is understudied, and the pathophysiology of the component diseases remains incompletely understood. Billing and other administrative codes available in the electronic medical record are neither sensitive nor specific for CHD diagnosis and do not adequately describe many other salient clinical features. As a result, structured data in large administrative databases are not well suited to studying adults with CHD, even when the goal is simply to identify a cohort of patients with a given diagnosis. This constitutes a major impediment to research efforts and is the primary barrier underlying the limited population-based research performed to date. Adult CHD investigation would benefit immensely from methods to establish harmonized, large-scale, multi-center datasets. While billing codes are inadequate, the information needed to accurately classify adults with CHD is already available in the electronic medical record in the form of clinical notes, comprised mainly of unstructured (“free”) text. Manual data extraction is laborious, resource intensive, and, therefore, not scalable. We propose to apply cutting-edge natural language processing approaches to unstructured text in the electronic medical record to develop computable classifiers for variables fundamental to the study of adults with CHD. We will use two unique institutional data resources at Boston Children's Hospital and Brigham and Women's Hospital that are already populated with expert-adjudicated labels to train classifiers for key phenotypes that are poorly defined by administrative codes. These classifiers will be validated in an independent patient cohort at Vanderbilt University Medical Center and tested in new disease-specific risk prediction models. This work promises to accelerate CHD research by massively increasing the scale of the patient cohorts that can be studied and by establishing a foundation for improved evidence-based decision support for this underserved population. PROJECT NARRATIVE Administrative billing codes are inadequate to support research for adults with congenital heart disease, a growing but understudied population with a high burden of medical comorbidities. To advance high quality research towards much-needed innovations in clinical care for these patients, we plan to develop novel methods for the creation of harmonized, large-scale, multi-center datasets that will expand and enhance collaborative research efforts.",Accelerating research to advance care for adults with congenital heart disease through development of validated scalable computational phenotypes,9946462,R01HL151604,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Arrhythmia', 'Atrial Heart Septal Defects', 'Boston', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Specificity', 'Disease', 'Eisenmenger Complex', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Heart', 'Heart failure', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitals', 'ICD-9', 'Incidence', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Label', 'Life', 'Lung', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical Informatics', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New York', 'Nomenclature', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Population Research', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Stroke', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Thromboembolism', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transposition of Great Vessels', 'Underserved Population', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Visit', 'Woman', 'Work', 'adjudicate', 'administrative database', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'biobank', 'clinical care', 'clinical data warehouse', 'clinical database', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinically actionable', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'computable phenotypes', 'congenital heart disorder', 'data resource', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'high risk', 'improved', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'large scale data', 'large-scale database', 'mortality', 'multitask', 'neural network', 'neural network classifier', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'palliation', 'patient population', 'population based', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive modeling', 'premature', 'prospective', 'repaired', 'risk prediction model', 'structured data', 'tool', 'treatment strategy']",NHLBI,CINCINNATI CHILDRENS HOSP MED CTR,R01,2020,784220,-0.005343645000958053
"Development of a biomarker panel for minimally-invasive screening and diagnosis of gynecological disease PROJECT SUMMARY One-third of all women of reproductive age will experience nonmenstrual pelvic pain at some point in their lives and one-third of outpatient visits to gynecologists in the U.S. are for evaluation of abnormal uterine bleeding. For many women, these symptoms accompany infertility which is reported in ~10% of all US women and even higher percentages worldwide. For almost all of these women, these conditions result in a diagnostic odyssey wherein women struggle through multiple physicians over many years for a definitive diagnosis, frequently culminating in invasive laparoscopy or hysteroscopy with dilation and curettage (D&C) for definitive diagnosis. To reduce the burden of diagnosis and enable early treatment, MDDx, Inc. is developing the first biomarker- based diagnostic test to enable minimally invasive simultaneous diagnosis of four of the most common causes which together result in chronic pain, uterine bleeding and infertility: adenomyosis, endometrial polyps, leiomyoma, and endometriosis. MDDx, Inc. has been leveraging access to >12 years of longitudinally collected and deeply annotated biobanked uterine lavage samples from the Gynecologic Cancer Translational Research Program (Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai; New York, NY and Nuvance Health; Danbury, CT) to identify diagnostic autoantibodies (AAb) that could serve as diagnostic biomarkers for these benign gynecological diseases. By performing AAb profiling against the entire human proteome and applying our novel machine-learning based method for classification of molecular profiles we have determined that there is a common set of ~200 biomarkers that could be used to diagnose women with adenomyosis, endometrial polyps, leiomyoma, or endometriosis. The goal of Phase I is to finalize and validate the optimized set of ~200 diagnostic AAbs, while Phase II will focus on validation of the commercial diagnostic assay. In Aim 1 we will expand our proprietary database of uterine lavage autoantibody profiles to ensure that we have a sample size (~935) that will enable us to confidently apply our machine learning approaches to identifying the minimal panel of AAbs for the diagnostic. We will use this enhanced database to identify a prototype panel of ~200 AAbs for construction of classification scoring functions to distinguish between adenomyosis, endometrial polyps, leiomyoma, and endometriosis. In Aim 2 we will perform a blinded validation and performance study using an independent set of 300 uterine lavage samples to provide proof-of- concept for clinically useful sensitivity and specificity prior to large scale prospective validation in Phase II. Successful completion of this Phase I program will identify the optimized panel of AAbs for an affordable, laboratory-based diagnostic test that will significantly reduce the number of women who will need to undergo laparoscopy or hysteroscopy with D&C for definitive diagnosis, enabling early treatment of disease and reducing the significant psychological and financial burden of diagnoses that otherwise can take years. PROJECTIVE NARRATIVE Nearly half of all women of reproductive age will experience some combination of nonmenstrual pelvic pain, abnormal uterine bleeding, and infertility in their lifetimes, yet there are no non-invasive methods to definitively diagnose the primary causes of these symptoms. MDDx, Inc. is developing the first laboratory diagnostic test to enable minimally invasive simultaneous diagnosis of four common causes of these often debilitating symptoms and infertility: adenomyosis, endometrial polyps, leiomyoma, and endometriosis. This test will enable early detection, early treatment, and reduce the physical, emotional, and financial burden of obtaining a diagnosis for women suffering from these common yet disruptive symptoms.",Development of a biomarker panel for minimally-invasive screening and diagnosis of gynecological disease,10146682,R41HD104402,"['Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anesthesia procedures', 'Antigens', 'Area', 'Atypical Endometrial Hyperplasias', 'Autoantibodies', 'Benign', 'Biological Markers', 'Blinded', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Dilatation and Curettage', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Emotional', 'Endometrial Carcinoma', 'Ensure', 'Entropy', 'Evaluation', 'Female Genital Diseases', 'Financial Hardship', 'General Anesthesia', 'Goals', 'Gynecologist', 'Health', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hemorrhage', 'Human', 'Hysteroscopy', 'Image', 'Infertility', 'Irrigation', 'Laboratories', 'Laparoscopy', 'Leiomyoma', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Female Reproductive System Neoplasm', 'Malignant neoplasm of ovary', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'New York', 'Operating Rooms', 'Outpatients', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Pelvic Pain', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Polyps', 'Population Control', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Preneoplastic Conditions', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Surgeon', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Triage', 'United States', 'Uterine Polyp', 'Uterine hemorrhage', 'Uterus', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomarker panel', 'chronic pain', 'clinically relevant', 'cost', 'diagnostic assay', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'diagnostic panel', 'disabling symptom', 'disease diagnosis', 'endometriosis', 'experience', 'improved', 'large datasets', 'medical schools', 'minimally invasive', 'novel', 'phase 1 study', 'programs', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'psychologic', 'reproductive', 'screening', 'translational research program', 'uterus endometriosis']",NICHD,"MDDX, INC.",R41,2020,299998,-0.050988475397632765
"Combined Cardiopulmonary Failure in COPD: SPIROMICS HF The death rate and hospitalizations from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have doubled in the last 50 years. A third of COPD hospitalizations overlap with heart failure, mostly with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), yet no large COPD study has ascertained cardiac function. The Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) COPD Study was funded to test the endothelial hypothesis of emphysema and examine reduced RV dimensions (“cor pulmonale parvus”) in COPD. In the MESA COPD Study II, we found that associations of reduced pulmonary microvascular blood flow with emphysema do not appear to be confounded by hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction and that emphysema on CT predicted RV regression over 5 years. We also developed methods to further subtype emphysema and COPD and scaled them up to the SubPopulations and InteRmediate Outcome Measures In COPD Study (SPIROMICS). We used unsupervised machine learning to discover new emphysema subtypes that are common and have molecular origins. Separately, we found that 26% of adults have segmental airway variants, which are associated with COPD and the developmental genes FGF10 and RARA. Both genes affect right heart development. In pilot work, we found one dramatically altered RV strain and the other associated with cor pulmonale parvus. Finally, we found that bronchitic ‘symptomatic smokers,’ who have hyperinflation from gas trapping, may have increased LV diastolic dysfunction. Hence, cardiac alterations in COPD are complex but recent advances in COPD subtyping may allow their personalized diagnosis and treatment. SPIROMICS is an NHLBI-funded prospective study that recruited smokers with COPD and controls and is re-examining 2,000 participants with gold- standard lung phenotyping including full-lung CT. We propose to add comprehensive echocardiography (echo) with speckle-tracking for cardiac mechanics for 1,000 SPIROMICS participants, with exercise in 700 and cardiopulmonary MRI in 600, to test the following hypotheses: 1) machine-learned subtypes of emphysema on CT are associated with specific alterations in cardiac structure and function, which vary from cor pulmonale to LV diastolic dysfunction; 2) participants with segmental airway variants have abnormal RV structure and function; 3) symptomatic smokers have signs of increased LV afterload and LV diastolic dysfunction. Innovative aspects of the application include the use of novel echo and MRI measures in a large, well- characterized cohort of COPD patients. Confirmation of the hypotheses would define the mechanisms of HFpEF in COPD and identify subsets of patients for targeted treatment of cardiopulmonary dysfunction. The death rate and hospitalizations from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have doubled in the last 50 years. A third of COPD hospitalizations overlap with heart failure, mostly with preserved ejection fraction. The proposed study would be the first large study with gold-standard phenotyping of the heart and lungs and would test highly specific hypothesized based upon recent advances in lung subphenotyping to yield personalized approaches to combined cardiopulmonary disease in COPD.",Combined Cardiopulmonary Failure in COPD: SPIROMICS HF,10020427,R01HL093081,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Apical', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Output', 'Cardiopulmonary', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Code', 'Complex', 'DRD1 gene', 'Death Rate', 'Developmental Gene', 'Diffuse', 'Dimensions', 'Drops', 'EFRAC', 'Echocardiography', 'Endothelium', 'Exercise', 'FGF10 gene', 'Failure', 'Fibrosis', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Gases', 'Genes', 'Gold', 'Heart', 'Heart Atrium', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Impairment', 'Kinetics', 'Lung', 'Lung CAT Scan', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis', 'Myocardial', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Outcome Measure', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Prospective Studies', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Pulmonary Fibrosis', 'Pulmonary Heart Disease', 'Pulmonary artery structure', 'RARA gene', 'Respiratory Failure', 'Right Ventricular Hypertrophy', 'Right ventricular structure', 'Sampling', 'Smoker', 'Structure', 'Suggestion', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Variant', 'Ventricular', 'Work', 'base', 'cardiogenesis', 'cohort', 'disorder control', 'disorder subtype', 'genetic variant', 'heart function', 'heart preservation', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'interstitial', 'lung hypoxia', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'patient subsets', 'personalized approach', 'personalized diagnostics', 'personalized medicine', 'preservation', 'pressure', 'receptor', 'recruit', 'targeted treatment', 'unsupervised learning', 'vasoconstriction']",NHLBI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2020,2331272,-0.027780444295170063
"Michigan Hepatotoxicity Clinical Research Network Renewal 2018 Michigan Hepatotoxicity Research Network 2018 Renewal ABSTRACT In the past 5 years, the Drug Induced Liver Injury Network (DILIN) has increased cumulative enrollment to over 2000 adult and pediatric patients in the ongoing Prospective and Retrospective registry studies. In addition, an “Acute” DILI protocol with collection of serial early biological samples for mechanistic biomarker studies was developed and implemented. Other network aims included investigation of the role of genetic polymorphisms in DILI susceptibility and outcome, development of improved causality assessment methods, and expansion of the LiverTox website. The University of Michigan team led by Dr. Fontana has played an important role in the design, implementation, and analysis of the primary and ancillary DILIN studies since its inception in 2003. Michigan has not only been a leading enroller in all of the ongoing Registry studies but also provided important leadership in multiple DILIN committees and initiatives. The Michigan team now proposes a series of novel and feasible study aims for the DILIN renewal. The PRIMARY AIM of this proposal is to continue to recruit and enroll high causality adult and pediatric DILI cases into the registry studies for genetic, immunologic, biomarker and mechanistic studies. The Michigan Hepatotoxicity Network has specific plans to increase the enrollment of ethnic minorities via the engagement of hepatologists/ collaborators in southeastern Michigan and elsewhere that care for a large number of African American, Hispanic, and Asian patients. In addition, further development of natural language processing algorithms to search the EMR at the University of Michigan are proposed to facilitate enrollment. Qualitative, quantitative and toxicological studies of the chemical constituents in the herbal and dietary supplement (HDS) products implicated in a growing proportion of DILI cases will be expanded via an ongoing collaboration with the National Center for National Products Research. The SECOND AIM of this proposal is to conduct pilot/ feasibility clinical trials to improve the outcomes of patients with severe acute DILI and those at risk for developing chronic DILI. Proposed study designs include a 12 week course of a simple and safe, orally administered anti-inflammatory or anti-oxidant agent (e.g. budesonide, SAMe, vitamin E) in selected patients with severe acute DILI at risk for adverse outcomes. In addition, 12 to 24 week studies of a safe and effective orally administered anti- cholestatic agent such as an ileal apical bile salt transport inhibitor that may reduce serum bile acids are proposed for subjects at risk of chronic DILI. Lastly, prospective studies of magnetic resonance elastography and MRCP imaging are proposed to improve our understanding of the severity and natural history of DILI. The THIRD AIM of this proposal is to further expand the LiverTox website to include additional chapters on HDS DILI, develop and implement a computerized causality assessment instrument, and assemble working committees to insure that the website content remains up to date and pertinent. Finally, additional collaborations between DILIN and the US FDA and other regulatory agencies are proposed to enhance the pharmacovigilance capabilities of DILIN for new causes of DILI and temporal changes over time. PROJECT NARRATIVE The University of Michigan Hepatotoxicity Research Network proposes to improve our understanding of the etiologies, risk factors, and outcomes of DILI via the continued enrollment of adult and pediatric patients including targeted enrollment of ethnic minority patients that will help determine if there are racial differences in DILI susceptibility and outcomes via analysis of collected biological samples, DNA, liver tissue, and clinical data. Pilot/ feasibility clinical trials of simple, safe and mechanistically based treatments for patients with severe acute DILI and those at risk for developing chronic DILI are also proposed. Finally, further development and enhancement of the LiverTox website is proposed to include additional chapters on HDS DILI, development and implementation of a computerized diagnostic instrument, and expansion of the pharmacovigilance capabilities of DILIN.",Michigan Hepatotoxicity Clinical Research Network Renewal 2018,9998934,U01DK065184,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'African American', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Antioxidants', 'Apical', 'Asians', 'Assessment tool', 'Bile Acids', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Budesonide', 'Caring', 'Chemicals', 'Childhood', 'Chinese People', 'Cholestasis', 'Chronic', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Enrollment', 'Etiology', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic study', 'Hepatic', 'Hepatotoxicity', 'Herbal supplement', 'Hispanics', 'Hospitals', 'Human Resources', 'Image', 'Immunologic Factors', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Immunologics', 'International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10)', 'Intuition', 'Investigation', 'Leadership', 'Liver', 'Magnetic Resonance Elastography', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Monitor', 'Natural History', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Oxidants', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pediatrics', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Phenotype', 'Plasma', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Race', 'Recovery', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'S-Adenosylmethionine', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Serum', 'Severities', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Symptoms', 'Taiwan', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxicology', 'Transplantation', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Vitamin E', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'bile salts', 'clinical phenotype', 'computerized', 'design', 'ethnic minority population', 'hepatotoxin', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'industry partner', 'instrument', 'liver injury', 'meetings', 'member', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'outreach', 'pediatric patients', 'pharmacovigilance', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'racial difference', 'recruit', 'repository', 'sample collection', 'transcriptomics', 'transport inhibitor', 'web site']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U01,2020,344849,-0.0019564475488261374
"Machine learning to inform health services and policy for traumatic brain injury Project Summary Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is recognized as the leading cause of death and disability in all parts of the world and costs the international economy approximately US$400 billion annually, which, given an estimated standardized gross world product of US $73.7 trillion, is a striking 0.5% of the entire annual global output. To address the profound issues related to a drastic increase in emergency department visits and hospitalizations for TBI over the past decades, the United States Congress highlighted injury surveillance as a federal priority. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention defines surveillance as “use of health-related data that precede diagnosis and signal a sufficient probability of a case or an outbreak to warrant further public health response”. To prevent TBI, it is essential to understand its distribution and patterns, in addition to having strong knowledge of clinical disorders, characteristic, or other definable entity, that differentiates TBI from other clinical populations. A critical barrier to the progress of the NIH-funded program “Comorbidity in traumatic brain injury and risk of all-cause mortality, functional and financial burden: a decade-long population based cohort study” was the presence of complex and multifaceted comorbidities in a patient with TBI before and at the time of the injury, and their links to patients’ frailty, injury circumstances, severity, and outcomes. This resulted in a shift in the research paradigm, and development of a novel data mining approach used in genomics to sequence more than 70,000 clinical diagnosis codes in a TBI population, and compare them to a matched population. The developed data mining approach allowed not only the validation of previously known risk factors of TBI, but also the identification of associations previously unknown, without any preconceived human biases. This project will continue advancement of a non-hypothesis driven scientific approach, which will: (1) Characterize patients with TBI at three different time periods in relation to the TBI event – before, at the time of, and after the injury; (2) Develop individual and population level models to study the transitions between the different time states; and (3) Construct and validate predictive models of susceptibility to TBI events, adverse outcomes, and high healthcare resource use at the individual and population level. Decades- long population-based health administrative data from the publicly-funded healthcare system in Ontario, Canada is ready to be further analysed for clinical and technological advancement, to support human thinking in categorizing personal, clinical, and environmental exposure data preceding TBI. Project Narrative To detect, manage, and prevent traumatic brain injury (TBI), a complex and often lifelong disabling injury, it is essential to understand its distribution and patterns and have a comprehensive knowledge of the clinical disorder, characteristic, or other definable entity that differentiates between and within persons at risk of TBI of varying mechanisms, injury presentation, and its course. This research proposal expands an ongoing NIH-funded project that started to categorize clinical comorbidities and personal and environmental exposure data into clinically meaningful factors that increase the risk of injury and its severity at the population and individual levels. With the support of data mining and big data, this proposed program will advance research methods with a goal-directed learning process and the fields of injury surveillance and precision medicine, covering a variety of interests in public health, brain injury medicine, and behavioural and social sciences.",Machine learning to inform health services and policy for traumatic brain injury,10030705,R01NS117921,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Ambulances', 'Americas', 'Amnesia', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Brain Pathology', 'Canada', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Categories', 'Cause of Death', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Congresses', 'Data', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Elements', 'Emergency department visit', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Explosion', 'Exposure to', 'Financial Hardship', 'Funding', 'Gender', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Health', 'Health Policy', 'Health Services', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Injury', 'International', 'International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10)', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Metabolic', 'Modeling', 'Musculoskeletal System', 'Natural regeneration', 'Ontario', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Preventive', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Province', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Proposals', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Role', 'Secondary to', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Standardization', 'Stratification', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'TBI Patients', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Unconscious State', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Woman', 'adverse outcome', 'assault', 'behavioral/social science', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'comorbidity', 'cost', 'data mining', 'disability', 'expectation', 'falls', 'frailty', 'functional outcomes', 'gender disparity', 'improved', 'informatics tool', 'injury recovery', 'injury surveillance', 'interest', 'medically necessary care', 'men', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized medicine', 'population based', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'response', 'sex', 'social', 'survivorship', 'vehicular accident', 'virtual']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO,R01,2020,185878,-0.014176637287438704
"Reducing the incidence of febrile neutropenia in cancer patients treated with chemotherapy with PointCheck: a portable non-invasive neutropenia analyzer Every year in the US, 650,000 cancer patients are treated with chemotherapy. As a side effect,  their neutrophil counts (number of white blood cells that aid in fighting infections) become low  (referred to as neutropenia) and expose them to febrile neutropenia (FN) which are episodes  of serious infection that entail costly hospitalization and sometimes death. If  neutropenia is detected early, FN can be avoided through timely delivery of  prophylactic antibiotics or growth stimulating factors. Currently, neutrophil measurements require  visits to healthcare centers. This increases infection risk (as measurements are taken infrequently  and low counts may not be detected before infections ensue) and reduces chemotherapy efficacy (as  chemotherapy levels are kept at the lower end of frequency and dose for safety). We aim to overcome  this limitation with PointCheck, a noninvasive neutrophil test that can be used frequently in  local health centers or at home, enabling physicians to minimize infections and  personalize chemotherapy planning. The basis for our technology is noninvasive optical imaging of  microcirculation in nailfold capillaries. We conducted a pilot clinical study where trained   nurses used PointCheck to acquire data from 46 chemotherapy patients. By manually analyzing  a training dataset (N=38 measurements from 16 patients), we built a labeled dataset of flow gaps in  the microcirculation that can be considered proxies of neutrophils and demonstrated their number  can be used to distinguish baseline patients (>500 neutrophils/mm3) from grade IV neutropenic ones  (<500/mm3). However, the need for manual analysis makes the technology inaccessible to patients on  its current status. With support from SBIR Phase I, we will (a) develop algorithms that automatize  the manual data processing workflow employed on our training set, (b) test those algorithms on our  acquired and unanalyzed testing database (N=103 measurements from 30 patients) and (c) generate  additional performance data including further intermediate neutrophil ranges (>500 and <1,500  neutrophils/mm3), thus fulfilling the requirements for a minimum viable product. The consecution of  these milestones will enable, in Phase II, using PointCheck in a multi-site diagnostic validation  trial to confirm, under clinical conditions, that the management of FN can be improved with this  new paradigm. Development of a portable optical imaging device that can noninvasively  detect neutropenia-related immunosuppression, to enable more frequent monitoring of  chemotherapy patients so that timely medical interventions can be staged before  life-threatening infections develop.",Reducing the incidence of febrile neutropenia in cancer patients treated with chemotherapy with PointCheck: a portable non-invasive neutropenia analyzer,10091634,R43CA228920,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Algorithms', 'Antibiotics', 'Area', 'Autologous Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Blinded', 'Blood capillaries', 'Blood specimen', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnostic', 'Dose', 'FPS-FES Oncogene', 'Fever', 'Fingers', 'Frequencies', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hematology', 'Home environment', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Imaging Device', 'Immunosuppression', 'Incidence', 'Infection', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Label', 'Letters', 'Leukocytes', 'Life', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Microcirculation', 'Monitor', 'Neutropenia', 'Nurses', 'Oncology', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Process', 'Proxy', 'ROC Curve', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Side Effects', 'Triage', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'base', 'chemotherapy', 'cohort', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'experience', 'fighting', 'improved', 'infection risk', 'learning strategy', 'man', 'mortality', 'movie', 'neutrophil', 'non-invasive optical imaging', 'non-invasive system', 'optical imaging', 'personalized chemotherapy', 'point of care', 'portability', 'prophylactic', 'prototype', 'side effect']",NCI,"LEUKO LABS, INC.",R43,2020,55000,0.019081749363117302
"Development of a multi-omic clinical decision platform to guide personalized therapy PROJECT SUMMARY The era of “big data” has opened the door for genomic and systems biology approaches to be applied to current challenges in life sciences and precision medicine. One critical challenge in these areas is how to prioritize research findings to validate and identify actionable insights that can translate into better outcomes for patients. In this regard, we have assembled a multidisciplinary group of scientists and physicians from academia and industry with a focus on creating discovery pipelines that combine high-throughput profiling technologies with advanced statistical and machine learning approaches to generate predictive tools that enable us to move rapidly from big data to better diagnoses and treatment. In this regard, we propose to apply these approaches to develop a computational clinical decision tool that will improve disease forecasting and treatment plans for Multiple Myeloma (MM), an incurable cancer that originates in bone marrow plasma cells and affects more than 30,000 patients a year. Though there have been some advances in the number and diversity of available therapeutic options for these patients, relapse remains inevitable, and MM ultimately remains a terminal diagnosis. The clinical assay and computational pipeline developed in this project will combine a targeted sequencing panel specific to myeloma patients and clonality estimates with RNA- sequencing and drug repurposing to expand therapeutic options for MM patients. We will develop this unique tool with the following specific aims: (1) Develop an integrated genomic clinical decision tool to guide precision treatment of MM and validate therapy recommendations using PDX profiling, and (2) Validate MM precision medicine platform in a prospective clinical trial and generate clone-specific treatment recommendations. To achieve these objectives, we will integrate a Cancer Genetic, Inc.'s FOCUS::Myeloma panel, a targeted panel designed to specifically interrogateall the genes and copy number alterations commonly altered in myeloma, and into a computational drug selection pipeline that utilizes RNA-sequencing data and drug repurposing algorithms to generate therapeutic recommendations matched to a patient's unique disease profile. These recommendations will be validated in mouse avatars of myeloma to confirm and refine drug predictions. We will implement our assay in a prospective clinical trial of 100 patients to determine if the treatment decisions generated by our pipeline achieves an improvement in standard-of-care. Finally, we will perform clonal modeling on relapsed patients to retrospectively evaluate clone-specific treatment responses. Completion of these studies will result in a clinic-ready assay and computational tool that will guide MM precision treatment decisions and inform new therapeutic strategies based on a patient's unique cancer profile. genomic clonal modeling PROJECT NARRATIVE Multiple Myeloma is an incurable cancer of the blood that takes the lives of over 12,000 people every year. It remains a difficult disease to treat due to its genetic complexity from the earliest stages of the disease, indicating a need for a precision medicine approach in treating these patients. In this application Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai will partner with Cancer Genetics, Inc. to develop a multi-omics clinical decision assay that will improve long-term outcomes for patients with advanced myeloma and generate valuable insights and tools that can be broadly leveraged for other disease indications.",Development of a multi-omic clinical decision platform to guide personalized therapy,9981389,R01CA244899,"['Academia', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Animal Model', 'Area', 'Arteries', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Sciences', 'Bone Marrow', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clonality', 'Computer Models', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Drug resistance', 'Employment', 'Event', 'Gene Dosage', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'Hematopoietic Neoplasms', 'Heterogeneity', 'Industry', 'Inflammatory', 'Intake', 'Intestines', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Multiple Myeloma', 'Mus', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Physicians', 'Plasma Cells', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'RNA', 'Recommendation', 'Refractory', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Risk stratification', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'Stream', 'Suggestion', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Xenograft Model', 'Xenograft procedure', 'base', 'cancer genetics', 'clinical decision support', 'clinically actionable', 'computational pipelines', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'disorder subtype', 'efficacy testing', 'genomic data', 'genomic profiles', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'in vivo', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'longitudinal design', 'medical schools', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple omics', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'novel therapeutics', 'personalized medicine', 'personalized therapeutic', 'pilot trial', 'point of care', 'precision medicine', 'predictive tools', 'profiles in patients', 'prospective', 'relapse patients', 'standard of care', 'statistical and machine learning', 'support tools', 'targeted sequencing', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment planning', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor xenograft']",NCI,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2020,519735,-0.02639488035550969
"Antibody isotyping for discrimination of disease stage and diagnosis of early Lyme disease. ABSTRACT More than 3 million tests are performed each year to support the laboratory diagnosis of human Lyme disease (LD). While the CDC conventional standard two-tier (CSTT) approach for serodiagnosis of LD has worked relatively well when used as recommended, there is plenty of room for improvement. Of a number of weaknesses associated with the supplemental immunoblot of the CSTT the most significant is low reproducibility due to the subjective visual interpretation of results. To overcome these weaknesses the CDC recently updated its recommendations based on a modified STT (MSTT) in that a second EIA can replace the immunoblot. The major goal of this project is to develop an objective, quantitative, multiplex EIA that can detect four antibody isotypes (IgM/D/G/A) and all four IgG subclasses (IgG1/2/3/4) to leverage acquisition of simultaneous antibody profile information on multiple B. burgdorferi antigens to build an assay that can discriminate Lyme disease stage with increased overall sensitivity without incurring in loss of specificity. The novelty of this study relies on: 1) evaluation of B. burgdorferi antigen-specific antibody isotypes and IgG subclasses that can be correlated with Lyme disease stage; and 2) development of new diagnostic tools using machine learning techniques to train and integrate all data and produce an objective result to discriminate early Lyme from early disseminated/late Lyme disease. We expect this Phase I SBIR to allow us to develop a new EIA for serodiagnosis of Lyme disease (isoEIAplex-Ld) and to further an ongoing collaboration with DCN diagnostics for the adaptation of our biomarkers to a new rapid Lateral Flow Assay (see Letter of Support) for a follow up Phase II SBIR .

"A multifaceted adaptive mobile application to promote self-management and improve outcomes in heart failure PROJECT SUMMARY Heart failure (HF) is the most common hospital discharge diagnosis among older adults in the United States. Strikingly, 2 in 5 patients are readmitted within 1-year following their first HF admission. This results in significant potentially avoidable costs to our already strained healthcare system, since hospitalizations result in 70% of yearly HF management costs. The most common causes of readmission are failure to recognize clinical worsening and dietary nonadherence. As a result, HF management is rapidly evolving from the traditional model of face-to-face follow-up visits toward a proactive real-time technological model of assisting patients with monitoring and self-management while in the community. While several HF studies have implemented technologically-driven disease management programs, results have been mixed. These systems effectively deliver monitoring data and alerts to healthcare providers. However, their effectiveness in delivering behavioral interventions to patients and modifying patient behavior, a crucial factor in HF self-management, is unknown. Therefore, it is imperative to develop and test patient- centered technologies that deliver behavioral interventions to promote self-management for the most common causes of readmissions with an overall goal of reducing HF readmissions. This proposed project will determine the effectiveness of two interventions within a mobile application and builds on our work from previous research. Our central hypothesis is that a patient-centered mobile application with contextual just-in-time interventions about self-management during a clinical worsening and dietary sodium will improve the health status of HF patients. The rationale for this project, which is supported by our preliminary data, is that a new model for disease management - placing patients in control of their condition - will have a substantial positive impact on HF outcomes. Our objectives are to: (1) determine the impact of two unique adaptive mobile application interventions on HF readmission and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in HF patients, (2) establish the effect the interventions have on proximal outcomes and that the proximal outcomes mediate the intervention’s impact on HF readmission and HRQOL, and (3) develop data-driven machine learning models that can predict episodes of clinical worsening.

"Improving Health Outcomes for an Aging Population OTHER PROJECT INFORMATION – Project Summary/Abstract Drug Treatments and the Impact of COVID-19 on Alzheimer’s Patients and Other Vulnerable Populations Interventions in health policy and care management have the potential to reduce COVID-19 infections and deaths, particularly if they can be targeted to the most vulnerable populations such as patients with Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD). In this supplement proposal, we compile information and develop tools that can accelerate and target such interventions. The first aim is to identify the medical and socioeconomic characteristics of people that make them most vulnerable to COVID-19. We create cohorts of patients with ADRD and for other vulnerable populations based on their Fall 2019 characteristics, and follow them through 2020 to identify those at greatest risk of both “direct” COVID-19 outcomes (e.g., critical illness, mortality) and “indirect” increases in non-COVID outcomes. The second aim is an ambitious proof of concept: using natural experiments to shed light on novel drugs to treat or prevent COVID-19 with a particular focus on drugs most heavily used by ADRD patients (e.g., anticholinesterase inhibitors). We will develop and apply a machine learning approach to test the potential effect of drug classes on COVID-19, measured by diagnosis, hospitalization, ICU admission, and death. This supplement is made possible by a unique opportunity: Access to near-real-time Medicare claims data (one-month lag), which CMS appears willing to make available through an expedited data use agreement. The application will supplement an ongoing program project on Improving Health Outcome for an Aging Population, whose overarching aim is to better understand health trends and disparities, determinants of health, and approaches to improving health for an aging population in an evolving landscape. OTHER PROJECT INFORMATION – Project Narrative This administrative supplement seeks to better understand factors mediating (and exacerbating) the impact of COVID-19 on patient cohorts with Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) and other vulnerable characteristics.

"Efficient Statistical Learning Methods for Personalized Medicine Using Large Scale Biomedical Data Project Summary:  Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) has created a major public health crisis around the world. The novel coronavirus was observed to have a long incubation period and extremely infectious during this period. No proven effective treatment or vaccine is available. Massive public interventions have been implemented in many countries and states in the United States (US) at different phases of the outbreak with varying combinations of social dis- tancing, mobility restriction and population behavioral change. Decisions on how to implement these interventions (e.g., when to impose and relax mitigation measures) rely on important statistics of COVID epidemiology (e.g., effective reproduction number) that characterize and predict the course of COVID-19 outbreak. However, there is a lack of robust and parsimonious model of COVID epidemic that can accurately reﬂect the heterogeneity between susceptible populations and regions (e.g., demographics, healthcare capacity, social and economic determinants). There is no rigorous study to guide precision public health interventions that are tailored to a population or region depending on their characteristics. Furthermore, due to the non-randomized nature of public health interventions, it is critical to account for biases and confounding when comparing mitigation measures of COVID-19 across re- gions. To address these challenges, this project develops robust and generalizable analytic methods to evaluate public health interventions and assess individual patient risks of COVID-19 infection and complications. In Aim 1, we will develop dynamic and robust statistical models to predict the disease epidemic. The models will estimate the date of the ﬁrst unknown infection case, instantaneous effective reproduction number, and account for the incu- bation period of COVID-19 virus. Furthermore, heterogeneity in population's demographics, social and economic indicators, healthcare capacity and geographic locations will be incorporated to reﬂect their impacts on COVID epidemic. Under a longitudinal quasi-experimental design, we will provide valid inference for comparing public health interventions implemented at different regions while accounting for confounding bias. Multiple sources of data from different states in the US will be analyzed to empirically test which states' response strategies are more effective and in which subpopulation. In Aim 2, we will focus on developing precise risk assessment tool of individ- ual COVID-19 patients using electronic health records (EHRs) collected at New York Presbyterian hospital in New York City, an epicenter of COVID-19. We will engineer features of patient's pre-conditions associated with severe COVID complications, recovery, or death. More importantly, we will engineer features that represent proxies of virus exposures from patients' geographic information. We will use machine learning techniques to create quantitative summaries of patient prognosis (e.g., transitioning to serious clinical stages, discharge, death). We will use inter- nal cross-validation and external calibration to validate developed algorithms. The project will generate evidence to guide precision public health intervention, optimal patient care, and efﬁcient healthcare resource allocation in anticipation of a second wave of COVID epidemic and in preparation of other infectious disease outbreaks. Project Narrative:  This project aims to develop robust and generalizable analytics to evaluate public health interventions in response to coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic and to assess individual patient risks using multiple sources of data (e.g., ofﬁcial reports of COVID cases, electronic health records). The project will provide quantita- tive evidence to guide precision public health interventions at the right time for the right subpopulation to effectively contain and mitigate the outbreak. It will also provide quantitative risk assessments of COVID-19 patients to facili- tate best clinical management and optimal allocation of heathcare resources.",Efficient Statistical Learning Methods for Personalized Medicine Using Large Scale Biomedical Data,10161345,R01GM124104,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Assessment tool', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Calibration', 'Caring', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chiroptera', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Country', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Early identification', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Experimental Designs', 'Exposure to', 'Future', 'Gaussian model', 'Geographic Locations', 'Geography', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of General Medical Sciences', 'Nature', 'New York', 'New York City', 'Parents', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Care Management', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Preparation', 'Presbyterian Church', 'Process', 'Proxy', 'Public Health', 'Quasi-experiment', 'Recovery', 'Reporting', 'Reproduction', 'Resource Allocation', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Severities', 'Social Distance', 'Source', 'Statistical Models', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Triage', 'United States', 'Vaccines', 'Validation', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'Work', 'algorithm development', 'analytical method', 'big biomedical data', 'coronavirus disease', 'demographics', 'design', 'disease transmission', 'disorder risk', 'economic determinant', 'economic indicator', 'effective therapy', 'epidemiological model', 'high risk population', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'intervention effect', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'model building', 'mortality', 'multiple data sources', 'novel coronavirus', 'outcome forecast', 'pandemic disease', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'public health intervention', 'recruit', 'response', 'social', 'social determinants', 'statistical learning', 'statistics', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'vector', 'web site']",NIGMS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2020,331147,-0.001710507673870812
"BAsIC - Brain-computer-interface practical Application in the Intensive Care unit: a pilot study Patients increasingly survive critical care, but for many the experience is psychologically tormenting in part because they lose all control over their environment. Patients with neurological injury in particular suffer from this major loss of autonomy which impacts their long term recovery. Brain-computer interface (BCI) technology transforms physiological changes associated with patient thoughts into actionable outputs. The technology is rapidly advancing and well established outside of the critical care setting. The goal of this project is to determine whether conscious and unconscious appearing ICU patients are able to communicate their basic needs, such as pain, hunger, and thirst, to health care providers using the BCI technology. We will apply a bedside BCI system in the ICU using a machine-learning algorithm that analyzes changes in routine EEG in response to standardized questions presented to the patient by headphones. The BCI system will provide immediate closed- loop feedback (auditory and/or visual) to patients about their performance. To achieve our goals, we will first test if conscious ICU patients are able to express basic needs, such as pain, to health care providers using the BCI technology. Patients will trigger the BCI system to then express their needs in response to specific questions (e.g., “Do you have pain?”). Secondly, we will determine whether basic communication is possible for patients with cognitive motor dissociation (i.e., patients who appear unconscious, but follow commands using EEG motor imagery paradigms). We will test if these patients are able to use the BCI system to respond to simple questions (i.e., “Activate the alarm”). Finally, we will assess the patient's experience using BCI technology as part of this study, as well as acceptance of using BCI technology in future clinical trials from patients, families, and health care providers involved in the study. The long-term goal of this proposal is to prepare a large clinical trial to test the benefits of BCI-assisted communication in brain-injured ICU patients. Patients in critical care suffer an almost complete loss of control over their most basic needs (e.g., they are unable to tell someone that they are hungry), which is stressful and impacts their long term recovery.

"Evidence to improve heat warning effectiveness in reducing morbidity and mortality. Project Summary/Abstract  While exposure to high ambient temperature (i.e., heat) has long been recognized as a threat to public health, the burden of illness and death attributable to heat in the US remains high. In an effort to reduce heat- related mortality and morbidity, the US National Weather Service (NWS) issues heat alerts in advance of forecasted extreme heat events to communicate these risks to the public and government officials. However, it is largely unknown: (1) what are the optimal metrics of heat stress to inform when to issue heat alerts, (2) how effective are heat alerts in protecting the public’s health and (3) what factors make heat alerts comparatively more or less effective in some places or in some people versus others. In the absence of such information, we will fail to maximize the public health benefits of heat alerts.  The goals of this proposal are to identify the optimal health-based and location-specific metrics for issuing heat alerts, to estimate the causal benefits of heat alerts, and to identify characteristics of individuals or communities associated with the greatest reductions in morbidity or mortality following heat alerts. Specifically, using national claims data on deaths and hospital admissions among the large, geographically diverse population of >60 million US Medicare beneficiaries age ≥65 years enrolled between 2001 and 2015, and on emergency department visits among >130 million participants of all ages from one of the nation’s largest health insurers, we propose to: (Aim 1) Use novel machine learning methods to identify the heat metric(s) (e.g., heat index, ambient temperature, spatial synoptic classification, wet bulb globe temperature, absolute humidity) that best predict excess heat-related deaths, emergency hospitalizations, and emergency departments visits in each location, (Aim 2) estimate the causal effects of NWS heat alerts on rates of mortality, hospitalizations, and emergency department visits across the country and within groups stratified by health outcome, sex, and age group, and (Aim 3) assess how the benefits of heat alerts vary across characteristics of communities.  Key innovations of this proposal include a very large sample size, geographic diversity encompassing the entire US, the assessment across multiple health endpoints and age groups, and the use of sophisticated methods in statistical learning and causal inference. Collectively, the findings from this proposal will provide meteorologists, public health and emergency management officials, and local policy-makers with critical information to better protect public health during extreme heat events and guide more targeted future research on strategies to mitigate the adverse health effects of heat. Project Narrative Extreme heat is recognized as an important threat to public health, and the burden of illness and death attributable to heat in the US remains high. In an effort to reduce heat-related mortality and morbidity, the US National Weather Service (NWS) issues heat alerts in advance of forecast extreme heat events to communicate these risks to the public and local government officials, although it remains largely unknown whether such alerts are effective in protecting people. We propose to provide forecasters and public health officials across the country with location-specific, health-based evidence as to the effectiveness of heat alerts and insights into how to improve them to better protect the public’s health.",Evidence to improve heat warning effectiveness in reducing morbidity and mortality.,10164490,R01ES029950,"['Age', 'Air Conditioning', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'Country', 'Data', 'Effectiveness', 'Emergency Situation', 'Emergency department visit', 'Enrollment', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Government Agencies', 'Government Officials', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Heat Stress Disorders', 'Hospitalization', 'Humidity', 'Individual', 'Insurance Carriers', 'Knowledge', 'Local Government', 'Location', 'Medicare', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Policy Maker', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Seasons', 'Services', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Structure', 'Temperature', 'United States', 'Weather', 'age group', 'attributable mortality', 'base', 'beneficiary', 'burden of illness', 'comparative', 'evidence base', 'extreme heat', 'human old age (65+)', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'novel', 'prevent', 'public health emergency', 'response', 'sex', 'statistical learning']",NIEHS,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,R01,2020,613553,-0.006329150975596876
"Outcome-Driven Approach to Minimize the Risks of Facial Distortion Following CMF Surgery Abstract:  Our main clinical motivation of this project is to provide personalized precision care to patients with jaw (both maxilla and mandible) deformities by significantly improving surgical planning method. The number of patients suffering from jaw deformities is escalating each year.  Orthognathic surgery is a main surgical procedure to treat jaw deformities by repositioning bony segments of the jaws. The ultimate outcomes of orthognathic surgery are judged by the final facial appearance. Although the facial soft tissues are not directly operated on, the face changes “automatically” following the bony changes. Orthognathic surgery requires extensive surgical planning. While we can accurately plan the bony movements and transfer it to the patient during the surgery using computer-aided surgical simulation (CASS) and 3D printing, surgeons are still unable to practically predict the facial changes during the surgical planning, and just hope that a postoperative normal face will be “automatically” restored. However, this “mental-clue” approach is not reliable because the facial change does not exactly follow bony change. The problem is even bigger in patients with composite defects. For example, if a patient has a skeletal deformity and mild facial defect, a surgeon must know, before surgery, how to overcorrect the skeleton to camouflage the soft-tissue defect. But this information can only be attained by accurate method to predict facial changes. In addition, from patient’s perspective, the final facial appearance is great concern to them. Therefore, it is extremely important, for both doctors and patients, to accurately predict facial changes.  In the previous project period, we have made significant achievements in predicting facial changes following bony movements using finite element (FE) method. However, this approach still requires a considerable amount of time to prepare FE models. In addition, rather than determining the ultimate surgical outcome (the postoperative facial appearance) first, the current method is still to predict the facial change passively following the bony surgery. These hurdles greatly prevent surgeons from practically using it in the clinical setting.  Our hypothesis is that a personalized precision treatment outcome can only be achieved if surgeons are able to determine the final treatment outcome, a desired postoperative face, before planning the bony surgery. To test our hypothesis, we propose to integrate outcome-driven and machine learning-based techniques together to first estimate a desired postoperative face, and then plan the bony surgery.  The proposed project will have a significant clinical impact on improving patient care quality. It will enable clinicians to develop an optimal surgical plan based on both facial and bony information, on-the-fly, using a single software in their routine clinical practice. It will also revolutionize the surgical planning technique using outcome- driven approach, i.e., to first estimate a desired postoperative face and then plan the bony surgery. Project Narrative: 1. In the US and throughout the world, the number of patients requiring orthognathic surgery for jaw  deformities, which involves skeleton, overlying soft tissue, or both, is escalating every ear. 2. Currently, while surgeons are able to accurately plan orthognathic surgery by virtually repositioning bony  segments to desired locations, they are still unable to practically predict the ultimate treatment outcomes  of orthognathic surgery, a desired postoperative facial appearance, during the surgical planning. 3. We are proposing to integrate outcome-driven and machine learning-based techniques together to first  estimate a desired postoperative face, and then plan the bony surgery, which will revolutionize the  surgical planning technique and enable clinicians to develop an optimal surgical plan based on both facial  and bony information, on-the-fly, using a single software in their routine clinical practice.",Outcome-Driven Approach to Minimize the Risks of Facial Distortion Following CMF Surgery,9895393,R01DE021863,"['3-Dimensional', '3D Print', 'Achievement', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Appearance', 'Biomechanics', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer software', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Databases', 'Defect', 'Deformity', 'Development', 'Ear', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Face', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Jaw', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Lip structure', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Mandible', 'Maxilla', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Movement', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Planning Techniques', 'Postoperative Period', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Process', 'Progress Reports', 'Psyche structure', 'Quality of Care', 'Reconstructive Surgical Procedures', 'Reporting', 'Residual state', 'Running', 'Shapes', 'Skeleton', 'Slide', 'Structure', 'Surgeon', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'Treatment outcome', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'bone', 'clinical practice', 'craniomaxillofacial', 'design', 'improved', 'learning network', 'orthognathic', 'personalized care', 'prevent', 'psychologic', 'risk minimization', 'skeletal', 'soft tissue', 'success', 'surgery outcome', 'treatment planning', 'virtual surgery']",NIDCR,METHODIST HOSPITAL RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2020,682604,0.004332181813155213
"Quantifying Compliance to the New 2017 Hypertension Treatment Guidelines and Investigating the Association Between Guideline Compliance and Patients' Trajectory of Blood Pressure Project Summary/Abstract Blood pressure (BP) of ³140/90 mm Hg doubles the risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and the total cost of hypertension reaches as high as $51 billion per year. Despite the enormous risk and cost associated with hypertension, less than half (48.3%) of hypertensive patients have a controlled blood pressure (BP) in the United States. Clinical trials demonstrated that a high rate of BP control (up to 85%) can be achieved with currently available therapies and strictly following recommended treatment protocols. This suggests that a higher proportion of uncontrolled BP could be explained by less aggressive treatment, poorer follow-up, and use of fewer or less effective drugs. The 2017 guideline for high BP management was recently published and lowered the threshold for the initiation of medication and definition of uncontrolled BP to BP ≥130/80 mm Hg (from 140/90) for patients with CVD or higher risk of CVD. This challenges physicians to change their traditional hypertension management and could worsen the already low rate of compliance (range 25-65%) to hypertension treatment guidelines. Furthermore, conclusions from previous studies regarding compliance to older hypertension treatment guidelines were compromised due to failure to evaluate multiple aspects of hypertension care, such as comorbidities, follow-up and laboratory assessments; and use of subjective assessment such as physician self-report. The wide-spread adoption of electronic health record (EHR) technology and the vital patient information present in EHR data provide an exceptional opportunity to objectively evaluate several aspects of hypertension care, such as medications prescribed, laboratory procedures ordered, BP level achieved, follow-up monitoring examinations, demographic and comorbid information. We, therefore, propose to use the Northwestern Medicine Enterprise Data Warehouse (NMEDW) – an integrated EHR database of health information from 2.9 million patients to 1) assess compliance to the 2017 hypertension management guidelines for 5 years since its release (2018-2022); 2) investigate whether patient’s age, race, body mass index, history of diabetes, CVD, chronic kidney disease, medication adherence, presence of health insurance and regular physician, and physican speciality predict level of compliance to the new treatment guideline; and 3) examine the association between level of compliance to the 2017 hypertension treatment guidelines and prospective patient BP trajectory over 5 years (2019-2023). Newly diagnosed hypertensive patients’ demographics, BP, medications, lab results, follow-up visit, and comorbid conditions will be assessed from the NMEDW and will be compared to criteria developed based on the 2017 hypertension treatment guidelines to quantify compliance to the guideline. The proposed study provides the candidate an opportunity to learn EHR data-mining skills to assess association between compliance to the new hypertension treatment guideline and patient BP trajectory and to identify predictors of this compliance, as a first step, in designing future targeted interventions to enhance guideline compliance and BP control. Project Narrative The 2017 hypertension treatment guideline lowered the threshold for the initiation of hypertensive medication and definition of uncontrolled blood pressure (BP) to BP ≥130/80 mm Hg (from ≥140/90). This could worsen the already low rate of compliance (25-65%) to treatment guidelines. In this study, we will evaluate physician compliance to the 2017 hypertension treatment guideline and its association with patient BP using electronic health record data that comprises information on several aspects of hypertension care. Findings of this study will help in designing future targeted interventions to enhance compliance to treatment guideline and BP control.",Quantifying Compliance to the New 2017 Hypertension Treatment Guidelines and Investigating the Association Between Guideline Compliance and Patients' Trajectory of Blood Pressure,9870519,K01HL145345,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Adverse drug effect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Blood Pressure', 'Body mass index', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Caring', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diastolic blood pressure', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'E-learning', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiology', 'Failure', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Insurance', 'Hypertension', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Procedures', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Minority', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Obesity', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Provider', 'Publishing', 'Race', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Titrations', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States', 'Visit', 'aggressive therapy', 'base', 'blood pressure medication', 'blood pressure regulation', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'comorbidity', 'computerized', 'cost', 'data mining', 'data warehouse', 'demographics', 'design', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'hypertension control', 'hypertension treatment', 'improved', 'medication compliance', 'phenotyping algorithm', 'prospective', 'skills', 'treatment guidelines']",NHLBI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,K01,2020,120966,-0.03441805557488013
"Long non-coding RNA signatures to track treatment responses in multiple sclerosis ABSTRACT  Early detection of multiple sclerosis is key to limiting neurological damage but monitoring patient progression and response to therapy is of arguably similar if not greater importance due to the chronic nature of disease. Moreover, rates of non-adherence to therapy has been reported to be as high as 25% to 40% in the patient population suggesting the need to provide continuous monitoring and selection of optimal therapy. Identification of novel actionable biomarkers would provide clinicians with additional information for the purposes of diagnosis, prognosis, clinical subtyping as well as for the selection and monitoring of therapy. Initiation of sub-optimal therapy can be both detrimental to the patient’s health and financial well-being.  To date, the general approach to selecting a disease modifying treatment (DMT) is to weigh the risks and benefits while considering the aggressiveness of disease, efficacy of the drug and the potential side effects of treatment in a “trial and error” fashion. This approach is quite unsettling when understanding that treatment failure or inadequacy can cause irreversible neurological damage. Furthermore, many of these drugs are associated with serious adverse drug reactions such as cardiac events, opportunistic infections and secondary autoimmunity. Selection of the best therapy for a particular patient as well as the ability to identify if/when efficacy of a particular DMT dwindles is highly desirable and would be of great benefit throughout the healthcare spectrum. The course of MS disease does not manifest identically in all patients nor do all patients respond to treatment the same way. Identification of actionable biomarkers to serve as a surrogate for the efficacy of a particular therapy would allow clinicians to identify nonresponsive patients as early as possible and potentially evaluate dosing or administration to optimize patient outcomes.  Our previous work has explored lncRNAs as candidate biomarkers that can be measured in peripheral whole blood to accurately classify MS. The preliminary data provided in support of our fast track application highlights the potential for lncRNA expression levels analyzed with machine learning to not only classify MS but also indicate treatment responses. The emerging view by specialists that take care of patients with autoimmune diseases is that early diagnosis and early, aggressive and effective therapy is critical to produce the best long-term outcomes. This is very evident for multiple sclerosis with the goal of reducing damage to the central nervous system, producing longer and better disease remission, and mitigating long-term disability. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are newly discovered classes of RNAs with an array of regulatory functions. Our hypothesis to test is that classifiers can be built based upon differential expression of novel lncRNAs in blood. These classifiers will possess high levels of accuracy to monitor treatment responses in multiple sclerosis.",Long non-coding RNA signatures to track treatment responses in multiple sclerosis,10088013,R44AI145505,"['Adopted', 'Advocate', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmunity', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Cardiac', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Dose', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Europe', 'Event', 'Evoked Potentials', 'Exhibits', 'Expressed Sequence Tags', 'Expression Profiling', 'Face', 'Foundations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Human', 'Inflammatory', 'Invertebrates', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Messenger RNA', 'Monitor', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Nature', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurologist', 'Oligoclonal Bands', 'Opportunistic Infections', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Probability', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Site', 'Specialist', 'Spinal Cord', 'Suggestion', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment Failure', 'Treatment Side Effects', 'United States', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Vertebrates', 'Whole Blood', 'Work', 'adverse drug reaction', 'aggressive therapy', 'base', 'brain health', 'candidate marker', 'cell type', 'clinical subtypes', 'cohort', 'cost', 'differential expression', 'disability', 'disorder control', 'drug efficacy', 'effective therapy', 'experimental group', 'health organization', 'human disease', 'learning classifier', 'multiple sclerosis patient', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'outcome forecast', 'patient population', 'phase 2 study', 'preservation', 'response', 'treatment response']",NIAID,"IQUITY LABS, INC",R44,2020,499995,-0.03089072103408239
"Advanced Heart Failure: Epidemiology and Outcomes PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Advanced heart failure is characterized by progressive debilitating symptoms and repeated hospitalizations that degrade quality of life. There is no one criterion to diagnose advanced heart failure; the definition is complex and challenging to apply broadly to populations. As such, our knowledge of advanced heart failure is truncated and skewed as it is based on information from referral populations and convenience samples. Enhancing our understanding of the epidemiology, experiences, and outcomes of patients with advanced heart failure is critical to developing interventions to improve care and quality of life. To address these gaps in knowledge, this proposal leverages diverse data sources and novel applications of quantitative and qualitative methods to assess the epidemiology and outcomes of individuals with advanced heart failure. In Aim 1, we will apply an advanced heart failure definition to a geographically-defined population of individuals with heart failure under the auspices of the Rochester Epidemiology Project. We will determine the prevalence of advanced heart failure, examine the demographic and clinical features of the population, and evaluate the timing of its development and association with risk of outcomes. In Aim 2, we will use machine learning techniques to develop computer algorithms (computable phenotypes) to identify patients with advanced heart failure using electronic health record data. We will then leverage the infrastructure of the National Patient- Centered Clinical Research Network (PCORnet) to validate the performance of the computable phenotypes across diverse patient populations. This will enable the accurate and efficient identification of advanced HF for future applications. In Aim 3, we will use the computable phenotype developed in Aim 2 to prospectively identify individuals living with advanced HF. We will then assess their treatment and illness burdens using a combination of surveys and semi-structured qualitative interviews. This information will be used to inform the development of a palliative care intervention that is tailored to the needs of patients with advanced HF. We will assess the acceptability of the tailored palliative care intervention to stakeholders (patients, caregivers, clinicians). The results of these analyses will provide synergistic information to clarify the epidemiology, case mix, burdens, and outcomes of individuals with advanced heart failure. They will provide a prototype palliative care intervention tailored to decrease burden and improve quality of life in advanced heart failure. Finally, the computable phenotype developed can be used to identify patients with advanced HF for future quality improvement programs, observational studies, and interventional research. PROJECT NARRATIVE Some patients with heart failure (HF) develop end-stage, refractory disease (advanced HF), characterized by progressive debilitating HF symptoms that interfere with daily life. However, our knowledge of the epidemiology and impact of advanced HF is severely limited because the definition is complex and challenging to apply broadly to diverse populations. In this study, we will evaluate the epidemiology and outcomes of advanced HF in a geographically-defined population, develop computer algorithms that can accurately and efficiently identify advanced HF, and assess the burdens and experiences of patients living with advanced HF to enable the design of new interventions to improve care and quality of life.",Advanced Heart Failure: Epidemiology and Outcomes,9994364,R01HL144529,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Affect', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Case Mixes', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Family', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart Transplantation', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Infusion procedures', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial dysfunction', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Palliative Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Prevalence', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Applications Research', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Quality of life', 'Recurrence', 'Refractory', 'Refractory Disease', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Underserved Population', 'United States', 'Ventricular Function', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cohort', 'computable phenotypes', 'design', 'disabling symptom', 'diverse data', 'end of life care', 'experience', 'functional disability', 'health care disparity', 'high risk', 'hospice environment', 'improved', 'mortality', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'palliative', 'patient oriented', 'patient population', 'population based', 'programs', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'rural setting']",NHLBI,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2020,746610,0.021927777196643305
"Molecular characterization of pulmonary edema: a window to an injured lung Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a heterogeneous, life-threatening condition defined by poor oxygenation and bilateral pulmonary edema that carries a mortality rate >40% in most studies. Every ARDS drug trial to date has failed, perhaps because the clinical criteria defining ARDS include a substantial subset of low-risk patients. Clinical scoring systems poorly predict which ARDS patients will develop prolonged respiratory failure and are at increased risk of death.  Molecular profiling of pulmonary edema fluid could serve as a window on the alveolar microenvironment, enabling identification of high-risk patients. Pulmonary edema directly reflects lung pathobiology including loss of barrier integrity, inflammation, and epithelial damage. Unfortunately, free-flowing pulmonary edema has limited clinical utility because it can only be captured in a minority of patients. Molecular characterization of pulmonary edema is now possible in every patient with ARDS because of two critical innovations. First, we discovered that edema fluid condensing in the HME (heat and moisture exchanger) filter of the ventilator circuit, usually discarded as trash, closely reflects free-flowing edema. Second, we developed a non-targeted metabolomic fingerprinting method using mass spectroscopy that characterizes molecular components in trace quantities of fluid. Together, these innovations make it possible to test the central hypothesis that molecular features of edema fluid reflect pathobiology and enable ARDS risk stratification.  To address the prognostic enrichment potential of HME edema fluid, 300 early ARDS patients will be recruited at 3 US centers, with protocolized HME edema fluid collection. Aim 1 is to study whether high HME edema fluid total protein and lung-injury specific proteins predict prolonged respiratory failure ≥48h in ARDS. Aim 2 is to test whether hypermetabolic edema fluid and inflammatory lipids predict prolonged respiratory failure ≥48h in ARDS. In Aim 3, LASSO machine learning will be used to integrate all proteomic and metabolomic edema features into a prolonged mechanical ventilation classifier. The robustness of the classifier will be assessed by measuring whether it adds prognostic value to clinical ARDS severity scores, identifying how well key molecular features are reflected in plasma, and testing for replication in an independent cohort.  The goal of these studies is to examine to what extent a novel and readily available lung-specific sample, obtained early in the course of ARDS, reflects biology and can predict ARDS outcomes, thus offering prognostic enrichment for future clinical trials. Successful completion of the Specific Aims offers the potential for a much-needed classification scheme to better refine, understand, and therapeutically-target ARDS. PROJECT NARRATIVE Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is a common, life-threatening condition with no approved drug treatments. Pulmonary edema is a cardinal feature of ARDS and is mirrored closely by edema fluid collected passively in the Heat Moisture Exchanger (HME) filter; thus HME filter edema provides a novel and completely non-invasive window to the alveolar microenvironment. This proposal seeks to understand whether molecular characteristics of HME filter edema predict prolonged respiratory failure and could facilitate enrollment of high-risk patients into ARDS clinical trials.",Molecular characterization of pulmonary edema: a window to an injured lung,9945838,R01HL152083,"['Address', 'Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Alveolar', 'Bilateral', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Bronchoscopy', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Classification Scheme', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Edema', 'Electrons', 'Enrollment', 'Epithelial', 'Epithelium', 'Failure', 'Fingerprint', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Informatics', 'Intensive Care', 'Life', 'Lipids', 'Liquid substance', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measures', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Protocols documentation', 'Pulmonary Edema', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiratory Failure', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Ventilator', 'alveolar epithelium', 'cohort', 'effective therapy', 'epithelial injury', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'ionization', 'lung injury', 'metabolomics', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'peripheral blood', 'primary outcome', 'prognostic', 'prognostic value', 'prospective', 'protein metabolite', 'receptor for advanced glycation endproducts', 'recruit', 'secondary outcome', 'therapeutic target', 'treatment strategy']",NHLBI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,575013,-0.03900062929511687
"A Virtual Coach to Enhance Surgical Training using Human-Centric Modeling and Adaptive Haptic Guidance PROJECT SUMMARY We aim to reduce surgical robotic errors by developing novel technology to coach experienced practitioners by using real-time data-driven predictive models of operator behavior, task difﬁculty, and expertise levels during complex surgical training tasks. This technology could increase the effectiveness of simulation-based training, particularly for practicing clinicians, as the predictive models will inform the design of adaptive and personalized feedback for the surgeon.  Surgical training typically involves didactic learning, skills labs, and practice on live patients. Safety concerns asso- ciated with training on patients has led to signiﬁcant developments in simulation-based technology; however, existing simulators may lack the ability promote mastery of skills for practicing providers. Improved training is important for both the provider and the patient. An estimated 100,000 death per year occur due to preventable medical errors. In robotic surgeries, the majority of patient injuries can be attributed to inexperience and lack of technical competence of the attending surgeon. These errors could potentially be avoided through personalized and adaptive coaching.  In general, robotic systems can sense and adapt to their environment, even act autonomously to complete a task. However, the majority of surgical robots used today are “teleoperated systems"". These systems only perform tasks directly commanded by the human operator, possibly with some scaling or tremor cancellation. There is a missed opportunity to leverage the intelligence of robotic systems to sense and interpret the movements of the surgeon and to enable some form of adaptive feedback for personalized coaching. Our prior work in human-centric modeling could hold the key to the technical challenge of integrating intelligent methods into existing surgical robotic training platforms by better understanding the technical strengths and weaknesses of the practicing surgeon in a data-driven manner.  The long-term goal of this project is to improve surgical training outcomes by developing a personalized and adaptive surgical robotic coach capable of providing meaningful feedback to the practicing provider to optimize learning and skill transfer. The speciﬁc aims of the proposal include: (1) evaluate the ability of human- centric models to characterize surgeon performance using motion and video data, (2) design adaptive haptic or visual guidance cues to provide learners with real-time feedback and to optimize learning, and (3) evaluate the effectiveness of the adaptive technology coach through end-user validation using procedural-speciﬁc training models for general surgery, urology, and gynecologic oncology. This project could signiﬁcantly improve provider training in robotic surgery. The project could also improve provider training for laparoscopic and open surgery as the models used to develop the virtual coach are inherently human-centric and not tied to any speciﬁc surgical tasks or surgical platforms.  Our team is uniquely positioned to achieve success in this project, bringing together experts in surgical robotics, human-centric modeling, machine learning, and advanced surgical training. We have conducted extensive preliminary studies in areas related to this proposal, supporting feasibility of this project. Our integration with the Simulation Center at UTSW will enable translation of successful outcomes of this project into the surgical training and retraining pipeline. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Human-generated, preventable errors, particularly those made intra-operatively, can lead to morbidity and mortality for the patient and high costs for the hospital.

"Inconspicuous Daily Monitoring to Reduce Heart Failure Hospitalizations Project Summary/Abstract In-home monitoring technologies have the potential to transform the healthcare system by enabling the transition from reactive care to proactive and preventive care. This is especially important for cardiovascular disease (CVD); the leading cause of death worldwide. Heart failure (HF), a type of CVD characterized by a weakened heart muscle, impacts approximately 6.5 million Americans with over 960,000 new cases each year. HF costs the US an estimated $30.7 billion annually and is expected to increase 127% to $69.7 billion by 2030. With approximately 80% of the total cost associated with HF due to hospitalization, there is an opportunity to reduce the cost of HF by lowering hospitalization rates through remote patient monitoring. Since patient awareness of symptomology often lags deterioration, successfully tracking physiologic changes in the home is a critical component of an early intervention strategy. Classical approaches to in-home monitoring, such as blood pressure and weight monitoring have had limited success, with patient adherence cited as major barrier to reducing hospitalizations. The central hypothesis of this research is that hospitalization rates and duration of stay for heart failure patients can be significantly reduced through inconspicuous in-home monitoring and early intervention. This research will leverage a highly innovative technology for cardiovascular in-home daily monitoring; the fully integrated toilet seat (FIT). The FIT seat automatically captures a comprehensive cardiovascular assessment in the home, while ensuring long-term patient adherence. A multidisciplinary research team, comprised of engineers, physicians, advanced practice providers (APP), data scientists, biostatisticians, designers, and software developers, will advance an automated system that provides health care providers with early warning of patient deterioration using the FIT system measurements captured in the home. The success of this system will be evaluated through an in-home clinical trial of heart failure patients. Specific Aim 1 seeks to create a learning dataset and data visualization architecture from HF patient in-home physiologic data, perceived wellness, and adverse events. The FIT seat will be deployed for a 90-day in-home study of 200 HF patients, with patient perceived wellness and activity captured through a custom application. This physiologic, wellness, and activity data will be combined with adverse events from the electronic medical record to create an integrated dataset for retrospective analysis and alert model development. In Aim 2, an automated prediction model for early alert of all-cause hospitalizations will be created using novel machine learning techniques. The objective of Aim 3 is to demonstrate that inconspicuous in-home monitoring and early intervention can reduce hospitalizations in a second cohort of 200 HF patients. We hypothesize that the integrated FIT-based alert system will reduce the burden of all-cause hospitalization and will improve the quality of life for patients.

"Automated detection and prediction of atrial fibrillation during sepsis 7. ABSTRACT / PROJECT SUMMARY We propose the “Automated detection and prediction of atrial fibrillation during sepsis” study to develop automated technologies capable of accurate atrial fibrillation (AF) detection and prediction during sepsis. Sepsis is a life-threatening, dysregulated response to infection and the most common illness leading to hospitalization in the United States, affecting ~1 million Americans yearly, and is associated with 50% of all hospital deaths. With the exception early antibiotic and fluid use, few therapies improve outcomes among septic patients; new treatment strategies are greatly needed to improve survival. New-onset AF is a common dysrhythmia among critically ill patients with sepsis, affecting up to 1 in 3 septic patients and conferring increased short- and long-term risks stroke, heart failure, and death. Prevention of AF or its complications may improve sepsis outcomes by reducing AF-related morbidity and mortality. Although several evidence-based treatments have shown efficacy in treating and preventing AF in certain high-risk subgroups (e.g., AF prevention following cardiac surgery), studying application of these therapies among critically ill patients with sepsis has been hampered by two major factors: 1) we lack validated automated mechanisms to detect AF and facilitate real-world AF research in large clinical databases, and 2) we cannot presently predict which patients with sepsis will develop AF. Our project will leverage the unique resources of the recently released Multiparameter Intelligent Monitoring in Intensive Care (MIMIC III) database. MIMIC III links continuous ECG and pulse plethysmographic waveforms to a wealth of time-varying clinical and hemodynamic data. Our project will develop and validate state-of-the art automated AF detection algorithms using waveform data from critically ill patients. Automated AF detection would enable expedited clinical treatment of AF, identification of subclinical AF, and will catalyze the study of AF in emerging electronic health record waveform databases. We will develop innovative automated AF prediction capabilities using state-of-the-art waveform analysis algorithms and machine learning methods in critically ill patients. Automated algorithms that identify patients at high risk for developing AF in the near-term would enable targeting of preventative therapies and potentially usher in a new era of AF prevention for critically ill patients. AF prevention and treatment facilitated through our project will allow targeting of novel, AF-based mechanisms of poor outcomes during and following sepsis. 8. Project Narrative Sepsis is a dysregulated response to infection that causes life-threatening organ dysfunction that affects nearly 1 million Americans each year. Atrial fibrillation is a form of cardiac dysfunction that occurs during sepsis characterized by abnormal heart rhythm, loss of normal atrial contraction, rapid heart rates, heart failure, shock and increased risk for stroke. Our proposal seeks to develop automated methods for the detection and prediction of atrial fibrillation during sepsis, methods that will enhance our future ability to prevent and treat atrial fibrillation to avoid its life-threatening consequences.",Automated detection and prediction of atrial fibrillation during sepsis,9910440,R01HL136660,"['Affect', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Antibiotics', 'Arrhythmia', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Big Data', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Surgery procedures', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Complication', 'Computer Assisted', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electrolytes', 'Electromagnetics', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Heart Abnormalities', 'Heart Atrium', 'Heart Rate', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Infection', 'Intelligence', 'Intensive Care', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Myocardial dysfunction', 'Noise', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Prevention', 'Preventive therapy', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sepsis', 'Shock', 'Stroke', 'Stroke Volume', 'Subgroup', 'Technology', 'Telemetry', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'clinical database', 'clinical predictors', 'comorbidity', 'data warehouse', 'electronic data', 'heart rhythm', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'novel', 'portability', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive signature', 'prevent', 'response', 'septic patients', 'stroke risk', 'therapeutic target', 'time use', 'tool', 'treatment strategy']",NHLBI,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,R01,2020,535600,0.004906682862551036
"Biomarkers of Alcoholic Hepatitis Abstract Our overarching goal is to develop minimally invasive approaches to better predict outcome and novel mechanisms in alcoholic hepatitis (AH). AH is characterized by acute hepatic decompensation and multiple organ failure. Although supportive care for AH has improved, short-term mortality has largely remained unchanged (30-40%) for decades. Effective approaches to predict risk hamper the treatment of AH. The hepatic extracellular matrix (ECM) responds dynamically to organ injury and ECM turnover increases; we propose to take advantage of this to develop new biomarkers for AH. The peptidome, low molecular weight peptides in biologic fluids, includes not only synthesized peptides, but fragments of degraded proteins (i.e., ‘degradome’). We hypothesize that the ECM degradome in plasma will yield new biomarkers to predict outcome and mechanisms in AH. We will test this hypothesis via the following Specific Aims: 1). To identify key changes in the peptidome as predictive biomarkers of outcome in AH. Unbiased peptidomics and multivariate analyses will identify degradomic features independently linked to prognosis. Protease activity that could produce significantly changed peptides will be predicted using Proteasix. We will also determine the mechanistic role of ECM turnover in the in parallel established models of alcohol-induced liver injury. 2) To develop probabilistic graphical models to predict outcome in AH. Whereas we expect the results of Aim 1 to establish that the peptidome profile in patients correlates with overall outcome, biomarkers alone are often insufficient to accurately predict individual patient outcome. We will therefore employ machine learning methods like probabilistic graphical models (PGMs) over mixed data types to integrate peptidomic and individual patient clinical data, into a single probabilistic graphical framework. The resulting graphs will then be used to infer causal interactions between variables, select informative biomarkers that will more specifically predict the outcome, and gain new mechanistic insight into the biology of AH (hypothesis generation). 3) To validate the use of the peptidome as a predictive tool for determining outcome in AH. Using a large prospectively-designed patient cohort with established outcomes, we will test the ability of the algorithms and biomarkers generated in this study to predict outcome. The successful completion of the proposed work will produce significant results at various levels: (1) Biomarker discovery: we will identify biomarkers and conditional biomarkers for AH prognosis. (2) Mechanistic understanding of AH: our models will generate hypotheses about the interactions between variables at different scales (molecular, individual) that will provide insights on the proteins that are involved in AH. (3) Algorithm development: through this project we will extend our mixed data graph learning algorithms to include censored variables (i.e., survival data). As a result of the above, this project is likely to yield novel diagnostic tools for AH that may also translate to other liver diseases. Narrative Alcoholic hepatitis (AH) is a severe acute form of alcoholic liver disease with a very high mortality rate. Despite years of research, the standard-of-care and mortality rate has not changed dramatically in over 50 years. Our goal is to develop new computational and experimental methods and discover new biomarkers for AH outcome that can efficiently identify at-risk individuals. A second goal of the project is to identify molecular mechanisms of AH, which could be targeted therapeutically.",Biomarkers of Alcoholic Hepatitis,9995661,R01AA028436,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Alcoholic Hepatitis', 'Alcoholic Liver Diseases', 'Alcohols', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Cells', 'Clinical Data', 'Collagen', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Extracellular Matrix Proteins', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Health', 'Hepatic', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Injury', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Liver Fibrosis', 'Liver diseases', 'Matrix Metalloproteinases', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Weight', 'Multiple Organ Failure', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Peptide Fragments', 'Peptide Hydrolases', 'Peptides', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Process', 'Production', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Protease Inhibitor', 'Protein Fragment', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Supportive care', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Work', 'acute liver injury', 'algorithm development', 'biomarker discovery', 'chronic alcohol ingestion', 'cohort', 'design', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'interest', 'learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'minimally invasive', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'organ injury', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'predictive marker', 'predictive tools', 'profiles in patients', 'prospective', 'standard of care', 'targeted treatment', 'tool']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2020,615104,-0.003818856621056173
"Predictive Personalized Public Health (P3H): A Novel Paradigm to Treat Infectious Disease Challenge, Innovation and Impact: In recent years, we have demonstrated that it is feasible to predict epidemic disease outbreaks from retrospective seasonal and geographical case data and to show that we can take climate factors into account in our predictive models. We are moving closer to real-time prediction at the population level. But we have never used prediction at point-of-care for treating the individual patient.  Presently, personalized medicine uses delayed results of laboratory testing of individuals. For infectious disease, most of such testing has targeted the pathogen in the host-pathogen interaction. The role of laboratory testing is to modify therapy after a variable period of time delay. Personalized medicine today is reactive. Complicating matters further, many infectious epidemic diseases are strongly dependent on environmental factors and climate. Lastly, we want to name the pathogens we are fighting, but we really need to know the resistance characteristics to select therapy for patients effectively. Both speciation and resistance can now be determined from molecular data, which can be integrated into point-of-care treatment predictions.  We here propose a radically different approach to the treatment of infectious diseases. Our hypothesis is that the alternative to time-delayed and expensive laboratory analysis of specimens from individual patients, is to use predictive modeling to forecast point-of-care treatment. Time-delayed personalized testing can be conducted as surveillance, and that data used for real-time prediction to guide point-of-care treatment.  We will introduce predictive personalized public health (P3H) policy at the individual patient level, with the potential to substantially improve patient outcomes compared with our present reactive approaches. Our key rationale is to expand population infectious disease predictive modeling in order to achieve prediction for treatment at point-of-care. Our primary insight is that we can reposition the delayed reactive personalized testing from the urgent medical decision-making process, and into a predictive modeling framework. The gaps and opportunities in technology that we will address are four-fold. First, we will employ individual case geospatial mapping at a fine scale to take into account infection spread and environmental factors. Second, our ability to perform pan-microbial analysis using molecular techniques is now feasible. Third, modeling our novel fusion of data has no simple low-dimensional solution – but machine learning technologies are now capable of handling such big data assimilation, model discovery and prediction. Fourth, our proposal is not an academic exercise. We have a partnership with the economic planners within a developing country to design and implement our new methods. We will prospectively tune and validate our algorithms in real-time. Our deliverable will be an open-source framework ready for clinical trials testing and adaptation to the public health infrastructure in any country. Project Narrative We have made substantial progress in our abilities to track and predict infectious disease epidemics at the population level, but prediction has never been used at the individual level to guide treatment at point-of-care. The individual treatment for all infectious disease syndromes at point-of-care is presently empirical, because laboratory testing is reactive and time delayed. We here propose a novel framework to use rigorous prediction strategies to guide point-of-care treatment for infectious diseases, and to validate this approach under real-world conditions.",Predictive Personalized Public Health (P3H): A Novel Paradigm to Treat Infectious Disease,10006784,R01AI145057,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Antigens', 'Assimilations', 'Bacterial Meningitis', 'Bacteriology', 'Big Data', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Cholera', 'Climate', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complex', 'Country', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Developed Countries', 'Developing Countries', 'Diagnostic', 'Diarrhea', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Economics', 'Engineering', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemic', 'Equilibrium', 'Exanthema', 'Exercise', 'Fever', 'Frequencies', 'Genus staphylococcus', 'Geography', 'HIV', 'Hand', 'Health Policy', 'Hospitals', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infection', 'Infrastructure', 'Investments', 'Laboratories', 'Leadership', 'Leptospirosis', 'Machine Learning', 'Malaria', 'Measles', 'Medical', 'Medical emergency', 'Melioidosis', 'Meningitis', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Names', 'Newborn Infant', 'Paralysed', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Preventive', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Reaction', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sepsis', 'Specimen', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Uganda', 'Work', 'acute infection', 'antimicrobial', 'authority', 'climate data', 'cost', 'cost outcomes', 'data fusion', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'fighting', 'flu', 'global health', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'infectious disease model', 'infectious disease treatment', 'innovation', 'insight', 'microbial', 'mortality', 'neonatal infection', 'novel', 'open source', 'pathogen', 'personalized medicine', 'personalized predictions', 'point of care', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'resistance gene', 'spreading factor', 'surveillance data']",NIAID,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIV HERSHEY MED CTR,R01,2020,1627982,-0.005601090842643359
"Development of personalized ex vivo predictive technology for rapidly matching patient tumors with chemotherapy regimens before treatment. Project Summary/Abstract Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is among the deadliest cancers with <9% five-year survival rate and an estimated 60,000 deaths/year by 2030. PDAC is often diagnosed at an advanced stage thereby precluding surgical resection for most patients. While new systemic therapy regimens have improved survival, availability of multiple options, without tools to select an optimal regimen from these (on an individualized basis), has created a frustrating paradox in clinical decision-making. Due to a lack of personalized predictive tools, current standard of care treatment strategy is based on prognostic factors such as age, stage, performance status, serum albumin, etc. There is a critical, urgent and unmet need to develop predictive tools that can identify optimal systemic therapy regimens and eliminate from consideration ineffective options, on an individualized basis, to improve quality of life and reduce overtreatment. CerFlux, Inc. is developing such predictive technology with its low-cost and rapid Personalized Oncology Efficacy Test (POET) to match each patient with the right treatment – before treatment – to transform pancreatic cancer treatment in the near-term and make a difference in the lives of patients and providers around the world. Our personalized medicine approach is unique and further enhanced by a commercial-academic collaboration between CerFlux, Inc. and the O’Neil Comprehensive Cancer Center at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. The proposed project will build on recent work by our team including a patented (US 10,114,010B1) biomimetic in vitro platform for pharmacological transport and pancreatic microtissue tumor models. The commercial goal of this proposal is to identify best practices for using POET in personalized therapy. Our hypothesis is that response to treatment observed in POET will approximate the response in the corresponding patient. Our objective is to predict both effective and ineffective treatments for each patient prior to initiating treatment. We propose the following aims to achieve our objective: Aim 1: Calibrate and optimize POET for evaluating therapeutics using human PDAC cell-line xenografts for subsequent testing with patient tissue. Aim 2: Evaluate efficacy of various systemic therapy agents in POET on an individualized basis to establish protocols and best practices for using POET in personalized therapy. We envision substantial continuing commercial-academic collaboration between CerFlux, Inc. and the O’Neil Comprehensive Cancer Center at the University of Alabama at Birmingham including the integration of machine learning to derive a “POET Score” – a personalized quantitative efficacy score – based on a combination of factors. Data from POET and the POET Score will help clinical teams rank treatments for individual patients before the first drug infusion. If successful, this SBIR-driven study has the potential to transform pancreatic cancer treatment in the near-term and make a positive impact around the world.

"An Unobtrusive Continuous Cuff-less Blood Pressure Monitor for Nocturnal Hypertension PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The objective of this project is to create an unobtrusive, wrist-worn, cuff-less blood pressure monitor for measurement and identification of nocturnal nondipping hypertension. The investigation includes extensive validation with state-of-the-art ambulatory blood pressure monitors at nighttime in presence of heterogeneous treatment paradigms. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is one of the major causes of ailments worldwide. Hypertension alone affects one in three adults according to the World Health Organization. Therefore, monitoring blood pressure has become a critical part of healthcare as it is known to be linked to many CVDs. Traditionally, clinical practitioners have relied on the mercury-based (or digital equivalent) inflatable cuff-based sphygmomanometer. However, the nature of the device allows for only infrequent measurements and its somewhat invasive nature and associated discomfort prohibits additional nocturnal measurements. There is certainly a value to measuring blood pressure continuously in the natural context of the user’s environment, in particular during sleep, without being disturbed by the instrument. Our proposed technology can provide a wealth of information to physicians, help identify certain short-term dynamics/variations of blood pressure, and allow effective monitoring of response to medication, among other things. Nocturnal measurements provide additional prognostic value in identifying risk. Despite these benefits, no wearable, non-invasive device for continuous blood pressure monitoring exists on the market simply because none have been reliable enough to be considered clinical grade. This project aims to develop a robust and reliable blood pressure monitor in the form of a wrist-worn device that uses bio-impedance sensors, and for the first time, demonstrate clinical grade reliability. These sensors measure pulse wave velocity (PWV) along with several other derivatives for cardiovascular parameters including heart rate and blood volume changes in arteries, which correlate with the blood pressure. The system will incorporate clever hardware design to localize underlying vasculature and focus on arterial sites for enhanced accuracy. The device will include a motion sensor to take into account the user’s movements and motion artifacts, the contact quality, and reliability of the measurements. Advanced machine learning techniques, leveraging both general and personalized models, will be developed to convert bio-impedance measurements to blood pressure. This project aims to then validate the system and analytics in both a healthy patient cohort and a hypertensive cohort, learning the impact that nocturnal ‘nondipping’ hypertension and anti-hypertensive treatments have on PWV/other cardiovascular correlates and blood pressure estimates. After decades of relying on the inflatable cuff- based technique, this system could represent a significant change in how we measure blood pressure. PROJECT NARRATIVE Continuous monitoring of nocturnal blood pressure can help early diagnosis of developing cardiac conditions, reveal short term blood pressure variations, and also help the physician monitor differences in variations in response to medication for hypertensive patients. Moreover, the comfort and convenience of a wearable monitor would allow measurement in the natural context of daily life, including important nocturnal measurements, and reduce the burden of adherence on the user. The system will also provide feedback on quality of measurements to allow the users or care-givers to gauge reliability.",An Unobtrusive Continuous Cuff-less Blood Pressure Monitor for Nocturnal Hypertension,9998433,R01HL151240,"['Adherence', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring', 'Antihypertensive Agents', 'Arteries', 'Awareness', 'Biometry', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood Pressure Monitors', 'Blood Volume', 'Blood flow', 'Calibration', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caregivers', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Environment', 'FDA approved', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Rate', 'Home environment', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Investigation', 'Learning', 'Legal patent', 'Life', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mercury', 'Methods', 'Microfabrication', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Nature', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Participant', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Penetration', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiology', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Proxy', 'Reading', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Skin', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Deprivation', 'Sphygmomanometers', 'Structural Models', 'Supine Position', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'Wrist', 'advanced analytics', 'analytical method', 'arterial stiffness', 'base', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'design', 'digital', 'effectiveness validation', 'electric impedance', 'insight', 'instrument', 'model development', 'monitoring device', 'motion sensor', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'patient stratification', 'patient subsets', 'performance tests', 'prognostic value', 'response', 'sensor', 'sex', 'sleep position', 'supine sleep', 'wearable device', 'wearable sensor technology', 'willingness']",NHLBI,TEXAS ENGINEERING EXPERIMENT STATION,R01,2020,766675,-0.0018934425463600236
"Efficient Statistical Learning Methods for Personalized Medicine Using Large Scale Biomedical Data Project Summary/Abstract  Current medical treatment guidelines largely rely on data from randomized controlled trials that study  average effects, which may be inadequate for making individualized decisions for real-world patients. Large-scale electronic health records (EHRs) data provide unprecedented opportunities to optimize personalized treatment strategies and generate evidence relevant to real-world patients. However, there are inherent challenges in the use of EHRs, including non-experimental nature of data collection processes, heterogeneous data types with complex dependencies, irregular measurement patterns, multiple dynamic treatment sequences, and the need to balance risk and benefit of treatments. Using two high-quality EHR databases, Columbia University Medical Center's clinical data warehouse and the Indiana Network for Patient Care database, and focusing on type 2 diabetes (T2D), this proposal will develop novel and scalable statistical learning approaches that overcome these challenges to discover optimal personalized treatment strategies for T2D from real-world patients. Specifically, under Aim 1, we will develop a unified framework to learn latent temporal processes for feature extraction and dynamic patient records representation. Our approach will accommodate large-scale variables of mixed types (continuous, binary, counts) measured at irregular intervals. They extract lower-dimensional components to reflect patients' dynamic health status, account for informative healthcare documentation processes, and characterize similarities between patients. Under Aim 2, we will develop fast and efficient multi-category machine learning methods, in order to evaluate treatment propensities and adaptively learn optimal dynamic treatment regimens (DTRs) among the extensive number of treatment options observed in the EHRs. The methods will provide  sequential decisions that determine the best treatment sequence for a T2D patient given his/her EHRs. Under Aim 3, we will develop statistical learning methods to assist multi-faceted treatment decision-making, which balances risks versus benefits when evaluating a DTR. Our approach will ensure maximizing benefit to the greatest extent while controlling all risk outcomes under the safety margins. For all aims, we will develop efficient stochastic resampling algorithms to scale up the optimization for massive data sizes. We will identify optimal DTRs for T2D using the extracted information from patients' comorbidity conditions, medications, and laboratory tests, as well as records-collection processes. Our methodologies will be applied and cross-validated between the two EHR databases. The treatment strategies learned from the representative EHR databases with a diverse patient  population will be beneficial for individual patient care, assisting clinicians to adaptively choose the optimal treatment for a patient. Finally, we will disseminate our methods and results through freely available software and outreach to the informatics and clinical experts at our Centers for Translational Science and elsewhere. Project Narrative  This proposal aims to develop novel and scalable statistical learning methods to analyze electronic health records (EHRs) and use two real-world, high-quality EHR databases for personalized medicine research. The methods will handle the non-experimental nature of data collection processes, along with heterogeneous data types, dynamic treatment sequences, and the trade-off between benefit and risk outcomes.

We propose to identify alterations in the plasma metabolome of patients experiencing different levels of severity of COVID-19. Such changes should be pivotal in allowing the prediction of the severity of the patient COVID-19 symptoms and also provide mechanistic information about the disease and its progression. In addition to our expertise in metabolomics, we are able to carry out this project because we have access to samples from the Yale New Haven Hospital System via the IMPACT Biorepository. This repository stores human specimens related to emerging respiratory viral infections (with a particular focus on COVID-19) in order to support research on factors related to viral expression, transmission, disease severity, progression, and susceptibility. The directors of the biorepository are co-investigators in this supplement. As such, we are in unique position to perform this novel research because we have: (a) the infrastructure to conduct the metabolomic analyses and we have already developed the methodologies, (b) access to COVID-19 patient plasma samples stored at the IMPACT (Implementing medical and public health actions against coronavirus in Connecticut) Biorepository (and associated patient records), (c) assembled an extraordinary team that includes expertise in metabolomics, virology, pulmonary and infectious disease, and immunology. of this supplement current pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 is of major concern because (i) it is highly contagious, (ii) it a spectrum of adverse health consequences (collectively known as COVID-19) that range from mild symptoms (fever, chills, cough) to life-endangering pneumonia and SARS, and (iii) there is no effective or vaccine to prevent it. To date, the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has had devastating effects on public with an international mortality rate of 5.8% in infected individuals. As of June 6, 2020, the U.S. has cases and a mortality rate of 5.7%. Measures taken to stem the pandemic have paralyzed normal  activities and crippled national and international economies.

"Omniview tethered capsule for low cost, non-endoscopic Barrett's esophagus screening in unsedated patients Esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) is among the most lethal malignancies with a 19% five-year survival rate and its incidence has increased several fold in the last decades. Barrett’s esophagus (BE) confers elevated risk for progression to EAC. Patients diagnosed with BE undergo periodic surveillance endoscopy with biopsies to detect dysplasia which can be treated by endoscopic eradication with radiofrequency ablation before it progresses to EAC. However, the majority of diagnosed EAC patients have not had prior screening endoscopy and present with advanced lesions that limit treatment options and result in poorer survival. The development of a rapid, low cost, well tolerated, non-endoscopic BE screening technique that can be performed in unsedated patients at points of care outside the endoscopy suite would improve BE detection and reduce EAC morbidity and mortality. Our program is a multidisciplinary collaboration among investigators at the Massachusetts Institute Technology and Veteran Affairs Boston Healthcare System / Harvard Medical School that integrates novel optical imaging and software design, preclinical studies in swine, clinical studies in patients, and advanced image processing / machine learning. Aim 1 will develop an omniview tethered capsule technology that generates a map of the esophageal mucosa over a multi-centimeter length of esophagus and a series of wide angle forward views to aid navigation as the capsule is swallowed or retracted. The images will resemble endoscopic white light or narrow band imaging, but will not suffer from perspective distortion present in standard endoscopic or video capsule images. This will facilitate development of automated BE detection algorithms as well as enhance their sensitivity and specificity. This aim will also perform imaging studies in swine as a translational step toward clinical studies. Aim 2 will determine reader sensitivity and specificity for BE detection versus standard endoscopy / biopsy and prepare data for developing automated BE detection. Patients undergoing screening as well as with history of BE undergoing surveillance will be recruited and unsedated capsule imaging will be performed on the same day prior to their endoscopy. Sensitivity and specificity for detecting BE will be assessed using multiple blinded readers and data sets suitable for developing automated BE detection algorithms will be developed. Aim 3 will develop image analysis methods for automated BE detection by investigating classifiers that operate on handcrafted features (colors and textures) and modern deep convolutional neural network methods for direct classification. If successful, this program will develop a rapid, low cost and scalable method for BE screening that would not require patient sedation, endoscopy, or tissue acquisition, and which could be performed in community primary care clinics. The procedure would be much faster and many times lower cost than endoscopy. Automated BE detection would enable immediate results for patient consultation and referral to gastroenterology if indicated. Larger patient populations with expanded risk criteria could be cost effectively screened and access to screening dramatically improved, reducing EAC mortality. Esophageal adenocarcinoma is among the most lethal malignancies with a 19% five-year survival rate and its incidence has increased several fold in the last decades. The program proposes to develop an omniview tethered capsule technology, examination protocol, and automated analysis methods for low cost, rapid, well tolerated, and scalable screening in order to facilitate monitoring and timely treatment.

"Predictive Modeling of COVID-19 Progression in Older Patients The objective of this proposal is to develop a predictive model to identify individuals who are infected with SARS-CoV-2 and at risk of developing severe COVID-19. Louisiana has the 5th highest death rate per capita in the United States as of May 4th, 2020. Severe disease is seen in older individuals and those with underlying conditions. The New Orleans population is particularly susceptible to severe COVID-19 as hypertension, diabetes and obesity are rampant. After infection, acute lung injury caused by the virus must be repaired to regain lung function and avoid acute respiratory distress syndrome and pulmonary fibrosis. Mounting evidence suggests that patients with severe COVID-19 have cytokine storm syndrome, which may exacerbate multiorgan injury and risk of fibrotic complications. Lack of effective ways to identify and attenuate severe COVID-19 progression persist due to limited understanding of the biological pathways responsible for cytokine storm syndrome and increased risk in older patients. Therefore, there is a need to determine the critical cytokine profiles responsible for severe COVID-19 progression to develop effective treatments. Further, it is essential to find a way to stage disease trajectory(ies) to identify therapeutic targets with precision to attenuate disease progression and uncover preventive strategies. Towards this end, we seek to leverage a mathematical model of SARS-CoV-2-induced lung damage to predict severity of acute respiratory distress syndrome and pulmonary fibrosis by considering key cytokine-cell interactions. We hypothesize that the model will accurately predict quantitative changes in suites of key cytokines and matrix accumulation with varying COVID-19 progression within 10% accuracy. To accomplish this, we have assembled an investigative team at Tulane University with key expertise in virology, clinical infectious disease research, bioinformatics, and predictive mathematical models of tissue remodeling. In Aim 1 of the proposal, we will identify the critical cytokine markers linked to viral-induced lung damage and pulmonary fibrosis. This will be accomplished by leveraging machine learning to determine the biomarkers and molecular pathways characterizing progression of severe COVID-19 to focus model formulation. In Aim 2, we will predict the severity of COVID-19 in older patients. Model predictions will be compared to blood markers of COVID-19 disease in cohorts of older patients at different stages of disease progression. The model will be refined and informed by cytokine data to discern causal biological pathways and disease processes that can be tested and targeted. Our expected outcome is to have determined the critical cytokine interactions responsible for lung tissue damage and dictating pathways for varying disease trajectories in older patients. These results are expected to have an important impact as the proposed predictive model will open new avenues of research to rationally design pharmaceutical interventions for severe COVID-19 patients. Specifically, the study will provide a paradigm-shifting open-source tool to delineate target therapeutics, estimate their efficacy, and move towards development of patient-specific treatment plans for older individuals. Severe COVID-19 is seen in older individuals and those with underlying complications such as hypertension, diabetes and obesity. Lack of effective ways to identify and halt severe COVID-19 progression persists due to limited understanding of the biological pathways responsible for increased risk and cytokine storm syndrome. Towards this end, in this proposal we will test our hypothesis that a mathematical model informed by key patient- specific suites of cytokines is capable of predicting patient trajectories, which will provide a strong evidence- based proof of concept for future efforts to rationally design interventions for severe COVID-19 patients.",Predictive Modeling of COVID-19 Progression in Older Patients,10162283,P20GM103629,"['2019-nCoV', 'Acute Lung Injury', 'Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Attenuated', 'Autopsy', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'COVID-19', 'Cell Communication', 'Cessation of life', 'China', 'Cities', 'Clinical', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Death Rate', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Elderly', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Fibrosis', 'Formulation', 'Future', 'Hypertension', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infectious Diseases Research', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Louisiana', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Monitor', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Population Study', 'Prevention strategy', 'Process', 'Pulmonary Fibrosis', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Severities', 'Specimen', 'Structure of parenchyma of lung', 'Syndrome', 'Testing', 'Tissue Model', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Viral', 'Virus', 'base', 'biomarker identification', 'cell injury', 'cohort', 'coronavirus disease', 'cytokine', 'cytokine release syndrome', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'evidence base', 'extracellular', 'genetic predictors', 'individualized medicine', 'lung injury', 'mathematical model', 'molecular pathology', 'multiorgan injury', 'nonhuman primate', 'older patient', 'open source', 'pandemic disease', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'repaired', 'research study', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'virology', 'wound healing']",NIGMS,TULANE UNIVERSITY OF LOUISIANA,P20,2020,379884,-0.028484806315889125
"Multi-modal Health Information Technology Innovations for Precision Management of Glaucoma PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Glaucoma is the world's leading cause of irreversible blindness and will affect >110 million people by 2040. Early detection and treatment are critical, as symptoms typically do not present until the disease is advanced. A data-driven precision medicine approach is needed to better identify individuals who are at greatest risk of developing the disease and who are at greatest risk of progressing quickly to vision loss. While there has been considerable progress in eye imaging and testing to improve glaucoma monitoring, precision management of glaucoma is incomplete without accounting for patients' co-existing systemic conditions, concurrent systemic medications and treatments, and adherence with prescribed glaucoma treatment. Understanding how systemic conditions, and specifically vascular conditions such as hypertension, impact glaucoma presents growing public health importance given the increasing co-morbidities facing aging populations. Preliminary studies have demonstrated the predictive value of systemic data, even without ophthalmic endpoints. Similarly, measuring medication adherence is important for guiding patient counseling and engagement and avoiding downstream interventions such as surgeries, which carry high cost and morbidity. These factors are important for providing a more comprehensive perspective of glaucoma management and for improving patient outcomes, yet they are relatively understudied. I propose applying multi-modal advancements in health information technology (IT) to address these gaps and achieve the following specific aims: (1) Develop machine learning-based predictive models classifying patients at risk for glaucoma progression using systemic electronic health record (EHR) data from a diverse nationwide patient cohort; (2) evaluate how integrating blood pressure (BP) data from novel smartwatch-based home BP monitors enhance predictive models for risk stratification in glaucoma, and (3) measure glaucoma medication adherence using innovative flexible electronic sensors to validate their use for future interventions aimed at improving adherence and clinical outcomes in glaucoma. These studies would leverage state- of-the-art methods in big-data predictive modeling as well as cutting-edge advancements in sensor technologies. This multi-faceted approach will build a foundation for a health IT framework geared toward improving risk stratification and generating novel therapeutic targets for glaucoma patients. PROJECT NARRATIVE A precision medicine approach is critical for early detection and treatment of glaucoma, an insidious chronic eye disease that can lead to blindness and severely decreased quality of life. The relationship between systemic conditions and treatments with glaucoma progression, as well as methods for monitoring and promoting glaucoma medication adherence, represent areas of glaucoma management that are not well-understood and are thus critical opportunities for technology-driven interventions. This study proposes the development and application of multi- modal health information technology innovations – such as machine learning-based predictive modeling, massive electronic datasets, wearable devices, and flexible sensor electronics – to enhance understanding of glaucoma pathophysiology and identify new potential therapeutic strategies.",Multi-modal Health Information Technology Innovations for Precision Management of Glaucoma,10018290,DP5OD029610,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Aging', 'All of Us Research Program', 'Area', 'Award', 'Big Data', 'Blindness', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood Vessels', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Department chair', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronics', 'Ensure', 'Exhibits', 'Eye', 'Eye diseases', 'Eyedrops', 'Fellowship', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Glaucoma', 'Home Blood Pressure Monitoring', 'Home environment', 'Human Resources', 'Hypertension', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Latino', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Ophthalmologist', 'Ophthalmology', 'Optic Nerve', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physical activity', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Predictive Value', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Role', 'Sleep', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Track and Field', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vision', 'Visual Fields', 'Work', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'blood pressure regulation', 'circadian regulation', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'cost', 'data integration', 'early onset', 'electronic data', 'experience', 'faculty community', 'flexibility', 'health information technology', 'improved', 'innovation', 'medication compliance', 'multidisciplinary', 'multimodality', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'patient engagement', 'personalized management', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'professor', 'programs', 'racial minority', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'smart watch', 'treatment adherence', 'wearable device']",OD,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",DP5,2020,393957,-0.005024824095164701
"MINDS Imaging Ancillary Study Dramatic advances in management of congenital heart disease (CHD) have improved survival to adulthood from <10% in the 1960's to nearly 90% in the current era. With this shifting demographic, adult CHD (ACHD) patients now outnumber pediatric CHD patients.1 ACHD patients demonstrate domain-specific neurocognitive deficits such as impairment in executive function, associated with reduced quality of life that includes deficits in educational attainment and social interaction.2-7 These deficits are related to risk factors that can occur across the lifespan, including genetic abnormalities, cumulative hypoxic/ischemic injury, and, adult-onset atherosclerotic cerebrovascular disease. Our overarching hypothesis is that ACHD patients exhibit vascular brain injury and structural/physiological brain alterations that are predictive of specific neurocognitive deficits, including executive dysfunction, which are modified by behavioral and environmental enrichment proxies of CR (e.g., level of education and lifestyle/social habits). We propose an ancillary study to the NHLBI-funded Pediatric Heart Network (PHN) “Multi-Institutional Neurocognitive Discovery Study (MINDS) in Adult Congenital Heart Disease (ACHD).” We will leverage the MINDS-ACHD parent study data (i.e., NIH Toolbox neuropsychological battery/clinical data/biological samples) and our established neuroimaging harmonization, which we currently use for the PHN Single Ventricle Reconstruction (SVRIII) multi-center brain connectome study (R01-HL128818; PI-Panigrahy), to measure neuroimaging biomarkers in ACHD patients at the same PHN sites. Our specific aims are: Specific Aim #1 (brain injury): To determine if vascular-related brain injury (cortical infarcts, hemosiderin lesions, and white matter hyperintensity) is associated with specific neurocognitive deficits (e.g. NIH Toolbox total composite score) in ACHD patients. Specific Aim #2 (brain structure): To determine if reduced fronto-temporal cortical thickness and white matter connectivity are associated with specific neurocognitive deficits (e.g. NIH Toolbox frontal executive sub-score) in ACHD patients. Specific Aim #3 (brain physiology): To determine if reduced cerebrovascular reserve (regional cerebral blood flow/ resting BOLD imaging) is associated with specific neurocognitive deficits (e.g. NIH Toolbox crystallized composite score) in ACHD patients. Specific Aim #4 (cognitive reserve): To determine if the associations between neuroimaging biomarkers and neurocognitive outcomes in ACHD patients are modified by behavioral and environmental enrichment proxies of CR, using traditional statistical models and machine learning techniques. Given the paucity of multi-modal neuroimaging studies in ACHD, our proposed study addresses a major knowledge gap in the ACHD population by providing insight into the mechanism underlying impaired neurocognitive outcomes. Our study will provide structural-physiological correlates of neurocognitive outcomes, representing the first multi-center neuroimaging study to be performed in ACHD. Importantly, other behavioral and environmental enrichment data will be integrated with these neuroimaging and neurocognitive outcome data to model cognitive reserve. Results from this research will help shape the care of ACHD patients, and further our understanding of the interplay between brain injury and cognitive reserve. The proposed ancillary study is thus both feasible and cost-effective by leveraging the NHLBI-PHN infrastructure As such, the proposed research is well aligned with the NHLBI's Strategic Vision. Adult Congenital Heart Disease (ACHD) now outnumber children with CHD. ACHD patients demonstrate domain-specific neurocognitive deficits and reduced quality of life, including lower educational attainment and less social interaction. The mechanism of neurocognitive impairment in the ACHD population is unknown and few neuroimaging studies in this population exist. We propose a multi-modal neuroimaging ancillary study to the NHLBI-funded Pediatric Heart Network (PHN) “Multi-Institutional Neurocognitive Discovery Study” (MINDS) in Adult Congenital Heart Disease to correlate multi-modal neuroimaging biomarkers in relation to neurocognitive outcome. We will also determine if the associations between neuroimaging biomarkers and neurocognitive outcomes in ACHD patients are modified by behavioral and environmental enrichment proxies of cognitive reserve, using traditional statistical models and machine learning techniques. These ACHD studies will foster development of future clinical translational studies or trials of preventive strategies to improve neurocognitive outcome in this population.",MINDS Imaging Ancillary Study,10001823,R01HL152740,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Ancillary Study', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain Injuries', 'Caring', 'Cerebrovascular Circulation', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders', 'Cerebrovascular Trauma', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Common Ventricle', 'Complex', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Crystallization', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Educational Background', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'Exhibits', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Habits', 'Heart', 'Hemosiderin', 'Hypoxia', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Infarction', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Life Style', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Abnormality', 'Multicenter Studies', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Network Infrastructure', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'Neuropsychology', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Patients', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Prevention strategy', 'Protocols documentation', 'Proxy', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Social Interaction', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Thick', 'Translational trial', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vision', 'White Matter Hyperintensity', 'aged', 'brain abnormalities', 'cerebrovascular', 'cognitive reserve', 'cohesion', 'cohort', 'congenital heart disorder', 'connectome', 'cost effective', 'environmental enrichment for laboratory animals', 'executive function', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'insight', 'ischemic injury', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'prevent', 'protective factors', 'randomized trial', 'reconstruction', 'recruit', 'response', 'social', 'translational study', 'white matter', 'young adult']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2020,526873,0.002199412165651776
"Autonomous diagnosis and management of the critically ill during air transport (ADMIT) Project Summary/Abstract: Cardiorespiratory instability (CRI) is common in trauma patients and other acutely ill patients being transferred from trauma sites or between hospital centers. Although paramedics/nurses (PM/RN) have some success in rescuing unstable patients with CRI using defined protocols and decrease incidence of inter-transport severe circulatory shock, the shock recognition tools available and resuscitation endpoints are limited to blood pressure and heart rate thresholds. However, CRI is often unrecognized until it is well established when patients are more refractory to treatment, or progressed to organ injury. If one could accurately predict who, when and why these critically ill patients develop CRI, then effective preemptive treatments could be given to improve care and triage resulting in better use of healthcare resources. We have shown that an integrated monitoring system alert obtained from continuous noninvasively acquired monitoring parameters coupled to a care algorithm improved step-down unit (SDU) patient outcomes. We also applied machine learning (ML) modeling to our clinically-relevant porcine model of hemorrhagic shock to characterize responses to hypovolemia, hemorrhage, and resuscitation, predict which animals would or would not collapse during hypovolemia, and identify occult bleeding 5 minutes earlier than with traditional monitoring. We now propose to apply our work to vulnerable STAT MedEvac air transported patients. We will validate these approaches in our existing >5,000 patient STAT MedEvac database, containing highly granular continuous non-invasive monitoring waveforms of air transported critically ill patients linked to their primary care and inpatient electronic health records (EHR). This level of patient information and granularity linked to treatment data and patient outcomes is unprecedented. We will extend our analysis to include more complex CRI, richer data, deeper analytics, and larger libraries of critically ill patients while in air transport, linking our proven Functional Hemodynamic Monitoring (FHM) principles for pathophysiologic diagnosis and resuscitation with non-invasive monitoring to operationalize personalized resuscitation. We will concurrently running two specific aims. First, we will develop through the Carnegie Melon University Auton Lab multivariable models through ML data-driven classification techniques to predict CRI. We will do this initially on our existing porcine hemorrhagic shock model data (n=60) and then on our STAT MedEvac dataset linked to EHR (n >5,000 patients), determining the minimal data (measures, sampling frequency, observation duration) required to robustly identify deviation from health, likely CRI cause, and response to treatment (endpoint of resuscitation), as well as the incremental benefit of additional variables, analysis, lead-time and sampling frequency to predict CRI and response to treatment, and examine the trade-offs between model parsimony and specificity. Second, we will evaluate our existing clinical decision support (CDS) tools to interface with FHM principles and ML- defined interactions, and trial this in silico first on our porcine hemorrhagic shock resuscitation, then on our STAT MedEvac data, followed by prospective human simulation on flight crew PM/RN (n=160) during annual training for agreement and benefit, defining effectiveness based on diagnosis accuracy, time to diagnosis, intervention choice accuracy and time to intervention. This iterative process will modify the existing CDS platform into one more specifically suited for air transport scenarios. Finally, we will evaluate the resultant semi-autonomous management protocol initially in retrospect in 100 STAT MedEvac patients and 10 Emergency Department trauma patients and then prospectively by active CDS in a final 100 STAT MedEvac patients. We will prospectively analyze the effectiveness of these calibrated CDS tools for predictive ability of the various ML models and apply the best, most practical and parsimonious predictive models for clinical care during transport based on patient population, pathological processes and support staff. Project narrative We propose to develop and trial of proactive approach to diagnosis and management of vulnerable critically ill patients during STAT MedEvac air transport from trauma sites and inter-hospital transfer. We will use machine learning approaches to plumb our existing rich >5500 patient STAT MedEvac waveform data linked to their electronic health records to define level of severity, predict impending cardiovascular instability and to both drive in-flight resuscitation and alert receiving Emergency Department triage. We will use our existing clinically relevant porcine model of hemorrhagic shock to focus initial human instability algorithms and then refine our existing graph user interface clinical decisions support (CDS) algorithm, first in animal and with paramedic/nurse dyads in human simulation and then during actual STAT MedEvac air transport and Emergency Department care of trauma patients creating a scalable CDS platform to support paramedic/nurse smart monitoring and proactive resuscitation of these high risk patients.",Autonomous diagnosis and management of the critically ill during air transport (ADMIT),9912846,R01HL141916,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute', 'Agreement', 'Air', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Blood Pressure', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency Care', 'Emergency Department Physician', 'Environment', 'Family suidae', 'Frequencies', 'Graph', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Rate', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hemorrhagic Shock', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Hypovolemia', 'Incidence', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Medical', 'Melons', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Normal Range', 'Nurses', 'Organ failure', 'Paramedical Personnel', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Records', 'Refractory', 'Resources', 'Resuscitation', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Sepsis', 'Series', 'Serious Adverse Event', 'Severities', 'Shock', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trauma', 'Trauma patient', 'Traumatic Hemorrhage', 'Triage', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Weaning', 'Work', 'advanced system', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision support', 'clinically relevant', 'cost', 'data modeling', 'data streams', 'demographics', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'in silico', 'indexing', 'insight', 'iterative design', 'mortality', 'non-invasive monitor', 'organ injury', 'patient population', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'prospective', 'response', 'signal processing', 'simulation', 'success', 'support tools', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2020,761406,0.012035655307671703
"Refinement of a rapid saliva miRNA diagnostic test for concussion Summary/Abstract - Quadrant Biosciences is developing a new diagnostic to aid in the clinical detection of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) in school-aged children and young adults (13–22 years). Based on salivary microRNA (miRNA) biomarkers, Quadrant’s diagnostic will provide an accurate, objective, and non-invasive method for mTBI diagnosis. Such a method is critically needed, as the number of pediatric mTBIs is on the rise, and the developing brains of young patients are more vulnerable to the after-effects of mechanical forces, leading to a wide range of negative effects on physical, cognitive, and psychological function. The diagnosis and assessment of mTBI in adolescents are challenging and rely on subjective measures, leading many mTBIs to go undiagnosed or underreported. This results in suboptimal post-injury treatment and patient management. A biologic assay to accurately diagnose adolescent mTBI would therefore provide an invaluable guide for clinical care, potentially guiding decisions for imaging, return to play, return to school, and therapeutic interventions. While a number of potential biomarkers for objectively detecting mTBI have been proposed, including the blood biomarkers glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and ubiquitin c-terminal hydrolase (UCH-L1), recent research questions the ability of blood-based biomarkers to differentiate patients with mTBI from those with acute orthopedic trauma, particularly in pediatric populations. Moreover, these assays require venipuncture expertise that is not always available, particularly in the case of sports-related concussions, which account for nearly 1/3 of mTBIs in this patient population. To address these shortcomings, Quadrant Biosciences is creating a novel, objective diagnostic tool based on a panel of saliva miRNA biomarkers that are differentially expressed in patients with mTBI. Pilot studies in over 200 individuals with mTBI have identified a panel of saliva miRNAs capable of diagnosing mTBI and predicting symptom duration. In the proposed Fast Track project, Quadrant will advance development of this test by establishing a rapid, accurate method for quantifying these miRNAs and refining/validating a diagnostic algorithm to differentiate adolescents and young adults with mTBI from peers with symptomology that mimics mTBI (e.g. chronic headaches, anxiety/depression, ADHD, exercise-related fatigue, and orthopedic injury). In Phase I, Quadrant will refine a diagnostic algorithm for mTBI using a rapid quantification technique for saliva miRNAs. Machine learning will be used to develop a diagnostic algorithm that employs miRNA levels from the rapid multiplex assay alongside participant medical and demographic characteristics to predict mTBI status. In Phase II, Quadrant will validate the diagnostic algorithm for differentiating mTBI from medical conditions with overlapping symptomology in a prospective, case-control study of 2500 adolescents and young adults (age 13–22 years) to refine the saliva-based diagnostic aid for mTBI. Ultimately, Quadrant’s proposed salivary miRNA-based test will yield a minimally invasive, objective, biologic test that can aid diagnosis of mTBI, including among patients with confounding psychologic conditions. Narrative - Children and adolescents account for approximately 2/3 of the 3 million concussions that occur in the U.S. each year, placing them at risk for negative impacts on physical, cognitive, and psychological function, including poor academic performance, behavior, social interactions, and reduced subsequent employment. Unfortunately, mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is underdiagnosed due to the poor sensitivity of conventional methods (neurological assessment, self-reporting, imaging, etc.) and lack of an objective, non-invasive diagnostic tool. Quadrant Biosciences’ rapid, accurate, objective aid for the diagnosis of mTBIs in adolescents and young adults will enable timely and accurate decision-making in mTBI assessment, resulting in reduced re- injury/morbidity, individualized patient management, and improved long-term patient outcomes.",Refinement of a rapid saliva miRNA diagnostic test for concussion,10081522,R42NS119119,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adolescent and Young Adult', 'Advanced Development', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anxiety', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Sciences', 'Biological Testing', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Brain Concussion', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Headaches', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Custom', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Emergency department visit', 'Employment', 'Exercise', 'Fatigue', 'Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein', 'Headache', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neurologic', 'Olfactory Nerve', 'Oral cavity', 'Orthopedics', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physical activity', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protein C', 'RNA Sequences', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk-Taking', 'Saliva', 'Salivary', 'Sampling', 'School-Age Population', 'Schools', 'Severities', 'Social Interaction', 'Sports', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'Venipunctures', 'accurate diagnosis', 'age group', 'aging population', 'base', 'blood-based biomarker', 'clinical care', 'concussive symptom', 'design', 'diagnostic panel', 'differential expression', 'improved', 'mechanical force', 'microRNA biomarkers', 'mild traumatic brain injury', 'minimally invasive', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'patient population', 'pediatric patients', 'peer', 'personalized management', 'potential biomarker', 'psychologic', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase', 'young adult']",NINDS,"QUADRANT BIOSCIENCES, INC.",R42,2020,380848,0.0022019039519832694
"SCH: INT: MyPHA: Automatically generating personalized accounts of in-patient hospitalization A growing body of research has found that patients who actively manage their health have better outcomes, and patient engagement has become a central tenet in recent healthcare approaches. However, it has also been shown that many patients lack knowledge of their disease and medications, particularly as concerns chronic health conditions, whose exacerbation causes about two thirds of hospitalizations every year in the USA. Discharge instructions after hospitalization are a critical tool to engage patients in their self-care, but are often unsuccessful. Our hypothesis is that, to en9age patients at discharge, a personalized hospitalization summary should be provided, that integrates physician and nurse documentation, and is informed by the patient's level of engagement in self-care and their socio-cultural perspective. Our transformative pilot work on physician and nurse documentation has identified an additional obstacle to the effective flow of information from professionals to patients: vocabulary differences between physicians and nurses. By leveraging the Unified Medical Language System Metathesaurus, we found no common synonyms between physician and nurse documentations for 75% of patients. Further, 86% of terms patients use are simple compared to only 15% for physicians. The lack of common language among patients, physicians and nurses motivates including all perspectives to make instructions meaningful for patients. Our hypothesis is that a better informed patient population who understands the connections between their illness, hospital experience, and discharge instructions will be more empowered and more engaged in their chronic disease management. Our innovation is to automatically create an easy-to-understand, personalized hospitalization summary that integrates events described in the EHR; and that is responsive to the patient's needs and preferences, and their activation framework (PAF) level. We pursue four specific aims: 1. To investigate socio-cultural patterns of patient perceptions of illness via a socio linguistic analysis of patient interviews; 2. To integrate multi-faceted information about a patient, as provided by physicians and nurses; 3a. To develop MyPHA, a novel application program, which will automatically generate the personalized summaries and deliver them to the patient on a tablet. MyPHA will be informed by aims 1 and 2, and will be grounded in Natural Language Generation technology; 3b. To evaluate MyPHA with multiple cycles of formative evaluation with all stakeholders, and a summative evaluation with patients. Whereas our pilot work has focused on heart failure, the techniques we will develop can easily be adapted to the management of other chronic health conditions, in particular for patients with cancer and cancer survivors. In addition, cancer and heart failure can co-occur, especially in older patients, and several cancer treatments can lead to the development of heart failure. The software program MyPHA will be released open source to the research community to enable rapid customization to other chronic conditions. Patients who are engaged in their self-care have better outcomes, however discharge instructions often fail to activate them. This study plans to integrate nurse and physician documentation from the Electronic Health Record with the patient's needs and preferences to provide patients with a concise summary of their hospitalization, tailored to their current activation level. This contextual information should help improve the lives of patients living with chronic health conditions, such as cancer patients and survivors.",SCH: INT: MyPHA: Automatically generating personalized accounts of in-patient hospitalization,9987573,R01CA225446,"['Adherence', 'Appointment', 'Area', 'Asian Americans', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Survivor', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Charge', 'Chicago', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Confusion', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Documentation', 'Education', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emotional', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Faculty', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Health', 'Health Professional', 'Healthcare', 'Heart failure', 'Hispanic Americans', 'Home environment', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Illinois', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Instruction', 'Intention', 'Interdisciplinary Communication', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Investments', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Linguistics', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical Libraries', 'Medical Records', 'Minority', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Native Americans', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nurses', 'Outcome', 'Ownership', 'Pacific Island Americans', 'Participant', 'Patient Discharge', 'Patient Education', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Process', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Self Care', 'Self Efficacy', 'Self Management', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Students', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Time', 'UMLS Metathesaurus', 'Universities', 'Vocabulary', 'Woman', 'Work', 'biomedical informatics', 'cancer therapy', 'cardiogenesis', 'college', 'compliance behavior', 'computer science', 'design', 'doctoral student', 'efficacy trial', 'empowered', 'empowerment', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'formative assessment', 'health literacy', 'hospital readmission', 'illness perceptions', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'member', 'natural language', 'novel', 'older patient', 'open source', 'patient engagement', 'patient population', 'patient portal', 'preference', 'programs', 'prototype', 'skills', 'social', 'social culture', 'sociolinguistics', 'tool', 'undergraduate student', 'urban school']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,R01,2020,372633,0.013843363694047933
"Computer-Assisted Histologic Evaluation of Cardiac Allograft Rejection Project Summary Though cardiac transplantation is a lifesaving intervention, cardiac allograft rejection (CAR) remains a relatively common and serious complication that confers an increased risk of acute graft failure and adverse patient outcomes. For three decades, endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) with histological grading, as recommended by the International Society of Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) has been the broadly applied standard for CAR diagnosis. However, it is widely appreciated that the ISHLT rejection grading standard lacks diagnostic accuracy and has limited ability to discern the mechanism of rejection. These limitations expose patients to risks of both over-treatment and under-treatment, and highlight the unmet need for more accurate and informative approaches to histopathologic analysis of EMB samples. Our team is a leader in computational pathology image analysis with over 200 papers and >30 issued patents in this area. We have already developed and evaluated a computer assisted histopathology grading evaluation (CACHE) scheme which (1) in N=205 patients, had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC)=0.95 compared to two cardiac pathologists (mean AUC=0.74) in distinguishing normal from failing hearts and (2) could distinguish low and high ISHLT rejection grades in N=1109 patients with a performance that exceeds that of trained cardiac pathologists. Recognizing the frequent discordance between ISHLT rejection grade and the clinical trajectory of a rejection event, we will further develop and optimize CACHE to identify new “grade agnostic” morphologic biomarkers of clinically serious CAR. Our scientific premise is that morphologic biomarkers prioritized based on their correlation to patients’ clinical trajectories and underlying immunological disease mechanisms will generate an accurate, consistent and informative classifier for diagnosing allograft rejection. In service of this hypothesis, the proposed research will address three specific aims. In Aim 1, we will utilize computational image analysis to discover the morphologic biomarkers of rejection-related injury which are needed to develop a classifier capable of assessing the clinical trajectory of CAR. In Aim 2, we will provide mechanistic annotation of biomarkers identified in Aim 1 through correlation with in-situ immunologic markers using custom multi-parameter immunofluorescence panels. In Aim 3, we employ a multicenter, prospective cohort to validate the diagnostic and mechanistic accuracy of the new rejection classifier developed in Aims 1 and 2. Ultimately, development of a more accurate and mechanistically informative tool for morphologic diagnosis of CAR will improve patient outcomes by reducing over- and under- treatment and inspire applications in other organ transplants. Interestingly, development of a superior histologic diagnostic tool will empower development of alternative, biopsy-free diagnostic approaches that have been handicapped by the necessity of comparison with the flawed ISHLT rejection grade as a reference standard. Project Narrative For heart transplant recipients, allograft rejection remains a relatively common and serious complication associated with adverse patient outcomes. Shortcomings of the current rejection grading standard for heart biopsies leads to both over- and under-treatment, accordingly, this proposal will develop and validate a computer assisted rejection grading classifier that is more accurate, consistent and informative for diagnosing heart allograft rejection. Improved diagnostic accuracy will improve patient outcomes, inspire similar applications in other organ transplants and empower development of additional technologies that have been constrained by the current flawed rejection standard.",Computer-Assisted Histologic Evaluation of Cardiac Allograft Rejection,10070406,R01HL151277,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Allografting', 'Antibodies', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Benign', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Biopsy Specimen', 'Cardiac', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Complication', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Derivation procedure', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disabled Persons', 'Disease', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Graft Rejection', 'Guidelines', 'Heart', 'Heart Transplantation', 'Heart-Lung Transplantation', 'Histologic', 'Histopathologic Grade', 'Histopathology', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Immune', 'Immune System Diseases', 'Immunofluorescence Immunologic', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Immunologics', 'In Situ', 'Injury', 'International', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Intervention', 'Journals', 'Legal patent', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Organ Transplantation', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Pathologist', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Prospective cohort', 'Protocols documentation', 'ROC Curve', 'Recurrence', 'Reference Standards', 'Research', 'Retrospective cohort', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Slide', 'Societies', 'Stains', 'Syndrome', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Transplantation', 'allograft rejection', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'biomarker validation', 'clinical predictors', 'clinically significant', 'cohort', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'feature detection', 'graft failure', 'heart allograft', 'heart imaging', 'improved', 'innovation', 'molecular marker', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'overtreatment', 'pathology imaging', 'phenotypic data', 'population based', 'post-transplant', 'prospective', 'screening', 'success', 'tool', 'transplant centers', 'treatment as usual', 'treatment choice']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2020,845590,0.01703139884163939
"Utility of Predictive Systems to identify Inpatient Diagnostic Errors: The UPSIDE Study PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  While much research has been conducted on patient safety since the Institute of Medicine published “To Err is Human” in 2000, there is a comparative dearth of research on diagnostic errors in the hospital setting. The broad, long-term objectives of the proposed research is to better understand the incidence, causes, and risk factors for diagnostic errors in the inpatient setting. This work will provide foundational research for the development of interventions to reduce these errors, including predictive tools, targets for intervention, and a methodology for outcome assessment in future trials of interventions. To achieve this overall goal, we will carry out the following specific aims: 1) To determine the incidence of diagnostic errors among patients who die in hospital or are transferred to the ICU two days or more after admission to a general medicine service through a structured, standardized adjudication process of patient records, 2) To combine adjudication data with data from Vizient to determine which specific factors contribute to risks for diagnostic errors, and to use risk estimates to calculate incidence and impact of factors contributing to those errors, and 3)To create machine- learning models that can be used to retrospectively identify patients in whom a diagnostic error was likely to have taken place. The research will involve a retrospective evaluation of 2000 patients admitted to general medicine units at 20 US hospitals participating in a national research collaborative and which also contribute data to a benchmarking and purchasing organization (Vizient). Using the Safer-Diagnosis (Safer-Dx) and Diagnostic Error Evaluation and Research (DEER) taxonomy tools, both adapted for the inpatient setting, adjudicators will review electronic medical record data and determine the presence or absence of diagnostic errors using a rigorous training and continuous review process to ensure reliability across sites, adjudicators, and time. Standard modelling techniques will be used to understand the population-attributable risk of each of the DEER process failure points to diagnostic error as well as the contributions of several patient, provider, and system-level risk factors. Lastly, advanced machine-learning methods will be used to create models that can identify patients in whom diagnostic error occurred, with superior performance to standard approaches such as logistic regression. Together, these approaches will provide a broad and representative picture of the incidence of diagnostic errors among hospitalized patients who have suffered harm, develop models of patient and system-based factors that make a diagnostic error more or less likely, and build advanced, efficient, and scalable tools needed to support future surveillance and improvement programs for a variety of institutions. This research will establish a foundation from which healthcare systems can assess and achieve excellence in diagnosis in the inpatient setting. PROJECT NARRATIVE  This study seeks to accurately define the incidence of diagnostic errors among patients suffering serious inpatient events in a large network of US hospitals. Without a reliable method for determining the presence of diagnostic errors across many organizations, it is not otherwise possible to understand the incidence, impact, predictors, and underlying causes of these errors, to create and optimize future solutions to reduce diagnostic errors, to directly test the effects of these solutions, or to teach physicians how to avoid diagnostic pitfalls in the future. Our study addresses these issues while being responsive to the RFA’s goals of developing robust estimates of incidence and risk and using approaches that leverage electronic data, and our approach represents a novel application of rigorous outcome adjudication and advanced modeling techniques to the problem of inpatient diagnostic errors.",Utility of Predictive Systems to identify Inpatient Diagnostic Errors: The UPSIDE Study,10020962,R01HS027369,[' '],AHRQ,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2020,496734,-0.00780900438649773
"Synchronized brain dynamics and eye movement trajectory for objective evaluation of robot-assisted surgical skills Complicated and costly robot assisted surgery (RAS) training results in less frequent use of this technology in several complex areas of surgery, and consequently ends up in harm. RAS requires a unique blend of skills in addition to manual competence with human-machine interaction skills, while operating remotely from patient with no tactile feedback. To address this challenge, numerous studies have focused on simulation-based robotic training curricula, like Fundamental Skills of Robotic Surgery (FSRS), to develop and assess the performance level of the surgeon operator. However, such training tools were developed based on metrics measured by performance on a simulator and other subjectively evaluated metrics. The goal of this research proposal is to develop a tool for objective RAS skill assessment and a model for performance monitoring. We hypothesize that brain dynamics - Electroencephalogram (EEG) - and eye movement behavior are able to detect change of skill level and the level of surgeon’s performance. To validate this hypothesis, we will record EEG signals and eye movement time series from subjects with different RAS expertise levels. Ten novices, 5 beginners, 5 advanced beginners, and 5 expert surgeons will be included in the study and continuously perform four levels of designed RAS training tasks on surgical robot simulator, dry lab, and animal lab during one year; (1) performing six basic tasks on surgical simulator. All subjects will practice these tasks during two weekly sessions and each practice session takes 2 hours. (2) Subjects will practice 3 tasks of peg transfer, pattern cutting, and suturing on dry lab. (3) Subjects will practice 2 tasks (anastomosis and dissection) on animal tissue and also on plastic models. (4) Subjects will practice two operations of nephrectomy and hysterectomy on animal lab, 2 operations in each session, and each session takes 3 hours and occurs every other week. Two master surgeons will subjectively evaluate performance of subjects (all 25 subjects; Score scale: 1-20) and expertise level (four categories) in performing the designed tasks, every practice session. Master surgeons evaluate surgeon’s skill and performance throughout task and notify change of skill level and performance through time. We will then develop a ‘deep convolutional neural network’ algorithm trained by EEG and eye movement time series through running windows with equal size, to classify subject skill level into four categories of a novice, beginner, advanced beginner, and expert. We will also use network neuroscience techniques to extract engineered features from EEG and eye movement data and use them for training a regression algorithm to develop a model for performance level prediction. Ultimately, the developed objective skill evaluation tool and performance monitoring model will make RAS training more efficient by providing feedback to the trainee regarding his/her skills and directing him/her to focus on skills needed improvement. These improvements will result in more frequent use of RAS in complex surgical areas and ultimately lead to patient safety. Project Narrative The use of robot-assisted surgery (RAS) has offered advantages for surgeons and patients, yet there is no clinically practical tool for objective evaluation of subject’s expertise level and performance. The overall objective of this research is to develop a tool for objective RAS skill assessment and a model for performance monitoring, leading to optimized RAS training process, improved patient safety and surgical outcomes.",Synchronized brain dynamics and eye movement trajectory for objective evaluation of robot-assisted surgical skills,9939074,R01EB029398,"['Active Learning', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anastomosis - action', 'Animals', 'Applied Skills', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Competence', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dissection', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Electroencephalogram', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Eye Movements', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Hysterectomy', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Literature', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Needles', 'Nephrectomy', 'Neurosciences', 'Operating Rooms', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'Role', 'Running', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'Surgeon', 'Surgical sutures', 'System', 'Tactile', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Wrist', 'adaptive learning', 'algorithm development', 'algorithm training', 'animal tissue', 'arm', 'base', 'cognitive process', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'deep neural network', 'density', 'design', 'gaze', 'human disease', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'motor learning', 'neural network algorithm', 'operation', 'patient safety', 'regression algorithm', 'robot assistance', 'robotic device', 'robotic training', 'safety outcomes', 'sensor', 'signal processing', 'simulation', 'skill acquisition', 'skills', 'surgery outcome', 'tool']",NIBIB,ROSWELL PARK CANCER INSTITUTE CORP,R01,2020,393075,-0.019684100191427575
"Learning to Predict Delayed Cerebral Ischemia with Novel Continuous Cerebral Arterial State Index Project Summary  Delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) is the most devastating complication after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) and has an incidence rate of 30%. Current practice relies on intermittent assessment of neurological status and daily cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV) by Transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD) to guide medical management to prevent DCI. Only after medical management fails, is endovascular treatment (EVT) including intraarterial vasodilator infusion and/or intracranial angioplasty initiated. This reactive practice does not account for early predictors of DCI and may miss the optimal EVT window at an early stage of DCI development before symptoms or severe deviations from normal hemodynamics. The goal of this project is to develop algorithms to predict DCI and related targets at an early stage in their development. An accurate prediction of DCI will enable a more proactive strategy to prevent and treat the underlying cause of DCI.  The following three aims will be pursued towards the goal of the project: 1) Develop aSAH-specific intracranial pressure (ICP) pulse-based cerebral arterial state index; 2) Develop and validate predictive models of targets related to delayed cerebral ischemia after aSAH; 3) Conduct a prospective institution- specific adaption and validation of the developed models.  Our DCI predictive algorithms only need data available in current clinical practice hence they can be readily adopted. If validated, these algorithms will enable clinicians to monitor risk of DCI continuously and to proactively deliver appropriate treatment. The proposed prospective study of algorithm implementation and adaptation will well prepare future clinical trials to test the efficacy of algorithm-informed interventions.

"Improving Outcomes Assessment in Chronic Graft versus Host Disease PROJECT SUMMARY Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) can cure many hematologic cancers and other life- threatening hematologic diseases but 20-50% of survivors develop chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD), the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in transplant survivors. Chronic GVHD is an iatrogenic complication that can affect multiple organs, leading to clinical manifestations similar to autoimmune diseases such as systemic sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjogren’s syndrome, and lichen planus. Chronic GVHD requires prolonged treatment with potent immunosuppressive agents and is associated with high symptom burden and poor quality of life. The precise pathophysiology is unclear in humans. There are data supporting involvement of T and B cells, macrophages, dendritic cells, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, cytokines, chemokines and other proteins. However, information is derived from studies with few patients having heterogeneous clinical manifestations. This renewal application will address key gaps in our understanding: Can we identify biologically relevant cGVHD subgroups by studying large numbers of patients and using sophisticated analytic techniques to identify “clusters” of similar patients? Is personalized medicine possible based on knowledge of underlying pathophysiology and the likelihood of response? To address these questions, we will use our extensive biorepository to test whether plasma proteins and peripheral blood cellular populations cluster with clinical manifestations. While these studies are ongoing, a new cohort will be enrolled to prospectively test the cluster findings and to investigate early biomarkers for treatment response. Participants will be enrolled prior to starting a new systemic initial or second-line cGVHD treatment, then followed at 1, 3 and 6 months later to assess clinical response. Successful completion of these aims will advance our understanding of the biologic underpinnings of the different forms of human cGVHD and guide therapeutic approaches, in order to decrease the morbidity and mortality of this common transplant complication. PROJECT NARRATIVE Chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) is the leading cause of morbidity and non-relapse mortality in survivors of allogeneic transplantation.

"Optimized identification of therapeutic bacterial strains in ulcerative colitis PROJECT SUMMARY Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic gut inflammatory condition thought to be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Therapeutic options are only partially effective in inducing and maintaining remission, and there is currently no cure for UC. Recent studies have found the microbiome of UC patients is distinct compared to that of healthy controls, suggesting that the microbiome could be a promising therapeutic target. Fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) has been extremely successful in the treatment of colitis caused by Clostridium difficile infection, further demonstrating the potential for bacterial therapeutics. The recently completed FOCUS (Faecal Microbiota Transplantation in Ulcerative Colitis) trial has demonstrated that FMT from healthy donors can induce clinical remission in 27% of UC patients compared to only 8% in the placebo group. However, we still lack an understanding of the exact mechanisms by which FMT is able to modulate disease pathogenesis. The overarching hypothesis of this proposal is that UC remission after FMT is induced by specific bacteria, and that accurate identification of bacterial strains will be paramount to develop microbial therapeutics for UC. To test this hypothesis, we will first develop a novel ensemble method to identify bacterial species and strains from deep metagenomic data. This method combines software tools using a voting algorithm that is weighted based on the accuracy of each tool. The accuracy of this method will be tested using microbial culture collections from UC patients, in silico simulations, and a bacterial mock community as gold standards. We will then apply this approach to metagenomic data generated from the FOCUS study in order to identify bacterial strains that are associated with UC remission. This will be performed by using established supervised learning techniques, as well as through a novel method based on co- occurrence network analysis that identifies clusters of bacteria that act synergistically. Based on these results, we will finally validate our findings using a gnotobiotic model of colitis. The prophylactic and/or therapeutic potential of candidate bacteria will be tested by inoculating them to gnotobiotic mice colonized with the microbiota of UC patients and with colitis induced through the transfer of naïve T cells. Our proposal will be the first to address the question of how specific bacteria modulate disease progression in a randomized trial of FMT in UC through the development of more sensitive and accurate methods for strain characterization that can be experimentally validated. The rational design of our strategy to identify therapeutic bacteria will produce highly translational results that can be used to guide future clinical trials in UC. PROJECT NARRATIVE Finding novel approaches to prevent and treat ulcerative colitis (UC) is a pressing clinical need. This project investigates the role of bacterial strains as predictors of UC remission after fecal microbiota transplant, and presents novel methods to identify therapeutic strains that will be tested in a mouse model of colitis.",Optimized identification of therapeutic bacterial strains in ulcerative colitis,10017191,R01DK114038,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Bacteria', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clostridium difficile', 'Colitis', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease remission', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Etiology', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Gnotobiotic', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Immune response', 'Incidence', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patients', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Probiotics', 'Property', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Shotguns', 'Societies', 'Software Tools', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Ulcerative Colitis', 'United States', 'Voting', 'bacterial community', 'base', 'clinical remission', 'cohort', 'design', 'fecal transplantation', 'improved', 'in silico', 'learning network', 'learning strategy', 'metagenome', 'metagenomic sequencing', 'method development', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'outcome prediction', 'placebo group', 'potential biomarker', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'probiotic therapy', 'prophylactic', 'randomized trial', 'response', 'simulation', 'supervised learning', 'therapeutic target', 'tool']",NIDDK,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2020,254179,0.008832193652388428
"Impact of Disparities Affecting Survival among Advanced Heart Failure Patients and Transplant Recipients DESCRIPTION: The current heart transplant allocation system and the newly recommended one prioritizes patients based on waitlist survival and does not take into account risk of death after transplant or likelihood of transplantation. Furthermore, it defines medical urgency for transplantation mainly by use of devices and not by objective evidence of medical illness. Unfortunately, many heart failure patients die on the waitlist, including a disproportionate number of women, Hispanics, and patients with certain heart diseases like restrictive cardiomyopathy. After transplantation there are also survival disparities. The long-term goal of this project is to optimize timing for advanced heart failure therapy in order to improve survival and minimize organ wastage. The objective of this research application is to identify risk factors for disparities in survival among heart transplant candidates and post-transplantation and to create tools that will improve outcome in therapy while minimizing organ wastage. The central hypothesis is that a better heart transplant allocation system requires knowledge of how population differences affect patient selection, waitlist mortality, and post-transplant mortality. The rationale for the proposed research is that there are known disparities (sex, race, and type of heart disease) in survival among advanced heart failure patients (pre- and post-transplantation) and creation of risk prediction models have successfully reduced waitlist mortality for lung, liver, and kidney transplantation. The specific aims of this research proposal are: 1) to identify risk factors for disparities in survival among heart transplant candidates and post-transplantation using the national transplant database 2) to develop a method to dynamically update risk of waitlist mortality across time using data from multiple transplant centers that includes potential prognistic risk factors not available in our national transplant database and 3) to create a mathematical model that simultaneous estimates waitlist and post-transplant mortality to optimize timing of transplantation. The approach is innovative because it utilizes new mathematical approaches and seeks to shift current heart failure research and clinical practice paradigms by taking into account population differences rather than basing decisions solely on ejection fraction, presence of coronary artery disease, and stages of disease. The proposed research is significant, because few studies have explored population differences in advanced heart failure to determine the factors associated with mortality on the waitlist and poor outcome post-transplantation. This proposal will evaluate the complex interplay of population differences (i.e sex, race, type of heart disease, laboratory measures of organ dysfunction, and influences of co-morbidities) as they relate to mortality on the waitlist, timing of transplantation, and mortality after transplantation. If the aims of our proposal are achieved, our research has the potential to empower clinicians and researchers to provide the right therapies for the right patient at the right time. There are disparities in survival among patients on the waiting list for a heart transplant, and post-transplantation. These differences are not recognized by the current and newly recommended heart transplant allocation system. Our proposal will identify the factors contributing to these population differences in order to improve survival and minimize organ wastage.",Impact of Disparities Affecting Survival among Advanced Heart Failure Patients and Transplant Recipients,9884783,R01HL141892,"['Affect', 'Albumins', 'American', 'Cardiac', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Complex', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'EFRAC', 'Event', 'Fibrinogen', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health Personnel', 'Heart', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart Transplantation', 'Heart failure', 'Hispanics', 'Hypoalbuminemia', 'Individual', 'Insurance', 'Kidney Failure', 'Kidney Transplantation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Liver Failure', 'Lung Transplantation', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Rights', 'Patient Selection', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Population', 'Prostitution', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Renal function', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Restrictive Cardiomyopathy', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Sex Differences', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Transplantation', 'Treatment Failure', 'United Network for Organ Sharing', 'Update', 'Vibrissae', 'Waiting Lists', 'Woman', 'base', 'cardiac cachexia', 'cardiac device', 'clinical practice', 'comorbidity', 'cost effective', 'forest', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'liver transplantation', 'mathematical methods', 'mathematical model', 'men', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'novel', 'post-transplant', 'risk prediction model', 'sex', 'statistical and machine learning', 'time use', 'tool', 'transplant centers', 'transplant database', 'transplant registry']",NHLBI,CLEVELAND CLINIC LERNER COM-CWRU,R01,2020,779535,0.010712787624919026
"In silico Randomized Control Trial Framework for Assessing Infection Control and Prevention Interventions in the Hospital Project Summary/Abstract Multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs), particularly carbapenem-resistant organisms (CROs), are a major cause of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs). Though studies have found multiple interventions addressing MDRO colonization and transmission to be effective at reducing HAIs, implementation has lagged due to uncertainty regarding the most efficacious combinations of interventions. As patients are connected within healthcare facilities by the movement of healthcare workers (HCWs) and mobile equipment, evaluation of an intervention's impact on transmission and infection must consider these network dynamics. Additionally, each institution has its own staffing ratios, equipment management, and cleaning practices that inform the efficacy of an intervention. To address knowledge gaps regarding the most effective combinations of intervention strategies at an individual hospital, we will build a model framework that will provide hospital administrators and infection control experts with tools for quantifying individual patient risk factors for colonization and infection and for comparing the potential effectiveness of interventions to control HAIs. The aims of the project are: (1) to develop models to predict which patients are at highest risk for colonization and infection with MDROs using clinically relevant information collected during the normal course of care combined with operational data on staffing and equipment movement; (2) to utilize hospital- level models to quantify the combinatorial relationship between, and marginal impact of, additional interventions to reduce HAIs; and (3) to build a framework for other hospitals and healthcare systems to examine the effectiveness of interventions parameterized by their own institution's data. Models will start with the patient at the center, utilizing the rich covariate data stored in electronic health records to develop prediction models based on advanced machine learning. These prediction models will be translatable tools that can be directly incorporated into clinical care to assist clinicians in preventing HAIs. Data on patient-connectedness will form the foundation of hospital-level models that will allow for detailed examinations of the effectiveness of different combinations of interventions. Finally, a generalizable framework will be constructed and tested across a network of healthcare facilities. These models will directly inform CDC guidelines about MDRO prevention and aid clinicians in reducing the risk of HAIs. Project Narrative The models developed through this proposal will improve understanding of how biological factors associated with the transmission of multidrug-resistant organisms (MDRO) impact interventions to reduce hospital-associated infections (HAIs). This will aid predictions of patients' risk for colonization and infection, as well as improve understanding of how interventions can most effectively be combined to reduce the likelihood that patients will suffer from these high-consequence pathogens.",In silico Randomized Control Trial Framework for Assessing Infection Control and Prevention Interventions in the Hospital,10110718,U01CK000589,[' '],NCEZID,"CENTER/ DISEASE DYNAMICS, ECONOM/POLICY",U01,2020,550000,-0.013015447045797626
"Improving Hypertension Treatment in African Americans Using Computational Modeling and Predictive Analytics ABSTRACT As compared to whites, African Americans (AA) develop hypertension (HTN) at an earlier age, have a greater frequency and severity of HTN, poorer control of blood pressure (BP), and have twice the mortality rate from HTN. For 47 years our department has been developing computer simulations of integrative physiology for research purposes. The current model, HumMod, is comprised of 14 organ systems, and includes neural, endocrine, circulatory, and renal physiology. We have created tools that generate and analyze large cohorts of computer-generated (virtual) patients. With these techniques HumMod has been used for hypothesis generation and for understanding underlying physiological mechanisms that are not able to be determined in either whole animal or human experiments. This proposed work will use these tools and this mathematical model of human physiology to develop a realistic AA virtual population for studying antihypertensive therapies that have well-known (diuretic or salt reduction), variable (angiotensin converting enzyme, or ACE inhibition), or unclear (renal denervation (RDX), and baroreflex activation therapy (BAT) therapeutic efficacies in AA. Published data from our laboratory show that our model is robust and can realistically simulate salt sensitivity, multiple types of HTN, and device-based antihypertensive therapy. As shown in our preliminary data, we have successfully created a virtual population that was similar to the clinical data (AA population with resistant HTN) in 5-dimensions (blood pressure, heart rate, glomerular filtration rate, cardiac output, and peripheral resistance) and have conducted in silico trials for new device-based therapy currently being evaluated for the treatment of resistant HTN—namely RDX, BAT, and arteriovenous fistula. Based on these preliminary data, we hypothesize that these techniques will allow us to investigate the physiological mechanisms responsible for the variation in response to therapy in a wide range of AA patient types and predict the likelihood of success for a particular treatment. Aim 1 of the proposal will test the hypothesis that a virtual AA population with resistant HTN can be successfully calibrated and validated. Aim 2 of the proposal will test the hypothesis that in silico trials using the calibrated populations from the first Aim can be used for testing and predicting mechanisms of nonresponse to device-based antihypertensive therapies. Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that our predictive analytic techniques can be used to identify mechanisms and proxy markers of therapeutic resistance in hypertensive AA. These proposed studies have clinical relevance because they address a leading cause of morbidity and mortality as well as potential mechanisms of therapeutic resistance in an underserved and understudied minority. Furthermore, these applications and the potential insights gleaned from our physiological model and predictive analytic tools may have broad implications for BP control in other resistant hypertensive populations. PROJECT NARRATIVE African Americans develop hypertension and its co-morbidities at an earlier age, have a greater frequency and severity of hypertension, have poorer control of blood pressure, and die disproportionately (2-fold) more from hypertension as compared to whites. Despite these known disparities, there has been little attention or advancement in the management of blood pressure in the African American population. Our laboratory’s advanced physiological model paired with novel analytic tools may mechanistically predict the types of patients that should respond to therapy, ultimately improving patient drug regimens and their success rate in this underserved and understudied population.",Improving Hypertension Treatment in African Americans Using Computational Modeling and Predictive Analytics,10048017,K99MD014738,"['Address', 'African American', 'Age', 'Aldosterone Antagonists', 'Angiotensin II', 'Animals', 'Antihypertensive Agents', 'Arterial Disorder', 'Arteriovenous fistula', 'Attention', 'Baroreflex', 'Blood Pressure', 'Calcium Channel', 'Cardiac Output', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Computer Simulation', 'Controlled Study', 'Data', 'Denervation', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Diuretics', 'Endocrine', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Generations', 'Genomics', 'Glean', 'Glomerular Filtration Rate', 'Heart Rate', 'High Prevalence', 'Hormonal', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Jackson Heart Study', 'Kidney', 'Laboratories', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentors', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Obesity', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A', 'Peripheral Resistance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Prevalence', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Proxy', 'Publishing', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Resistant Hypertension', 'Severities', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Sodium Chloride', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'blood pressure regulation', 'body system', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'computer generated', 'data warehouse', 'experimental study', 'genetic epidemiology', 'human model', 'hypertension control', 'hypertension treatment', 'improved', 'in silico', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mathematical model', 'mortality', 'novel', 'patient population', 'patient response', 'physiologic model', 'relating to nervous system', 'resistance mechanism', 'response', 'simulation', 'success', 'therapeutic biomarker', 'therapy resistant', 'tool', 'virtual', 'virtual model']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF MISSISSIPPI MED CTR,K99,2020,103817,0.0040677973387802475
"VERITY: Value and Evidence in Rheumatology using bioInformaTics, and advanced analYtics PROJECT ABSTRACT  Pediatric and adult rheumatic and musculoskeletal (MSK) diseases challenge the clinical researcher: they affect the population across the lifespan, impact a broad range of patient-centered outcomes, are rarely cured, and often have multiple possible treatment strategies. If properly addressed, these factors present tremendous opportunities for improving patient care and outcomes of patients. The overarching goal of the Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH) CCCR is to facilitate advancements in the methodologic sciences supporting clinical research within the NIAMS pediatric and adult rheumatic and musculoskeletal (MSK) disease missions.  VERITY is organized around central scientific themes that can be applied to multiple rheumatic and MSK diseases. The Cores address the following cross-cutting areas: 1) including patients in clinical trial design, outcome selection, result interpretation, and dissemination; 2) integrating behavioral economics to enhance benefits of known interventions, i.e., adherence to medications, engagement in physical activity and weight loss; 3) extracting maximum information content from big data; 4) using smart technologies (mobile health) to advance clinical research; and 5) disseminating knowledge and mentoring of local and national rheumatic and MSK disease clinical researchers through distributed learning models. These scientific themes will be approached through several Cores described in the following Specific Aims. 1. To strategically direct, supervise, and provide financial accountability to VERITY and to train a broad group of local and national investigators for patient-oriented clinical research in pediatric and adult rheumatic and MSK diseases. (Administrative Core) 2. To develop and implement state of the art methods in innovative trials and longitudinal comparative effectiveness studies for rheumatic and MSK disease research. (Methodology Core) 3. To support bioinformatic approaches to enhance utilization of large databases for phenotyping relevant patients, and implementing biomarker, electronic medical record, and comparative effectiveness analyses.

"Novel mechanisms and treatment of arrhythmia during resuscitation Resuscitation from sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) is typically initiated in patients with ongoing ischemia and ventricular fibrillation (VF) or tachycardia (VT) that, even if successful, is commonly followed by repeated rearrest. Despite significant efforts to improve resuscitation from SCA, survival remains poor prompting NIH to identify resuscitation as a high priority for emergency care research. Beat-to-beat alternans of cellular repolarization in the myocardium (repolarization alternans) is a substrate for arrhythmias, is rampant during resuscitation, and is manifested on the ECG as T-wave oscillations that can alternate (2:1) or as more complex oscillations. In preliminary studies, we observed in resuscitation patients and in an in vivo translational model of resuscitation from SCA, that rearrest due to VT/VF is preceded by T-wave oscillations that are complex; whereas, rearrest due to pulseless electrical activity (PEA) is preceded by increased T-wave oscillations that alternate. Accordingly, we contend that when T-wave oscillations are complex, repolarization alternans in the myocardium is spatially discordant, which is repolarization alternans occurring out-of-phase in adjacent regions and is highly arrhythmogenic. In contrast, when T-wave oscillations alternate, repolarization alternans in the myocardium is spatially in-phase (concordant), which poses no known immediate arrhythmia risk but is associated with mechanical dysfunction and, thus, PEA. Finally, in the absence of any repolarization alternans, risk of rearrest due to PEA or VT/VF is low. We hypothesize that during resuscitation rearrest due to VT/VF or PEA is strongly linked to repolarization alternans in the myocardium that is spatially discordant or not, respectively, and that specifically targeting the underlying mechanisms can prevent rearrest due to VT/VF and, possibly, PEA. In addition, the full spectrum of ECG T-wave oscillations can be utilized to predict no rearrest and rearrest from VT/VF or PEA and, thus, be used in the future as a biomarker to guide therapy and significantly improve outcomes. Our hypotheses will be tested with the following aims. 1) Determine the mechanistic relationship between cellular repolarization alternans and rearrest due to VT/VF or PEA in an in vivo model of resuscitation. 2) Determine if targeting the mechanisms of repolarization alternans can prevent rearrest during resuscitation, thereby gaining additional mechanistic insight. 3) Develop and test an ECG biomarker for predicting risk of rearrest due to VT/VF and PEA in resuscitation patients. To achieve these aims, we will utilize sophisticated instrumentation and signal processing in an in vivo translational model of resuscitation as well as in pre-hospital and in- hospital resuscitation patients. We have also established a highly translational collaboration that combines expertise in emergency medicine, cardiac arrhythmia, and clinical electrophysiology. Our scientific environment provides a unique opportunity to develop a better understanding of arrhythmia mechanisms relevant to resuscitation in order to develop novel and effective therapies. Project Narrative Sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) due to arrhythmia is a major public health problem and despite significant efforts to improve resuscitation from SCA, rearrest and survival remain poor. Consequently, improved approaches are needed, and NIH has recently identified resuscitation as a high priority for emergency care research. We propose to investigate the mechanisms of rearrest during resuscitation to develop novel and effective therapeutic strategies that improve outcomes.",Novel mechanisms and treatment of arrhythmia during resuscitation,9886863,R01HL142754,"['Acute', 'Arrhythmia', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Circulation', 'Cardiac', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Development', 'Distress', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Emergency Medicine', 'Emergency research', 'Environment', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gap Junctions', 'Heart', 'Heart Arrest', 'Hospitals', 'Ischemia', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanics', 'Metabolic', 'Modeling', 'Myocardial Ischemia', 'Myocardium', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Public Health', 'Reperfusion Therapy', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Sum', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Translating', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Ventricular Fibrillation', 'Ventricular Tachycardia', 'base', 'effective therapy', 'epicardial mapping', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'in vivo', 'in vivo Model', 'insight', 'instrument', 'instrumentation', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'predictive marker', 'prevent', 'rearrest', 'signal processing', 'translational model']",NHLBI,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,668976,0.0073306843015007745
"4D ventricle-valve model risk stratification for planning surgical treatment of ischemic mitral regurgitation Project Summary/Abstract Ischemic mitral regurgitation (IMR) is a disease where the normal mitral valve (MV) structure is dysfunctional due to left ventricular (LV) remodeling after a myocardial infarction (MI). IMR affects nearly 3 million Americans and the magnitude of this problem is expected to grow as the population ages. IMR has a substantial mortality rate that is associated with even mild MR severity. Mitral valve repair with undersized ring annuloplasty has been the preferred treatment strategy for IMR; however, the recurrence of moderate or severe IMR within 12 months of surgery is common. Recent high profile results from the Cardiothoracic Surgical Trials Network (CTSN) mul- ticenter randomized trials on IMR have confirmed a high incidence of early recurrent IMR. More importantly, these studies highlighted the adverse impact of recurrent IMR on LV remodeling and clinical outcomes. The CTSN trials demonstrated no significant difference in LV volume reduction or survival at 12 and 24 months between repair and replacement groups; however, subgroup analysis demonstrated that repair patients that developed recurrent IMR had no reduction in LV volume while repair patients without recurrence experienced LV volume reduction that was superior to patients having valve replacement. The results of the CTSN IMR trials indicate an unmet need for a pre-operative risk stratification tool that reliably predicts MV repair failure. Such a tool would significantly reduce the problem of recurrent IMR by performing valve repair only in patients likely to experience a durable result and performing valve replacement in patients with high risk of recurrence. The long term goal is to improve quality of surgical therapy in IMR by improving risk-stratification pre-operatively using image analysis tools. The overall objective of this proposal is to improve the prediction IMR recurrence by ex- panding this model to include the left ventricle (LV). The rationale is that while IMR manifests as MV malcoapta- tion, the root cause of the disease is LV remodeling. The central hypothesis is that features extracted from the integrated left ventricular and mitral valve (LVMV) model will predict recurrence more accurately than the current MV-only model. To fulfill this objective and test the central hypothesis by pursuing the following specific aims: 1) Develop the 4D integrated LVMV model and compare the accuracy of fitting this model to intraoperative 3DTE images to that of the existing MV-only model. 2) Assess the ability of biomarkers derived from the integrated LVMV model to predict IMR recurrence, and compare to the predictive value of the MV-only model. The project is significant because, if successful, the integrated LVMV model will be incorporated into the Gorman lab ongoing effort translating this technology to the operating room, thus improving survival rates, reducing the impending clinical burden and the number of repeated procedures. Project Narrative The proposed project tackles the high impact problem of ischemic mitral regurgitation (IMR) recurrence after surgical repair by developing a reliable real-time pre-operative risk stratification tool using image analysis of 3D transesophageal echocardiography. This will enable surgeons to optimize mitral surgical treatment in IMR on a case-by-case basis.

Gout flares cause impaired quality of life and physical function, leading to lost work days, disability, high healthcare costs. Patients with gout are also known to be at an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVD), kidney disease, and mortality. Previous studies suggest a potential beneficial effect of urate-lowering therapy on the risk of CVD and renal function. Over the past decade, the American College of Rheumatology and the European League Against Rheumatism recommend a treat-to-target (TTT) approach that lowers serum uric acid (SUA) level below 6 mg/dl to reduce acute gout attacks, based on the upper limit of water solubility of uric acid under normal physiologic circumstances. However, the 2016 American College of Physicians (ACP)’ guidelines for gout management recommend use of urate-lowering therapy but support a ‘treat-to-avoid symptoms’ strategy without monitoring SUA rather than the TTT strategy because of ‘inconclusive’ evidence in the literature. Such discrepancies in treatment guidelines from various societies urge the need for comparative effectiveness research of the treatment strategies for gout.  Rigorous epidemiologic studies utilizing high-quality observational data from electronic health records (EHR) or insurance claims databases can be an important tool for comparative effectiveness research. The primary objective of this 3-year proposal is to provide high-quality, timely evidence on the comparative effectiveness of two different treatment strategies, TTT versus usual care, for management of gout. We will pursue this objective by utilizing the linked Partners’ EHR-Medicare database (2007-2016); this linked database includes all patients aged ≥65 years enrolled in Medicare Parts A/B/D who had ≥1 encounter at one of the Partners Healthcare hospitals. We will have longitudinal, clinically important data on patients’ demographics, body mass index, visit notes, laboratory results including SUA and serum creatinine, as well as all Medicare claims for inpatient and outpatient visits, procedures, and prescription drugs. The two specific aims of this 3-year proposal are: 1) to examine the effect of TTT strategy on the risk of gout flares versus usual care and 2) to assess the effect of TTT strategy on the risk of kidney disease and CVD versus usual care.  Given the substantial prevalence of gout, the suboptimal management of gout and lack of comparative trial of different treatment strategies, this proposed study will make an immediate, important contribution to the management of gout in clinical practice. This work will not only investigate the effects of different treatment strategies on gout flares but also on common comorbidities in patients with gout such as kidney and CVD. Furthermore, this proposed study will advance understanding of how to improve ascertainment of dynamic outcomes and control for time-varying confounding by utilizing sophisticated and innovative epidemiologic as well as bioinformatics methods in a large EHR database linked with Medicare claims. Narrative Gout is a common, painful inflammatory arthritis caused by crystallization of uric acid in joint tissues. Xanthine oxidase inhibitors, allopurinol and febuxostat, are the mainstay of urate-lowering treatment for gout. While rheumatology societies recommend a treat-to-target (TTT) approach that lowers serum uric acid below 6 mg/dl to reduce acute gout attacks, there is currently no clinical data whether TTT approach is better than urate- lowering therapy but no regular monitoring of uric acid levels (i.e., usual care); therefore, this 3-year research proposal examines the comparative effectiveness of the two different treatment strategies, TTT versus usual care, for management of chronic gout in a real-world setting.",Comparative Effectiveness of Treat-To-Target Approach versus Routine Care in Management of Gout,9975704,R01AR073314,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Allopurinol', 'American', 'American College of Physicians', 'Bioinformatics', 'Body mass index', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Practice Guideline', 'Comparative Effectiveness Research', 'Coronary', 'Creatinine', 'Crystallization', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiology', 'European', 'Flare', 'Glomerular Filtration Rate', 'Gold', 'Gout', 'Guidelines', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Insurance', 'Healthcare', 'Heart failure', 'High Prevalence', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hypertension', 'Hyperuricemia', 'Impairment', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Arthritis', 'Inpatients', 'Joints', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Medical Societies', 'Medicare', 'Medicare Part A', 'Medicare claim', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Physical Function', 'Physiological', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Prognostic Factor', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Renal function', 'Research Proposals', 'Rheumatism', 'Rheumatology', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Serum', 'Societies', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stroke', 'Symptoms', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Urate', 'Uric Acid', 'Visit', 'Work', 'active comparator', 'base', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'clinical practice', 'college', 'comorbidity', 'comparative effectiveness', 'comparative trial', 'cost', 'demographics', 'design', 'disability', 'drug efficacy', 'efficacy study', 'electronic data', 'epidemiology study', 'febuxostat', 'human old age (65+)', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insurance claims', 'mortality', 'population based', 'rheumatologist', 'routine care', 'tool', 'treatment as usual', 'treatment guidelines', 'treatment strategy', 'water solubility', 'xanthine oxidase inhibitor']",NIAMS,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2020,435018,-0.04234489588868796
"Development of a novel medication adherability tool to improve cardiovascular disease management Nearly half of patients with heart disease become non-adherent to their prescribed therapies within a year of treatment initiation. This is a central and modifiable reason why cardiovascular disease remains a leading cause of death in the US. Despite numerous attempts to develop interventions aimed at improving adherence, these attempts have had varying and often limited success; one explanation could be that underlying barriers to adherence are not being addressed. Those interventions that have been successful often make medications easier to take but are frequently expensive to implement or deployed too late. Developing a novel provider- facing intervention that modifies medication “adherability”, defined as the properties of medications that make them difficult for patients to take, could be especially impactful and relatively inexpensive. For example, more than 30% of patients report difficulties swallowing prescribed medicines, yet little is known how this “adherability” affects long-term adherence and clinical outcomes, and few interventions focus on these issues.  To this end, Dr. Lauffenburger’s K01 proposal incorporates a novel prophylactic, patient-centric approach to provider behavior change for cardiovascular disease management. Providers often do not know what the medications they prescribe actually look like or what aspects of the medications are acceptable to or preferred by their patients. This study will uniquely incorporate patient perspectives about medication properties that lead to poor adherence in the design of a scalable provider-facing clinical decision support intervention.  The proposed aims are to: (1) develop a comprehensive framework of cardiovascular medication properties, such as appearance, side-effect profiles, or dosing, that may lead to poor adherence using patient focus groups; (2) rigorously evaluate their effects on adherence and clinical outcomes in large national data sources; (3) develop and externally validate a novel clinical prediction rule for medication adherability; and (4) develop and pilot test novel web- and electronic health record-based prescribing tools based on the prediction rule for providers. The expected overall impact of this innovative proposal is that it will fundamentally advance how to personalize medications for patients to ultimately improve adherence and health outcomes.  Dr. Lauffenburger has a unique background as a practicing pharmacist trained in epidemiology with a proven commitment to research. This proposal includes an educational plan that will address gaps in her training: expertise in behavioral sciences, prediction modeling, and implementation research. The mentorship team, led by Niteesh Choudhry, an expert in adherence and implementation, includes well-known experts in cardiovascular trials (Elliott Antman, co-mentor), biostatistics (Robert Glynn, co-mentor), and behavioral sciences (Daniel Solomon, co-mentor), and will ensure scientific success and training. By the conclusion of this program, she will be able to independently design, target, and evaluate behavioral interventions for heart diseases. The results of the proposed K01 will be invaluable pilot work for a planned R01-level application. We propose a novel strategy to address the epidemic of poor adherence to cardiovascular therapies: tailoring medications for vulnerable patients based on their “adherability”, or the properties of medication like dosing frequency, palatability, and side-effect profiles, that make them difficult to take regularly. To achieve the proposed research, we will conduct focus groups with at-risk patients, determine the effect of adherability on long-term adherence and cardiovascular outcomes, develop and validate a novel adherability clinical prediction rule, and pilot test a simple, scalable clinical decision support tool for providers. The overarching goal is to improve clinical outcomes by optimizing medications for patients at the time of prescribing, which is a central mission of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI).",Development of a novel medication adherability tool to improve cardiovascular disease management,9886260,K01HL141538,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Appearance', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Biometry', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cause of Death', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Color', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Deglutition', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Dose', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Focus Groups', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heart Diseases', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Palate', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacists', 'Property', 'Provider', 'Regimen', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Review Literature', 'Risk', 'Route', 'Shapes', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior change', 'cardiometabolism', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'design', 'health belief', 'implementation research', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'medication compliance', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'prophylactic', 'side effect', 'success', 'successful intervention', 'support tools', 'systematic review', 'theories', 'tool', 'virtual']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K01,2020,143581,-0.006428238251354111
"Advancing the Measurement and Classification of Lower Urinary Tract Dysfunction PROJECT SUMMARY Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) are common with high economic and social costs and significant effects on patients’ quality of life. Prevalence of LUTS increases with age, with estimates ranging from 45-70% of U.S. adults. It is clear from the range of conditions that produce LUTS, and the failure of current therapies to ameliorate symptoms in large segments of the population that have similar LUTS, that patients with LUTS are a heterogeneous population even when their symptoms are identical or overlap. Current LUTS treatment paradigms target narrow symptom groups, largely ignoring the heterogeneity in concomitant symptoms. Furthermore, clinicians have a limited understanding on how to integrate information from self-reported symptoms, clinical exam and laboratory results, and urodynamic testing into treatment decision-making. Improving treatment outcomes for patients with LUTS will require both (1) increased understanding of LUTS symptom clusters and underlying mechanisms behind the various subtypes and (2) comprehensive, validated, and responsive measurement tools for defining treatment efficacy. The Symptoms of Lower Urinary Tract Dysfunction Research Network (LURN) was assembled in 2012, the primary objective of which was to categorize patients with LUTS into distinct subgroups, a process known as ‘phenotyping’. The Network’s approach to defining patient subtypes was based on a probability-based consensus clustering approach using a myriad of patient data, resulting in the identification of novel LUTS-based clusters that are statistically and clinically distinct. Concurrently, the Network worked to improve the measurement of patient reports of LUTS through systematic development of a new, high-quality item bank based on qualitative input from patients, community participants, internists, urologists, urogynecologists, and clinical researchers. LURN II will build on the knowledge gained through multiple specific aims: to test and refine the original LURN clustering model in a new cohort including a wider range of symptom severity and a wider range of physical measures (n=1380 participants followed for 3 years); to identify a signature of proteins contained within plasma that can be used to identify specific subgroups of men and women with LUTS; to determine phenotypic characteristics of women with LUTS by measuring the functional components of the lower urinary tract; to validate a self-reported outcome tool for evaluating treatments, based on the comprehensive tool developed for phenotyping in LURN I; and to explore promising alternative analytic approaches to existing and future LURN data and characterize the broader experiences of patients with LUTS. This proposal brings together a multidisciplinary team of urologists, urogynecologists, bladder physiologists, data scientists, epidemiologists, and outcomes researchers.

"Quantifying Microbial Keratitis to Predict Outcomes: An Imaging and Epidemiologic Approach PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT For epidemiological studies, future clinical trials, and personalized patient care, there is a critical need to create a risk-stratification system for microbial keratitis. Microbial keratitis (MK), a debilitating, infectious corneal disease, is estimated to be the fourth-leading cause of blindness worldwide. MK severity depends on a complex interaction of patient, organism, and environment, resulting in a spectrum of clinical presentations and responses to treatment. Clinical presentations manifest with unique morphology features and clinical symptoms. Morphology features are visible in the cornea, and symptoms are measurable. But most patients are treated with non-specific broad-spectrum antimicrobials, an approach that increases antimicrobial resistance. This non-specific treatment approach lacks congruence with the unique MK presentations. There is a critical need for a new strategy to personalize treatments for MK and measure treatment efficacy. With quantified MK morphologic and clinical features, clinicians will have the tools to risk-stratify patients. The long-term goal is to develop rapid, objective, personalized treatment plans for patients with MK. This proposal’s objective is to quantify dynamic morphologic and clinical MK features using image and electronic health record (EHR) analyses and then build a risk-stratification scoring system associated with MK outcomes. The proposed research will test the hypothesis that morphologic and clinical features accurately risk- stratify patients for corneal and vision outcomes. Our premise is supported by preliminary data demonstrating that: (1) different organisms generate distinct morphologic and clinical features; (2) clinicians quantify morphology less precisely than image-analysis methods, (3) an expert is able to use MK features to tailor treatments; (4) the use of quantified features has improved outcomes in other diseases, such as diabetic retinopathy, by helping providers to tailor treatments; (5) EHR data can be used to quantify and classify clinical disease features accurately; and (6) EHR data can be used effectively to risk-stratify patients. Aim 1 will develop objective image analysis tools to measure features of MK with existing clinical equipment. Aim 2 will evaluate MK treatment efficacy using morphologic image analysis and clinical features from prospective surveys. Aim 3 will risk-stratify patients with MK by combining image analysis and EHR extracted data. The expected outcomes are: (1) characterized databases of MK images and linked clinical data, (2) quantified MK features across a spectrum of clinical presentations, (3) performance-tested, open-source imaging algorithms and surveys to measure MK markers dynamically, and (4) a novel risk stratification model and scoring system. The resultant work will have significant value to clinicians. Clinicians can use practical, low-cost technologies and readily-available EHR data to quantify MK features and risk-stratify patients in order to tailor treatments. NARRATIVE The clinical management of microbial keratitis is imprecise and dependent on the expertise of the treating physician. Our innovative strategies will quantify corneal features using image analysis and available clinical data from the electronic health record. Quantified image features will be linked to health outcomes to give physicians new tools to risk-stratify patients and to tailor their management to optimize outcomes.",Quantifying Microbial Keratitis to Predict Outcomes: An Imaging and Epidemiologic Approach,9865483,R01EY031033,"['Algorithms', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Blindness', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Control Groups', 'Cornea', 'Corneal Diseases', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Databases', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Equipment', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Inflammatory', 'Keratitis', 'Link', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'National Eye Institute', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Provider', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Self-Examination', 'Severities', 'Standardization', 'Strategic Planning', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Universities', 'Virulence', 'Vision', 'Visual Acuity', 'Work', 'antimicrobial', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'care systems', 'case control', 'clinical risk', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'epidemiology study', 'healing', 'improved outcome', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'microbial', 'novel', 'open source', 'outcome prediction', 'patient stratification', 'performance tests', 'personalized care', 'personalized medicine', 'primary outcome', 'prospective', 'slit lamp imaging', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'treatment response']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2020,410000,-0.0347391189271837
"Multi-Omic Markers of Cardiac Function and Structure within the Pressure Overloaded Heart PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This proposed study is motivated by the public health importance of aortic stenosis (AS), a common form of valvular heart disease that is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. Once symptomatic, survival is a dismal 50% at 1-year if left untreated. Clinical symptoms develop once cardiac compensatory mechanisms fail, indicating the need for aortic valve replacement (AVR), but because AS primarily affects the elderly, symptoms are often incorrectly attributed to comorbid conditions, advanced age, or both—resulting in delayed treatment. While most patients that eventually undergo AVR experience improvements in symptoms and survival, nearly half of patients die within the first year after AVR or fail to reap the symptom and health status improvements for which they underwent AVR. Our research suggests that irreversible cardiac remodeling and injury related to delayed treatment contribute to these poor clinical outcomes, highlighting the unmet need for objective and sensitive measures to inform clinical decisions regarding the timing of AVR. Our long-term goal is to develop and implement an omics-based precision medicine approach for identifying patients with severe AS at-risk for irreversible cardiac remodeling and injury who would benefit from earlier AVR, and our central hypothesis is that multi-omic signatures reflective of dimensions of cardiac structure and function will identify irreversible cardiac remodeling and therefore predict the clinical response to AVR. Our prior work and preliminary studies provide strong support for our hypothesis and demonstrate that our experienced multidisciplinary team is uniquely qualified to complete the proposed study. We have identified metabolomic signatures that relate strongly to measures of cardiac function and structure and predict mortality after AVR, and also proteomic signatures relating to cardiac function that differentiate severe AS and associate with mortality. Within this proposal, we adopt a longitudinal systems biology approach that leverages the latest in proteomic and metabolomic (multi-omic) sciences to: discover, test, and cross-validate multi-omic signatures of cardiac function and structure in patients with severe AS (Aim 1); characterize longitudinal multi-omic signatures and associations with changes in cardiac structure and function after AVR (Aim 2); and evaluate the accuracy with which multi-omic signatures predict response to AVR (Aim 3). Our approach will enable us to identify multi-omic signatures of irreversible cardiac remodeling and injury in patients with severe AS. These data will support the development of new precision medicine-based strategies for identifying patients who would benefit from earlier clinical intervention in an effort to reduce mortality and maximize health after AVR. PROJECT NARRATIVE Aortic stenosis ultimately leads to heart failure and death, but valve replacement is curative. For many patients, valve replacement is performed too late, after damage to the heart muscle is no longer reversible, resulting in persistent symptoms and increased risk for death. The goal of my research is to identify compounds within the blood that can serve as an early warning that the heart is struggling to overcome aortic stenosis and can therefore help physicians plan the optimal timing of valve replacement surgery.",Multi-Omic Markers of Cardiac Function and Structure within the Pressure Overloaded Heart,9946858,R01HL151838,"['Adopted', 'Affect', 'Aortic Valve Stenosis', 'Biological Process', 'Blood', 'Cardiac', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Practice Guideline', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Distress', 'EFRAC', 'Early Intervention', 'Elderly', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Heart', 'Heart Injuries', 'Heart Valve Diseases', 'Heart failure', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Left', 'Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction', 'Left Ventricular Remodeling', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial dysfunction', 'Myocardium', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Prospective cohort', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Ventricular', 'Work', 'aortic valve replacement', 'classification algorithm', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'experience', 'heart dimension/size', 'heart function', 'metabolomics', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple omics', 'patient registry', 'persistent symptom', 'precision medicine', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predicting response', 'predictive signature', 'pressure', 'protein metabolite', 'proteomic signature', 'response', 'valve replacement']",NHLBI,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2020,696226,0.016457220814910647
"Flexible Bayesian approaches to causal inference with multilevel survival data and multiple treatments Project Summary Combining comparative effectiveness research (CER) and dissemination and implementation research is playing an increased role in public health and health care service by allowing practitioners to make informed decisions about treatments and improving adoption of evidence-based practices. In circumstances where CER questions do not lend themselves to direct experimentation or in implementation trials where incomplete adoption of in- tervention occurs, causal inference tools for “ﬁeld data” are recommended for evaluating treatment effects. The increased complexities in large national electronic health databases pose challenges for statistical analyses and demand approaches beyond conventional causal inference techniques, which have traditionally focused on bi- nary treatment. Given the wealth of information captured in large-scale data, it is rare that treatment regimens are deﬁned in terms of two treatments only. The data are typically pooled from treating facilities across the nation with considerable variability in the institutional effect. Although it has been established that popular tools for bi- nary treatment are inappropriate for the multiple treatment setting, and that ignoring the multilevel data structure can bias the estimate of the treatment effect, few alternative methods have been proposed to deal with both complications simultaneously. The ﬁrst aim of our proposed project is to develop a novel and ﬂexible Bayesian approach to estimating the causal effects of multiple treatments on survival with clustered data. We then fully investigate the operating characteristics of our proposed method in a variety of simulated scenarios and contrast it with approaches often used in practice. For causal estimates to be unbiased, researchers commonly make the assumption of no unmeasured confounding (UMC). Though highly recommended with binary treatment, there is no known implementation or framework for sensitivity analysis with multiple treatments and multilevel survival data. The second aim of our project is to develop and apply a ﬂexible and interpretable Bayesian approach to assessing the sensitivity of causal estimates to possible departures from the assumption of no UMC, at both cluster- and individual-level. This approach is capable of gauging the amount of unobserved confounding needed to change the direction of the observed treatment effects Our project will apply the developed methods in the ﬁrst two aims to a large representative high-risk localized prostate cancer population, drawn from the National Cancer Data Base, to evaluate the average causal effects of three popular treatment options on survival and evaluate how unmeasured confounding might alter causal conclusions. We also will estimate treatment heterogeneity and identify distinct subgroups of patients for which a treatment is effective or harmful. Our methods will establish the effectiveness component and lay the groundwork for building the cost-effectiveness models, and provide evidence for further investigations of variations in intervention implementation and modiﬁcations in recommendations for treatments leading to different patient outcomes. To facilitate the dissemination of our work, we will share the underlying statistical code via an R package. Project Narrative As public health comparisons often involve more than two treatments on patients from multiple care centers, comparative effectiveness research and implementation research call for advanced causal inference techniques allowing for the estimation of multiple treatment effects while respecting the multilevel data structure. We de- velop a new approach to simultaneously contrast the effectiveness of multiple treatments on clustered survival outcomes, propose and apply a new framework for testing the assumptions behind these estimates, and propose a strategy for estimating treatment effect heterogeneity and identifying distinct subgroups of patients for which a treatment is harmful or effective. Our work will provide practitioners clarity with respect to estimating causes and effects from complicated health care databases in which the comparative assessment of multiple treatment options from multilevel survival data is challenging but imperative.",Flexible Bayesian approaches to causal inference with multilevel survival data and multiple treatments,10056850,R21CA245855,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Androgens', 'Bayesian Method', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Brachytherapy', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Practice Patterns', 'Code', 'Comparative Effectiveness Research', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Effectiveness', 'Event', 'Evidence based practice', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Output', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prostate Cancer therapy', 'Public Health', 'Radiation therapy', 'Radical Prostatectomy', 'Recommendation', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Source', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Subgroup', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Trees', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer epidemiology', 'comparative', 'complex data ', 'cost effectiveness', 'data structure', 'data tools', 'deprivation', 'design', 'dissemination research', 'effective therapy', 'epidemiology study', 'flexibility', 'health care service', 'high risk', 'implementation research', 'implementation trial', 'improved', 'interest', 'large scale data', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'patient subsets', 'regression trees', 'simulation', 'structured data', 'survival outcome', 'tool', 'treatment arm', 'treatment choice', 'treatment effect', 'user-friendly']",NCI,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R21,2020,459480,-0.01042329050861706
"Biomarking IBD patient-specific disease features using the epithelial antigenic peptidome Project Summary/Abstract  In immune-mediated diseases such as type1 diabetes, target-cell autoantibodies have emerged as important clinical biomarkers of pre-clinical disease progression and mechanistic disease subsets. However, with the focus on genetics, inflammatory effectors, and microbiome, there has not been a modern search for such antibody biomarkers and the potential contribution of anti-epithelial autoimmunity in IBD. This project tests the hypothesis that ulcerative colitis phenotypes are distinguished by autoantibodies to mucosal epithelial proteins, addressed in two aims.  In the first aim, we apply the innovative peptide expression display (PED) technology to display and analyze the antigenic epithelial peptidome. This includes bioinformatically determining a comprehensive tabulation of human proteins with high likelihood for antigenicity and ileal-colonic epithelial expression; and, representing these proteins as tiled peptide epitopes with linked cognate oligonucleotides suitable for NGS-based identification and quantitation.  In the second aim, we will assess archival sera of 654 well-characterized colonic IBD patients and non-IBD controls to quantitate individual profiles of epithelial protein binding in relation to two outcomes of ulcerative colitis (UC). The significance of the project has been endorsed by the IBD Genetics Consortium (IBDGC), which made the UC colectomy cohort a research priority, and will collaborate with this R21 via archival serum samples and associated genetics and clinical metadata from the consortium UC patients and controls. Our primary study will compare 300 UC subjects, equally divided into severe and mild phenotypes of outcome based on time to colectomy. Our secondary study will compare 154 UC post-colectomy pouch patients, divided into severe and absent pouchitis phenotypes. We will also study two age-matched reference populations. Bioinformatic analyses will test for shared peptide specificities associated with disease state (UC vs. non-IBD controls) and each of the two extreme phenotypes (severe vs. mild UC; chronic pouchitis vs. late non-pouchitis). We also will perform exploratory tests for the role of IBD predictive risk scores and select genetic loci on autoantibody specificities.  If successful, this project will establish feasibility for the hypothesis, and foundational targets to pursue mechanistic and clinical biomarker studies that may validate and refine its implications for IBD pathogenesis and clinical applications. Project narrative In immune-mediated diseases such as type-1 diabetes, target-cell autoantibodies have emerged as important clinical biomarkers of pre-clinical disease progression and mechanistic disease subsets.

"Improving Glycemic Management in Patients with Type 1 Diabetes Using a Context-aware Automated Insulin Delivery System Project Summary Automated insulin delivery (AID) systems offer substantial opportunities for helping people with type 1 diabetes (T1D) to improve glucose control and lower HbA1c. However, the AID has only shown a benefit during the nighttime when meals, exercise, and stress do not significantly challenge the AID. Furthermore, hypoglycemia (<70 mg/dL) remains a common occurrence in people with type 1 diabetes and continues to occur even in the setting of AID, particularly with exercise. Integrating context awareness into an AID has the potential to improve glycemic time in range (70-180 mg/dL) during the daytime and reduce and possibly eliminate hypoglycemia. Contextual information can include inferred food intake, insulin dosing, inferred exercise type and duration, as well as movement patterns. An AID can be designed to recognize contextual patterns that relate to poor glycemic responses to meals and hypoglycemia and then adjust insulin dosing in response to these patterns in advance and help mitigate these problems. In this grant, we will explore how contextual information may be used within an AID to help (1) avoid hypoglycemia and (2) reduce postprandial dysglycemia. We will first conduct a data gathering study whereby we will collect a rich data set from people with T1D who will use sensor augmented pump therapy to manage their glucose. Data will be collected from these 30 patients over 28 days; data will include multivariable contextual information including continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data, insulin data, food data, physical activity data (heart rate and accelerometry), as well as indoor/outdoor contextual movement patterns gathered using a novel beacon-based context-aware sensing system called MotioWear developed by our group in collaboration with our industry partner MotioSens. Next, we will utilize this contextual data set to construct a Bayesian glucose prediction algorithm. This will include a clustering algorithm that will group contextual sequences that are similar with each other and which lead to similar glycemic outcomes. This context-aware glucose prediction algorithm will be integrated into an adaptive, personalized, smartwatch-based context-aware AID (CA-AID) system. Contextual patterns that have a high likelihood of leading to hypoglycemia or postprandial dysglycemia will inform an insulin dosing aggressiveness factor to be adjusted for similar contextual sequences observed in the future (i.e. the CA-AID will reduce insulin for contextual sequences with high likelihood of hypoglycemia such as aerobic exercise). We expect that integrating context awareness into an AID will lead to significant improvements in time in target range during the day and will help reduce time in hypoglycemia. The CA-AID will be evaluated for safety in a small pilot study. We will then evaluate the CA-AID within a 6 week clinical study in 40 adults with type 1 diabetes on insulin pump therapy. Twenty will receive the CA-AID while the other 20 will receive a standard (non-context-aware) AID. The primary outcome measures of this study is the percent time in range. We hypothesize that the CA-AID will increase time in range by 10% as compared with a non-context aware AID. Project Narrative Diabetes is the leading cause of blindness, kidney failure, and non-traumatic amputations. While automated insulin delivery systems can help people with type 1 diabetes better manage their glucose levels during the night, improved glycemic control during the day has not been demonstrated and hypoglycemia continues to be a problem, especially during exercise. We propose to develop and evaluate in a clinical study a context-aware automated insulin delivery system that learns patterns of daily living, meal patterns, glucose patterns, insulin dosing patterns, and physical activity patterns that relate to dysglycemia and adapts the gains within the AID to improve postprandial time in target range (70-180 mg/dL) and reduce hypoglycemia.",Improving Glycemic Management in Patients with Type 1 Diabetes Using a Context-aware Automated Insulin Delivery System,9977179,R01DK122583,"['Accelerometer', 'Adult', 'Aerobic Exercise', 'Algorithms', 'Awareness', 'Beds', 'Behavior', 'Blindness', 'Calibration', 'Cellular Phone', 'Clinic', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Dose', 'Eating', 'Engineering', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Food', 'Future', 'Glucose', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'Grant', 'Heart Rate', 'Home environment', 'Hyperglycemia', 'Hypoglycemia', 'Insulin', 'Insulin Infusion Systems', 'Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Kidney Failure', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Movement', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Outpatients', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Pilot Projects', 'Pump', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Restaurants', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Safety', 'Schedule', 'Stress', 'System', 'Tactile', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Wrist', 'arm', 'base', 'blood glucose regulation', 'cohort', 'design', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'expectation', 'fitbit', 'fitness', 'glucose monitor', 'glucose sensor', 'glycemic control', 'high risk', 'improved', 'industry partner', 'machine learning algorithm', 'novel', 'prediction algorithm', 'primary outcome', 'recruit', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'sensor', 'smart watch', 'two-arm study', 'usability', 'wearable sensor technology']",NIDDK,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,653880,-0.018868870128837915
"Learning-Based Approach for Personalized Craniomaxillofacial Surgical Planning Abstract: Our main clinical objective for this project is to provide personalized precision care to patients with craniomaxillofacial (CMF) deformities by significantly improving the surgical planning method. CMF deformities involve congenital and acquired deformities of the jaws and face. A large number of patients in the US and around the world suffer from CMF deformities. The basic principles of CMF surgery involve the restoration of deformed CMF structures back to normal anatomy and functions with osteotomy, autologous, bone grafts, or vascularized free flaps. The success of CMF surgery depends on not only the technical aspects of the operation, but also, to a large extent, the precise formulation of a surgical plan. However, CMF surgical planning is extremely challenging due to the complex nature of CMF anatomy and deformity. During a routine CMF surgical planning, a surgeon first acquires a three-dimensional (3D) model of the patient's skull. He then performs 3D cephalometric analysis to quantify the deformity. Finally, the surgery is simulated by virtually cutting the 3D model into multiple bony segments. The surgeon then tries his best to move and rotate each segment individually to a desired position within the normal range of cephalometric values (the current standard of care). This is problematic as “normal” cephalometric values are the averageness of normal population, in which each value has a mean and a standard deviation. Due to the variation within the normal values, the surgeon must often guess what the exact value the patient's cephalometric measurement should be corrected to. In addition, cephalometry is a group of only linear and angular measurements, which certainly cannot represent the complex nature of human CMF structures. Therefore, surgical outcomes are often subjective and heavily dependent on the surgeons' experience and artistic talent. Because each human face is different, the average “normal values” cannot represent the complex morphology of each individual face. To this end, we hypothesize that if a surgeon can foresee what the normal CMF shape of the patient should be, the surgical plan will be objective and personalized. Therefore, in this project, we propose developing and validating a new surgical planning method of using patient-specific and anatomically-correct reference models. The feasibility of our approach has already been proven by our preliminary studies. The results of this project will significantly improve the quality of patient care by developing personalized and precise surgical plans for CMF surgery objectively. The results will be especially beneficial to patients with jaw deformities, syndromic and non-syndromic craniofacial deformities, trauma, and CMF cancer. In the future, our approach can also be used to design and print 3D patient-specific resorbable bone implants with tissue engineering capability for bone regeneration. Project Narrative:  The current standard of care of making treatment plan for patients with craniomaxillofacial (CMF)  deformities is cephalometric analysis, including a group of linear and angular measurements, which  cannot represent the complex morphology of human CMF facial structures.  We propose to develop and validate an innovative shape-based surgical planning method of using  patient-specific and anatomically-correct reference models, for replacing the current subjective  cephalometric method.  The results of this project will significantly improve the quality of patient care by developing  personalized and precise surgical plans for CMF surgery objectively, which is especially beneficial  to the patients with jaw deformities, syndromic and non-syndromic deformities, trauma, and CMF cancer.",Learning-Based Approach for Personalized Craniomaxillofacial Surgical Planning,9950849,R01DE027251,"['3-Dimensional', '3D Print', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Autologous', 'Back', 'Bilateral', 'Blood Vessels', 'Bone Regeneration', 'Bone Tissue', 'Bone Transplantation', 'Cephalometry', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computer Assisted', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Deformity', 'Development', 'Ensure', 'Face', 'Formulation', 'Future', 'Head', 'Human', 'Human Characteristics', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Jaw', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Motivation', 'Nature', 'Normal Range', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Orthodontics', 'Osteotomy', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Quality of Care', 'Research', 'Running', 'Shapes', 'Structure', 'Surgeon', 'Surgical Flaps', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Talents', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissue Engineering', 'Tissue Model', 'Trauma', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'bone', 'cone-beam computed tomography', 'craniofacial', 'craniomaxillofacial', 'cranium', 'deep learning', 'design', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'knowledge base', 'novel', 'operation', 'personalized approach', 'personalized care', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'psychologic', 'restoration', 'skull base', 'soft tissue', 'standard of care', 'success', 'surgery outcome', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'treatment planning', 'two-dimensional', 'usability', 'user-friendly', 'virtual reality simulator', 'virtual surgery']",NIDCR,METHODIST HOSPITAL RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2020,574725,0.005372292771257844
"Secure Homomorphically Encrypted National Registry of COVID-19 Recovered Plasma Donors PROJECT SUMMARY Treatment with convalescent plasma (CP) was recently approved by the FDA for seriously ill patients of COVID-19. There are many institutions and hospitals that have implemented CP programs, but they all face the challenge of finding sufficient and appropriate donors. The constraints of matching, imbalances in supply and demand, and privacy concerns pose several challenges to engage donors. Considering multiple stakeholders (patients, donors, hospitals), we will develop new algorithms based on multikey homomorphic encryption to protect the privacy of patients and donors, with additional functionality to simplify the registration process, and conduct optimization for plasma donation (of patients who recovered from COVID-19). We are dedicated to the public good and will make freely available the code / resources developed within the framework of this project. If we succeed, our project will build a secure national registry for potential plasma donors and may save many lives. Narrative We are proposing a novel platform for convalescent plasma donation with integrated privacy protection and resource optimization. The goal is to remove the barriers and concerns for COVID-19 recovered patients to donate their plasma to save severely ill patients.

"A Novel, Low-Cost Device to Guide Peripherally Inserted Central Catheter (PICC) Line Placement Abstract In the United States alone, more than three million peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) are placed each year to provide IV therapies, where navigation through the venous system is typically performed blind, or without navigation guidance. Improper PICC placement is relatively common, is costly, and has serious complications for critically-ill patients. Unfortunately, under blind placement 30-55% of PICC tips are not optimally placed on the first attempt and require repositioning, which has an average direct cost of $223 per patient and often necessitates the removal and reinsertion of the catheter line that carries a 4-6% risk of pneumothorax. Moreover, approximately 17% of these improperly positioned PICCs are placed into the right atrium, which is associated with a multitude of life-threatening complications. Improper placement of PICCs also often requires referral to an interventional radiologist for fluoroscopic-guided central line placement, which is expensive ($1,000) and requires more radiation exposure for the patient. Not surprisingly, over half of all PICCs are administered to patients over the age of 60. Therefore, safe and accurate PICC placement is critical for providing high-quality care to older Americans. Despite serious adverse events associated with blind placement of PICC lines, current vascular access systems have not been widely adopted. The Teleflex ARROW® G4 VPS and the Bard Sherlock 3CG® TCS are PICC guidance systems that employ ECG for positioning the PICC tip into the correct location: the region that includes the lower superior vena cava (SVC) and cavoatrial junction (CAJ). While these procedures often limit the need for a confirmatory X-ray, they have poor and variable successful placement rates (44-84%), are 30-70% more expensive than standard PICCs, require skilled staff, and have significantly longer procedure times as compared to standard, blind PICC placement. Additionally, these guidance systems rely on the use of ECG, which is ineffective for patients with cardiac arrhythmias, a condition that affects approximately 16% of all patients requiring a PICC line. To address the need for accurate, safe, and cost- effective PICC placement, Piccolo Medical has developed the Smart PICC™ system, a point-of-care catheter system that uses unique hemodynamic signatures of different vascular regions for real-time vascular access guidance into the SVC/CAJ. The goals of this Phase II proposal are to validate the accuracy of the Piccolo Smart PICC™ for navigation and placement of a PICC tip into the SVC or CAJ for adult patients with and without cardiac arrhythmias. First, we will verify the sensitivity of the Smart PICC™ system algorithm to identify correct PICC placement in adult patients with both normal and altered cardiac rhythms (Aim 1). Second, we will compare the accuracy of the Smart PICC™ system to the most widely used catheter navigation system (BD’s Sherlock 3CG® TCS) in a head-to-head superiority study (Aim 2).The data obtained will support FDA 510(k) clearance and will allow us to commercialize the system within ~2.5 years of the funding of this proposal. Narrative Peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) are widely used to provide life-sustaining intravenous therapies, where navigation through the venous system is typically performed blind, or without navigation guidance. Commercially available PICC navigation systems can be effective, but have limitations that have impeded adoption into the clinic. We propose an inexpensive, easily operated catheter system for real-time vascular access guidance that addresses the limitations of current systems.","A Novel, Low-Cost Device to Guide Peripherally Inserted Central Catheter (PICC) Line Placement",10019319,R44AG060793,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Area Under Curve', 'Arrhythmia', 'Automobile Driving', 'Blinded', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiac', 'Catheters', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Direct Costs', 'Distal', 'EKG P Wave', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Excision', 'Family suidae', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Heart Atrium', 'Heart Valves', 'Infusion procedures', 'Intervention', 'Intravenous', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Location', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Multi-site clinical study', 'Myocardial', 'Navigation System', 'Nurses', 'Patients', 'Perforation', 'Performance', 'Peripheral', 'Phase', 'Pneumothorax', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Quality of Care', 'ROC Curve', 'Radiation exposure', 'Randomized', 'Real-Time Systems', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Right atrial structure', 'Risk', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Savings', 'Serious Adverse Event', 'Signal Transduction', 'Superior vena cava structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Thermodilution', 'Thoracic Radiography', 'Thrombus', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Venous system', 'Work', 'base', 'blind', 'cohort', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'follow-up', 'heart rhythm', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'novel', 'point of care', 'pre-clinical', 'radiologist', 'sensor']",NIA,"PICCOLO MEDICAL, INC.",R44,2020,561565,0.0167845646202491
"Network for Cardiothoracic Surgical Investigations in Cardiovascular Medicine Project Summary Cardiac surgery has been a highly innovative field of medicine. The introduction of major innovations, and ongoing incremental change in existing ones, have extended survival and improved quality of life for many patients suffering from cardiac disease. A rapid pace of innovation requires a rigorous infrastructure for clinical evaluation that provides timely assessments of the value of new and modified treatments. The Cardiothoracic Surgical Trials Network (CTSN) was created to provide a rigorous evidence base tor the surgical treatment of cardiothoracic disease. The International Center for Health Outcomes and Innovation Research (InCHOIR) enthusiastically embraces the opportunity to continue to work in partnership with clinical investigators and the NIH as the CTSN DCC. The Network has developed a rich research agenda for the renewal that includes trials of novel neuroprotective agents, long-term antithrombotic strategies, new regenerative medicine therapies, and surgical approaches to valvular disease, heart failure and atrial fibrillation. Given our long-standing interest and experience in the design and analysis of cardiac surgery multicenter studies, we are in a strong position to serve as the coordinating center for this vital clinical research effort. In particular, we will provide leadership in designing novel trials that optimize sample size, include patient- centered as well as clinical endpoints, and collect data from a variety of sources, including electronic data capture systems, mobile apps and wearable sensors, registries and electronic health records. We have a strong track record of obtaining efficient regulatory approval for our trials from the FDA and Health Canada, training and monitoring sites nationally and internationally, ensuring robust enrollment and retention, data management and quality assurance, data sharing, and overall administrative coordination. We have the infrastructure to expand our trials to include mechanistic studies that use biospecimens collected and managed through the CTSN biorepository. Finally, the DCC plays an important role in the analysis, interpretation and dissemination of research findings. We will continue to support the process of publishing in high-impact journals that should lead to revision of practice guidelines and to surgical practice itself. This goal should be further optimized by incorporating Implementation Science approaches into Network trials, which should decrease the well-recognized gap between publication of trial results and adoption of findings into widespread practice. NARRATIVE Clinical trials are a critical step in translating discoveries into better treatments for people burdened by cardiac disorders. Such trials typically require cooperation and coordination among a broad range of investigators, patients, government agencies, and industry partners. The objective of the Cardiothoracic Surgical Trials Network (CTSN) is to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of clinical research through shared infrastructure for important trials that will advance therapy for patients suffering from cardiac disease.",Network for Cardiothoracic Surgical Investigations in Cardiovascular Medicine,9914111,U01HL088942,"['Address', 'Administrative Coordination', 'Adoption', 'Agreement', 'Ancillary Study', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Canada', 'Cardiac Surgery procedures', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Data Monitoring Committees', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Data Coordinating Center', 'Data Management Resources', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Event', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Government Agencies', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart failure', 'Industry', 'Information Technology', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Journals', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Link', 'Longterm Follow-up', 'Manuscripts', 'Mediation', 'Medicine', 'Monitor', 'Multicenter Studies', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neuroprotective Agents', 'Online Systems', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Practice Guidelines', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Regenerative Medicine', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Review Committee', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Sample Size', 'Secure', 'Serious Adverse Event', 'Site', 'Source', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visit', 'Work', 'adjudicate', 'adjudication', 'base', 'biobank', 'clinical center', 'clinical infrastructure', 'clinical practice', 'clinical research site', 'data integrity', 'data management', 'data quality', 'data sharing', 'design', 'dissemination research', 'electronic data', 'electronic data capture system', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'implementation research', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'industry partner', 'innovation', 'interest', 'international center', 'large datasets', 'meetings', 'mobile application', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient oriented', 'performance site', 'prospective', 'quality assurance', 'recruit', 'research clinical testing', 'research data dissemination', 'screening', 'tool', 'trial design', 'wearable sensor technology']",NHLBI,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,U01,2020,7231781,0.009599707395006967
"Predicting Urinary Continence Status with Sacral Neuromodulation and Botulinum Toxin Treatments PROJECT SUMMARY Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms (LUTS) include urinary urgency, incontinence, and nocturia, afflict roughly 50% of the adult population, and have substantial, wide-ranging impact. Many gaps remain in our understanding of these symptoms, leading to inadequate treatment. Urgency urinary incontinence, one form of LUTS, was the focus of two recent multi-site clinical trials (Anticholinergic vs. Botox Comparison Study or ABC and Refractory Overactive Bladder: Sacral NEuromodulation vs. BoTulinum Toxin Assessment or ROSETTA). These trials compared the efficacy of urgency urinary incontinence therapies, 100 Units (U) Onabotulinum Toxin A (Botox) versus an anticholinergic medication (ABC) and 200U Botox versus sacral neuromodulation (SNM)(ROSETTA). These studies compared whether on average 100U Botox was superior to a standard anticholinergic regimen (ABC) and whether 200U Botox was superior to SNM (ROSETTA). The objective of this K01 proposal is to use the same clinical trial data to create predictive models that accurately estimate the likelihood that a patient will respond to Botox and SNM treatments, as well as the likelihood of developing urinary retention or urinary tract infections (risks associated with Botox treatment). In addition to medical histories and questionnaires some of the predictive models will incorporate diagnostic measurements, both standard and novel, from tests of bladder function (urodynamics). This approach will allow for the formal assessment of the utility of urodynamics in guiding treatment decisions, something that is currently debated in the field. This project will result in innovative models which can be used to: 1) predict whether a patient will respond to Botox and SNM treatments and the likelihood of adverse events (Botox only); 2) determine the utility of urodynamics data in predicting patient response to treatment and 3) identify patients that are resistant to treatment, so as to guide future research. These models will offer a patient specific, data-driven approach to treatment that will greatly benefit patient care and help reduce costs to the health care system. This project will also provide training in predictive modeling and clinical benign urology under the guidance of an experienced mentoring team. The candidate’s long-term objective is to lead a strong independent research program to design new therapies for patients with (LUTS) informed by both animal and human studies, and to match patients with suitable therapies based on individual patient characteristics (personalized medicine). PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will result in predictive models that clinicians can use to help guide patients when selecting third line therapies for urgency incontinence; providing patients with tailored estimates of how likely it is that they will respond successfully to sacral neuromodulation or intradetrusor Onabotulinum Toxin A. These models will make use of individual characteristics (i.e. personalized medicine), rather than using the current practice, a one-size-fits-all approach, for guiding treatment selection. By improving the match between therapies and patients, it is expected that these models will ultimately improve the quality of treatment that patients receive as well as reduce healthcare costs.",Predicting Urinary Continence Status with Sacral Neuromodulation and Botulinum Toxin Treatments,9977422,K01DK121866,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Adverse event', 'Aftercare', 'Animals', 'Anti-Cholinergics', 'Benign', 'Bladder', 'Bladder Control', 'Botox', 'Botulinum Toxins', 'Catheters', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Diagnostic', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Medical History', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Nocturia', 'Overactive Bladder', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Questionnaires', 'Refractory', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Residual volume', 'Resistance', 'Sampling', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Human Experimentation', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'Urge Incontinence', 'Urinary Incontinence', 'Urinary Retention', 'Urinary tract infection', 'Urodynamics', 'Urology', 'Woman', 'alpha Toxin', 'base', 'comparative efficacy', 'cost', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'expectation', 'experience', 'feature selection', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'infection risk', 'innovation', 'lower urinary tract symptoms', 'mathematical model', 'micturition urgency', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient response', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'primary outcome', 'programs', 'response', 'shared decision making', 'signal processing', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'trial comparing']",NIDDK,DUKE UNIVERSITY,K01,2020,22825,0.01813274295661301
"A peptide-based point-of-care vertical flow assay for the rapid diagnosis of Lyme disease Project Summary There is an obvious need for new approaches and better assays for the laboratory diagnosis of Lyme disease. All attempts to develop a practical assay for the direct detection of Borrelia burgdorferi in infected patients have failed. Thus far, all proposed alternatives to serology have been unsuccessful, not cost-effective, or are still in early development. Improving serological detection in early disease is the fastest and most effective way to improve patient outcomes in Lyme disease. The antigen targets utilized in current serodiagnostic assays have considerable defects. They often contain conserved epitopes that cross-react with antibodies raised to other antigens, reducing specificity and requiring the use of a two-tier seroassay paradigm that preserves specificity at the cost of poor sensitivity in the detection of early disease. The use of peptides as serodiagnostic targets demonstrate improved efficacy, but the use of one or two peptides containing single epitopes still provides re- duced sensitivity in early disease. Putting the same old antigen targets into new platforms, no matter how in- novative the platform, will not succeed in improving serodiagnostics for Lyme disease. Both the target anti- gens and assays need an innovative approach. By incorporating unique peptides containing linear epitopes highly specific to B. burgdorferi, into a cutting-edge, multiplex, portable paper-based point-of-care diagnostic assay that uses a cost-effective smartphone-based reader, we aim to transform the diagnosis of Lyme disease. An ideal test for Lyme disease could be performed in a single step and yield an answer on the spot to support diagnosis and direct the course of clinical treatment. We have developed an innovative vertical-flow assay which allows for the multiplexed detection of IgM and IgG binding of up to 25 independent antigen targets in a point-of-care setting. The VFA design allows for uniform flow of sample across the target membrane, creating uniform binding conditions and maximizing developed signal. We coupled this design with a cost-effective portable smart-phone based reader allowing for quantitative measure of antibody binding, eliminating subjectiv- ity. By multiplexing peptide antigens each containing 1-2 epitopes unique to B. burgdorferi from multiple differ- ent antigens expressed at different stages during mammalian infection we can generate a single tier, POC as- say that can specifically and sensitively detect patient antibody at all stages of the disease. The assay can be completed in less than 25 min allowing for rapid in office results to support clinical diagnosis, thereby improving patient outcomes. Project Narrative Early diagnosis of Lyme disease is critical to prevent disease progression and sequelae; however current laboratory diagnostics that are used to support clinical diagnosis are insensitive during early infection, failing ~50% of the time. We propose the development of a sensitive and specific multi-antigen point-of-care assay that will provide immediate serological detection of antibodies against Borrelia burgdorferi, the causative agent of Lyme disease, to aid in physician diagnosis. Accurate, rapid diagnosis will improve patient outcomes by reducing the likelihood of developing potentially debilitating late stage disease through early antibiotic intervention.",A peptide-based point-of-care vertical flow assay for the rapid diagnosis of Lyme disease,10080510,R44AI150060,"['Address', 'Antibiotics', 'Antibodies', 'Antigen Targeting', 'Antigens', 'Bacterial Proteins', 'Bedside Testings', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biological Assay', 'Borrelia burgdorferi', 'Borrelia miyamotoi', 'Cells', 'Cellular Phone', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Coupled', 'DBL Oncoprotein', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Epitopes', 'Family', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'ITGB3 gene', 'ImProv', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'Immunoglobulin M', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Diagnosis', 'Legal patent', 'Lyme Disease', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Membrane', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Musculoskeletal System', 'Nature', 'Nervous system structure', 'OspC protein', 'Paper', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Peptides', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Proteins', 'Reader', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Serologic tests', 'Serological', 'Signal Transduction', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'Spottings', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'base', 'biological systems', 'blind', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cross reactivity', 'decorin binding protein B', 'design', 'diagnostic assay', 'efficacy testing', 'improved', 'innovation', 'member', 'multiplex detection', 'novel strategies', 'point of care', 'point-of-care diagnostics', 'portability', 'preservation', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'rapid diagnosis', 'relapsing fever borrelia', 'screening']",NIAID,"BIOPEPTIDES, INC.",R44,2020,300000,-0.008516674288864877
"Empower treatment effects evaluation of randomized clinical trials for elderly patients with integrated real-world data PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) are the gold-standard method of evaluating cancer treatment, which has immense health and economic burdens worldwide. However, practical considerations that allow an RCT to be conducted typically require a relatively small sample size and restricted eligibility criteria such that the study has inadequate power to generalize treatment effects to elderly patients or other under-represented patient pop- ulations. On the other hand, massive real-world data (RWD) are increasingly captured by population-based databases and registries, such as Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER), SEER-Medicare, and National Cancer Database (NCDB), that have much broader demographic and clinical diversity compared to RCT cohorts. Treatment evaluation using causal inference methods and RWD that were not collected purely for re- search purposes is now frequently performed but fraught with limitations such as confounding due to lack of randomization. In fact, the agreement between RCT and RWD ﬁndings is often low in the analysis of matched RCT and RWD studies with the same treatment comparisons. Although several national organizations and reg- ulatory agencies have advocated using RWD to complement RCTs, methods that integrate these two potentially complementary data sources and achieve better treatment evaluation over the use of a single data source alone have yet to be developed.  This proposal is motivated by the PIs' collaborative work to study the safety and efﬁcacy of treatment strategies for elderly non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and esophageal cancer patients by integrating data from multiple sources: RCTs from NCI cooperative groups and the real-world databases (e.g. SEER, SEER-Medicare, and NCDB). The objective of this project is to develop new statistical methods for integrative analyses of RCTs and RWD that can improve the generalizability and increase estimation efﬁciency of RCT ﬁndings to more diverse ""real-world"" patients as well as under-studied populations while avoiding confounding bias inherent in RWD. In Aim 1, we develop methods for statistical analysis of RCT data to compare chemoradiotherapy patterns for the real-world and elderly NSCLC patients by leveraging the baseline covariates of comparable patients from SEER, for whom the temporal information of chemotherapy and radiation and the outcome are both missing. Aims 2 and 3 focus on the settings when both RCT and RWD provide comparable covariates, treatment, and outcome information. In Aim 2, we develop improved analysis of RCT data to evaluate trimodality therapy versus surgery alone for the real-world and elderly esophageal cancer patients by exploiting the large sample size and predictive power offered by the NCDB/SEER-Medicare. In Aim 3, we develop new efﬁcient and data-adaptive methods to estimate individualized treatment effects of adjuvant chemotherapy versus observation, possibly modiﬁed by age and tumor size, for stage IB resected NSCLC patients by integrating RCT and NCDB data. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The proposed research is closely in line with the 21st Century Cures Act, passed in 2016, which placed additional focus on the use of big real-world data to support decision making and precision medicine. The availability of multiple data sources, namely randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and real-world databases, presents unique and novel opportunities for medical research, because the knowledge that can be acquired from integrative analyses would not be possible from any single-source analysis alone. Our effort is important to bridge RCTs and vast real-world databases and registries arising from clinical practices in order to better understand how treatment works for the real-world and under-studied patient populations outside relatively narrow RCT eligibility criteria and provide accurate and reliable evidence for patient-centered care.",Empower treatment effects evaluation of randomized clinical trials for elderly patients with integrated real-world data,9947226,R01AG066883,"['Address', 'Adjuvant Chemotherapy', 'Advocate', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Area', 'Calibration', 'Cancer Patient', 'Characteristics', 'Chemotherapy and/or radiation', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Disease', 'Economic Burden', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Ensure', 'Equilibrium', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Exclusion Criteria', 'Gold', 'Heterogeneity', 'Knowledge', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of esophagus', 'Medical Research', 'Medicare', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patient-Centered Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resected', 'SEER Program', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Source', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Target Populations', 'Therapy trial', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Treatment outcome', 'Weight', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'chemoradiation', 'clinical practice', 'clinical trial analysis', 'cohort', 'disease registry', 'health economics', 'improved', 'inclusion criteria', 'individualized medicine', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning method', 'multiple data sources', 'novel', 'older patient', 'patient population', 'population based', 'precision medicine', 'safety study', 'study population', 'treatment comparison', 'treatment effect', 'treatment group', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor']",NIA,NORTH CAROLINA STATE UNIVERSITY RALEIGH,R01,2020,409049,-0.012871191334949371
"Innovative Method for Real-time Assessment of Intracranial Compliance ""Standard of care"" neurological monitoring for patients with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) - a leading cause of death and long-term neurological impairment in children and adults-has not changed in decades, relying mainly on intracranial pressure {ICP) monitoring. Remarkably, the use of ICP alone as a therapeutic target for severe TBI is currently controversial due to a lack of robust supporting evidence, especially for its use in children. To address this clinical need, we developed the ICP-PC02 Compliance Index (ICP-PCI), an algorithm to compute dynamic intracranial compliance in real-time by integrating continuous ICP and end tidal CO, (ETC02) data streams. Bedside assessment of intracranial compliance-the relationship between changes in ICP and concomitant changes in intracranial volume, has been limited because of the lack of point-of-care devices to measure cerebral blood flow (CBF)/cerebral blood volume (CBV). The ICP-PCI is based on the well-known and robust relationship between the partial pressure of CO2 in blood (PC02) and CBV, where a change in PC02 of 1 mmHg induces an -3% change in CBF in patients with severe TBI. Since CBF is proportional to blood vessel radius to the fourth power, changes in CBF reflect immediate changes in CBV. As continuous ICP and ETC02 monitoring are standard of care for patients with severe TBI, ICP-PCI can be determined using existing ICU monitoring. To date we have obtained preliminary data in children with severe TBI in an IRB approved study that validates the physiologic premise and demonstrates feasibility for measurement of ICPPCI using existing, continuous ICU monitoring deemed guidelines-based standard of care. In this proposal, dense time series data, including continuous ETC02, ICP, and other physiologic waveforms will be interrogated. ICP-PCI will be calculated as the running moment-to-moment correlation between ETC02 and ICP across optimized temporal epochs, and subject to additional signal processing. We will confirm our findings across a larger cohort and define the temporal pattern of ICP-PCI and associations with relevant clinical variables: ICP, CPP, duration of ICP monitoring, medical and surgical interventions, and ICU and hospital length of stay. In addition, high-density, time series data will be integrated and time-synchronized with electronic health record (EHR) data and simulation models will be generated and refined to define the capacity for ICP-PCI to predict the need and response to relevant medical and surgical interventions. Clinical application of ICP-PCI will be compared head-to-head with ICP alone. Successful validation of ICP-PCI would lay the groundwork for the development of a valuable clinical tool for all Centers managing children and possibly adults with severe TBI, that could be readily integrated and implemented using existing ICU monitoring.

"Predicting Epilepsy Surgery Outcomes Using Neural Network Architecture Abstract Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is one of the most common forms of pharmacologically resistant epilepsy. The resection or ablation of medial temporal structures can be curative for many patients. Unfortunately, approximately one third of patients who undergo TLE surgery continue to have disabling seizures post- procedurally. The reasons for suboptimal outcomes are not well understood and therefore constitute a very important knowledge gap in epilepsy care. A better understanding of this difference in surgical response phenotype could be used to improve surgical planning, treatment, outcome prediction and counseling. Promising preliminary studies suggest that TLE surgical outcomes can be inferred by neuroimaging computational tools assessing the cumulative degree of abnormalities in the topological organization of structural networks involving limbic and extra-limbic regions. Nonetheless, network abnormalities are not routinely or systematically used and quantified in the pre-surgical evaluation of epilepsies, and their assessment requires refinement and further validation. The purpose of this proposal is to perform a prospective study to test the hypothesis that the degree of limbic and extra-limbic network abnormalities in TLE, systematically assessed using a connectome approach based on optimized diffusion MRI (dMRI), can be used to predict and better understand epilepsy surgery outcomes. This hypothesis builds on the well-defined basic science and neurobiological premises that epilepsy is associated with pathological alterations in networks that are related to seizure onset and seizure propagation. Importantly, network abnormalities are not visible on routine MRI, but their detection using connectomes constitutes a modern approach to quantifying the location and magnitude of “lesional epilepsy,” where broad computational network abnormalities imply worse outcomes. We will prospectively gather clinical and imaging data at six epilepsy centers using the NIH epilepsy common data elements. This project will be fundamentally based on standard of care data, thus minimizing the burden of extra data collection and ensuring feasibility. Furthermore, this project will be embedded in the ENIGMA-Epilepsy framework, which is a collaborative platform for clinical and neuromaging multi-center research. Specific Aim 1 will define the accuracy, reproducibility, and predictive values of the pre-surgical dMRI tractography connectome model towards surgical results in TLE. We will perform hypothesis-driven tests of specific limbic and extra-limbic networks in relationship with clinical data and surgical outcomes. Specific Aim 2 will test if the neuroimaging-clinical outcome model can be further improved with advanced diffusion methods (multi-shell diffusional kurtosis imaging), resting state functional MRI networks, or a multimodal approach. We believe that this research will have an important impact on our understanding of the mechanisms related to TLE treatment. NARRATIVE While some patients can become seizure free with epilepsy surgery, others persist with disabling seizures and the reasons for vastly dissimilar outcomes are not well understood. Increasing evidence suggests that epilepsy-related neuronal network reorganization is at the core of the mechanisms underlying epilepsy severity and seizure control. This project will use individualized mapping of white matter neural networks to better understand the pathophysiology of epilepsy, identify reasons for treatment success, and guide strategies to improve surgical treatment.",Predicting Epilepsy Surgery Outcomes Using Neural Network Architecture,9994414,R01NS110347,"['Ablation', 'Anterior Temporal Lobectomy', 'Area', 'Basic Science', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Common Data Element', 'Contralateral', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Detection', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Electrocoagulation', 'Electroencephalography', 'Ensure', 'Epilepsy', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Failure', 'Fiber', 'Freedom', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intractable Epilepsy', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Predictive Value', 'Procedures', 'Prospective Studies', 'Prospective cohort', 'Publishing', 'Refractory', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Scalp structure', 'Seizures', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Structure', 'Temporal Lobe Epilepsy', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Tonic-Clonic Epilepsy', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'connectome', 'experience', 'gray matter', 'hippocampal atrophy', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'millimeter', 'multimodality', 'neural network', 'neural network architecture', 'neuroimaging', 'neuronal circuitry', 'novel strategies', 'organizational structure', 'outcome prediction', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'response', 'standard of care', 'success', 'surgery outcome', 'tractography', 'white matter']",NINDS,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,R01,2020,646134,0.0026633163917286944
"Quantitative Histomorphometric Risk Classifier (QuHbIC) in HPV + Oropharyngeal Carcinoma SUMMARY: In 2016, nearly 50,000 adults in the US were diagnosed with oral and pharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), and nearly 10,000 died from the disease. Human papillomavirus (HPV) is now recognized as the most common cause of oropharyngeal (OP) SCC in the US. Although concomitant chemo- and radio-therapy is the most common treatment choice in patients with advanced OP-SCC, they have substantial short- and long- term morbidity and result in increased health care costs in patients who are cured of their cancers. These patients live with sometimes disabling morbidity for many years post-treatment. For these reasons, it has been suggested that therapy in lower risk patients might be de-escalated. There is also a higher risk cohort of patients in whom treatment with chemo-radiation may be insufficient, often resulting in distant metastatic failure. As such, these patients may require intensified therapies to improve outcomes. This is an agonizing choice for patients and their doctors, however. While patients do not want to be sickened by morbid treatments, they are obviously concerned about having the best chance at cure. Unfortunately, there currently are no companion diagnostic tools to identify which HPV + OPSCC patients are at (1) low risk of recurrence such that they can be treated safely to high cure rates with de-escalated therapy; (2) higher risk of failure despite aggressive high dose chemoradiation in whom treatment intensification strategies should be studied.  Recently, we developed a quantitative histomorphometric based image risk classifier (QuHbIC) that uses computerized measurements of tumor morphology (e.g. nuclear orientation, texture, shape, architecture) from digital images of H&E-stained tumor sections to predict progression in HPV+ OP-SCC patients; the current version of QuHbIC has already been validated in >400 patients and found to be superior to clinical variables in outcome prediction. In this Academic-Industry Partnership we seek to further improve predictive accuracy of QuHbIC by incorporating new classes of image features relating to stromal morphology, density and patterns of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, and tumor cell multi-nucleation, features now recognized as promising markers of unfavorable prognosis in HPV+ OP-SCC. We also seek to create a pre-commercial QuHbIC companion diagnostic test that is ready for clinical use in risk stratification in p16+ OP-SCC. QuHbIC will be trained on >700 retrospectively identified HPV + OP-SCC whole tissue slide images with associated long term outcome data and then validated on 440 cases from randomized, controlled, multi-institutional RTOG 0129 and 0522 clinical trials.  This partnership will leverage long-standing collaborations in (1) computational histomorphometry from the Madabhushi group at Case Western Reserve University, (2) surgical pathology and oncology expertise in HPV+ OPSCC from Vanderbilt University and the Cleveland Clinic and, (3) Inspirata Inc., a cancer diagnostics company that will bring quality management systems and production software standards to establish QuHbIC as an Affordable Precision Medicine (APM) solution for oropharyngeal cancers. Project Relevance: In this project we propose to optimize and validate a quantitative histomorphometric-based image classifier (QuHbIC) to better risk stratify survival among p16+ (Human papillomavirus (HPV)-related) OPSCC patients. The successful validation of QuHbIC could pave the way for its adoption as an Affordable Precision Medicine (APM) companion diagnostic tool, allowing for the identification of patients for whom therapies could be either ""de-escalated”, left as standard, or even potentially escalated, depending on risk status.",Quantitative Histomorphometric Risk Classifier (QuHbIC) in HPV + Oropharyngeal Carcinoma,9884742,R01CA220581,"['Adoption', 'Adult', 'Aftercare', 'American Joint Committee on Cancer', 'Architecture', 'Biological', 'Cancer Diagnostics', 'Categories', 'Cervical', 'Cessation of life', 'Chemotherapy and/or radiation', 'Chromosome abnormality', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Cooperative Group', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Distant', 'Distant Metastasis', 'Dose', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Epithelial', 'Epithelium', 'Failure', 'Foundations', 'HPV-High Risk', 'Head Cancer', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining Method', 'Human Papillomavirus', 'Image', 'Indolent', 'International Union Against Cancer', 'Left', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphology', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Mutation', 'Neck Cancer', 'Nuclear', 'Oropharyngeal', 'Oropharyngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Production', 'Progressive Disease', 'Publishing', 'Radiation Therapy Oncology Group', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials', 'Recurrence', 'Recurrent disease', 'Regimen', 'Regulatory Pathway', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retrospective cohort', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Slide', 'Smoking', 'Specimen', 'Squamous cell carcinoma', 'Stage Grouping', 'Stains', 'Stratification', 'Surgical Oncology', 'Surgical Pathology', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Tissue Stains', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Treatment Failure', 'Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocytes', 'Universities', 'Uterus', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'chemoradiation', 'cohort', 'commercialization', 'common treatment', 'companion diagnostics', 'computerized', 'cost', 'density', 'digital imaging', 'digital pathology', 'disorder risk', 'economic need', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'industry partner', 'innovation', 'malignant oropharynx neoplasm', 'neoplastic cell', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'overtreatment', 'patient subsets', 'pharynx squamous cell carcinoma', 'power analysis', 'precision medicine', 'prognostic', 'prognostic assays', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment choice', 'treatment response', 'treatment risk', 'tumor', 'tumor behavior']",NCI,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,624150,0.0031722996768189645
"The Vanderbilt Urologic Infection Repository, a Resource for Personalized Clinical Discovery SUMMARY - OVERALL In personalized medicine, the care of each patient is guided by his/her unique clinical circumstances. At its foundation, however, this paradigm holds a concurrent need for personalized science, in which technologies are developed and hypothesis explored in light of individual diversity. Critically, this diversity also includes unique microbial populations, which can augment the onset, progression, and treatment of disease. Within the field of benign urology, one of the most common pathologies—urinary tract infections (UTIs)—is also one of the most heterogenous, as the risk factors, symptomatology, and outcomes can vary significantly from patient to patient. Not surprisingly, the complexity of UTIs extends beyond the host, with tremendous genotypic and phenotypic diversity among the species/strains of microbes that elicit these infections. To better align the management of UTIs with the goals of precision care, our understanding of pathophysiology must become more nuanced, as we network in tandem the inherent diversity of host and microbe. To these ends, we propose a resource that provides an interconnected picture of both components, the Vanderbilt Urologic Infection Repository (VUIR). With our institution's unique foundation in medical informatics, we will create a searchable database of clinical parameters from bacteriuric patients (many thousands of cases annually), together with microbiologic data on the organisms. In parallel, the paired microbial strains will be stored permanently as a biobank for analysis and experimentation, together with linkage to anonymized versions of patient records within Vanderbilt's Synthetic Derivative (a filtered version of our electronic health data). The logistical infrastructure for clinical biobanking is also already in place at Vanderbilt via the institutionally-supported microVU initiative, in which microbial isolates from the diagnostic laboratory are repurposed as academic resources. As a basic expansion of these efforts, the VUIR will represent a first-in-kind tool for developing technologies to combat UTIs, while also investigating their underlying pathogenesis. In particular, it could facilitate functional genomic studies that bridge host and pathogen. Demonstrating the resource's value, we will conduct whole-genome sequencing of clinically underrepresented bacterial species, together with genome-wide association studies that focus on the infection phenotypes of the source-patients. In addition to novel virulence factors, we seek to identify elusive genomic determinants that distinguish cases of asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) and symptomatic UTI. The molecular basis of UTI-versus-ASB epitomizes a clinical challenge that requires integration of host and pathogen, as provided by the VUIR. Finally, to support the program and its discoveries, we propose an organizational structure of multidisciplinary content-area experts and dedicated support staff. Along with coordinating daily activities and assuring seamless dissemination of data/specimens, this Administrative Core (AdCore) will champion educational activities and additional pilot projects that build upon the resource. In sum, the VUIR stands to generate actionable discoveries from the human and microbial diversity of UTIs—not in spite of it. PROJECT NARRATIVE - OVERALL Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are not only a common urologic ailment, but one of the most widespread medical conditions facing women, men and children around the globe. In order for clinicians to better manage UTIs—and scientists to understand them more deeply—our clinical viewpoint must become personalized, as we study in tandem the afflicted patients and offending pathogens. To these ends, the Vanderbilt Urologic Infection Repository will provide a first-in-kind resource for the biomedical community, creating a massive network of patient-level clinical data and banked microbial strains from patients with real-world infections.","The Vanderbilt Urologic Infection Repository, a Resource for Personalized Clinical Discovery",10022297,P20DK123967,"['Acinetobacter baumannii', 'Advisory Committees', 'Antimicrobial susceptibility', 'Area', 'Bacteriuria', 'Benign', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Communities', 'Community Outreach', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Education and Outreach', 'Educational Activities', 'Educational workshop', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Escherichia coli', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genitourinary System Infection', 'Genitourinary system', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Genus staphylococcus', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Informatics', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Light', 'Link', 'Location', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Medical Informatics', 'Medical Records', 'Microbe', 'Microbiology', 'Molecular', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Published Comment', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Source', 'Specimen', 'Sum', 'Symptoms', 'Taxonomy', 'Technology', 'Urinary tract infection', 'Urine', 'Urologic Diseases', 'Urology', 'Uropathogen', 'Virulence Factors', 'Woman', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomedical resource', 'career development', 'clinical database', 'clinical infrastructure', 'clinical sequencing', 'combat', 'data dissemination', 'data mining', 'data space', 'data warehouse', 'demographics', 'functional genomics', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'health data', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'interest', 'member', 'men', 'microbial', 'microbial genome', 'microbiome', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'operation', 'organizational structure', 'outcome forecast', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic microbe', 'patient health information', 'personalized care', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'programs', 'repository', 'symptomatology', 'tool', 'translational impact', 'urinary', 'urologic', 'whole genome', 'young woman']",NIDDK,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,P20,2020,340000,-0.01210367577274502
"DFU Clinical Research Unit Abstract Diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) are a prevalent diabetes complications affecting up to 25% of patients and leading to ~80,000 Americans having non-traumatic amputations each year, with five-year mortality rates of up to 40%. Recent evidence suggests that non-traumatic lower extremity amputations are on the rise, after decades of decline, in spite of advances in targeted wound care products, establishment of interdisciplinary clinical and surgical teams, and improving diabetes medical care.

"A portable photoacoustic imager for diagnosing vascular diseases Project Summary/Abstract Vascular diseases are the leading cause of death worldwide. Some common vascular diseases include: cardio vascular disease, stroke, and peripheral artery disease (PAD). Many of these vascular diseases need point-of- care (POC) diagnosis and monitoring using non-ionizing, non-invasive and cost-effective approaches. Although Doppler ultrasound meets all these requirements, it only maps blood flow, which is operator dependent and influenced by motion artifacts, resulting in limited sensitivity and specificity to detect the disease in its early stage. A POC technique that provides direct label-free molecular and functional information of vasculature is needed to reliably detect and monitor vascular diseases.  A mobile photoacoustic imager (mPAI) is proposed for diagnosing various vascular diseases in resource poor settings of the world. Leveraging on strong multispectral optical absorption of oxy- and de-oxy hemoglobins, the mPAI is capable of providing multi-parametric information of deep vasculature, such as blood oxygen saturation, plaque lipids, blood flow and blood clot. The mPAI is non-invasive, real time and uses non-ionizing optical and ultrasound radiation. This will be the first and perhaps the only portable technology capable of deriving such multiparametric functional information of deep vasculature without the use of contrast agents. Competing technologies cannot provide such a direct information of vascular health, and certainly not in a compact portable device form. Health care providers can use the mPAI to instantly diagnose several vascular diseases affecting humans of all ages, including infants.  In the R21 phase, Aim1 will design and develop the mPAI, integrating the low-cost optical illumination and piezoelectric micromachined ultrasound transducer (PMUT) arrays. Dr. Rundra Pratap team from the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore, will design and fabricate the PMUT arrays. Dr. Kothapalli team will develop the mPAI and validate its performance on tissue mimicking vascular phantoms in Aim 1, and rat models of PAD in Aim 2. The ultimate goal of the two-year R21 phase is to achieve a clinical grade mPAI device with reliable vascular imaging metrics.  In the R33 phase, to test the clinical performance of the mPAI, the following multicenter pilot clinical studies on PAD patients will be conducted in 1) Penn State Hershey medical center, 2) Vikram Hospital in India through collaborations with the IISc team, and 3) in Ghana in Year 5 with the help of Dr. Colette Pameijer of Penn State who conducts medical camps in Ghana every year through Penn State Global Health Program. Clinical studies in R33 phase will be undertaken only if well-defined milestones are achieved in the R21 phase.  The overall goal of these studies is to carefully validate the clinical potential of emerging label-free photoacoustic imaging technology to screen for vascular diseases, in a portable form, in resource poor settings of the world. Project Narrative Vascular diseases are becoming epidemic with increase in aging population, obesity and type II diabetes. They affect humans of all age groups, including neonates.

"Predictors of Low-risk Phenotypes  after Traumatic Brain Injury Incorporating Proteomic Biomarker Signatures PROJECT SUMMARY Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death in the US, and treatment options are limited. Therapeutic clinical trials in TBI have yielded disappointing results owing in part to the difficulty in accounting for clinically important heterogeneity within TBI. Early delivery of therapy is essential after TBI to reduce secondary brain injury, but unrestricted treatment of all brain injuries could be harmful. TBI stimulates a complex cascade of immunologic responses, both centrally and peripherally. These peripheral immune responses to TBI could serve as an early sensor of risk phenotype given the rapid, readily measurable response in the blood. An improved ability to risk-stratify patients on admission will streamline patient selection for aggressive interventions—such as invasive neuromonitoring—versus selection of those patients who can safely be observed reducing potential harms. Holly E Hinson, MD MCR is a Neurologist and Neurointensivist at Oregon Health and Science University where she cares for patients with severe acute brain injury. The objective of this application is to develop supervised learning models of actionable short- and long-term outcomes post-TBI and to interrogate if pre-specified immunoregulatory proteins add predictive power to the models over clinical features alone. Her central hypothesis is that immunoregulatory proteomic signatures improve our ability to classify a low-risk clinical phenotype after TBI. Dr. Hinson’s preliminary data suggest peripheral cytokine levels are associated with actionable clinical events acutely after TBI. The project employs a highly-sensitive, single molecule immunoarray (SIMOA) to detect immunoregulatory proteins complemented with an unbiased proteomic approach utilizing global discovery mass spectrometry. She will develop and assess a series of models incorporating proteomic signatures to classify: acute progressive intracranial hemorrhage (Aim 1A), acute neurologic deterioration (Aim 1B), and long-term outcomes measured by the 6-month Glasgow Outcome Scale (Aim 2). She will develop these models in a well-defined, clinical trial population (development set), and test their ability to correctly classify outcome in an independent, prospectively enrolled cohort at OHSU (test set). Under a multidisciplinary team of expert mentors, the project will generate new insights into low-risk phenotype recognition and outcome classification after acute TBI. The proposed patient-oriented research project will be enhanced by a structured didactic program in the principles of predictive modeling and patient phenotyping (including proteomics), which will provide Dr. Hinson with the critical skills she will need to conduct independent, innovative translational clinical research in the field of neurotrauma. PROJECT NARRATIVE Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death in the US, and treatment options are limited—we lack methods to assess a patient’s risk of deterioration at admission. An improved ability to classify patients early after injury will allow us to identify those who may benefit from aggressive interventions versus those who can safely be observed. The goal of the proposed project is to develop and assess a series of predictive models incorporating immune proteins from peripheral blood to aid in the prediction of which patients are at low-risk for complications and poor outcome after TBI.",Predictors of Low-risk Phenotypes  after Traumatic Brain Injury Incorporating Proteomic Biomarker Signatures,9975580,K23NS110828,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Acute Brain Injuries', 'Admission activity', 'Age', 'Benign', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain Injuries', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Disease model', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'Exclusion Criteria', 'Glasgow Outcome Scale', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Health Sciences', 'Heterogeneity', 'Holly', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Injury', 'Interleukin-6', 'Intervention', 'Intracranial Hemorrhages', 'Ion Transport', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mentors', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologist', 'Oregon', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Selection', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'ROC Curve', 'Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Series', 'Signaling Protein', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'TBI treatment', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Clinical Trial', 'Tranexamic Acid', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Universities', 'Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1', 'analog', 'base', 'blood-based biomarker', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical risk', 'clinically actionable', 'cohort', 'cytokine', 'digital', 'effective therapy', 'high dimensionality', 'immunoregulation', 'improved', 'inclusion criteria', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient oriented research', 'patient stratification', 'peripheral blood', 'placebo group', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'prospective', 'proteomic signature', 'response', 'sensor', 'single molecule', 'skills', 'supervised learning']",NINDS,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,K23,2020,189108,-0.0026302954843311598
"Feelix @ Home: Testing and optimization of a smart stethoscope for home use to monitor changes in lung status of individuals with chronic conditions Project Summary  The goal of this project is to further develop an existing smart stethoscope in order to be capable of monitoring pediatric patients at home who suffer from asthma as well as adults with COPD. Lung diseases impose a serious burden on healthcare systems, individuals and governments. The World Health Organization (WHO) found that chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and lower respiratory infections (LRIs) ranked third and fourth as the leading causes of death in 2016, each claiming 3 million lives annually. LRIs accounted for 14.9% of pediatric deaths, making it the leading cause of infant mortality after pre-term birth. Asthma—a condition for which, like COPD, there is no cure—is also the leading chronic disease in children and an estimated 235 million people suffer from the disease worldwide, with over 380,000 deaths from the disease in 2015. Asthma and COPD costed the United States approximately $56 billion and $72 billion last year, respectively. The burden of these diseases and the health disparities across populations is only slated to get worse in the coming decade, as respiratory diseases are expected to increase by 155% due to an aging population and increased pollution, while there is expected to a large shortage of pulmonary specialists, with an expect 7% decline by 2030.  We reasoned that a long-term monitoring solution that can be used in the home by untrained patients, or family members of patients, that could detect and monitor severity of airway inflammation in patients, provide insight into reasons for worsening or improved symptoms, push tailored educational content, and direct patients to medical follow before the situation becomes acute, would empower patients with chronic conditions while also reducing trips to emergency departments and readmission rates to hospitals. We find that several challenges exist when considering long term auscultatory monitoring solutions in non-traditional clinical settings: (1) unpredictable ambient noise, (2) the need for medical expertise to interpret lung sounds, (3) subjectivity in the analysis, and (4) difficulty using and placing the stethoscope. The research team developed a smart stethoscope that was originally intended for use in low-resource countries by community health workers to differentiate between pediatric patients with crackles and wheezes that overcomes many of these challenges. This smart stethoscope address all the challenges above by including (1) adaptive noise suppression that has been objectively and subjectively proven to be superior in all types of noise environments than traditional or other electronic stethoscopes, (2) on-board analysis algorithms that can detect crackles and wheezes in pediatric patients with an accuracy that matches that of a specialist, and (3) a uniform pickup surface that removes the requirement for exact placement of the device to get an accurate recording. In this project, we will validate that the device can be correctly used by parents of children with asthma and accurate recordings can be taken that are similar in quality to those that would be taken by a medical professional. Simultaneously, we will be using patient feedback to iterate on the device and mobile app design to create a version that patients are comfortable using in their home. Once the device and app have been validated in Phase I, we plan to move into directly into Phase II where the device will enter in a second phase of investigation that will include a first-time longitudinal study from parents of pediatric patients taking daily recordings in their home. This data will then be used for the development of algorithms to determine lung sound severities with metrics that can be tracked and predicted over time. In parallel to the this clinical study and algorithm development, recordings will be taken of adult patients with COPD to expand the usability of the device beyond pediatrics. Project Narrative This proposal aims to validate a smart auscultation device for home use and develop algorithms that can track changes in, and severity of, lung sounds in order to monitor patients over long periods of time, improve the clinical relevance of home monitoring for timely interventions, and decrease hospital admissions. Current state of the art technology available to patients suffering from asthma and COPD is unable to intelligently monitor patients at home and no long-term monitoring solutions exist for these conditions, resulting in increases in emergency department visits. The academic partner has developed a smart stethoscope that offers greatly improved audio fidelity in any type of noise environment, automated on-board analysis and detection algorithms of lung sounds, and increased ease of use. The small business partner is in the process of commercializing the device for clinical use by trained, professional personnel. Together, we are aiming to test whether the device can be reliably used by non-trained personnel for home use, develop algorithms that would provide metrics for monitoring trends and severities of lung sounds and predict future severity, expand the current abilities of the stethoscope from pediatrics to all patients, and transfer this technology to the small business partner for further clinical testing and commercial development such that it can improve the long-term outcome for patients with chronic lung conditions.",Feelix @ Home: Testing and optimization of a smart stethoscope for home use to monitor changes in lung status of individuals with chronic conditions,9909859,R42HL147728,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acoustics', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Agreement', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Asthma', 'Auditory', 'Auscultation', 'Businesses', 'Caregivers', 'Categories', 'Cause of Death', 'Censuses', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Community Health Aides', 'Cost of Illness', 'Country', 'Crackles', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Dropout', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronics', 'Emergency department visit', 'Environment', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Feedback', 'Focus Groups', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Home environment', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Housing', 'Human Resources', 'Individual', 'Infant Mortality', 'Intelligence', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Letters', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lower Respiratory Tract Infection', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Medical', 'Medical Staff', 'Modification', 'Monitor', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patient Transfer', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pediatrics', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Pollution', 'Population', 'Premature Birth', 'Process', 'Pulmonology', 'Questionnaires', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Respiratory Sounds', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Specialist', 'Stethoscopes', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Technology Transfer', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Untrained Personnel', 'Wheezing', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'aging population', 'airway inflammation', 'algorithm development', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'clinical research site', 'clinically relevant', 'commercialization', 'computer aided detection', 'design', 'digital', 'efficacy trial', 'health disparity', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'instrument', 'intelligent algorithm', 'mobile application', 'monitoring device', 'pediatric patients', 'readmission rates', 'recruit', 'research clinical testing', 'signal processing', 'sound', 'supervised learning', 'symptomatic improvement', 'trend', 'usability']",NHLBI,"SONAVI LABS, INC.",R42,2020,236489,-0.07256416793436359
"Identification of biologically relevant subtypes of hidradenitis suppurativa Project Summary Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a neglected, prevalent, chronic, stigmatizing, and debilitating disease that has recently been prioritized for study by NIAMS. Evidence suggests that some HS patients choose to self-manage symptoms remaining unconnected to healthcare, and some seek medical care for repeated outbreaks of boils but never receive a diagnosis. Such ‘hidden populations’ create challenges for designing research studies that are generalizable. Precision medicine initiatives and resources offer opportunities to rapidly increase our knowledge about biological causes of HS and to improve the care that HS patients receive. For example, the NIH has made considerable investments in the development of data repositories that link genetic data to EHR for hundreds of thousands of patients, including the NHGRI-funded eMERGE Network and the NIH-funded All of Us Research Program. Columbia University investigators are integral members of these nationwide programs, both as a recruitment site, as well as a data and research center (5U01HG008680, 1OT2OD026556). Engaging research participants who are willing to contribute longitudinal data is a major obstacle to precision medicine initiatives. The public’s use of the Internet and social media to obtain and exchange health-related information has created opportunities to rapidly and efficiently assemble large longitudinal cohorts, yet there are important differences from traditional research methods and best practice guidelines have yet to be developed. Columbia University is at the forefront of the development and application of these methods. A major challenge to implementing precision medicine arises from patients who share a diagnosis but have different biological causes of disease. HS patients have a high burden of comorbidities and we hypothesize that sets of comorbidities that tend to present together in individual patients can be used to identify biologically relevant disease subtypes. Here we will use three approaches to identify patterns of comorbidities within patients, to characterize the generalizability of the results from studies conducted in EHR, and to use genetic data to biologically validate comorbidities and resolve causality underlying disease associations. Training in biomedical informatics and Internet-based survey research will allow the applicant to use EHR data and Internet resources for assembling cohorts to conduct these studies, and complement her previous training in epidemiology, biostatistics, molecular biology and human genetics, providing fluency across several domains that are crucial for advancing precision medicine initiatives. Completion of this proposal will achieve the applicant’s long-term goal of obtaining advanced training aimed at implementing precision medicine in the treatment of skin disease. Project Narrative This project addresses the imperative needs of hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) patients who suffer from pain, stigma, diminished quality of life, decreased work productivity, and increased healthcare costs that arise from managing a difficult-to-treat, debilitating disease with a high burden of comorbidities. We will conduct studies of HS comorbidities to identify biologically distinct subclasses of HS in large samples of patients using data in electronic health records and data collected from Internet surveys. This work will improve the precision of HS diagnoses and set up the infrastructure for future large-scale studies of HS.",Identification of biologically relevant subtypes of hidradenitis suppurativa,9977561,K01AR075111,"['Abscess', 'Address', 'Advertising', 'Affect', 'All of Us Research Program', 'Anogenital region', 'Attenuated', 'Automobile Driving', 'Axilla', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Cicatrix', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Consent', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Economic Burden', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Funding', 'Furuncles', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hidradenitis Suppurativa', 'Human Genetics', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Inguinal region', 'International Classification of Disease Codes', 'Internet', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leg', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Medical Research', 'Methods', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Diagnosis', 'Mutation', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases', 'Pain', 'Participant', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Practice Guidelines', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Prevalence', 'Productivity', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Stigmatization', 'Subgroup', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'data resource', 'data sharing', 'data warehouse', 'design', 'disorder subtype', 'effective therapy', 'genome wide association study', 'health care service utilization', 'health data', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'instrument', 'large datasets', 'learning strategy', 'medically underserved', 'member', 'multidimensional data', 'neglect', 'online resource', 'patient engagement', 'patient stratification', 'patient subsets', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'programs', 'psychosocial', 'recruit', 'research study', 'skin disorder', 'social media', 'social stigma', 'symptom self management', 'tool', 'unsupervised learning', 'validation studies']",NIAMS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,K01,2020,121288,-0.03558000206704564
"Stanford Advanced Wound Care Center Clinical Research Unit SUMMARY   Approximately  25%  of  diabetic  patients  experience  diabetic  foot  ulcers  (DFUs).  This  is  a  significant  clinical  problem since there are no effective biomarkers for predicting outcomes, no drug candidates that have recently  been  FDA-­approved  and  no  therapies  that  are  widely  effective  in  treatment.  The  Stanford  Advanced  Wound  Care  Center  (AWCC)  was  opened  in  2014  with  the  sole  purpose  of  facilitating  clinical  trials,  conducting  translational  research  and  providing  care

"Employing the gut microbiome to accelerate effective initiation of rheumatoid arthritis therapy Title: Employing the gut microbiome to accelerate effective initiation of rheumatoid arthritis therapy ABSTRACT Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a complex, multifactorial, autoimmune disorder that affects ~1% of the worldwide population (~2 million adults in the US alone). It is characterized by chronic synovitis that, when left untreated, can result in irreversible joint destruction and deformity, leading to increased morbidity and all-cause mortality. The last three decades have witnessed impressive advances in the understanding of disease pathogenesis and therapeutic outcomes. In fact, the use of methotrexate first, and the subsequent incorporation of anti-TNF (TNFi) and other “biologics” have led to substantial improvements in RA clinical outcomes, enhancing the quality of life for millions of patients with inflammatory arthritis. Despite this progress, however, a significant question still remains unanswered: why do over 50% of RA patients with moderate to severe arthritis fail to respond appropriately to these agents? Pharmacomicrobiomics – an emerging field of study that investigates the effect of variations within the human gut microbiome on drugs – promises to overcome these barriers and facilitate precision medicine approaches in autoimmune disease.  Methotrexate (MTX), a dihydrofolate (DHF) reductase inhibitor, remains the anchor drug for the treatment of RA and is used widely throughout the world. While quite effective, oral MTX achieves significant results in less than 50% of patients and remission in only a quarter of them. It is well established that the inter-individual bioavailability of MTX is extremely variable, ranging from 10 to 80%. The reasons for this are presumably multifactorial. However, the intestinal microbiome and its enzymatic machinery are likely to play a significant role, based on our Preliminary Results and given that animals treated with antibiotics or kept under germ-free conditions show significant differences in MTX metabolism relative to control animals.  Our multidisciplinary team composed of rheumatologists, bioinformaticians, pharmacologists and microbiome researchers will address our overarching goal to study: a) if baseline intestinal microbiome, its genes, and associated metabolites can be used to predict the immunomodulatory responses to MTX in treatment-naïve, new-onset RA (NORA) patients; and b) if the gut microbiomes of MTX non-responders can be manipulated to modulate MTX metabolism and bioavailability. We believe that the results of our highly translational, innovative studies will directly influence therapeutic approaches for the treatment of RA and offer a more personalized approach in which the clinical efficacy response would be predicted early (and potentially improved by microbiome-targeted adjuvant therapies) in any given patient about to initiate MTX, limiting or preventing disease progression and ultimately avoiding wasteful health expenditures (estimated as ~$50,000/year/patient in direct costs). Importantly, we anticipate that our studies will establish generalizable approaches in rheumatology and autoimmunity that could be more broadly applied to the study and clinical maximization of other similar small molecules (e.g., JAK inhibitors) or even biologic agents (e.g., anti-TNF mAbs). NARRATIVE Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, autoimmune disease characterized by widespread musculoskeletal inflammation affecting 1% of the world’s population (including ~2 million adults in the US alone). While the use of methotrexate (MTX) has significantly improved the lives of many people with RA, over 50% of patients do not respond adequately to this drug. Successful completion of our proposed studies will provide key insights into the effects of the gut bacteria on MTX and the implications for prediction of clinical response, ultimately identifying patients that are either likely to improve even before this treatment is prescribed, or those that would benefit from microbiome-targeted interventions to improve MTX absorption and efficacy.",Employing the gut microbiome to accelerate effective initiation of rheumatoid arthritis therapy,9989043,R01AR074500,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adjuvant Therapy', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Animals', 'Antibiotics', 'Arthritis', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmunity', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Availability', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Products', 'Biological Response Modifier Therapy', 'Biometry', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Control Animal', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Deformity', 'Diagnosis', 'Dihydrofolate Reductase Inhibitor', 'Direct Costs', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease remission', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Engraftment', 'Excess Mortality', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genotype', 'Germ-Free', 'Goals', 'Health Expenditures', 'Human', 'Human Microbiome', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory Arthritis', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Metabolism', 'Metagenomics', 'Methotrexate', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Monoclonal Antibodies', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mus', 'Musculoskeletal', 'National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Rheumatology', 'Role', 'Series', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Synovitis', 'TNF gene', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Transplantation', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'absorption', 'arthritis therapy', 'bacterial community', 'base', 'biomarker identification', 'chronic autoimmune disease', 'clinical efficacy', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'disability', 'drug disposition', 'drug metabolism', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'field study', 'follow-up', 'germ free condition', 'gut bacteria', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'immunoregulation', 'improved', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'insight', 'inter-individual variation', 'joint destruction', 'joint injury', 'metabolomics', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiome components', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple omics', 'novel', 'personalized approach', 'personalized medicine', 'polyglutamates', 'pre-clinical', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'rRNA Genes', 'recruit', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'rheumatologist', 'sample collection', 'small molecule', 'therapy outcome']",NIAMS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2020,677759,0.010796378923364306
