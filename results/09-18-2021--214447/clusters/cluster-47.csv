"Reproducible Analytics for Secondary Analyses of ImmPort Vaccination-Related Cytometry Data Project Summary The immunology database and analysis portal (ImmPort, http://immport.niaid.nih.gov) is the NIAID-funded public resource for data archive and dissemination from clinical trials and mechanistic research projects. Among the current 291 studies archived in ImmPort, 114 are focused on vaccine responses (91 for influenza vaccine responses), which is the largest category when organized by research focus. As the most effective method of preventing infectious diseases, development of the next-generation vaccines is faced with the bottleneck that traditional empirical design becomes ineffective to stimulate human protective immunity against HIV, RSV, CMV, and other recent major public health threats. This project will focus on three important aspects of informatics approaches to secondary analysis of ImmPort data for influenza vaccination research: a) expanding the data analytical capabilities of ImmPort and ImmPortGalaxy through adding innovative computational methods for user-friendly unsupervised identification of cell populations, b) processing and analyzing a subset of the existing human influenza vaccination study data in ImmPort to identify cell-based biomarkers using the new computational methods, and c) returning data analysis results with data analytical provenance to ImmPort for dissemination of derived data, software tools, as well as semantic assertions of the identified biomarkers. Each aspect is one specific research aim in the proposed work. The project outcome will not only demonstrate the utility of the ImmPort data archive but also generate a foundation for the Human Vaccine Project (HVP) to establish pilot programs for influenza vaccine research, which currently include Vanderbilt University Medical Center; University of California San Diego (UCSD); Scripps Research Institute; La Jolla Institute of Allergy and Immunology; and J. Craig Venter Institute (JCVI). Once such computational analytical workflow is established, it can be applied to the secondary analysis of other ImmPort studies as well as to support the user-driven analytics of their own cytometry data. Each of the specific aims contains innovative methods or new applications of the existing methods. The computational method for population identification in Aim 1 is a newly developed constrained data clustering method, which combines advantages of unsupervised and supervised learning. Cutting-edge machine learning approaches including random forest will be used in Aim 2 for the identification of biomarkers across study cohorts, in addition to the traditional statistical hypothesis testing. Standardized knowledge representation to be developed in Aim 3 for cell-based biomarkers is also innovative, as semantic networks with inferring and deriving capabilities can be built based on the machine-readable knowledge assertions. The proposed work, when accomplished, will foster broader collaboration between ImmPort and the existing vaccine research consortia. It will also accelerate the deployment of up-to-date informatics software tools on ImmPortGalaxy. Project Narrative Flow cytometry (FCM) plays important roles in human influenza vaccination studies through interrogating immune cellular functions and quantifying the immune responses in different conditions. This project will extend the current data analytical capabilities of the Immunology Database and Analysis Portal (ImmPort) through adding novel data analytical methods and software tools for user-friendly identification of cell populations from FCM data in ImmPort influenza vaccine response studies. The derived data and the knowledge generated from the secondary analysis of the ImmPort vaccination study data will be deposited back to ImmPort and shared with the Human Vaccines Project (HVP) consortium for dissemination.",Reproducible Analytics for Secondary Analyses of ImmPort Vaccination-Related Cytometry Data,9724345,UH2AI132342,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Address', 'Archives', 'Back', 'Biological Markers', 'California', 'Categories', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collaborations', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cytomegalovirus', 'Cytometry', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Failure', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Genetic Transcription', 'HIV', 'Human', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Imagery', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunity', 'Immunology', 'Incidence', 'Influenza', 'Influenza vaccination', 'Informatics', 'Institutes', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri', 'Maps', 'Measles', 'Medical', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Mumps', 'Names', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'Outcome', 'Play', 'Poliomyelitis', 'Population', 'Population Statistics', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention strategy', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Readability', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Institute', 'Research Project Grants', 'Respiratory Syncytial Virus Vaccines', 'Respiratory syncytial virus', 'Role', 'Secondary to', 'Semantics', 'Smallpox', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Universities', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccine Design', 'Vaccine Research', 'Vaccines', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'biomarker identification', 'catalyst', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'computer infrastructure', 'computerized tools', 'data archive', 'data mining', 'data portal', 'data resource', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'immune function', 'improved', 'influenza virus vaccine', 'information organization', 'innovation', 'neoplastic', 'news', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel vaccines', 'prevent', 'programs', 'public-private partnership', 'random forest', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'secondary analysis', 'statistics', 'success', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'unsupervised learning', 'user-friendly', 'vaccine development', 'vaccine response', 'vaccine trial', 'vaccine-induced immunity']",NIAID,"J.

"Pharmaco Response Signatures and Disease Mechanism DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of the HMS LINCS Center is to delineate the fundamental principles of cellular response to perturbagens at the level of single-cells and cell populations and to make response data routinely available via web-based browse, query and programmatic interfaces. This will involve the development and testing of new measurement methods, computational algorithms, and response signatures for diverse human cell types exposed to perturbations individually and in combination. We will emphasize the systematic collection of data not currently available in existing public databases including live and fixed-cell imaging, biochemical data on signaling proteins and multi-factorial drug-response phenotypes. A focus on diverse transformed and primary cells, including those derived from healthy and diseased donors, and on clinical grade small molecules (kinase inhibitors and epigenome drugs) will increase the translational impact of our work. The proposed LINCS Center represents a continuation of a program in operation for ~3.5 years under a LINCS pilot phase U54 award. We will expand the scope and sophistication of our Center, devoting  significant effort to (i) improving the quality of data analysis and visualization, particularly wih respect to the  complexities of perturbagen polypharmacy (ii) accelerating the release of perturbagen-response signatures  using methods that have been demonstrated to yield reliable and informative data, with a particular  emphasis on primary and non-transformed cells (iii) developing and applying new measurement methods,  particularly mass spectrometry for analysis of cell populations and live-cell imaging for analysis of single cells.  The work will involve nine complementary but independent aims. In Data Generation, Aim 1 will perform systematic analysis of perturbagen responses at a single-cell level. Aim 2 will collect multiplex protein and mRNA data on perturbagen response using a set of complementary imaging, mass spectrometry and bead-based assays. Aim 3 will apply LINCS methods to non-transformed immune cells and induced pluripotent stem cells, and explore if signatures can guide a detailed medicinal chemistry campaign. In Data Analysis, Aim 4 will construct perturbagen-response signatures using statistical modeling, network inference and machine learning methods. Aim 5 will develop new approaches to understanding and analyzing drug interactions on multiple phenotypes in single cells. Aim 6 will develop a novel compressed sensing framework for analyzing the poly-pharmacology of kinase inhibitors. Aim 7 will enhance the query, browse and explore functions of the HMS LINCS website and database and its integration with the UCSC Genome Browser. In Community Interaction and Outreach, Aim 8 will implement diverse training and outreach activities, including collaboration with LINCS and non-LINCS research groups. In Administration, Aim 9 will ensure effective management of the Center, sustained access to tools and data produced within the LINCS Project, and compliance with program goals. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Disease networks are complex interactions between multiple proteins. Precise understanding of the multifactorial perturbations imposed on multi-component networks is a crucial step in the development of a rational approach to drug discovery and personalization of therapy. The LINCS Center we propose will develop innovative computational and experimental methods for understanding cellular perturbagen-response networks and will make the resulting data and new knowledge accessible to the diverse community of molecular and computational biologists, medicinal chemists and clinical investigators through outreach.",Pharmaco Response Signatures and Disease Mechanism,9754857,U54HL127365,"['Antibodies', 'Apoptosis', 'Award', 'Bayesian learning', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell Cycle Arrest', 'Cell Extracts', 'Cell surface', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Drug Interactions', 'Education and Outreach', 'Ensure', 'Exposure to', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Fuzzy Logic', 'Generations', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Growth Factor', 'Human', 'Image', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunoassay', 'Immunofluorescence Immunologic', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Linear Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Computations', 'Online Systems', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pharmaceutical Chemistry', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Polypharmacy', 'Population', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Semantics', 'Sentinel', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signaling Protein', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Stem cells', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thromboplastin', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'cell type', 'cellular imaging', 'cytokine', 'data visualization', 'drug discovery', 'epigenome', 'experimental study', 'genome browser', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'kinase inhibitor', 'learning strategy', 'live cell imaging', 'member', 'network models', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'operation', 'outreach', 'personalized medicine', 'phenotypic data', 'predicting response', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'random forest', 'response', 'senescence', 'single cell analysis', 'small molecule', 'tool', 'translational impact', 'tumor', 'usability', 'web services', 'web site']",NHLBI,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,U54,2019,2145158,0.07300113560176466
"Development of label-free computational flow cytometry for high-throughput micro-organism classification The purpose of flow cytometers is to enable the classification of cells or organisms at high throughput. Label-free optical flow cytometers not based on fluorescence are generally based on scattering. The most common of these compares the amount of forward (FS) versus side (SS) scattering. Such two-parameter information permits rudimentary classification based on size or granularity, but it misses more subtle features that can be critical in defining organism identity. Nevertheless, FS/SS flow cytometry remains popular, largely because of its simplicity and capacity for high throughput.  We propose to develop a label-free computational flow cytometer that preserves much of the simplicity and high-throughput capacity of FS/SS flow cytometry, but provides significantly enhanced information. Instead of characterizing organisms based on scattering direction (as does FS/SS flow cytometry), we will characterize based on scattering patterns. We will insert a reconfigurable diffractive element in the imaging optics of a flow cytometer to route user-defined basis patterns to independent detectors. The basis patterns will be optimally matched to specific sample features. The respective weights of these basis patterns will serve as signatures to identify organisms of interest. The basis patterns themselves will be determined by machine learning algorithms. Both the device and the learning algorithms will be developed from scratch.  We anticipate that our flow cytometer will be able to operate at flow rates on the order of meters per second, commensurate with state-of-the-art FS/SS flow cytometers, while providing significantly more information for improved classification capacity. While our technique should be advantageous for any label-free flow cytometry application requiring high throughput, we will test it here by demonstrating high-throughput classification of microbial communities. NARRATIVE Our goal is to improve the information extraction capacity of label-free flow cytometers, while maintaining high throughput capacity. As such, our device should have a broad range of applications.",Development of label-free computational flow cytometry for high-throughput micro-organism classification,9702053,R21GM128020,"['Address', 'Awareness', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Categories', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'Custom', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Elements', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescence', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Image Compression', 'Label', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Microbe', 'Modernization', 'Optics', 'Organism', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pupil', 'Resolution', 'Route', 'Sampling', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Traction', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'base', 'cellular imaging', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'design', 'detector', 'improved', 'interest', 'learning algorithm', 'machine learning algorithm', 'meter', 'microbial community', 'microorganism', 'microorganism classification', 'optical imaging', 'preservation', 'prototype', 'recruit']",NIGMS,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),R21,2019,206250,0.07621751341791827
"EFFICIENT METHODS FOR CALIBRATION, CLUSTERING, VISUALIZATION AND IMPUTATION OF LARGE scRNA-seq DATA Single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) profiling provides an unprecedented opportunity to conduct detailed cellular analysis of cell subpopulations. Fulfilling the promise of scRNA-seq for biomedical studies and biomarker discovery requires robust computational approaches to support detection of rare phenotypes and unanticipated cellular responses. Current approaches for imputation, calibration, clustering and visualizing of scRNA-seq data suffer from challenges such as erroneous imputing of non-expressed genes, limitation of linear assumptions in removal of multivariate batch effects, and inefficiencies of clustering and dimensional reduction methods of very large datasets. We have developed spectral, neural network, and Fast Multipole Methods (FMM) prototypes suitable for addressing these issues in the context of scRNA-seq and other high throughput data contexts and propose to further develop and adapt these methods to scRNA-seq data analysis. Our team of experts on data analytics and computational biology is currently funded through the NIH BD2K initiative to develop novel big data tools and methods that have broad applicability to biomedical science. This effort proved the feasibility of extremely efficient scalable prototypes of neural network, spectral, and harmonic analysis techniques suitable for calibrating, reducing the dimensionality and visualizing high dimensional data, finding intrinsic state-probability densities, and co-organizing cells, markers and samples. We propose substantial advances over existing analytical procedures used in single cell RNA-seq studies including matrix recovery approaches for the sparse and noisy scRNA-seq data by combining matrix completion and statistical techniques (Aim 1A), and calibration based on our unsupervised MMD-ResNet neural network prototype and optimal transport theory (Aim 1B). We will develop a variant of the FMM approach to speed up the calculation of the repulsion term of the t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) visualization technique, which will improve our current fastest t-SNE FFT-based FIt-SNE prototype, and develop new reliable approximate nearest neighbors approaches to speed up the computation of the attraction term of t-SNE and other clustering algorithms (Aim 2A). Our additional variants of t-SNE will be further developed to allow better separation between clusters of cell subpopulations (late exaggeration) and better visualization using 1D t-SNE for heatmap gene-cell representation (Aim 2A). We will adapt SpectralNet, our efficient neural network approach, for computing graph Laplacian eigenvectors for large datasets. This will enable computation of spectral clustering, diffusion maps and manifold learning that are utilized in many scRNA studies but are currently limited to a moderate number of single cells (Aim 2B). Finally, we will develop a kernel based differential abundance algorithm to characterize differences between biological conditions (Aim 2C). We will adopt appropriate sampling approaches to significantly improve current methods. This research plan aims at developing scalable spectral computational and neural network tools suitable for analyzing very large single cell RNA sequencing datasets. Specifically, our team which is led by a computational biologist, two prominent applied mathematicians and two prominent biologists will develop and validate scalable and novel techniques for: (i) completing missing values prevalent in these measurements, (ii) removing batch effect, (iii) reducing dimensionality and visualizing very large single cell RNA sequencing datasets and enabling detection of rare cell populations as well as detecting minute changes of cell populations between biological conditions.

"High throughput cell screening for toxic metal exposure Project Summary The overall objective of this research project is to develop a novel approach for high throughput screening of individual cells based on holographic imaging. To achieve this goal, we propose to implement a new quantitative phase imaging modality, holographic cytomtery, which incorporates several novel technical advances to enable high throughput imaging. Holographic cytometry (HC) will bring the high sensitivity of quantitative phase microscopy (QPM) to imaging of cells flowing through microfluidic devices. While QPM has been used for cell analysis previously, typically only a handful of cells have been imaged. To enable significant application of QPM for fundamental cell biology and clinical studies, it is necessary to move to a high throughput implementation. Technical advances needed to realize the high resolution HC system include use of high speed line scan cameras, microfluidic chips with multiple parallel channels, and light from a pulsed laser source to enable stroboscopic illumination. In order to efficiently analyze and process this data set, rapid analysis software will be developed that leverages the highly parallel processing capabilities of graphics processing units and machine learning algorithms to enable automated classification. The proposed HC method can be applied to imaging a wide range of flowing cells. To demonstrate the utility of the approach, we will initially target the measurement of cancerous progression due to environmental toxicant exposure. We have conducted a preliminary study that shows QPM can detect early changes in the biomechanical properties of cells due to arsenic exposure. In the proposed project, we seek to develop QPM based biomarkers of pre-cancerous change that will enable rapid assessesment. QPM has not been implemented in such a format to date and thus is not yet a feasible approach for clinical or research studies. To meet the goal of high throughput imaging with QPM, the following Specific Aims are proposed: 1. Develop new instrumentation for high speed imaging using off axis digital holography. 2. Implement high throughput analysis methods based on machine learning 3. Test and validate high throughput system with pilot studies of heavy metal exposed epithelial cells to show the approach can detect early pre-cancerous changes due to environmental toxicant exposure. Upon completion of this project, we will have realized a high throughput imaging cytometry system for research and clinical applications. Project Narrative  The proposed research will develop a new high throughput cellular screening technology based on quantitative phase image of cells flowing in a microfluidic chip. This technology will allow researchers and doctors to obtain holographic images of every single cell in a sample in a short amount of time which can then be analyzed by a computer. This would offer the opportunity to evaluate the characteristics of populations of cells for understanding changes in public health due to environmental factors.",High throughput cell screening for toxic metal exposure,9732537,R21ES029791,"['Arsenic', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomechanics', 'Cancerous', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Cytology', 'Cytometry', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Heavy Metals', 'Holography', 'Image', 'Image Cytometry', 'Individual', 'Lasers', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Mechanics', 'Metal exposure', 'Methods', 'Microfluidic Microchips', 'Microfluidics', 'Microscopy', 'Morphology', 'Motion', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population Characteristics', 'Premalignant', 'Process', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Stream', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic Environmental Substances', 'Toxicant exposure', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'carcinogenesis', 'cellular imaging', 'clinical application', 'detector', 'digital', 'high throughput analysis', 'high throughput screening', 'imaging approach', 'imaging modality', 'instrument', 'instrumentation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine vision', 'mechanical properties', 'microscopic imaging', 'nanoscale', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'parallel computer', 'parallel processing', 'prevent', 'research clinical testing', 'research study', 'screening', 'shear stress', 'systems research', 'tool', 'toxic metal']",NIEHS,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R21,2019,194177,0.031055146403153325
"High-throughput high-content single cell analysis by multichannel stimulatedRaman flow cytometry ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Flow cytometry is one of the most important tools for high-throughput single cell analysis. Fluorescent labeling acts as the primary approach for cellular analysis in flow cytometry. Nevertheless, fluorescent tags are not applicable to all cases especially small molecules (e.g. metabolites) for which labeling may significantly perturb their properties. Raman spectroscopic signals arising from inherent molecular vibrations provide a key approach to detect specific molecules inside cells and to differentiate cellular state. Raman-based microfluidic devices have been reported. However, the very small cross section of spontaneous Raman scattering results in low Raman signal level and consequently long data acquisition time, which is not compatible with the high- speed flow condition. The long-term goal of the proposed project is to establish a high-throughput high-content single cell analysis platform using molecular fingerprint vibrations as contrast. The specific objective of current application is to develop a vibrational spectroscopic cytometer based on the stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) process. Several recent advances in the Ji-Xin Cheng (PI) lab, including the highly sensitive femtosecond SRS imaging, lock-in free SRS signal detection and a tuned amplifier array for multiplex SRS imaging, pave the foundation for the planned instrumentation. The PI has assembled an interdisciplinary team for the proposed study. Dr. J. Paul Robinson (co-PI) is a leader in development and applications of fluorescence-based flow cytometer and he will bring expertise to the design of fluidics and multichannel detection systems. Dr. Bartek Rajwa (co-PI) will provide expertise for spectroscopic cytometry data analysis and machine learning. The team will design and construct a SRS flow cytometer by multichannel detection of dispersed SRS signal (Aim 1), construct a tandem system able to collect SRS and fluorescence data (Aim 2), develop spectral un-mixing and machine-learning analysis tools able to combine the information obtained from SRS spectra and labeled biomarkers for functional classification of cells (Aim 3), and validate the capability of SRS flow cytometer for label-free detection of single-cell metabolism (Aim 4). With a speed of analyzing thousands of cells per second, SRS flow cytometer will enable high-throughput analysis of single-cell chemical content which is beyond the reach by fluorescence-based flow cytometer. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to build a high-throughput single cell analysis platform through multiplex stimulated Raman scattering detection of single flowing cells at microsecond time scale. Having fluorescence and stimulated Raman scattering detection in tandem, our platform is capable of discovering new metabolic signatures of cell subpopulations (e.g. cancer stem cells sorted through fluorescent markers). Such discovery could potentially lead to new development of disease-specific treatment strategies.",High-throughput high-content single cell analysis by multichannel stimulatedRaman flow cytometry,9692022,R01GM118471,"['Amplifiers', 'Biological Markers', 'Cells', 'Cellular Metabolic Process', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Cytometry', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Energy Transfer', 'Event', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescence', 'Foundations', 'Geometry', 'Glucose', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of ovary', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Microfluidic Microchips', 'Microfluidics', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Nanostructures', 'Optics', 'Phase', 'Polymers', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Process', 'Property', 'Quartz', 'Reporting', 'Sampling', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'Stream', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tube', 'base', 'biological systems', 'cancer cell', 'cancer stem cell', 'data acquisition', 'design', 'design and construction', 'detector', 'electric impedance', 'high throughput analysis', 'instrumentation', 'light scattering', 'novel strategies', 'particle', 'photomultiplier', 'public health relevance', 'single cell analysis', 'small molecule', 'spectroscopic data', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'vibration']",NIGMS,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),R01,2019,388535,0.11708572402050593
"Transformative Computational Infrastructures for Cell-Based Biomarker Diagnostics Project Summary The presence of abnormal cell populations in patient samples is diagnostic for a variety of human diseases, especially leukemias and lymphomas. One of the main technologies used for cell-based diagnostic evaluation is flow cytometry, which employs fluorescent reagents to measure molecular characteristics of cell populations in complex mixtures. While cytometry evaluation is routinely used for the diagnosis of blood-borne malignancies, it could be more widely applied to the diagnosis of other diseases (e.g. asthma, allergy and autoimmunity) if it could be reproducibly used to interpret higher complexity staining panels and recognize more subtle cell population differences. Flow cytometry analysis is also widely used for single cell phenotyping in translational research studies to explore the mechanisms of normal and abnormal biological processes. More recently, the development of mass cytometry promises to further increase the application of single cell cytometry evaluation to understand a wide range of physiological, pathological and therapeutic processes. The current practice for cytometry data analysis relies on “manual gating” of two-dimensional data plots to identify cell subsets in complex mixtures. However, this process is subjective, labor intensive, and irreproducible making it difficult to deploy in multicenter translational research studies or clinical trials where protocol standardization and harmonization are essential. The goal of this project is to develop, validate and disseminate a user-friendly infrastructure for the computational analysis of cytometry data for both diagnostic and discovery applications that could help overcome the current limitations of manual analysis and provide for more efficient, objective and accurate analysis, through the following aims: Specific Aim 1 – Implement a novel computational infrastructure – FlowGate – for cytometry data analysis that includes visual analytics and machine learning; Specific Aim 2 – Assess the utility of FlowGate for cell population characterization in mechanistic translational research studies (T1); Specific Aim 3 – Assess the robustness and accuracy of FlowGate for clinical diagnostics in comparison with the current standard-of-care analysis of diagnostic cytometry data (T2); Specific Aim 4 – Develop training and educational resources and conduct directed outreach activities to stimulate adoption and use of the resulting FlowGate cyberinfrastructure. The project will have a major impact in advancing translational science by overcoming key hurdles for adoption of these computational methods by facilitating analysis pipeline optimization, providing intuitive user interfacing, and delivering directed training activities. The application of the developed computational infrastructure for improved diagnostics of AML and CLL will contribute to the new emphasis on precision medicine by more precisely quantifying the patient-specific characteristics of neoplastic and normal reactive cell populations. Although FlowGate will be developed by the UC San Diego, UC Irvine, and Stanford CTSAs, the resulting computational infrastructure will be made freely available to the entire research community. Project Narrative Flow cytometry analysis is widely used for single cell phenotyping in the translational research lab to explore the mechanisms of normal and abnormal biological processes and in the clinical diagnostic lab for the identification and classification of blood-borne malignancies. However, the current practice for cytometry data analysis using “manual gating” based on two-dimensional data plots is subjective, labor-intensive and unreliable, especially when using more complex high content staining panels.

"A robust platform for multiplexed, subcellular proteomic imaging in human tissue Project Summary Multiplexed Ion Beam Imaging by Time of Flight (MIBI-TOF) uses secondary ion mass spectrometry and metal conjugated primary antibodies to simultaneously visualize dozens of proteins at subcellular resolution in a single tissue section. This technology is back compatible with archival formalin fixed, paraffin embedded tissue (FFPE) and has been used in peer-reviewed work to simultaneously visualize and quantify 36 proteins in retrospective human tissue cohorts. In line with the stated goals of the HuBMAP consortium to develop both “High-sensitivity, high-resolution imaging techniques that can rapidly provide spectral data over large areas of tissue” and “Quantitative imaging analysis tools, including automated 3D image segmentation, feature extraction, and image annotation,” the work outlined here will create a standardized, high throughput, and user-friendly workflow for using MIBI-TOF in basic and translational research to gain insight into how single cell phenotype and tissue structure are functionally-linked in health and disease. To achieve this, we will validate 100 FFPE antibodies and optimize ready-to-use multiplexed staining panels in lyophilized format that will permit storage for at least two years. Protocols and reagents for multiplexed signal amplification of protein and mRNA targets will be further refined, while next generation instrumentation will increase sample throughput to permit full tissue section imaging of up to 40 proteins in 1 hour. Standardized reagents and more robust instrumentation will be accompanied by an automated computational pipeline that utilizes a standard set of segmentation markers and machine learning to accurately identify nuclei and cell borders in any non-neural human tissue. This data will be used to cluster single cell events into functionally distinct populations according to morphology, protein expression, and histological distribution. The reagents and computational pipeline proposed here synergize with existing HuBMAP-funded platforms and could be readily generalized to virtually any high dimensional imaging modality. Thus, this work will not only provide a practical, back compatible imaging platform for high throughput multiplexed imaging, but will also accelerate development of other complimentary imaging technologies as well. Project Narrative Multiplexed ion beam imaging by time of flight (MIBI-TOF) is a new technology for visualizing dozens of proteins in standard clinical tissue biopsies at high resolution. The work outlined here will create a standardized, high throughput, and user-friendly workflow for using MIBI-TOF in basic and translational research to gain insight into how single cell phenotype and tissue structure are functionally-linked in health and disease.","A robust platform for multiplexed, subcellular proteomic imaging in human tissue",9894465,UH3CA246633,"['Allergic', 'Antibodies', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Back', 'Basic Science', 'Biopsy', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Cloud Computing', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decidua', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Equipment', 'Event', 'Extramural Activities', 'Feedback', 'First Pregnancy Trimester', 'Formalin', 'Foundations', 'Freeze Drying', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Granuloma', 'Health', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Histologic', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Immune', 'Immunosuppression', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Ions', 'Letters', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical center', 'Messenger RNA', 'Metals', 'Morphology', 'Multiplexed Ion Beam Imaging', 'Noninfiltrating Intraductal Carcinoma', 'Optics', 'Organ', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Pathology', 'Peer Review', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Protocols documentation', 'Pulmonary Tuberculosis', 'Readiness', 'Reagent', 'Reproducibility', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Secondary Ion', 'Stains', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Tissue Embedding', 'Tissues', 'Translational Research', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'cancer immunotherapy', 'cohort', 'computational platform', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'graphical user interface', 'high dimensionality', 'high resolution imaging', 'human imaging', 'human tissue', 'imaging Segmentation', 'imaging modality', 'imaging platform', 'insight', 'instrumentation', 'ion source', 'learning strategy', 'multiplexed\xa0imaging', 'new technology', 'next generation', 'programs', 'protein expression', 'quantitative imaging', 'reagent standardization', 'technology validation', 'tool', 'tumor microenvironment', 'user-friendly', 'virtual']",NCI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,UH3,2019,590000,0.035615799451558794
"Accelerating Multi-modal Biomarker Discovery in Translational Research with Cloud Data Integration Project Summary/Abstract Cytobank is the leading cloud-based platform for analysis and storage of single cell flow and mass cytometry data, technologies that are essential for investigating the interplay between the immune system and disease conditions including cancer. There are numerous data analysis steps between raw data and insight especially for many single-cell technologies, where the data analysis is complex, highly expert-driven and/or reliant on novel computational methodologies. Cytobank already makes major contributions (1) centralizing single-cell cytometry data, (2) providing data analysis traceability that removes knowledge sharing complexities, and (3) establishing a platform that increases access to cutting edge algorithms and makes complex machine learning methods easy for biologists to use. However, as the amount, complexity, and different types of single cell data and other associated data increases and the number of workflows and single-cell algorithms to analyze the data also increases, the need for open and easy access to existing and new tools and secure, complete storage of the workflows and the resulting data has increased to the point of being critical for supporting basic and translational research collaborations and enabling them to efficiently achieve their objectives including biomarker discovery and development. The proposed project significantly extends the capabilities of the Cytobank platform. This will benefit the community by (1) enabling scalable and secure access to a number of new single-cell data analysis tools that will result in new automated workflows, and (2) enable more efficient cross platform knowledge generation with increased meta-analysis capabilities across experiments and data types. The potential of this project is that thousands of scientists around the world will be able to more easily leverage additional single-cell cytometry, transcript, and other data in their translational research data analysis including automating analysis that has primarily been dominated by expert-driven annotation, thus providing a central repository and knowledge management framework that will accelerate biomarker discovery and precision medicine. Project Narrative Single-cell biology and Immunotherapy are exploding and generating larger and more complex datasets in combination clinical trials. To take full advantage of these revolutions, the iteration and dissemination of advanced single-cell data analysis algorithms (many of whose development was funded by the NIH) needs to scale at the same rate as single-cell data generation technologies are scaling, and multi-omics data analysis and visualization must be integrated and automated. This project will greatly accelerate scientific research, transparency, and reproducibility by significantly lowering the barrier to perform complex data analysis of multiple types of high-dimensional data, providing the biomedical research community with access to powerful tools needed in immuno-oncology, autoimmunity and other high-impact disease areas.",Accelerating Multi-modal Biomarker Discovery in Translational Research with Cloud Data Integration,9672504,R44GM117914,"['Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Autoimmunity', 'B-Cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia', 'Basic Science', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cytometry', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Follicular Lymphoma', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Generations', 'Immune System Diseases', 'Immune system', 'Immunologic Monitoring', 'Immunology', 'Immunooncology', 'Immunotherapy', 'Information Resources Management', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Multiomic Data', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Regimen', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Sharing', 'Resources', 'Scientist', 'Secure', 'System', 'Target Populations', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Toxic effect', 'Transcript', 'Translational Research', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'anti-cancer', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'biomarker development', 'biomarker discovery', 'biomarker validation', 'clinically actionable', 'cloud based', 'cost effective', 'cytokine', 'data integration', 'data management', 'data visualization', 'experimental study', 'high dimensionality', 'immunotherapy trials', 'improved', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'multidimensional data', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'personalized medicine', 'population based', 'precision medicine', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'relapse prediction', 'repository', 'response', 'single cell analysis', 'single cell technology', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'synergism', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor']",NIGMS,"CYTOBANK, INC.",R44,2019,652516,0.08502677870949414
"Turning a sequence barcode into a spectral barcode for single-cell analysis. Project Summary: The use of sequence barcodes has enabled high-throughput transcriptomic analysis of single cells. But one challenge remains – there is no method to map the physical assessments of single cells and the downstream transcriptomic data of single cells to the same cells of origin. This is because currently sequence barcodes are only read by sequencing which takes place after all single cells are lysed, reverse transcription is completed, and cDNA are amplified and pooled. In order to perform transcriptomic analysis and physical assessments on the same single cells, we will need a method that allows us to decipher the sequence barcodes while in the process of single-cell physical interrogation. Our goal in this proposed research is to develop a new method to turn sequence barcodes into spectral barcodes that can be read locally in the process. The proposed sequence- barcode-reading technique, if it can be realized, will have substantial impact to the single-cell community as it will become the only method to map the physical assessments and the downstream molecular analysis data to the same cells of origin in a high-throughput, streamlined format. Project Narrative: High-throughput single-cell analysis has advanced our knowledge in developmental biology and disease origins. But currently there is no method to map the physical and transcriptional analysis data of single cells to the same cells of origin.

"Finding emergent structure in multi-sample biological data with the dual geometry of cells and features    A fundamental question in biomedical data analysis is how to capture biological heterogeneity and characterize the complex spectrum of health states (or disease conditions) in patient cohorts. Indeed, much effort has been invested in developing new technologies that provide groundbreaking collections of genomic information at a single cell resolution, unlocking numerous potential advances in understanding the progression and driving forces of biological states. However, these new biomedical technologies produce large volumes of data, quantified by numerous measurements, and often collected in many batches or samples (e.g., from different patients, locations, or times). Exploration and understanding of such data are challenging tasks, but the potential for new discoveries at a level previously not possible justifies the considerable effort required to overcome these difficulties.  In this project we focus on multi-sample single-cell data, e.g., from a multi-patient cohort, where data points represent cells, data features represent gene expressions or protein abundances, and samples (e.g., considered as separate batches or datasets) represent patients. We consider a duality or interaction between constructing an intrinsic geometry of cells (e.g., with manifold learning techniques) and processing data features as signals over it (e.g., with graph signal processing techniques). We propose the utilization of this duality for several data exploration tasks, including data denoising, identifying noise-invariant phenomena, cluster characterization, and aligning cellular features over multiple datasets. Furthermore, we expect the dual multiresolution organization of data points and features to allow us to compute aggregated signatures that represent patients, and then provide a novel data embedding that reveals multiscale structure from the cellular level to the patient level.  The proposed research combines recent advances in several fields at the forefront of data science, including geometric deep learning, manifold learning, and harmonic analysis. The methods developed in this project will provide novel advances in each of these fields, while also establishing new relations between them. Furthermore, the challenges addressed by these methods are a foundational prerequisite for new advances in genomic research, and more generally in empirical data analysis where data is collected in varying experimental environments. The developed algorithms and methods in this project will be validated in several biomedical settings, including characterizing Zika immunity in Dengue patients, tracking progress of Lyme disease, and predicting the effectiveness of immunotherapy. In this project we will develop new algorithms for biomedical data analysis that will characterize the complex spectrum of health states across various patient populations. These algorithms will leverage the large volumes of data collected by new biomedical technologies, focusing on single-cell data. Specific analysis will be carried out for characterizing Zika immunity in Dengue patients, tracking progress of Lyme disease, and predicting the effectiveness of immunotherapy.",Finding emergent structure in multi-sample biological data with the dual geometry of cells and features   ,9903563,R01GM135929,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Technology', 'Cells', 'Cellular Structures', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Dengue', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Environment', 'Foundations', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genomics', 'Geometry', 'Graph', 'Health', 'Immunity', 'Immunotherapy', 'Instruction', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Lyme Disease', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Noise', 'Patients', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Zika Virus', 'algorithmic methodologies', 'biological heterogeneity', 'cohort', 'computerized data processing', 'deep learning', 'denoising', 'driving force', 'new technology', 'novel', 'patient population', 'signal processing']",NIGMS,MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,380650,0.03664026540889876
"Quantitative SRS Imaging of Cancer Metabolism at Single Cell Level Project summary: Although altered cell metabolism is becoming an established hallmark of cancer, there remains a crucial need of new tools for quantitation of metabolites at single living cell level. In particular, due to lack of specific labels for metabolites, there is an unmet need for high-resolution imaging tools capable of mapping metabolites and small molecules (fatty acids, carbohydrates, amino acids) that play essential roles in pathogenesis of cancer. Supported by a R21 grant through the IMAT program, our team partially addressed this need via developing a multiplex stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) microscope, which enabled vibrational imaging of metabolites in live tumor cells and intact biopsies at the speed of 5 microseconds per spectrum. This R33 application aims to push the hyperspectral stimulated Raman imaging technology to the next level through (i) technical simplification and validation, (ii) developing a robust hyperspectral image segmentation framework, and (iii) integrating the SRS modality with a commercial spontaneous Raman microscope towards broad use by non-experts. We have assembled an inter-disciplinary team for the proposed development. The three specific aims are: (1) Developing an easy-to-operate, highly sensitive line-by-line hyperspectral SRS microscope and validate its capacity for cancer metabolic imaging at single cell level. (2) Establishing a feature analysis framework for segmentation of hyperspectral SRS images using the non-parametric Bayesian model. (3) Integrating and validating the stimulated Raman imaging modality on a spontaneous Raman microscope. By completing the proposed development and validation activities, we will have generated a highly novel spectroscopic imaging system broadly applicable to analysis of chemical contents of cells and tissues for discovery-driven research and marker- based precision diagnosis.

"A Modeling Framework for Multi-View Data, with Applications to the Pioneer 100 Study and Protein Interaction Networks New advances in biomedical research have made it possible to collect multiple data “views” — for example, genetic, metabolomic, and clinical data — for a single patient. Such multi-view data promises to offer deeper insights into a patient's health and disease than would be possible if just one data view were available. However, in order to achieve this promise, new statistical methods are needed.  This proposal involves developing statistical methods for the analysis of multi-view data. These methods can be used to answer the following fundamental question: do the data views contain redundant information about the observations, or does each data view contain a different set of information? The answer to this question will provide insight into the data views, as well as insight into the observations. If two data views contain redundant information about the observations, then those two data views are related to each other. Furthermore, if each data view tells the same “story” about the observations, then we can be quite conﬁdent that the story is true.  The investigators will develop a uniﬁed framework for modeling multi-view data, which will then be applied in a number of settings. In Aim 1, this framework will be applied to multi-view multivariate data (e.g. a single set of patients, with both clinical and genetic measurements), in order to determine whether a single clustering can adequately describe the patients across all data views, or whether the patients cluster separately in each data view. In Aim 2, the framework will be applied to multi-view network data (e.g. a single set of proteins, with both binary and co-complex interactions measured), in order to determine whether the nodes belong to a single set of communities across the data views, or a separate set of communities in each data view. In Aim 3, the framework will be applied to multi-view multivariate data in order to determine whether the observations can be embedded in a single latent space across all data views, or whether they belong to a separate latent space in each data view. In Aims 1–3, the methods developed will be applied to the Pioneer 100 study, and to the protein interactome. In Aim 4(a), the availability of multiple data views will be used in order to develop a method for tuning parameter selection in unsupervised learning. In Aim 4(b), protein communities that were identiﬁed in Aim 2 will be validated experimentally. High-quality open source software will be developed in Aim 5.  The methods developed in this proposal will be used to determine whether the ﬁndings from multiple data views are the same or different. The application of these methods to multi-view data sets, including the Pioneer 100 study and the protein interactome, will improve our understanding of human health and disease, as well as fundamental biology. Biomedical researchers often collect multiple “types” of data (e.g. clinical data and genetic data) for a single patient, in order to get a fuller picture of that patient's health or disease status than would be possible using any single data type. This proposal involves developing new statistical methods that can be used in order to analyze data sets that consist of multiple data types. Applying these methods will lead to new insights and better understanding of human health and disease.","A Modeling Framework for Multi-View Data, with Applications to the Pioneer 100 Study and Protein Interaction Networks",9752596,R01GM123993,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Clinical Data', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Genetics', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Records', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Set protein', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trust', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'insight', 'metabolomics', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'unsupervised learning']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2019,323659,0.02216343679514505
"3-D Imaging Flow Cytometry PROJECT SUMMARY This project aims to develop and test two innovative platforms and related software for 3-D imaging flow cytometry of fluorescent or absorbing (stained) samples. These systems will allow 3-D structural and functional imaging of many single cells at a subcellular resolution and at a scale that used to be available only in flow cytometry or recently in 2-D imaging. Thereby, the proposed methods have the potential to fundamentally change the ways cultured cells, patient-derived samples, and small experimental organisms are studied. Automated classification based on the 3-D features will enable the diagnosis of hematologic disorders at single-cell precision. Existing 3-D microscopy methods can provide the same information at higher resolution; however, by relying on a scanning mechanism they cannot be applied to suspending cells, especially in a flow configuration, which is essential for high-speed interrogation. Snapshot 3-D microscopy techniques have been developed to address this challenge, but they have insufficient spatial resolution for single-cell imaging and suffer from long data processing time. We overcome these limitations by combining two novel snapshot techniques developed by the PI with the most rigorous optical imaging theories and cutting-edge component technologies. We will use an array of lenslets, which simultaneously records many projection images corresponding with different viewing angles. The use of pupil phase masks, designed using wavefront coding and a theory of 3-D high-numerical-aperture optical imaging, will increase the resolution of each projection image to the theoretical limit given by the objective-lens numerical aperture. The target resolution is 0.5 µm, which is comparable to existing 2-D imaging flow cytometry systems. The target imaging throughputs based on current component technologies are 120 volumes/sec for fluorescence imaging and 700 volumes/sec for absorption imaging, which are higher than 100 volumes/sec of cutting-edge 3-D optical microscopy for stationary specimens. The vast amount of data acquired by these 3-D imaging systems imposes a serious challenge to data processing. The developed systems record true projection images, which obviate iterative deconvolution process, thereby allowing much faster tomographic reconstruction than in existing snapshot techniques. Using general-purpose graphics processing units and optical diffraction tomography, which includes the diffraction of light by subcellular organelles, our tomographic reconstruction algorithm will be faster yet more accurate than existing approaches. Further, we will explore the feasibility of applying a deep convolutional neural network to the images acquired by the developed systems for accurate single-cell classification based on 3-D features. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project aims to develop 3-D imaging flow cytometry platforms for fluorescent or absorbing (stained) cells at high resolution and high throughput in a flow configuration. The developed systems will be built upon two novel snapshot 3-D techniques developed by the PI in combination with most rigorous 3-D optical imaging theories and cutting-edge component technologies.

"Computational tools for regulome mapping using single-cell genomic data Project Summary Understanding how genes' activities are controlled is crucial for elucidating the basic operating rules of biology and molecular mechanisms of diseases. Recent innovations in single-cell genomic technologies have opened the door to analyzing a variety of functional genomic features in individual cells. These technologies enable scientists to systematically discover unknown cell subpopulations in complex tissue and disease samples, and allow them to reconstruct a sample's gene regulatory landscape at an unprecedented cellular resolution. Despite these promising developments, many challenges still exist and must be overcome before one can fully decode gene regulation at the single-cell resolution. In particular, current technologies lack the ability to accurately measure the activity of each individual cis-regulatory element (CRE) in a single cell. They also cannot measure all functional genomic data types in the same cell. Moreover, the prevalent technical biases and noises in single-cell genomic data make computational analysis non-trivial. With rapid growth of data, lack of computational tools for data analysis has become a rate-limiting factor for effective applications of single-cell genomic technologies.  The objective of this proposal is to develop computational and statistical methods and software tools for mapping and analyzing gene regulatory landscape using single-cell genomic data. Our Aim 1 addresses the challenge of accurately measuring CRE activities in single cells using single-cell regulome data. Regulome, deﬁned as the activities of all cis-regulatory elements in a genome, contains crucial information for understanding gene regulation. The state-of-the-art technologies for mapping regulome in a single cell produce sparse data that cannot accurately measure activities of individual CREs. We will develop a new computational framework to allow more accurate analysis of individual CREs' activities in single cells using sparse data. Our Aim 2 addresses the challenge of collecting multiple functional genomic data types in the same cell. We will develop a method that uses single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), the most widely used single-cell functional genomic technology, to predict cells' regulatory landscape. Since most scRNA-seq datasets do not have accompanying single-cell data for other -omics data types, our method will also signiﬁcantly expand the utility and increase the value of scRNA- seq experiments. Our Aim 3 addresses the challenge of integrating different data types generated by different single-cell genomic technologies from different cells. We will develop a method to align single-cell RNA-seq and single-cell regulome data to generate an integrated map of transcriptome and regulome.  Upon completion of this proposal, we will deliver our methods through open-source software tools. These tools will be widely useful for analyzing and integrating single-cell regulome and transcriptome data. By addressing several major challenges in single-cell genomics, our new methods and tools will help unleash the full potential of single-cell genomic technologies for studying gene regulation. As such, they can have a major impact on advancing our understanding of both basic biology and human diseases. Project Narrative Understanding how genes' activities are controlled at single-cell resolution is crucial for studying human diseases. This proposal will develop a coordinated set of computational and statistical methods and software tools for mapping and analyzing gene regulatory programs using single-cell genomic data. These methods and tools will allow scientists to more accurately and comprehensively reconstruct gene regulatory landscape of individual cells in complex tissue and disease samples, and they can have a major impact on advancing our understanding of both basic biology and human diseases.",Computational tools for regulome mapping using single-cell genomic data,9649896,R01HG010889,"['Address', 'Atlases', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Cellular Assay', 'Chromatin', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Foundations', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Molecular', 'Multiomic Data', 'Noise', 'Organ', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Software Tools', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stem Cell Development', 'System', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transposase', 'base', 'computer framework', 'computerized tools', 'epigenome', 'experimental study', 'functional genomics', 'genomic data', 'histone modification', 'human disease', 'innovation', 'multiple omics', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'rapid growth', 'single cell analysis', 'single cell technology', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'user-friendly']",NHGRI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,409375,0.03408136185498706
"Big Flow Cytometry Data: Data Standards, Integration and Analysis PROJECT SUMMARY Flow cytometry is a single-cell measurement technology that is data-rich and plays a critical role in basic research and clinical diagnostics. The volume and dimensionality of data sets currently produced with modern instrumentation is orders of magnitude greater than in the past. Automated analysis methods in the field have made great progress in the past five years. The tools are available to perform automated cell population identification, but the infrastructure, methods and data standards do not yet exist to integrate and compare non-standardized big flow cytometry data sets available in public repositories. This proposal will develop the data standards, software infrastructure and computational methods to enable researchers to leverage the large amount of public cytometry data in order to integrate, re-analyze, and draw novel biological insights from these data sets. The impact of this project will be to provide researchers with tools that can be used to bridge the gap between inference from isolated single experiments or studies, to insights drawn from large data sets from cross-study analysis and multi-center trials. PROJECT NARRATIVE The aims of this project are to develop standards, software and methods for integrating and analyzing big and diverse flow cytometry data sets.

Label-free optical flow cytometers not based on fluorescence are generally based on scattering. The most common of these compares the amount of forward (FS) versus side (SS) scattering. Such two-parameter information permits rudimentary classification based on size or granularity, but it misses more subtle features that can be critical in defining organism identity. Nevertheless, FS/SS flow cytometry remains popular, largely because of its simplicity and capacity for high throughput.  We propose to develop a label-free computational flow cytometer that preserves much of the simplicity and high-throughput capacity of FS/SS flow cytometry, but provides significantly enhanced information. Instead of characterizing organisms based on scattering direction (as does FS/SS flow cytometry), we will characterize based on scattering patterns. We will insert a reconfigurable diffractive element in the imaging optics of a flow cytometer to route user-defined basis patterns to independent detectors. The basis patterns will be optimally matched to specific sample features. The respective weights of these basis patterns will serve as signatures to identify organisms of interest. The basis patterns themselves will be determined by machine learning algorithms. Both the device and the learning algorithms will be developed from scratch.  We anticipate that our flow cytometer will be able to operate at flow rates on the order of meters per second, commensurate with state-of-the-art FS/SS flow cytometers, while providing significantly more information for improved classification capacity. While our technique should be advantageous for any label-free flow cytometry application requiring high throughput, we will test it here by demonstrating high-throughput classification of microbial communities. NARRATIVE Our goal is to improve the information extraction capacity of label-free flow cytometers, while maintaining high throughput capacity. As such, our device should have a broad range of applications.",Development of label-free computational flow cytometry for high-throughput micro-organism classification,9510096,R21GM128020,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Awareness', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Categories', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'Custom', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Elements', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescence', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Image Compression', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Microbe', 'Modernization', 'Optics', 'Organism', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pupil', 'Resolution', 'Route', 'Sampling', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Traction', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'base', 'cellular imaging', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'design', 'detector', 'improved', 'interest', 'meter', 'microbial community', 'microorganism', 'microorganism classification', 'optical imaging', 'prototype', 'recruit']",NIGMS,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),R21,2018,239527,0.07621751341791827
"Reproducible Analytics for Secondary Analyses of ImmPort Vaccination-Related Cytometry Data Project Summary The immunology database and analysis portal (ImmPort, http://immport.niaid.nih.gov) is the NIAID-funded public resource for data archive and dissemination from clinical trials and mechanistic research projects. Among the current 291 studies archived in ImmPort, 114 are focused on vaccine responses (91 for influenza vaccine responses), which is the largest category when organized by research focus. As the most effective method of preventing infectious diseases, development of the next-generation vaccines is faced with the bottleneck that traditional empirical design becomes ineffective to stimulate human protective immunity against HIV, RSV, CMV, and other recent major public health threats. This project will focus on three important aspects of informatics approaches to secondary analysis of ImmPort data for influenza vaccination research: a) expanding the data analytical capabilities of ImmPort and ImmPortGalaxy through adding innovative computational methods for user-friendly unsupervised identification of cell populations, b) processing and analyzing a subset of the existing human influenza vaccination study data in ImmPort to identify cell-based biomarkers using the new computational methods, and c) returning data analysis results with data analytical provenance to ImmPort for dissemination of derived data, software tools, as well as semantic assertions of the identified biomarkers. Each aspect is one specific research aim in the proposed work. The project outcome will not only demonstrate the utility of the ImmPort data archive but also generate a foundation for the Human Vaccine Project (HVP) to establish pilot programs for influenza vaccine research, which currently include Vanderbilt University Medical Center; University of California San Diego (UCSD); Scripps Research Institute; La Jolla Institute of Allergy and Immunology; and J. Craig Venter Institute (JCVI). Once such computational analytical workflow is established, it can be applied to the secondary analysis of other ImmPort studies as well as to support the user-driven analytics of their own cytometry data. Each of the specific aims contains innovative methods or new applications of the existing methods. The computational method for population identification in Aim 1 is a newly developed constrained data clustering method, which combines advantages of unsupervised and supervised learning. Cutting-edge machine learning approaches including random forest will be used in Aim 2 for the identification of biomarkers across study cohorts, in addition to the traditional statistical hypothesis testing. Standardized knowledge representation to be developed in Aim 3 for cell-based biomarkers is also innovative, as semantic networks with inferring and deriving capabilities can be built based on the machine-readable knowledge assertions. The proposed work, when accomplished, will foster broader collaboration between ImmPort and the existing vaccine research consortia. It will also accelerate the deployment of up-to-date informatics software tools on ImmPortGalaxy. Project Narrative Flow cytometry (FCM) plays important roles in human influenza vaccination studies through interrogating immune cellular functions and quantifying the immune responses in different conditions. This project will extend the current data analytical capabilities of the Immunology Database and Analysis Portal (ImmPort) through adding novel data analytical methods and software tools for user-friendly identification of cell populations from FCM data in ImmPort influenza vaccine response studies. The derived data and the knowledge generated from the secondary analysis of the ImmPort vaccination study data will be deposited back to ImmPort and shared with the Human Vaccines Project (HVP) consortium for dissemination.",Reproducible Analytics for Secondary Analyses of ImmPort Vaccination-Related Cytometry Data,9577591,UH2AI132342,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Address', 'Archives', 'Back', 'Biological Markers', 'California', 'Categories', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collaborations', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cytomegalovirus', 'Cytometry', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Failure', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Genetic Transcription', 'HIV', 'Human', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Imagery', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunity', 'Immunology', 'Incidence', 'Influenza', 'Influenza vaccination', 'Informatics', 'Institutes', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri', 'Maps', 'Measles', 'Medical', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Mumps', 'Names', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'Outcome', 'Play', 'Poliomyelitis', 'Population', 'Population Statistics', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention strategy', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Readability', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Institute', 'Research Project Grants', 'Respiratory Syncytial Virus Vaccines', 'Respiratory syncytial virus', 'Role', 'Secondary to', 'Semantics', 'Smallpox', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Supervision', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Universities', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccine Design', 'Vaccine Research', 'Vaccines', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'biomarker identification', 'catalyst', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'computer infrastructure', 'computerized tools', 'data archive', 'data mining', 'data portal', 'data resource', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'forest', 'immune function', 'improved', 'influenza virus vaccine', 'information organization', 'innovation', 'neoplastic', 'news', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel vaccines', 'prevent', 'programs', 'public-private partnership', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'secondary analysis', 'statistics', 'success', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'vaccine development', 'vaccine response', 'vaccine trial', 'vaccine-induced immunity']",NIAID,"J.

"High-throughput high-content single cell analysis by multichannel stimulatedRaman flow cytometry ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Flow cytometry is one of the most important tools for high-throughput single cell analysis. Fluorescent labeling acts as the primary approach for cellular analysis in flow cytometry. Nevertheless, fluorescent tags are not applicable to all cases especially small molecules (e.g. metabolites) for which labeling may significantly perturb their properties. Raman spectroscopic signals arising from inherent molecular vibrations provide a key approach to detect specific molecules inside cells and to differentiate cellular state. Raman-based microfluidic devices have been reported. However, the very small cross section of spontaneous Raman scattering results in low Raman signal level and consequently long data acquisition time, which is not compatible with the high- speed flow condition. The long-term goal of the proposed project is to establish a high-throughput high-content single cell analysis platform using molecular fingerprint vibrations as contrast. The specific objective of current application is to develop a vibrational spectroscopic cytometer based on the stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) process. Several recent advances in the Ji-Xin Cheng (PI) lab, including the highly sensitive femtosecond SRS imaging, lock-in free SRS signal detection and a tuned amplifier array for multiplex SRS imaging, pave the foundation for the planned instrumentation. The PI has assembled an interdisciplinary team for the proposed study. Dr. J. Paul Robinson (co-PI) is a leader in development and applications of fluorescence-based flow cytometer and he will bring expertise to the design of fluidics and multichannel detection systems. Dr. Bartek Rajwa (co-PI) will provide expertise for spectroscopic cytometry data analysis and machine learning. The team will design and construct a SRS flow cytometer by multichannel detection of dispersed SRS signal (Aim 1), construct a tandem system able to collect SRS and fluorescence data (Aim 2), develop spectral un-mixing and machine-learning analysis tools able to combine the information obtained from SRS spectra and labeled biomarkers for functional classification of cells (Aim 3), and validate the capability of SRS flow cytometer for label-free detection of single-cell metabolism (Aim 4). With a speed of analyzing thousands of cells per second, SRS flow cytometer will enable high-throughput analysis of single-cell chemical content which is beyond the reach by fluorescence-based flow cytometer. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to build a high-throughput single cell analysis platform through multiplex stimulated Raman scattering detection of single flowing cells at microsecond time scale. Having fluorescence and stimulated Raman scattering detection in tandem, our platform is capable of discovering new metabolic signatures of cell subpopulations (e.g. cancer stem cells sorted through fluorescent markers). Such discovery could potentially lead to new development of disease-specific treatment strategies.",High-throughput high-content single cell analysis by multichannel stimulatedRaman flow cytometry,9525343,R01GM118471,"['Amplifiers', 'Biological Markers', 'Cells', 'Cellular Metabolic Process', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Cytometry', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Energy Transfer', 'Event', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescence', 'Foundations', 'Geometry', 'Glucose', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of ovary', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Microfluidic Microchips', 'Microfluidics', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Nanostructures', 'Optics', 'Phase', 'Polymers', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Process', 'Property', 'Quartz', 'Reporting', 'Sampling', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'Stream', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tube', 'base', 'biological systems', 'cancer cell', 'cancer stem cell', 'data acquisition', 'design', 'design and construction', 'detector', 'electric impedance', 'high throughput analysis', 'instrumentation', 'light scattering', 'novel strategies', 'particle', 'photomultiplier', 'public health relevance', 'single cell analysis', 'small molecule', 'spectroscopic data', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'vibration']",NIGMS,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),R01,2018,388379,0.11708572402050593
"High throughput cell screening for toxic metal exposure Project Summary The overall objective of this research project is to develop a novel approach for high throughput screening of individual cells based on holographic imaging. To achieve this goal, we propose to implement a new quantitative phase imaging modality, holographic cytomtery, which incorporates several novel technical advances to enable high throughput imaging. Holographic cytometry (HC) will bring the high sensitivity of quantitative phase microscopy (QPM) to imaging of cells flowing through microfluidic devices. While QPM has been used for cell analysis previously, typically only a handful of cells have been imaged. To enable significant application of QPM for fundamental cell biology and clinical studies, it is necessary to move to a high throughput implementation. Technical advances needed to realize the high resolution HC system include use of high speed line scan cameras, microfluidic chips with multiple parallel channels, and light from a pulsed laser source to enable stroboscopic illumination. In order to efficiently analyze and process this data set, rapid analysis software will be developed that leverages the highly parallel processing capabilities of graphics processing units and machine learning algorithms to enable automated classification. The proposed HC method can be applied to imaging a wide range of flowing cells. To demonstrate the utility of the approach, we will initially target the measurement of cancerous progression due to environmental toxicant exposure. We have conducted a preliminary study that shows QPM can detect early changes in the biomechanical properties of cells due to arsenic exposure. In the proposed project, we seek to develop QPM based biomarkers of pre-cancerous change that will enable rapid assessesment. QPM has not been implemented in such a format to date and thus is not yet a feasible approach for clinical or research studies. To meet the goal of high throughput imaging with QPM, the following Specific Aims are proposed: 1. Develop new instrumentation for high speed imaging using off axis digital holography. 2. Implement high throughput analysis methods based on machine learning 3. Test and validate high throughput system with pilot studies of heavy metal exposed epithelial cells to show the approach can detect early pre-cancerous changes due to environmental toxicant exposure. Upon completion of this project, we will have realized a high throughput imaging cytometry system for research and clinical applications. Project Narrative  The proposed research will develop a new high throughput cellular screening technology based on quantitative phase image of cells flowing in a microfluidic chip. This technology will allow researchers and doctors to obtain holographic images of every single cell in a sample in a short amount of time which can then be analyzed by a computer. This would offer the opportunity to evaluate the characteristics of populations of cells for understanding changes in public health due to environmental factors.",High throughput cell screening for toxic metal exposure,9610235,R21ES029791,"['Algorithms', 'Arsenic', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomechanics', 'Cancerous', 'Cell Count', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Cytology', 'Cytometry', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Heavy Metals', 'Holography', 'Image', 'Image Cytometry', 'Individual', 'Lasers', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Mechanics', 'Metal exposure', 'Methods', 'Microfluidic Microchips', 'Microfluidics', 'Microscopy', 'Morphology', 'Motion', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population Characteristics', 'Premalignant', 'Process', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Stream', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic Environmental Substances', 'Toxicant exposure', 'Vision', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'carcinogenesis', 'cellular imaging', 'clinical application', 'detector', 'digital', 'high throughput analysis', 'high throughput screening', 'imaging approach', 'imaging modality', 'instrument', 'instrumentation', 'mechanical properties', 'microscopic imaging', 'nanoscale', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'parallel computer', 'parallel processing', 'prevent', 'research clinical testing', 'research study', 'screening', 'shear stress', 'systems research', 'tool', 'toxic metal']",NIEHS,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R21,2018,209312,0.031055146403153325
"Alicanto:  Proteogenomic discovery of single chain antibodies in llama Antibodies are a key component of the adaptive immune system, released in response to disease in order to target foreign molecular surfaces. Due to their capacity for high target affinity and specificity, they’ve become one of the fastest growing classes of therapeutic molecules addressing a range of disease including infectious diseases, auto-immune diseases, and cancer. Camelids, including llamas, camels, and alpacas, produce a unique repertoire of antibodies that includes both dual chain antibodies and single chain antibodies. Single chain antibodies, due to their comparative structural simplicity, are simpler to express and develop at the scale required for therapeutics. In addition, single chain antibodies are able to bind to small epitopes, such as enzyme active sites, that would be hidden to larger, dual chain antibodies. The binding domain of the single chain antibody may be small enough to infiltrate traditionally difficult to access tissues, including crossing the blood-brain barrier.  Current approaches to single chain antibody discovery require the collection of cells that encode the antibody genes, including memory B cells and plasma cells. Target-specific antibodies are selected after the antibody transcripts are cloned into a display system, such as phage or yeast. While memory B cells and plasma cells represent only a minute fraction of the cells located in peripheral blood, target- specific antibodies are present in high concentration in blood after an infection. Each plasma cell can secrete thousands of antibodies per minute. Digital Proteomics is developing Alicanto, a technology that utilizes the antibodies circulating in blood to identify target-specific antibodies.  Alicanto integrates two sources of information about the antibody repertoire. First, Alicanto constructs a database of potential antigen-specific antibodies by performing next-generation sequencing of antibody transcripts. Next, Alicanto enriches for target-specific antibodies from the blood using affinity chromatography and subjects the antibodies to tandem mass spectrometry. Finally, Alicanto uses machine learning models to integrate the sequencing and mass spectrometry data to derive a collection of target-specific antibody candidates. For single chain antibody discovery, Alicanto will use specialized primers and enrichment techniques to isolate only the subset of the antibody repertoire that contains the single chain antibodies. Alicanto will be used to discover high affinity, single chain antibodies for development as therapeutic molecules. Antibodies are produced natively in humans to fight disease and the molecules have garnered significant attention due to their therapeutic potential. Single-chain antibodies, which are smaller than conventional antibodies, represent a new frontier for antibody-based therapeutics due to their ability to target molecular surfaces that would be hidden to larger antibodies, as well as the relative simplicity of their development.

"Transformative Computational Infrastructures for Cell-Based Biomarker Diagnostics Project Summary The presence of abnormal cell populations in patient samples is diagnostic for a variety of human diseases, especially leukemias and lymphomas. One of the main technologies used for cell-based diagnostic evaluation is flow cytometry, which employs fluorescent reagents to measure molecular characteristics of cell populations in complex mixtures. While cytometry evaluation is routinely used for the diagnosis of blood-borne malignancies, it could be more widely applied to the diagnosis of other diseases (e.g. asthma, allergy and autoimmunity) if it could be reproducibly used to interpret higher complexity staining panels and recognize more subtle cell population differences. Flow cytometry analysis is also widely used for single cell phenotyping in translational research studies to explore the mechanisms of normal and abnormal biological processes. More recently, the development of mass cytometry promises to further increase the application of single cell cytometry evaluation to understand a wide range of physiological, pathological and therapeutic processes. The current practice for cytometry data analysis relies on “manual gating” of two-dimensional data plots to identify cell subsets in complex mixtures. However, this process is subjective, labor intensive, and irreproducible making it difficult to deploy in multicenter translational research studies or clinical trials where protocol standardization and harmonization are essential. The goal of this project is to develop, validate and disseminate a user-friendly infrastructure for the computational analysis of cytometry data for both diagnostic and discovery applications that could help overcome the current limitations of manual analysis and provide for more efficient, objective and accurate analysis, through the following aims: Specific Aim 1 – Implement a novel computational infrastructure – FlowGate – for cytometry data analysis that includes visual analytics and machine learning; Specific Aim 2 – Assess the utility of FlowGate for cell population characterization in mechanistic translational research studies (T1); Specific Aim 3 – Assess the robustness and accuracy of FlowGate for clinical diagnostics in comparison with the current standard-of-care analysis of diagnostic cytometry data (T2); Specific Aim 4 – Develop training and educational resources and conduct directed outreach activities to stimulate adoption and use of the resulting FlowGate cyberinfrastructure. The project will have a major impact in advancing translational science by overcoming key hurdles for adoption of these computational methods by facilitating analysis pipeline optimization, providing intuitive user interfacing, and delivering directed training activities. The application of the developed computational infrastructure for improved diagnostics of AML and CLL will contribute to the new emphasis on precision medicine by more precisely quantifying the patient-specific characteristics of neoplastic and normal reactive cell populations. Although FlowGate will be developed by the UC San Diego, UC Irvine, and Stanford CTSAs, the resulting computational infrastructure will be made freely available to the entire research community. Project Narrative Flow cytometry analysis is widely used for single cell phenotyping in the translational research lab to explore the mechanisms of normal and abnormal biological processes and in the clinical diagnostic lab for the identification and classification of blood-borne malignancies. However, the current practice for cytometry data analysis using “manual gating” based on two-dimensional data plots is subjective, labor-intensive and unreliable, especially when using more complex high content staining panels.

"Accelerating Multi-modal Biomarker Discovery in Translational Research with Cloud Data Integration Project Summary/Abstract Cytobank is the leading cloud-based platform for analysis and storage of single cell flow and mass cytometry data, technologies that are essential for investigating the interplay between the immune system and disease conditions including cancer. There are numerous data analysis steps between raw data and insight especially for many single-cell technologies, where the data analysis is complex, highly expert-driven and/or reliant on novel computational methodologies. Cytobank already makes major contributions (1) centralizing single-cell cytometry data, (2) providing data analysis traceability that removes knowledge sharing complexities, and (3) establishing a platform that increases access to cutting edge algorithms and makes complex machine learning methods easy for biologists to use. However, as the amount, complexity, and different types of single cell data and other associated data increases and the number of workflows and single-cell algorithms to analyze the data also increases, the need for open and easy access to existing and new tools and secure, complete storage of the workflows and the resulting data has increased to the point of being critical for supporting basic and translational research collaborations and enabling them to efficiently achieve their objectives including biomarker discovery and development. The proposed project significantly extends the capabilities of the Cytobank platform. This will benefit the community by (1) enabling scalable and secure access to a number of new single-cell data analysis tools that will result in new automated workflows, and (2) enable more efficient cross platform knowledge generation with increased meta-analysis capabilities across experiments and data types. The potential of this project is that thousands of scientists around the world will be able to more easily leverage additional single-cell cytometry, transcript, and other data in their translational research data analysis including automating analysis that has primarily been dominated by expert-driven annotation, thus providing a central repository and knowledge management framework that will accelerate biomarker discovery and precision medicine. Project Narrative Single-cell biology and Immunotherapy are exploding and generating larger and more complex datasets in combination clinical trials. To take full advantage of these revolutions, the iteration and dissemination of advanced single-cell data analysis algorithms (many of whose development was funded by the NIH) needs to scale at the same rate as single-cell data generation technologies are scaling, and multi-omics data analysis and visualization must be integrated and automated. This project will greatly accelerate scientific research, transparency, and reproducibility by significantly lowering the barrier to perform complex data analysis of multiple types of high-dimensional data, providing the biomedical research community with access to powerful tools needed in immuno-oncology, autoimmunity and other high-impact disease areas.",Accelerating Multi-modal Biomarker Discovery in Translational Research with Cloud Data Integration,9464486,R44GM117914,"['Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Autoimmunity', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Basic Science', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cytometry', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Follicular Lymphoma', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Generations', 'Immune System Diseases', 'Immune system', 'Immunologic Monitoring', 'Immunology', 'Immunooncology', 'Immunotherapy', 'Information Resources Management', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Regimen', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Sharing', 'Resources', 'Scientist', 'Secure', 'System', 'Target Populations', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Toxic effect', 'Transcript', 'Translational Research', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'anti-cancer', 'base', 'biomarker development', 'biomarker discovery', 'biomarker validation', 'clinically actionable', 'cloud based', 'cost effective', 'cytokine', 'data integration', 'data management', 'data visualization', 'experimental study', 'high dimensionality', 'immunotherapy trials', 'improved', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'multiple omics', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'personalized medicine', 'population based', 'precision medicine', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'relapse prediction', 'repository', 'response', 'single cell analysis', 'single cell technology', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'synergism', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor']",NIGMS,"CYTOBANK, INC.",R44,2018,613841,0.08502677870949414
"Imaging Live Cells with Super-Resolution Microscopy NIH-R15 “Imaging Live Cells with Super-Resolution Microscopy” Project Summary Fluorescence optical microscopy is one of the most important tools available for the study of biological systems at the cellular level. Unfortunately, due to diffraction phenomena the resolution of fluorescence microscopes in the lateral dimension is limited to about 250 nm. As many biological structures within cells are much smaller than this, increasing resolution is of prime importance. Although several methods are now available which are able to extend the resolution of optical microscopes beyond the diffraction limit, imaging live cells with these methods remains a major challenge. Super-resolution structured illumination microscopy (SIM), which can achieve a resolution of approximately 100 nm, is a suitable super-resolution method for imaging live cells. However, adoption of this technique by biologists is hindered by the inflexible equipment and artifact-prone image analysis algorithms which are currently available. The solution to this problem demands innovations in both optical design and in data processing methods which are used in SIM. Another new method, single molecule localization microscopy, achieves much higher resolution. Although live cell imaging has been demonstrated using single molecule localization approaches, applicability of this method in live cell studies is extremely limited due to the need to collect several thousand images to reconstruct a single super-resolution image. One solution to this problem is to greatly increase the density of photoactivated molecules in a given camera frame, but doing so requires more sophisticated computational methods to produce a satisfactory result. The goal of this interdisciplinary project is to develop, improve, and utilize super-resolution microscopy with a focus on imaging live cells. In Aim 1 we will develop alternative illumination approaches for SIM using economical components, and we will develop and implement improved SIM reconstruction algorithms which produce higher quality, more reliable results than are available with current methods. In Aim 2, we will improve single molecule localization microscopy, by developing and implementing algorithms for analysis of images with high densities of photoactivated molecules. Using the high density single molecule methods we develop, we expect to be able to accelerate imaging speed by a factor of 50, with a resulting image resolution of approximately 20 nm. In Aim 3, we will use the newly developed methods for studies of the molecular basis of allergic responses. We will use a novel total internal reflection-SIM microscope with polarized excitation to reveal the relationship between cell surface receptors and the morphology of the plasma membrane, in particular membrane regions with high curvature. NIH-R15: Imaging Live Cells with Super-Resolution Microscopy Project Narrative Several methods are now available which are able to produce optical fluorescence microscopy images of cells with a resolution that is not limited by diffraction. These methods, known together as super-resolution microscopy, are limited in their capabilities and applications when imaging live cells. This interdisciplinary AREA project, submitted by a team of three investigators, will involve undergraduate and graduate students at the University of Colorado, Colorado Springs in improving live cell imaging with super-resolution microscopy techniques. We will use the improved methods for studies of the molecular basis of allergic responses, which affect more than 50 million Americans each year.",Imaging Live Cells with Super-Resolution Microscopy,9515507,R15GM128166,"['Adoption', 'Affect', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Award', 'Basophilic leukemia', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Cell Surface Receptors', 'Cell membrane', 'Cells', 'Chemistry', 'Colorado', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Equipment', 'Event', 'Fluorescence', 'Fluorescence Microscopy', 'Focus Groups', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'HELLS gene', 'IgE Receptors', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Lateral', 'Lighting', 'Lysosomes', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of pancreas', 'Membrane', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Molecular', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Morphology', 'Nobel Prize', 'Noise', 'Optics', 'Pattern', 'Photobleaching', 'Phototoxicity', 'Physics', 'Principal Investigator', 'Proteins', 'Quantitative Evaluations', 'Rattus', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Work', 'allergic response', 'biological systems', 'cellular imaging', 'computer science', 'computerized data processing', 'computerized tools', 'deep learning', 'density', 'design', 'experimental study', 'fluorescence imaging', 'fluorescence microscope', 'graduate student', 'imaging detector', 'imaging modality', 'immunological synapse formation', 'improved', 'innovation', 'live cell imaging', 'microscopic imaging', 'novel', 'optical imaging', 'overexpression', 'receptor', 'reconstruction', 'single molecule', 'tool', 'undergraduate student']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO,R15,2018,432000,0.011672471419329979
"Pharmaco Response Signatures and Disease Mechanism DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of the HMS LINCS Center is to delineate the fundamental principles of cellular response to perturbagens at the level of single-cells and cell populations and to make response data routinely available via web-based browse, query and programmatic interfaces. This will involve the development and testing of new measurement methods, computational algorithms, and response signatures for diverse human cell types exposed to perturbations individually and in combination. We will emphasize the systematic collection of data not currently available in existing public databases including live and fixed-cell imaging, biochemical data on signaling proteins and multi-factorial drug-response phenotypes. A focus on diverse transformed and primary cells, including those derived from healthy and diseased donors, and on clinical grade small molecules (kinase inhibitors and epigenome drugs) will increase the translational impact of our work. The proposed LINCS Center represents a continuation of a program in operation for ~3.5 years under a LINCS pilot phase U54 award. We will expand the scope and sophistication of our Center, devoting  significant effort to (i) improving the quality of data analysis and visualization, particularly wih respect to the  complexities of perturbagen polypharmacy (ii) accelerating the release of perturbagen-response signatures  using methods that have been demonstrated to yield reliable and informative data, with a particular  emphasis on primary and non-transformed cells (iii) developing and applying new measurement methods,  particularly mass spectrometry for analysis of cell populations and live-cell imaging for analysis of single cells.  The work will involve nine complementary but independent aims. In Data Generation, Aim 1 will perform systematic analysis of perturbagen responses at a single-cell level. Aim 2 will collect multiplex protein and mRNA data on perturbagen response using a set of complementary imaging, mass spectrometry and bead-based assays. Aim 3 will apply LINCS methods to non-transformed immune cells and induced pluripotent stem cells, and explore if signatures can guide a detailed medicinal chemistry campaign. In Data Analysis, Aim 4 will construct perturbagen-response signatures using statistical modeling, network inference and machine learning methods. Aim 5 will develop new approaches to understanding and analyzing drug interactions on multiple phenotypes in single cells. Aim 6 will develop a novel compressed sensing framework for analyzing the poly-pharmacology of kinase inhibitors. Aim 7 will enhance the query, browse and explore functions of the HMS LINCS website and database and its integration with the UCSC Genome Browser. In Community Interaction and Outreach, Aim 8 will implement diverse training and outreach activities, including collaboration with LINCS and non-LINCS research groups. In Administration, Aim 9 will ensure effective management of the Center, sustained access to tools and data produced within the LINCS Project, and compliance with program goals.

"Quantitative SRS Imaging of Cancer Metabolism at Single Cell Level Project summary: Although altered cell metabolism is becoming an established hallmark of cancer, there remains a crucial need of new tools for quantitation of metabolites at single living cell level. In particular, due to lack of specific labels for metabolites, there is an unmet need for high-resolution imaging tools capable of mapping metabolites and small molecules (fatty acids, carbohydrates, amino acids) that play essential roles in pathogenesis of cancer. Supported by a R21 grant through the IMAT program, our team partially addressed this need via developing a multiplex stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) microscope, which enabled vibrational imaging of metabolites in live tumor cells and intact biopsies at the speed of 5 microseconds per spectrum. This R33 application aims to push the hyperspectral stimulated Raman imaging technology to the next level through (i) technical simplification and validation, (ii) developing a robust hyperspectral image segmentation framework, and (iii) integrating the SRS modality with a commercial spontaneous Raman microscope towards broad use by non-experts. We have assembled an inter-disciplinary team for the proposed development. The three specific aims are: (1) Developing an easy-to-operate, highly sensitive line-by-line hyperspectral SRS microscope and validate its capacity for cancer metabolic imaging at single cell level. (2) Establishing a feature analysis framework for segmentation of hyperspectral SRS images using the non-parametric Bayesian model. (3) Integrating and validating the stimulated Raman imaging modality on a spontaneous Raman microscope. By completing the proposed development and validation activities, we will have generated a highly novel spectroscopic imaging system broadly applicable to analysis of chemical contents of cells and tissues for discovery-driven research and marker- based precision diagnosis.

"An Integrative Bioinformatics Approach to Study Single Cancer Cell Heterogeneity DESCRIPTION:  My long term career goal is to become a leading expert in translational bioinformatics who creates, develops and applies computational and statistical methods to reveal landscapes of cancers and to identify strategies to cure cancers. Human cancers are highly heterogeneous. Such heterogeneity is the major source of the ultimate failure of most cancer agents. However, due to the limit of technologies, the intercellular heterogeneity has not been investigated genome wide, at single-cell level until recently. New technologies such as single-cell transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) and exome have revealed new insights and more profound complexity than was previously thought. However, so far these technologies are limited to one assay per cell. It remains a grand challenge to perform multiple, integrative assays from the same single tumor cell, in particular, from those derived from small tumor biopsies. Given the stochasticity at the single cell resolution, reproducibility and sensitivity ar daunting tasks. To overcome this challenge, I have started the single cancer cell sequencing analysis project, in collaboration with Dr. Sherman Weissman at Yale University, who is also my co-mentor of this K01 proposal. My immediate career goal is to identify genome-wide heterogeneity among single cancer cells, using the erythroleukemia K562 cell line. Towards this, I am proposing a research project on an integrative bioinformatics approach to analyze multiple types of genomics data generated from the same single leukemia cells, a timely and critical topic. Specifically, I am interested in studying the following specific aims: (1) buildinga bioinformatics pipeline to study heterogeneity of single-cell RNA-Seq, (2) building a bioinformatics pipeline to study CpG methylome of single cells, (3) building a bioinformatics pipeline to study single-cell Exome-Seq, and (4) integrate the RNA-Seq, methylome and Exome-Seq data generated from the same single cells. These single cells genomic data are provided by Dr. Sherman Weissman's lab from 30 single K562 erythroleukemia cells. I will first construct and validate in parallel, the RNA-Seq, methylome, and Exome-Seq bioinformatics pipelines optimized for single-cell analysis, and then develop and validate an integrative platform to analyze these multiple types of high-throughput data. To accomplish the research project, and to successfully transit from a junior faculty to an expert of the field, I have developed a career plan with my mentoring committee composed of four world-class experts in different fields relevant to Big Data Science: Primary Mentor Dr. Jason Moore in Bioinformatics from Dartmouth College, Co-mentor Dr. Sherman Weissman in Single-cell Genomics and Genetics from Yale University, Co-mentor Dr. Herbert Yu in Cancer Epidemiology from University of Hawaii Cancer Center and Co-mentor Dr. Jason Leigh in Big Data Visualization from the Information and Computer Science Department of University of Hawaii Manoa. I will primarily work with my four co-mentors for planning the development of my career during this award. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this K01 proposal is to integrate multiple types of high-throughput data, in particular, the transcriptome, exome-sequencing and CpG methylome data generated from single cancer cells. The proposed project is designed to address the urgent need for an integrative bioinformatics platform for mega-data generated from next-generation sequencing applications.

"A Modeling Framework for Multi-View Data, with Applications to the Pioneer 100 Study and Protein Interaction Networks New advances in biomedical research have made it possible to collect multiple data “views” — for example, genetic, metabolomic, and clinical data — for a single patient. Such multi-view data promises to offer deeper insights into a patient's health and disease than would be possible if just one data view were available. However, in order to achieve this promise, new statistical methods are needed.  This proposal involves developing statistical methods for the analysis of multi-view data. These methods can be used to answer the following fundamental question: do the data views contain redundant information about the observations, or does each data view contain a different set of information? The answer to this question will provide insight into the data views, as well as insight into the observations. If two data views contain redundant information about the observations, then those two data views are related to each other. Furthermore, if each data view tells the same “story” about the observations, then we can be quite conﬁdent that the story is true.  The investigators will develop a uniﬁed framework for modeling multi-view data, which will then be applied in a number of settings. In Aim 1, this framework will be applied to multi-view multivariate data (e.g. a single set of patients, with both clinical and genetic measurements), in order to determine whether a single clustering can adequately describe the patients across all data views, or whether the patients cluster separately in each data view. In Aim 2, the framework will be applied to multi-view network data (e.g. a single set of proteins, with both binary and co-complex interactions measured), in order to determine whether the nodes belong to a single set of communities across the data views, or a separate set of communities in each data view. In Aim 3, the framework will be applied to multi-view multivariate data in order to determine whether the observations can be embedded in a single latent space across all data views, or whether they belong to a separate latent space in each data view. In Aims 1–3, the methods developed will be applied to the Pioneer 100 study, and to the protein interactome. In Aim 4(a), the availability of multiple data views will be used in order to develop a method for tuning parameter selection in unsupervised learning. In Aim 4(b), protein communities that were identiﬁed in Aim 2 will be validated experimentally. High-quality open source software will be developed in Aim 5.  The methods developed in this proposal will be used to determine whether the ﬁndings from multiple data views are the same or different. The application of these methods to multi-view data sets, including the Pioneer 100 study and the protein interactome, will improve our understanding of human health and disease, as well as fundamental biology. Biomedical researchers often collect multiple “types” of data (e.g. clinical data and genetic data) for a single patient, in order to get a fuller picture of that patient's health or disease status than would be possible using any single data type. This proposal involves developing new statistical methods that can be used in order to analyze data sets that consist of multiple data types. Applying these methods will lead to new insights and better understanding of human health and disease.","A Modeling Framework for Multi-View Data, with Applications to the Pioneer 100 Study and Protein Interaction Networks",9535429,R01GM123993,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Clinical Data', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Genetics', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Records', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Set protein', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trust', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'insight', 'metabolomics', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'unsupervised learning']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2018,315184,0.02216343679514505
"High-throughput high-content single cell analysis by multichannel stimulatedRaman flow cytometry ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Flow cytometry is one of the most important tools for high-throughput single cell analysis. Fluorescent labeling acts as the primary approach for cellular analysis in flow cytometry. Nevertheless, fluorescent tags are not applicable to all cases especially small molecules (e.g. metabolites) for which labeling may significantly perturb their properties. Raman spectroscopic signals arising from inherent molecular vibrations provide a key approach to detect specific molecules inside cells and to differentiate cellular state. Raman-based microfluidic devices have been reported. However, the very small cross section of spontaneous Raman scattering results in low Raman signal level and consequently long data acquisition time, which is not compatible with the high- speed flow condition. The long-term goal of the proposed project is to establish a high-throughput high-content single cell analysis platform using molecular fingerprint vibrations as contrast. The specific objective of current application is to develop a vibrational spectroscopic cytometer based on the stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) process. Several recent advances in the Ji-Xin Cheng (PI) lab, including the highly sensitive femtosecond SRS imaging, lock-in free SRS signal detection and a tuned amplifier array for multiplex SRS imaging, pave the foundation for the planned instrumentation. The PI has assembled an interdisciplinary team for the proposed study. Dr. J. Paul Robinson (co-PI) is a leader in development and applications of fluorescence-based flow cytometer and he will bring expertise to the design of fluidics and multichannel detection systems. Dr. Bartek Rajwa (co-PI) will provide expertise for spectroscopic cytometry data analysis and machine learning. The team will design and construct a SRS flow cytometer by multichannel detection of dispersed SRS signal (Aim 1), construct a tandem system able to collect SRS and fluorescence data (Aim 2), develop spectral un-mixing and machine-learning analysis tools able to combine the information obtained from SRS spectra and labeled biomarkers for functional classification of cells (Aim 3), and validate the capability of SRS flow cytometer for label-free detection of single-cell metabolism (Aim 4). With a speed of analyzing thousands of cells per second, SRS flow cytometer will enable high-throughput analysis of single-cell chemical content which is beyond the reach by fluorescence-based flow cytometer. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to build a high-throughput single cell analysis platform through multiplex stimulated Raman scattering detection of single flowing cells at microsecond time scale. Having fluorescence and stimulated Raman scattering detection in tandem, our platform is capable of discovering new metabolic signatures of cell subpopulations (e.g. cancer stem cells sorted through fluorescent markers). Such discovery could potentially lead to new development of disease-specific treatment strategies.",High-throughput high-content single cell analysis by multichannel stimulatedRaman flow cytometry,9320713,R01GM118471,"['Amplifiers', 'Biological Markers', 'Cells', 'Cellular Metabolic Process', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Cytometry', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Energy Transfer', 'Event', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescence', 'Foundations', 'Geometry', 'Glucose', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of ovary', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Microfluidic Microchips', 'Microfluidics', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Nanostructures', 'Optics', 'Phase', 'Polymers', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Process', 'Property', 'Quartz', 'Reporting', 'Sampling', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'Stream', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tube', 'base', 'biological systems', 'cancer cell', 'cancer stem cell', 'data acquisition', 'design', 'design and construction', 'detector', 'electric impedance', 'high throughput analysis', 'instrumentation', 'light scattering', 'novel strategies', 'particle', 'photomultiplier', 'public health relevance', 'single cell analysis', 'small molecule', 'spectroscopic data', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'vibration']",NIGMS,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),R01,2017,403725,0.11708572402050593
"Transformative Computational Infrastructures for Cell-Based Biomarker Diagnostics Project Summary The presence of abnormal cell populations in patient samples is diagnostic for a variety of human diseases, especially leukemias and lymphomas. One of the main technologies used for cell-based diagnostic evaluation is flow cytometry, which employs fluorescent reagents to measure molecular characteristics of cell populations in complex mixtures. While cytometry evaluation is routinely used for the diagnosis of blood-borne malignancies, it could be more widely applied to the diagnosis of other diseases (e.g. asthma, allergy and autoimmunity) if it could be reproducibly used to interpret higher complexity staining panels and recognize more subtle cell population differences. Flow cytometry analysis is also widely used for single cell phenotyping in translational research studies to explore the mechanisms of normal and abnormal biological processes. More recently, the development of mass cytometry promises to further increase the application of single cell cytometry evaluation to understand a wide range of physiological, pathological and therapeutic processes. The current practice for cytometry data analysis relies on “manual gating” of two-dimensional data plots to identify cell subsets in complex mixtures. However, this process is subjective, labor intensive, and irreproducible making it difficult to deploy in multicenter translational research studies or clinical trials where protocol standardization and harmonization are essential. The goal of this project is to develop, validate and disseminate a user-friendly infrastructure for the computational analysis of cytometry data for both diagnostic and discovery applications that could help overcome the current limitations of manual analysis and provide for more efficient, objective and accurate analysis, through the following aims: Specific Aim 1 – Implement a novel computational infrastructure – FlowGate – for cytometry data analysis that includes visual analytics and machine learning; Specific Aim 2 – Assess the utility of FlowGate for cell population characterization in mechanistic translational research studies (T1); Specific Aim 3 – Assess the robustness and accuracy of FlowGate for clinical diagnostics in comparison with the current standard-of-care analysis of diagnostic cytometry data (T2); Specific Aim 4 – Develop training and educational resources and conduct directed outreach activities to stimulate adoption and use of the resulting FlowGate cyberinfrastructure. The project will have a major impact in advancing translational science by overcoming key hurdles for adoption of these computational methods by facilitating analysis pipeline optimization, providing intuitive user interfacing, and delivering directed training activities. The application of the developed computational infrastructure for improved diagnostics of AML and CLL will contribute to the new emphasis on precision medicine by more precisely quantifying the patient-specific characteristics of neoplastic and normal reactive cell populations. Although FlowGate will be developed by the UC San Diego, UC Irvine, and Stanford CTSAs, the resulting computational infrastructure will be made freely available to the entire research community. Project Narrative Flow cytometry analysis is widely used for single cell phenotyping in the translational research lab to explore the mechanisms of normal and abnormal biological processes and in the clinical diagnostic lab for the identification and classification of blood-borne malignancies. However, the current practice for cytometry data analysis using “manual gating” based on two-dimensional data plots is subjective, labor-intensive and unreliable, especially when using more complex high content staining panels.

"An Integrative Bioinformatics Approach to Study Single Cancer Cell Heterogeneity DESCRIPTION:  My long term career goal is to become a leading expert in translational bioinformatics who creates, develops and applies computational and statistical methods to reveal landscapes of cancers and to identify strategies to cure cancers.

"High-throughput high-content single cell analysis by multichannel stimulatedRaman flow cytometry ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Flow cytometry is one of the most important tools for high-throughput single cell analysis. Fluorescent labeling acts as the primary approach for cellular analysis in flow cytometry. Nevertheless, fluorescent tags are not applicable to all cases especially small molecules (e.g. metabolites) for which labeling may significantly perturb their properties. Raman spectroscopic signals arising from inherent molecular vibrations provide a key approach to detect specific molecules inside cells and to differentiate cellular state. Raman-based microfluidic devices have been reported. However, the very small cross section of spontaneous Raman scattering results in low Raman signal level and consequently long data acquisition time, which is not compatible with the high- speed flow condition. The long-term goal of the proposed project is to establish a high-throughput high-content single cell analysis platform using molecular fingerprint vibrations as contrast. The specific objective of current application is to develop a vibrational spectroscopic cytometer based on the stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) process. Several recent advances in the Ji-Xin Cheng (PI) lab, including the highly sensitive femtosecond SRS imaging, lock-in free SRS signal detection and a tuned amplifier array for multiplex SRS imaging, pave the foundation for the planned instrumentation. The PI has assembled an interdisciplinary team for the proposed study. Dr. J. Paul Robinson (co-PI) is a leader in development and applications of fluorescence-based flow cytometer and he will bring expertise to the design of fluidics and multichannel detection systems. Dr. Bartek Rajwa (co-PI) will provide expertise for spectroscopic cytometry data analysis and machine learning. The team will design and construct a SRS flow cytometer by multichannel detection of dispersed SRS signal (Aim 1), construct a tandem system able to collect SRS and fluorescence data (Aim 2), develop spectral un-mixing and machine-learning analysis tools able to combine the information obtained from SRS spectra and labeled biomarkers for functional classification of cells (Aim 3), and validate the capability of SRS flow cytometer for label-free detection of single-cell metabolism (Aim 4). With a speed of analyzing thousands of cells per second, SRS flow cytometer will enable high-throughput analysis of single-cell chemical content which is beyond the reach by fluorescence-based flow cytometer.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to build a high-throughput single cell analysis platform through multiplex stimulated Raman scattering detection of single flowing cells at microsecond time scale. Having fluorescence and stimulated Raman scattering detection in tandem, our platform is capable of discovering new metabolic signatures of cell subpopulations (e.g. cancer stem cells sorted through fluorescent markers). Such discovery could potentially lead to new development of disease-specific treatment strategies.        ",High-throughput high-content single cell analysis by multichannel stimulatedRaman flow cytometry,9080637,R01GM118471,"['Amplifiers', 'Biological Markers', 'Cell Separation', 'Cells', 'Cellular Metabolic Process', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Cytometry', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Energy Transfer', 'Event', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescence', 'Foundations', 'Geometry', 'Glucose', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of ovary', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Microfluidic Microchips', 'Microfluidics', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Nanostructures', 'Optics', 'Phase', 'Polymers', 'Population', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Process', 'Property', 'Quartz', 'Reporting', 'Sampling', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'Stream', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tube', 'base', 'biological systems', 'cancer cell', 'cancer stem cell', 'data acquisition', 'design', 'design and construction', 'detector', 'electric impedance', 'high throughput analysis', 'instrumentation', 'light scattering', 'novel strategies', 'particle', 'photomultiplier', 'public health relevance', 'single cell analysis', 'small molecule', 'spectroscopic imaging', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'vibration']",NIGMS,PURDUE UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,428677,0.11708572402050593
"Transformative Computational Infrastructures for Cell-Based Biomarker Diagnostics Project Summary The presence of abnormal cell populations in patient samples is diagnostic for a variety of human diseases, especially leukemias and lymphomas. One of the main technologies used for cell-based diagnostic evaluation is flow cytometry, which employs fluorescent reagents to measure molecular characteristics of cell populations in complex mixtures. While cytometry evaluation is routinely used for the diagnosis of blood-borne malignancies, it could be more widely applied to the diagnosis of other diseases (e.g. asthma, allergy and autoimmunity) if it could be reproducibly used to interpret higher complexity staining panels and recognize more subtle cell population differences. Flow cytometry analysis is also widely used for single cell phenotyping in translational research studies to explore the mechanisms of normal and abnormal biological processes. More recently, the development of mass cytometry promises to further increase the application of single cell cytometry evaluation to understand a wide range of physiological, pathological and therapeutic processes. The current practice for cytometry data analysis relies on “manual gating” of two-dimensional data plots to identify cell subsets in complex mixtures. However, this process is subjective, labor intensive, and irreproducible making it difficult to deploy in multicenter translational research studies or clinical trials where protocol standardization and harmonization are essential. The goal of this project is to develop, validate and disseminate a user-friendly infrastructure for the computational analysis of cytometry data for both diagnostic and discovery applications that could help overcome the current limitations of manual analysis and provide for more efficient, objective and accurate analysis, through the following aims: Specific Aim 1 – Implement a novel computational infrastructure – FlowGate – for cytometry data analysis that includes visual analytics and machine learning; Specific Aim 2 – Assess the utility of FlowGate for cell population characterization in mechanistic translational research studies (T1); Specific Aim 3 – Assess the robustness and accuracy of FlowGate for clinical diagnostics in comparison with the current standard-of-care analysis of diagnostic cytometry data (T2); Specific Aim 4 – Develop training and educational resources and conduct directed outreach activities to stimulate adoption and use of the resulting FlowGate cyberinfrastructure. The project will have a major impact in advancing translational science by overcoming key hurdles for adoption of these computational methods by facilitating analysis pipeline optimization, providing intuitive user interfacing, and delivering directed training activities. The application of the developed computational infrastructure for improved diagnostics of AML and CLL will contribute to the new emphasis on precision medicine by more precisely quantifying the patient-specific characteristics of neoplastic and normal reactive cell populations. Although FlowGate will be developed by the UC San Diego, UC Irvine, and Stanford CTSAs, the resulting computational infrastructure will be made freely available to the entire research community. Project Narrative Flow cytometry analysis is widely used for single cell phenotyping in the translational research lab to explore the mechanisms of normal and abnormal biological processes and in the clinical diagnostic lab for the identification and classification of blood-borne malignancies. However, the current practice for cytometry data analysis using “manual gating” based on two-dimensional data plots is subjective, labor-intensive and unreliable, especially when using more complex high content staining panels.

"Pharmaco Response Signatures and Disease Mechanism DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of the HMS LINCS Center is to delineate the fundamental principles of cellular response to perturbagens at the level of single-cells and cell populations and to make response data routinely available via web-based browse, query and programmatic interfaces. This will involve the development and testing of new measurement methods, computational algorithms, and response signatures for diverse human cell types exposed to perturbations individually and in combination. We will emphasize the systematic collection of data not currently available in existing public databases including live and fixed-cell imaging, biochemical data on signaling proteins and multi-factorial drug-response phenotypes. A focus on diverse transformed and primary cells, including those derived from healthy and diseased donors, and on clinical grade small molecules (kinase inhibitors and epigenome drugs) will increase the translational impact of our work. The proposed LINCS Center represents a continuation of a program in operation for ~3.5 years under a LINCS pilot phase U54 award. We will expand the scope and sophistication of our Center, devoting  significant effort to (i) improving the quality of data analysis and visualization, particularly wih respect to the  complexities of perturbagen polypharmacy (ii) accelerating the release of perturbagen-response signatures  using methods that have been demonstrated to yield reliable and informative data, with a particular  emphasis on primary and non-transformed cells (iii) developing and applying new measurement methods,  particularly mass spectrometry for analysis of cell populations and live-cell imaging for analysis of single cells.  The work will involve nine complementary but independent aims. In Data Generation, Aim 1 will perform systematic analysis of perturbagen responses at a single-cell level. Aim 2 will collect multiplex protein and mRNA data on perturbagen response using a set of complementary imaging, mass spectrometry and bead-based assays. Aim 3 will apply LINCS methods to non-transformed immune cells and induced pluripotent stem cells, and explore if signatures can guide a detailed medicinal chemistry campaign. In Data Analysis, Aim 4 will construct perturbagen-response signatures using statistical modeling, network inference and machine learning methods. Aim 5 will develop new approaches to understanding and analyzing drug interactions on multiple phenotypes in single cells. Aim 6 will develop a novel compressed sensing framework for analyzing the poly-pharmacology of kinase inhibitors. Aim 7 will enhance the query, browse and explore functions of the HMS LINCS website and database and its integration with the UCSC Genome Browser. In Community Interaction and Outreach, Aim 8 will implement diverse training and outreach activities, including collaboration with LINCS and non-LINCS research groups.

"Single-cell multi-protein device for informative cellular function evaluation ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): ELISpot including its variant FLUOROSpot remains the mainstay to measure true secretion of single cells and to assess cellular function (e.g., immunity) in the pre-clinical and clinical settings. However, because it measures only one or two proteins per single cell and provides minimal biological information, it has limited utility for measuring cell biology and physiological functions at the systems level. Because a subset of the cells capable of producing multiple cytokines (up to 40), called polyfunctional cells, dominate the overall response but currently no commercial tools are available to quantify polyfunctional cells at the highly multiplexed level, representing a major barrier in both academic research and pharmaceutical industry to accurately quantify cellular immune responses. Thus, it is necessary to develop a technology that can measure an array of proteins from single cells, and will help address a host of important biological and biomedical questions ranging from immune cell function heterogeneity, stem cell differentiation, drug resistance, angiogenesis, to cell-cell communication networks. Also, this technology is of urgent need in biotech and pharmaceutical industry. To address these challenges, this technology needs to meet all three of the following requirements: (i) Single cell sensitivity, (ii) High multiplicity, and (iii) High content. IsoPlexi has a prototype hand-held technology that for the first time provides the ability to measure many (up to 42) secreted effector proteins at the single T-cell level. At the same time, this device in its envisioned form will be far less costly than existing single-cell instruments, representing a significant market advantage for wide-spread use in pre-clinical and clinical uses. When applied to, but not limited in, the immunotherapeutics space, our technology has the capability to (1) detect the broadest mechanism of action at the single immune cell level, and (2) quantify the effector function of activated T-cell response including polyfunctionality at a broad cellular leve to detect both effective response and potential toxicity (autoimmunity). With Phase 1 support, IsoPlexis plans to conduct the initial industrial R&D to turn this academic technology to a commercial product. We propose to: (1) develop a fully packaged single-cell protein secretion assay device to meet minimum commercial usability and validity standards; (2) develop computational pipelines and a software suite for automated data quantification and informatics. We expect to develop a user-friendly hardware and a software suite for reliable single cell multiplex protein secretion profiling and rapid data analysis. This technology can not only provide comprehensive single cell information to address the biological and biomedical questions in academic research, but also offers a solution for biotech and pharmaceutical industry to evaluate drug/treatment responses at the single cell level.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to conduct the initial industrial R&D to turn our current academic single cell multiplex secretion profiling technology to a commercial product.

"Pharmaco Response Signatures and Disease Mechanism DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of the HMS LINCS Center is to delineate the fundamental principles of cellular response to perturbagens at the level of single-cells and cell populations and to make response data routinely available via web-based browse, query and programmatic interfaces. This will involve the development and testing of new measurement methods, computational algorithms, and response signatures for diverse human cell types exposed to perturbations individually and in combination. We will emphasize the systematic collection of data not currently available in existing public databases including live and fixed-cell imaging, biochemical data on signaling proteins and multi-factorial drug-response phenotypes. A focus on diverse transformed and primary cells, including those derived from healthy and diseased donors, and on clinical grade small molecules (kinase inhibitors and epigenome drugs) will increase the translational impact of our work. The proposed LINCS Center represents a continuation of a program in operation for ~3.5 years under a LINCS pilot phase U54 award. We will expand the scope and sophistication of our Center, devoting  significant effort to (i) improving the quality of data analysis and visualization, particularly wih respect to the  complexities of perturbagen polypharmacy (ii) accelerating the release of perturbagen-response signatures  using methods that have been demonstrated to yield reliable and informative data, with a particular  emphasis on primary and non-transformed cells (iii) developing and applying new measurement methods,  particularly mass spectrometry for analysis of cell populations and live-cell imaging for analysis of single cells.  The work will involve nine complementary but independent aims. In Data Generation, Aim 1 will perform systematic analysis of perturbagen responses at a single-cell level. Aim 2 will collect multiplex protein and mRNA data on perturbagen response using a set of complementary imaging, mass spectrometry and bead-based assays. Aim 3 will apply LINCS methods to non-transformed immune cells and induced pluripotent stem cells, and explore if signatures can guide a detailed medicinal chemistry campaign. In Data Analysis, Aim 4 will construct perturbagen-response signatures using statistical modeling, network inference and machine learning methods. Aim 5 will develop new approaches to understanding and analyzing drug interactions on multiple phenotypes in single cells. Aim 6 will develop a novel compressed sensing framework for analyzing the poly-pharmacology of kinase inhibitors. Aim 7 will enhance the query, browse and explore functions of the HMS LINCS website and database and its integration with the UCSC Genome Browser. In Community Interaction and Outreach, Aim 8 will implement diverse training and outreach activities, including collaboration with LINCS and non-LINCS research groups. In Administration, Aim 9 will ensure effective management of the Center, sustained access to tools and data produced within the LINCS Project, and compliance with program goals.

"An Integrative Bioinformatics Approach to Study Single Cancer Cell Heterogeneity DESCRIPTION:  My long term career goal is to become a leading expert in translational bioinformatics who creates, develops and applies computational and statistical methods to reveal landscapes of cancers and to identify strategies to cure cancers. Human cancers are highly heterogeneous. Such heterogeneity is the major source of the ultimate failure of most cancer agents. However, due to the limit of technologies, the intercellular heterogeneity has not been investigated genome wide, at single-cell level until recently. New technologies such as single-cell transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) and exome have revealed new insights and more profound complexity than was previously thought. However, so far these technologies are limited to one assay per cell. It remains a grand challenge to perform multiple, integrative assays from the same single tumor cell, in particular, from those derived from small tumor biopsies. Given the stochasticity at the single cell resolution, reproducibility and sensitivity ar daunting tasks. To overcome this challenge, I have started the single cancer cell sequencing analysis project, in collaboration with Dr. Sherman Weissman at Yale University, who is also my co-mentor of this K01 proposal. My immediate career goal is to identify genome-wide heterogeneity among single cancer cells, using the erythroleukemia K562 cell line. Towards this, I am proposing a research project on an integrative bioinformatics approach to analyze multiple types of genomics data generated from the same single leukemia cells, a timely and critical topic. Specifically, I am interested in studying the following specific aims: (1) buildinga bioinformatics pipeline to study heterogeneity of single-cell RNA-Seq, (2) building a bioinformatics pipeline to study CpG methylome of single cells, (3) building a bioinformatics pipeline to study single-cell Exome-Seq, and (4) integrate the RNA-Seq, methylome and Exome-Seq data generated from the same single cells. These single cells genomic data are provided by Dr. Sherman Weissman's lab from 30 single K562 erythroleukemia cells. I will first construct and validate in parallel, the RNA-Seq, methylome, and Exome-Seq bioinformatics pipelines optimized for single-cell analysis, and then develop and validate an integrative platform to analyze these multiple types of high-throughput data. To accomplish the research project, and to successfully transit from a junior faculty to an expert of the field, I have developed a career plan with my mentoring committee composed of four world-class experts in different fields relevant to Big Data Science: Primary Mentor Dr. Jason Moore in Bioinformatics from Dartmouth College, Co-mentor Dr. Sherman Weissman in Single-cell Genomics and Genetics from Yale University, Co-mentor Dr. Herbert Yu in Cancer Epidemiology from University of Hawaii Cancer Center and Co-mentor Dr. Jason Leigh in Big Data Visualization from the Information and Computer Science Department of University of Hawaii Manoa. I will primarily work with my four co-mentors for planning the development of my career during this award. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this K01 proposal is to integrate multiple types of high-throughput data, in particular, the transcriptome, exome-sequencing and CpG methylome data generated from single cancer cells.

"The Crystallography of Macromolecules    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposal ""The Crystallography of Macromolecules"" addresses the limitations of diffraction data analysis methods in the field of X-ray crystallography. The significance of this work is determined by the importance of the technique, which generates uniquely-detailed information about cellular processes at the atomic level. The structural results obtained with crystallography are used to explain and validate results obtain by other biophysical, biochemical and cell biology techniques, to generate hypotheses for detailed studies of cellular process and to guide drug design studies - all of which are highly relevant to NIH mission. The proposal focuses on method development to address a frequent situation, where the crystal size and order is insufficient to obtain a structure from a single crystal. This is particularly frequent in cases of large eukaryotic complexes and membrane proteins, where the structural information is the most valuable to the NIH mission. The diffraction power of a single crystal is directly related to the microscopic order and size of that specimen. It is also one of the main correlates of structure solution success. The method used to solve the problem of data insufficiency in the case of a single crystal is to use multiple crystals and to average data between them, which allows to retrieve even very low signals. However, different crystals of the same protein, even if they are very similar i.e. have the same crystal lattice symmetry and very similar unit cell dimensions, still are characterized by a somewhat different order. This non-isomorphism is often high enough to make their solution with averaged data impossible. Moreover, the use of multiple data sets complicates decision making as each of the datasets contains different information and it is not clear when and how to combine them. The proposed solution relies on hierarchical analysis. First, the shape of the diffraction spot profiles will be modeled using a novel approach (Aim 1). This will form the ground for the next step, in which deconvolution of overlapping Bragg spot profiles from multiple lattices will be achieved (Aim 2). An additional benefit of algorithms developed in Aim 1 is that they will automatically derive the integration parameters and identify artifacts, making the whole process more robust. This is particularly significant for high-throughput and multiple crystal analysis. In Aim 3, comparison of data from multiple crystals will be performed to identify subsets of data that should be merged to produce optimal results. The critical aspect of this analysis will be the identification and assessment of non- isomorphism between datasets. The experimental decision-making strategy is the subject of Aim 4. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) method will be used to evaluate the suitability of available datasets for possible methods of structure solution. In cases of insufficient data it will identify the most significant factor that needs to be improved. Aim 5 is to simplify navigation of data reduction and to integrate the results of previous aims with other improvements in hardware and computing.        The goal of the proposal is to develop methods for analysis of X-ray diffraction data with a particular focus on the novel analysis of diffraction spot shape and the streamlining of data analysis in multi-crystal modes. The development of such methods is essential to advance structural studies in thousands of projects, which individually are important for NIH mission.

This will form the ground for the next step, in which deconvolution of overlapping Bragg spot profiles from multiple lattices will be achieved (Aim 2). An additional benefit of algorithms developed in Aim 1 is that they will automatically derive the integration parameters and identify artifacts, making the whole process more robust. This is particularly significant for high-throughput and multiple crystal analysis. In Aim 3, comparison of data from multiple crystals will be performed to identify subsets of data that should be merged to produce optimal results. The critical aspect of this analysis will be the identification and assessment of non- isomorphism between datasets. The experimental decision-making strategy is the subject of Aim 4. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) method will be used to evaluate the suitability of available datasets for possible methods of structure solution. In cases of insufficient data it will identify the most significant factor that needs to be improved.

"The Crystallography of Macromolecules    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposal ""The Crystallography of Macromolecules"" addresses the limitations of diffraction data analysis methods in the field of X-ray crystallography. The significance of this work is determined by the importance of the technique, which generates uniquely-detailed information about cellular processes at the atomic level. The structural results obtained with crystallography are used to explain and validate results obtain by other biophysical, biochemical and cell biology techniques, to generate hypotheses for detailed studies of cellular process and to guide drug design studies - all of which are highly relevant to NIH mission. The proposal focuses on method development to address a frequent situation, where the crystal size and order is insufficient to obtain a structure from a single crystal. This is particularly frequent in cases of large eukaryotic complexes and membrane proteins, where the structural information is the most valuable to the NIH mission. The diffraction power of a single crystal is directly related to the microscopic order and size of that specimen. It is also one of the main correlates of structure solution success. The method used to solve the problem of data insufficiency in the case of a single crystal is to use multiple crystals and to average data between them, which allows to retrieve even very low signals. However, different crystals of the same protein, even if they are very similar i.e. have the same crystal lattice symmetry and very similar unit cell dimensions, still are characterized by a somewhat different order. This non-isomorphism is often high enough to make their solution with averaged data impossible. Moreover, the use of multiple data sets complicates decision making as each of the datasets contains different information and it is not clear when and how to combine them.

"Validation of a Vascular Health Profile for Cardiovascular Disease    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This application address broad challenge area ""(03) Biomarker Discovery and Validation"" and specific challenge research topic ""03-HL-101* Identify and validate clinically relevant, quantifiable biomarkers of diagnostic and therapeutic responses for blood, vascular, cardiac, and respiratory tract dysfunction."" Treatment paradigms have evolved from studies of patients who, despite similar presentations, may have experienced disparate environmental exposures or clinical courses and may have varied underlying pathobiologies. A developing and exciting biomarker strategy is the measurement of microparticles (MPs) and assessment of circulating progenitor and mature endothelial cells. All eukaryotic cells shed MPs in response to activation or apoptosis and elevation of plasma MPs, particularly those of endothelial origin, reflects cellular injury and is a surrogate marker for vascular dysfunction. Microparticles have been enumerated in a number of conditions where vascular dysfunction and inflammation are important pathophysiological mechanisms, for example coronary artery disease or thrombotic microangiopathies. We recently completed a pilot study evaluating levels of MPs in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) and compared flow cytometry results with those of a non cell specific Enzyme Linked ImmunoSorbent assay (ELISA). The ELISA assay results correlated with flow cytometry results but did not distinguish the cell of origin where the micoparticle originated. The overall goal of this study is to develop and validate a novel cell-based high throughput, high content, vascular health profile analysis that provides a signature for individuals at high risk for cardiovascular events. A unique biocomputational approach at Penn called cytometric fingerprinting will be used to identify populations of cells. The aims are: 1: To develop and validate a single platform high throughput, multiplexed flow cytometry assay for cell specific MPs, endothelial progenitor cells and hematopoietic progenitors. 2: To develop and validate a cell specific ELISA biomarker assay for MPs in healthy group of subjects and patients with DM and correlate with an independent flow cytometry test for EPCs and HSCs as a dual platform measure of vascular health. 3: To use high order informatics to derive a signature profile from the results of Aims 1 and 2. Such a high throughput high information content approach may prove to be clinically useful in discerning laboratory markers that would be useful for guiding therapy of patients with DM. Penn Medicine contributes substantially to the local economy. In 2008, Penn Medicine created 37,000 jobs and $5.4 billion in regional economic activity, with the area's highly trained workforce producing more than 24,600 applications for just 840 open Penn staff research positions. The current proposal will create or retain 3 jobs. If successfully validated, the biomarker technology proposed could be commercialized, create thousands of jobs in the health care industry and potentially prevent costly hospital admissions.

"Rare Cell Analysis by Multi-Spectral Flow Imaging The ability to detect and analyze rare malignant cells in body fluids has profound implications for the early detection of malignancy as well as for monitoring of residual disease and metastases. Current methodologies for accurately detecting abnormal cells within a population of normal cells are limited. Amnis' ImageStream technology combines the high-resolution imaging performance of microscopy and the high-speed cellular analysis and sorting capabilities of flow cytometry in a single platform. ImageStream employs time delay integration detection, resulting in up to a 1000 fold increase in signal collection over conventional instrument designs. The goal of this Phase I study is to optimize algorithms, electronics, and assays for the detection and analysis of rare exfoliated cells in body fluids. The image segmentation algorithm will be redesigned to operate with brightfield imagery as well as fluorescence and implemented on high-speed image computing hardware. A morphological feature set will be developed to discriminate epithelial cells. Ultimately, it is expected that instrumentation based on ImageStream technology will find application in the biological research laboratory, drug discovery arena, and in the clinical setting as a screening system for he early detection of cancer. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: Amnis' ImageStream technology represents an entirely new class of cellular analysis instrumentation with numerous opportunities for commercialization. It is expected that ImageStream will find application in drug discovery, biological research, genomics and proteomics, non- invasive prenatal diagnostics and early-stage cancer detection. n/a",Rare Cell Analysis by Multi-Spectral Flow Imaging,6446577,R43CA094590,"['artificial intelligence', ' bioimaging /biomedical imaging', ' cell line', ' cell population study', ' cell type', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' cytology', ' fluorescence microscopy', ' fluorescent dye /probe', ' human tissue', ' image processing', ' imaging /visualization /scanning']",NCI,AMNIS CORPORATION,R43,2002,124380,0.024320645166974367
"Combined Topological and Machine Learning Tools for Neuroscience Two major recent advances have raised the possibility of fundamental breakthroughs in both basic and clinical neuroscience: the development of new tools to probe the nervous system with single-cell resolution as well as brain-wide scope, and breakthroughs in machine learning methods for handling complex data. Yet there remain crucial barriers to progress: while data acquisition tools are now broadly within the grasp of neuroscience researchers, the same cannot be said about data analytical tools that can tackle the complexities of the new data sets being gathered. In addition, the highly training-data dependent, black-box Artificial Neural Network (ANN) methods that have shown rapid growth in the technological domain, are not well-suited to scientific data analysis, where transparency and understanding is more important than black-box performance measures. This proposal brings together a cross-disciplinary team of leading neuroscience and computer science researchers to develop and deploy a critical set of data analytical tools for the neuroscience community. The tools will be useful for data already gathered in major group efforts in the US Brain Initiative, and also for new data sets being acquired using the tools developed in the Initiative.  Extraction of the projection morphologies of individual neurons, and the classification and analysis of neuronal cell types is a central goal of the Brain Initiative. Because data from various sources are often analyzed with custom algorithms, scaling up existing approaches for use across large datasets and multiple data types has been a challenge. Instead researchers need a comprehensive, flexible mathematical framework that can be applied to a wide variety of data, including both static and dynamic measures. We propose to achieve this goal by combining Topological Data Analysis (TDA) methods with Deep Net based machine learning methods. Such a combined approach retains the flexibility of data-driven ANN methods while at the same time brings in conceptually well-grounded methods from TDA that are still able to address the complexities of brain-wide data sets with single-cell resolution. Aim 1 of the proposal will use these methods to automate tasks in neuroanatomy previously requiring intensive human expert effort. Aim 2 will apply the methods to single cell omics data sets. Aim 3 will deploy the tools developed to the Brain Initiative Cell Census Network and the neuroscience community. Recent years have seen many advances in experimental tools for probing brains in unprecedented ways, with single cell resolution, and as a result both individual investigators and large consortia are generating brain-wide single-cell data at an unprecedented scale. To derive full benefit from these data sets, researchers need theoretical and computational tools to analyze, visualize and derive knowledge from the data. In the proposed work, theoretically principled tools from Topological Data Analysis, in particular Discrete Morse Theory, are combined with artificial neural networks for Machine Learning, to provide a computational and analytical framework to deal with the complexity of the large-scale, high-dimensional data sets and derive the full benefits for basic as well as clinical neuroscience research.",Combined Topological and Machine Learning Tools for Neuroscience,10123310,RF1MH125317,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Axon', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Categories', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Censuses', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Dendrites', 'Development', 'Educational workshop', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Injections', 'Instruction', 'Knowledge', 'Letters', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Performance', 'Pythons', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Semantics', 'Skeleton', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Time', 'Tracer', 'Training', 'Trees', 'Visual', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'brain cell', 'cell type', 'complex data ', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'data acquisition', 'data centers', 'flexibility', 'grasp', 'high dimensionality', 'informatics tool', 'large datasets', 'machine learning method', 'mathematical methods', 'microscopic imaging', 'multidimensional data', 'multiple data types', 'neuronal cell body', 'rapid growth', 'repository', 'scale up', 'theories', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NIMH,COLD SPRING HARBOR LABORATORY,RF1,2020,2048230,0.030373710615287177
"Phenotypic Screening for Longevity Interventions Using Single-cell Epigenetic Signatures PROJECT SUMMARY Recent advances in understanding the biology of aging have raised the prospect of drug interventions to promote healthy aging in humans. However, such interventions should have essentially no toxicity or side effects. In practice, the throughput of drug testing (currently conducted in animals) is one of the major limitations for identifying interventions to promote healthy aging. Hence, a challenge is to identify candidate drugs able to induce rejuvenation and/or healthy aging, with minimal side effects in a high throughput fashion. Here we propose to take advantage of a novel high content screening approach based on imaging of epigenetic landscape in single cells. To meet the challenge, we propose to take advantage of a novel technique we have developed that is rooted in the analysis of epigenome topography at the single cell level, automated microscopy, and machine learning. “Microscopic Imaging of Epigenetic Landscapes” (MIEL) captures patterns of nuclear staining of epigenetic marks (e.g. acetylated and methylated histones) and employs machine learning to accurately distinguish between such patterns. Pertinent to this application, we have tested whether MIEL approach is suitable for building a phenotypic cell-based assay for inducers of longevity at the cellular level. Our preliminary results validated MIEL assay for a high content screening application to identify novel candidate pro-longevity compounds. In sum, we have developed and validated a high content cell-based screening assay capable of identifying pro-longevity/healthy aging compounds based on their effect on epigenetic signature. Our specific Aims are as follows: Specific Aim 1. Screen for novel inducers of cellular rejuvenation. Specific Aim 2. Validation of novel inducers of cellular rejuvenation.

"A robust platform for multiplexed, subcellular proteomic imaging in human tissue Project Summary Multiplexed Ion Beam Imaging by Time of Flight (MIBI-TOF) uses secondary ion mass spectrometry and metal conjugated primary antibodies to simultaneously visualize dozens of proteins at subcellular resolution in a single tissue section. This technology is back compatible with archival formalin fixed, paraffin embedded tissue (FFPE) and has been used in peer-reviewed work to simultaneously visualize and quantify 36 proteins in retrospective human tissue cohorts. In line with the stated goals of the HuBMAP consortium to develop both “High-sensitivity, high-resolution imaging techniques that can rapidly provide spectral data over large areas of tissue” and “Quantitative imaging analysis tools, including automated 3D image segmentation, feature extraction, and image annotation,” the work outlined here will create a standardized, high throughput, and user-friendly workflow for using MIBI-TOF in basic and translational research to gain insight into how single cell phenotype and tissue structure are functionally-linked in health and disease. To achieve this, we will validate 100 FFPE antibodies and optimize ready-to-use multiplexed staining panels in lyophilized format that will permit storage for at least two years. Protocols and reagents for multiplexed signal amplification of protein and mRNA targets will be further refined, while next generation instrumentation will increase sample throughput to permit full tissue section imaging of up to 40 proteins in 1 hour. Standardized reagents and more robust instrumentation will be accompanied by an automated computational pipeline that utilizes a standard set of segmentation markers and machine learning to accurately identify nuclei and cell borders in any non-neural human tissue. This data will be used to cluster single cell events into functionally distinct populations according to morphology, protein expression, and histological distribution. The reagents and computational pipeline proposed here synergize with existing HuBMAP-funded platforms and could be readily generalized to virtually any high dimensional imaging modality. Thus, this work will not only provide a practical, back compatible imaging platform for high throughput multiplexed imaging, but will also accelerate development of other complimentary imaging technologies as well. Project Narrative Multiplexed ion beam imaging by time of flight (MIBI-TOF) is a new technology for visualizing dozens of proteins in standard clinical tissue biopsies at high resolution. The work outlined here will create a standardized, high throughput, and user-friendly workflow for using MIBI-TOF in basic and translational research to gain insight into how single cell phenotype and tissue structure are functionally-linked in health and disease.","A robust platform for multiplexed, subcellular proteomic imaging in human tissue",10231018,UH3CA246633,"['Allergic', 'Antibodies', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Back', 'Basic Science', 'Biopsy', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Cloud Computing', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decidua', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Equipment', 'Event', 'Extramural Activities', 'Feedback', 'First Pregnancy Trimester', 'Formalin', 'Foundations', 'Freeze Drying', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Granuloma', 'Health', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Histologic', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Human BioMolecular Atlas Program', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Immune', 'Immunosuppression', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Ions', 'Letters', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical center', 'Messenger RNA', 'Metals', 'Morphology', 'Multiplexed Ion Beam Imaging', 'Noninfiltrating Intraductal Carcinoma', 'Optics', 'Organ', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Pathology', 'Peer Review', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Protocols documentation', 'Pulmonary Tuberculosis', 'Readiness', 'Reagent', 'Reproducibility', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Secondary Ion', 'Stains', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Tissue Embedding', 'Tissues', 'Translational Research', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'cancer immunotherapy', 'cohort', 'computational pipelines', 'computational platform', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'feature extraction', 'graphical user interface', 'high dimensionality', 'high resolution imaging', 'human imaging', 'human tissue', 'imaging Segmentation', 'imaging modality', 'imaging platform', 'insight', 'instrumentation', 'ion source', 'machine learning method', 'multiplexed imaging', 'new technology', 'next generation', 'protein expression', 'quantitative imaging', 'reagent standardization', 'technology validation', 'tool', 'tumor microenvironment', 'user-friendly', 'virtual']",NCI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,UH3,2020,700000,0.035615799451558794
"Finding emergent structure in multi-sample biological data with the dual geometry of cells and features    A fundamental question in biomedical data analysis is how to capture biological heterogeneity and characterize the complex spectrum of health states (or disease conditions) in patient cohorts. Indeed, much effort has been invested in developing new technologies that provide groundbreaking collections of genomic information at a single cell resolution, unlocking numerous potential advances in understanding the progression and driving forces of biological states. However, these new biomedical technologies produce large volumes of data, quantified by numerous measurements, and often collected in many batches or samples (e.g., from different patients, locations, or times). Exploration and understanding of such data are challenging tasks, but the potential for new discoveries at a level previously not possible justifies the considerable effort required to overcome these difficulties.  In this project we focus on multi-sample single-cell data, e.g., from a multi-patient cohort, where data points represent cells, data features represent gene expressions or protein abundances, and samples (e.g., considered as separate batches or datasets) represent patients. We consider a duality or interaction between constructing an intrinsic geometry of cells (e.g., with manifold learning techniques) and processing data features as signals over it (e.g., with graph signal processing techniques). We propose the utilization of this duality for several data exploration tasks, including data denoising, identifying noise-invariant phenomena, cluster characterization, and aligning cellular features over multiple datasets. Furthermore, we expect the dual multiresolution organization of data points and features to allow us to compute aggregated signatures that represent patients, and then provide a novel data embedding that reveals multiscale structure from the cellular level to the patient level.  The proposed research combines recent advances in several fields at the forefront of data science, including geometric deep learning, manifold learning, and harmonic analysis. The methods developed in this project will provide novel advances in each of these fields, while also establishing new relations between them. Furthermore, the challenges addressed by these methods are a foundational prerequisite for new advances in genomic research, and more generally in empirical data analysis where data is collected in varying experimental environments. The developed algorithms and methods in this project will be validated in several biomedical settings, including characterizing Zika immunity in Dengue patients, tracking progress of Lyme disease, and predicting the effectiveness of immunotherapy. In this project we will develop new algorithms for biomedical data analysis that will characterize the complex spectrum of health states across various patient populations. These algorithms will leverage the large volumes of data collected by new biomedical technologies, focusing on single-cell data. Specific analysis will be carried out for characterizing Zika immunity in Dengue patients, tracking progress of Lyme disease, and predicting the effectiveness of immunotherapy.",Finding emergent structure in multi-sample biological data with the dual geometry of cells and features   ,10022130,R01GM135929,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Technology', 'Cells', 'Cellular Structures', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Dengue', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Environment', 'Foundations', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genomics', 'Geometry', 'Graph', 'Health', 'Immunity', 'Immunotherapy', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Lyme Disease', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Noise', 'Patients', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'ZIKA', 'algorithmic methodologies', 'biological heterogeneity', 'cohort', 'computerized data processing', 'data exploration', 'deep learning', 'denoising', 'driving force', 'multiple datasets', 'new technology', 'novel', 'patient population', 'signal processing']",NIGMS,MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,353150,0.03664026540889876
"Transformative Computational Infrastructures for Cell-Based Biomarker Diagnostics Project Summary The presence of abnormal cell populations in patient samples is diagnostic for a variety of human diseases, especially leukemias and lymphomas. One of the main technologies used for cell-based diagnostic evaluation is flow cytometry, which employs fluorescent reagents to measure molecular characteristics of cell populations in complex mixtures. While cytometry evaluation is routinely used for the diagnosis of blood-borne malignancies, it could be more widely applied to the diagnosis of other diseases (e.g. asthma, allergy and autoimmunity) if it could be reproducibly used to interpret higher complexity staining panels and recognize more subtle cell population differences. Flow cytometry analysis is also widely used for single cell phenotyping in translational research studies to explore the mechanisms of normal and abnormal biological processes. More recently, the development of mass cytometry promises to further increase the application of single cell cytometry evaluation to understand a wide range of physiological, pathological and therapeutic processes. The current practice for cytometry data analysis relies on “manual gating” of two-dimensional data plots to identify cell subsets in complex mixtures. However, this process is subjective, labor intensive, and irreproducible making it difficult to deploy in multicenter translational research studies or clinical trials where protocol standardization and harmonization are essential. The goal of this project is to develop, validate and disseminate a user-friendly infrastructure for the computational analysis of cytometry data for both diagnostic and discovery applications that could help overcome the current limitations of manual analysis and provide for more efficient, objective and accurate analysis, through the following aims: Specific Aim 1 – Implement a novel computational infrastructure – FlowGate – for cytometry data analysis that includes visual analytics and machine learning; Specific Aim 2 – Assess the utility of FlowGate for cell population characterization in mechanistic translational research studies (T1); Specific Aim 3 – Assess the robustness and accuracy of FlowGate for clinical diagnostics in comparison with the current standard-of-care analysis of diagnostic cytometry data (T2); Specific Aim 4 – Develop training and educational resources and conduct directed outreach activities to stimulate adoption and use of the resulting FlowGate cyberinfrastructure. The project will have a major impact in advancing translational science by overcoming key hurdles for adoption of these computational methods by facilitating analysis pipeline optimization, providing intuitive user interfacing, and delivering directed training activities. The application of the developed computational infrastructure for improved diagnostics of AML and CLL will contribute to the new emphasis on precision medicine by more precisely quantifying the patient-specific characteristics of neoplastic and normal reactive cell populations. Although FlowGate will be developed by the UC San Diego, UC Irvine, and Stanford CTSAs, the resulting computational infrastructure will be made freely available to the entire research community. Project Narrative Flow cytometry analysis is widely used for single cell phenotyping in the translational research lab to explore the mechanisms of normal and abnormal biological processes and in the clinical diagnostic lab for the identification and classification of blood-borne malignancies. However, the current practice for cytometry data analysis using “manual gating” based on two-dimensional data plots is subjective, labor-intensive and unreliable, especially when using more complex high content staining panels.

"A knowledge graph framework for automated gating analysis of cytometry data Project Summary / Abstract Flow and mass cytometry provide multiparametric single-cell data critical for understanding the cellular heterogeneity in various biological systems. Modern polychromatic flow cytometers simultaneously measure about 16 parameters routinely. The next-generation mass cytometry (CyTOF) technology allows for the simultaneous measurement of 50 or more parameters. Even as the cytometry technology is rapidly advancing, approaches for analyzing such complex data remain inadequate. The widely-used manual gating analysis is knowledge-driven and easy-to- interpret, but it is subjective, labor-intensive, and not scalable to handle the increasing complexity of the data. Recent developments of automated data-driven algorithms are able to address the issues of manual gating, but the results from data-driven algorithms are often not intuitive for biology experts to interpret. These limitations create a critical bottleneck for flow and mass cytometry analysis. The overall objective of this application is to develop a novel framework that combines both knowledge-driven and data-driven approaches to achieve automated gating analysis of flow cytometry and CyTOF data. The specific aims are: (1) build knowledge graphs to capture existing knowledge of manual gating analysis, (2) develop algorithms for automated gating analysis, and (3) validate the knowledge graph framework using large-scale studies in ImmPort. The proposed research is significant because it will enable efficient and reproducible gating analysis and provide visualizations that are easy-to-interpret, both of which are critically important to the research community. Such contributions will fundamentally impact single-cell analysis of cellular heterogeneity in diverse fields including immunology, infectious diseases, cancer, AIDS, among others. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because it is expected to develop novel computational methods for automated analysis and interpretation of single-cell analysis by flow and mass cytometry.

"EFFICIENT METHODS FOR CALIBRATION, CLUSTERING, VISUALIZATION AND IMPUTATION OF LARGE scRNA-seq DATA Single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) profiling provides an unprecedented opportunity to conduct detailed cellular analysis of cell subpopulations. Fulfilling the promise of scRNA-seq for biomedical studies and biomarker discovery requires robust computational approaches to support detection of rare phenotypes and unanticipated cellular responses. Current approaches for imputation, calibration, clustering and visualizing of scRNA-seq data suffer from challenges such as erroneous imputing of non-expressed genes, limitation of linear assumptions in removal of multivariate batch effects, and inefficiencies of clustering and dimensional reduction methods of very large datasets. We have developed spectral, neural network, and Fast Multipole Methods (FMM) prototypes suitable for addressing these issues in the context of scRNA-seq and other high throughput data contexts and propose to further develop and adapt these methods to scRNA-seq data analysis. Our team of experts on data analytics and computational biology is currently funded through the NIH BD2K initiative to develop novel big data tools and methods that have broad applicability to biomedical science. This effort proved the feasibility of extremely efficient scalable prototypes of neural network, spectral, and harmonic analysis techniques suitable for calibrating, reducing the dimensionality and visualizing high dimensional data, finding intrinsic state-probability densities, and co-organizing cells, markers and samples. We propose substantial advances over existing analytical procedures used in single cell RNA-seq studies including matrix recovery approaches for the sparse and noisy scRNA-seq data by combining matrix completion and statistical techniques (Aim 1A), and calibration based on our unsupervised MMD-ResNet neural network prototype and optimal transport theory (Aim 1B). We will develop a variant of the FMM approach to speed up the calculation of the repulsion term of the t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) visualization technique, which will improve our current fastest t-SNE FFT-based FIt-SNE prototype, and develop new reliable approximate nearest neighbors approaches to speed up the computation of the attraction term of t-SNE and other clustering algorithms (Aim 2A). Our additional variants of t-SNE will be further developed to allow better separation between clusters of cell subpopulations (late exaggeration) and better visualization using 1D t-SNE for heatmap gene-cell representation (Aim 2A). We will adapt SpectralNet, our efficient neural network approach, for computing graph Laplacian eigenvectors for large datasets. This will enable computation of spectral clustering, diffusion maps and manifold learning that are utilized in many scRNA studies but are currently limited to a moderate number of single cells (Aim 2B). Finally, we will develop a kernel based differential abundance algorithm to characterize differences between biological conditions (Aim 2C). We will adopt appropriate sampling approaches to significantly improve current methods. This research plan aims at developing scalable spectral computational and neural network tools suitable for analyzing very large single cell RNA sequencing datasets. Specifically, our team which is led by a computational biologist, two prominent applied mathematicians and two prominent biologists will develop and validate scalable and novel techniques for: (i) completing missing values prevalent in these measurements, (ii) removing batch effect, (iii) reducing dimensionality and visualizing very large single cell RNA sequencing datasets and enabling detection of rare cell populations as well as detecting minute changes of cell populations between biological conditions.

"Multimodal mass spectrometry imaging of mouse and human liver We propose to develop a multimodal mass spectrometry imaging pipeline with novel desorption sources and data integration that will enable simultaneously mapping of biomolecule abundance in 3-dimensions in biological tissues at high spatial resolution (micron to submicron) and high speed (>10 ms/pixel) in a near-native environment. This would provide previously inaccessible information on cellular and tissue organization, and how homeostasis and disease intersect at the level of tissue physiology. A major challenge for performing multi- omics using mass spectrometry imaging has been the (i) lack of universal ionization methods, (ii) limited sample preparation protocols for preserving chemical gradients, (iii) low sensitivity, and (iv) limited tools for integration of large quantities of data. Our laboratories are developing systematic MS imaging for high sensitivity and high resolution analysis of diverse tissues. We discovered that water-based gas cluster ion beams (H2O-GCIB) operating at high energy yield ionization enhancements of multiple biomolecules (e.g., metabolites, lipids, and peptides/protein fragments) with high sensitivity at 1 µm lateral resolution and without labeling or complicated sample preparation. Coupled with unique Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (SIMS) instrumentation and cryogenic sample handling, we have imaged biomolecules directly in cells and tissues in a near-native state (i.e., frozen-hydration) with feature resolution of 1-10 µm. Low concentration biomolecules (e.g. cardiolipin and metabolites) that were impossible to localize in single cells previously are now visible with 3-dimensional localization. Moreover, the sufficient signal per pixel, we can use automated data analysis to characterize biologically active functional sites within 1 µm2 and areas of interest in single cells. We further developed data integration methods to combine imaging data from adjacent sections to create a multi-model imaging data sets. We propose to develop a pipeline for MS imaging analysis of biomolecules, and to elucidate molecular heterogeneity in tissues using multimodal imaging. To support the multi-modal analysis pipeline, we will develop an integrated data analysis platform. Integration of multiomics remains challenging, particularly spatially localize multiple biomolecules at single cell level. The direct visualization of cellular contents provides information on biomolecular composition, interactions and functions. This network of biomolecules is the driving force of specific behavior of cells in physiological states. Despite this, a comprehensive grasp of these interactions at cellular level has not moved beyond segregated methods. Our efforts will result in an integrated multimodal imaging platform to summon the best characteristics of each image form, acquiring a complete picture the biomolecular network at spatial resolution of 1 µm. With this direct visualization, we will address how metabolism links with functional biomarkers that stem from metabolism-associated protein complexes and phase-separated membrane-less organelles at the subcellular level, and how this drive different cell death modalities, including different modes of cell death. We propose to develop a new mass spectrometry imaging pipeline that will enable mapping of biomolecules in in biological tissues at high spatial resolution. This will provide previously inaccessible information on cellular and tissue organization, and how homeostasis and disease intersect at the level of tissue physiology.",Multimodal mass spectrometry imaging of mouse and human liver,10118811,UG3CA256962,"['3-Dimensional', 'Active Sites', 'Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Apoptosis', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Cardiolipins', 'Cell Death', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Coupled', 'Cytometry', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Electrospray Ionization', 'Environment', 'Eosine Yellowish', 'Freezing', 'Gases', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Health', 'Heart', 'Heterogeneity', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Hydration status', 'Image', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Individual', 'Ions', 'Kidney', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Lateral', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Liver', 'Liver Fibrosis', 'Liver diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Membrane', 'Messenger RNA', 'Metabolic Marker', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Mus', 'Optics', 'Organelles', 'Peptides', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Preparation', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Protein Fragment', 'Protocols documentation', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Source', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Secondary Ion', 'Speed', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Transcript', 'Visualization', 'Water', 'analysis pipeline', 'base', 'cell behavior', 'cell type', 'cryogenics', 'data analysis pipeline', 'data integration', 'data mining', 'data visualization', 'driving force', 'experimental study', 'grasp', 'high resolution imaging', 'human tissue', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging platform', 'improved', 'insight', 'instrumentation', 'interest', 'ionization', 'ionization technique', 'molecular imaging', 'multimodality', 'multiple omics', 'novel', 'preservation', 'protein complex', 'reconstruction', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'stem', 'submicron', 'tool', 'tumorigenesis']",NCI,COLUMBIA UNIV NEW YORK MORNINGSIDE,UG3,2020,300000,-0.0014380965593622569
"A Modeling Framework for Multi-View Data, with Applications to the Pioneer 100 Study and Protein Interaction Networks New advances in biomedical research have made it possible to collect multiple data “views” — for example, genetic, metabolomic, and clinical data — for a single patient. Such multi-view data promises to offer deeper insights into a patient's health and disease than would be possible if just one data view were available. However, in order to achieve this promise, new statistical methods are needed.  This proposal involves developing statistical methods for the analysis of multi-view data. These methods can be used to answer the following fundamental question: do the data views contain redundant information about the observations, or does each data view contain a different set of information? The answer to this question will provide insight into the data views, as well as insight into the observations. If two data views contain redundant information about the observations, then those two data views are related to each other. Furthermore, if each data view tells the same “story” about the observations, then we can be quite conﬁdent that the story is true.  The investigators will develop a uniﬁed framework for modeling multi-view data, which will then be applied in a number of settings. In Aim 1, this framework will be applied to multi-view multivariate data (e.g. a single set of patients, with both clinical and genetic measurements), in order to determine whether a single clustering can adequately describe the patients across all data views, or whether the patients cluster separately in each data view. In Aim 2, the framework will be applied to multi-view network data (e.g. a single set of proteins, with both binary and co-complex interactions measured), in order to determine whether the nodes belong to a single set of communities across the data views, or a separate set of communities in each data view. In Aim 3, the framework will be applied to multi-view multivariate data in order to determine whether the observations can be embedded in a single latent space across all data views, or whether they belong to a separate latent space in each data view. In Aims 1–3, the methods developed will be applied to the Pioneer 100 study, and to the protein interactome. In Aim 4(a), the availability of multiple data views will be used in order to develop a method for tuning parameter selection in unsupervised learning. In Aim 4(b), protein communities that were identiﬁed in Aim 2 will be validated experimentally. High-quality open source software will be developed in Aim 5.  The methods developed in this proposal will be used to determine whether the ﬁndings from multiple data views are the same or different. The application of these methods to multi-view data sets, including the Pioneer 100 study and the protein interactome, will improve our understanding of human health and disease, as well as fundamental biology. Biomedical researchers often collect multiple “types” of data (e.g. clinical data and genetic data) for a single patient, in order to get a fuller picture of that patient's health or disease status than would be possible using any single data type. This proposal involves developing new statistical methods that can be used in order to analyze data sets that consist of multiple data types. Applying these methods will lead to new insights and better understanding of human health and disease.","A Modeling Framework for Multi-View Data, with Applications to the Pioneer 100 Study and Protein Interaction Networks",9962426,R01GM123993,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Clinical Data', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Data Pooling', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Genetics', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Records', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Set protein', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trust', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'insight', 'metabolomics', 'multiple data types', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'unsupervised learning']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2020,323659,0.02216343679514505
"Turning a sequence barcode into a spectral barcode for single-cell analysis. Project Summary: The use of sequence barcodes has enabled high-throughput transcriptomic analysis of single cells. But one challenge remains – there is no method to map the physical assessments of single cells and the downstream transcriptomic data of single cells to the same cells of origin. This is because currently sequence barcodes are only read by sequencing which takes place after all single cells are lysed, reverse transcription is completed, and cDNA are amplified and pooled. In order to perform transcriptomic analysis and physical assessments on the same single cells, we will need a method that allows us to decipher the sequence barcodes while in the process of single-cell physical interrogation. Our goal in this proposed research is to develop a new method to turn sequence barcodes into spectral barcodes that can be read locally in the process. The proposed sequence- barcode-reading technique, if it can be realized, will have substantial impact to the single-cell community as it will become the only method to map the physical assessments and the downstream molecular analysis data to the same cells of origin in a high-throughput, streamlined format. Project Narrative: High-throughput single-cell analysis has advanced our knowledge in developmental biology and disease origins. But currently there is no method to map the physical and transcriptional analysis data of single cells to the same cells of origin.

"3-D Imaging Flow Cytometry PROJECT SUMMARY This project aims to develop and test two innovative platforms and related software for 3-D imaging flow cytometry of fluorescent or absorbing (stained) samples. These systems will allow 3-D structural and functional imaging of many single cells at a subcellular resolution and at a scale that used to be available only in flow cytometry or recently in 2-D imaging. Thereby, the proposed methods have the potential to fundamentally change the ways cultured cells, patient-derived samples, and small experimental organisms are studied. Automated classification based on the 3-D features will enable the diagnosis of hematologic disorders at single-cell precision. Existing 3-D microscopy methods can provide the same information at higher resolution; however, by relying on a scanning mechanism they cannot be applied to suspending cells, especially in a flow configuration, which is essential for high-speed interrogation. Snapshot 3-D microscopy techniques have been developed to address this challenge, but they have insufficient spatial resolution for single-cell imaging and suffer from long data processing time. We overcome these limitations by combining two novel snapshot techniques developed by the PI with the most rigorous optical imaging theories and cutting-edge component technologies. We will use an array of lenslets, which simultaneously records many projection images corresponding with different viewing angles. The use of pupil phase masks, designed using wavefront coding and a theory of 3-D high-numerical-aperture optical imaging, will increase the resolution of each projection image to the theoretical limit given by the objective-lens numerical aperture. The target resolution is 0.5 µm, which is comparable to existing 2-D imaging flow cytometry systems. The target imaging throughputs based on current component technologies are 120 volumes/sec for fluorescence imaging and 700 volumes/sec for absorption imaging, which are higher than 100 volumes/sec of cutting-edge 3-D optical microscopy for stationary specimens. The vast amount of data acquired by these 3-D imaging systems imposes a serious challenge to data processing. The developed systems record true projection images, which obviate iterative deconvolution process, thereby allowing much faster tomographic reconstruction than in existing snapshot techniques. Using general-purpose graphics processing units and optical diffraction tomography, which includes the diffraction of light by subcellular organelles, our tomographic reconstruction algorithm will be faster yet more accurate than existing approaches. Further, we will explore the feasibility of applying a deep convolutional neural network to the images acquired by the developed systems for accurate single-cell classification based on 3-D features. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project aims to develop 3-D imaging flow cytometry platforms for fluorescent or absorbing (stained) cells at high resolution and high throughput in a flow configuration. The developed systems will be built upon two novel snapshot 3-D techniques developed by the PI in combination with most rigorous 3-D optical imaging theories and cutting-edge component technologies.

"Single Cell Transcriptomic and Genetic Diversity by Single Molecule Long Read Sequencing PROJECT SUMMARY Defining the features of cellular mixtures, where diverse cell types with distinct genomic characteristics are physically intermingled together, is a central problem in biology. During the past decade, single cell sequencing technologies have enabled a new era of high throughput and high resolution interrogation of cell type diversity, vastly expanding our understanding of the role that cell types play in development and disease. Yet, current studies in single cell genomics rely on short-read sequencing and thus suffer from limitations, including: (1) Most studies rely on short read counting which limits the study of alternative splicing. (2) Cell states are reflected by static snapshots, and while population dynamics can be deduced through trajectory and RNA velocity estimation, robust estimation of these parameters remains a major challenge. (3) Despite advances in single-cell DNA sequencing, there is yet no cost-effective way to simultaneously characterize both the genetic variants and transcriptome-level changes in a cell, which is crucial for diseases such as cancer. This proposal is motivated by technological breakthroughs in single-molecule sequencing (SMS) and the recent adaptation of SMS to the massively parallel sequencing of single cell transcriptomes in our lab. We propose to develop computational methods to harness the power of SMS in single cell transcriptomics. In particular, we have developed a new genomic approach which allows one to repeatedly interrogate complete transcripts from single cells using SMS long reads, rather than 3' or 5' counting with short reads. This technology allows experimental designs where specific transcript subsets and/or cellular subsets can be repeatedly targeted for deeper joint short and long read analysis over many iterations, which we will exploit to conduct analyses that were previously intractable.

"A ""Culture"" Shift: Integrated Bacterial Screening and Antibacterial Susceptibility Test on Microfluidic Digital Array for Bloodstream Infections PROJECT SUMMARY The ability for clinicians to effectively treat bacterial infections with targeted antibacterials in the acute-care settings hinges on diagnostics capable of identifying the pathogen broadly and determining its susceptibility to antibacterials in a timely manner. Bloodstream infection (BSI) is a particularly representative disease because it is the leading cause of death due to infections with rapid disease progression. Unfortunately, the inconvenient delay of blood culture for definitive diagnosis contributes to widespread empiric use of broad- spectrum antibacterials and emergence of multi-drug-resistant pathogens. Toward addressing this critical unmet need, we propose to develop a new molecular diagnostic platform that integrates bacterial detection, species identification (ID), and antibacterial susceptibility testing (AST) from blood samples in a streamlined test. The expected sample-to-answer turnaround time is 90 min for ID and as early as 2-3 hr for AST. Such integrated diagnostic solution within the proposed timeframe will transform acute-care clinicians’ ability to establish diagnosis of bacterial infections, need for infection control, and antibacterial treatment based on objective data to improve clinical outcome. Using an innovative microfluidic digital array chip for assaying single cells as a backbone technology, we propose to develop a new molecular diagnostic platform which promises rapid ID and AST and allows customizable workflow and assay tailored to the clinical scenario while adjustable based on real-time results. The array chip seamlessly integrates digitization of cells, brief incubation (under various drug conditions), single-cell PCR (scPCR) or reverse transcriptase PCR (scRT-PCR) and single-cell high-resolution melt (scHRM). Thereby, bacterial pathogen can be detected at the level of single-cells, identified based on species- specific melt curves, and their antibacterial susceptibility profile subsequently assessed by measuring changes in rRNA level as a biosynthetic marker of cell viability. ScPCR/scRT-PCR enables sensitive detection and absolute quantification of rRNA of individual cells critical to rapid and reliable differentiation between viable and no-viable cells; while scHRM overcomes a key limitation of bulk HRM to resolve multiple species for diagnosing polymicrobial infections or discarding contaminations. Since both ID and AST do not rely on culture, they reduce total turnaround time from days to minutes/hours. We have assembled a superb team of multi-disciplinary investigators and industry advisors with complementary expertise and strong track record of team science. We propose the following aims:1) to develop a streamlined BSI diagnostic protocol for integrated ID and AST; 2) to develop a microfluidic array chip that enables ID and AST with single-cell resolution; 3) to develop instrument and analysis programs for single- cell ID and AST; and 4) to demonstrate the single-cell diagnostic platform, we will perform analytical and pilot clinical validation studies.

"Computational tools for regulome mapping using single-cell genomic data Project Summary Understanding how genes' activities are controlled is crucial for elucidating the basic operating rules of biology and molecular mechanisms of diseases. Recent innovations in single-cell genomic technologies have opened the door to analyzing a variety of functional genomic features in individual cells. These technologies enable scientists to systematically discover unknown cell subpopulations in complex tissue and disease samples, and allow them to reconstruct a sample's gene regulatory landscape at an unprecedented cellular resolution. Despite these promising developments, many challenges still exist and must be overcome before one can fully decode gene regulation at the single-cell resolution. In particular, current technologies lack the ability to accurately measure the activity of each individual cis-regulatory element (CRE) in a single cell. They also cannot measure all functional genomic data types in the same cell. Moreover, the prevalent technical biases and noises in single-cell genomic data make computational analysis non-trivial. With rapid growth of data, lack of computational tools for data analysis has become a rate-limiting factor for effective applications of single-cell genomic technologies.  The objective of this proposal is to develop computational and statistical methods and software tools for mapping and analyzing gene regulatory landscape using single-cell genomic data. Our Aim 1 addresses the challenge of accurately measuring CRE activities in single cells using single-cell regulome data. Regulome, deﬁned as the activities of all cis-regulatory elements in a genome, contains crucial information for understanding gene regulation. The state-of-the-art technologies for mapping regulome in a single cell produce sparse data that cannot accurately measure activities of individual CREs. We will develop a new computational framework to allow more accurate analysis of individual CREs' activities in single cells using sparse data. Our Aim 2 addresses the challenge of collecting multiple functional genomic data types in the same cell. We will develop a method that uses single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), the most widely used single-cell functional genomic technology, to predict cells' regulatory landscape. Since most scRNA-seq datasets do not have accompanying single-cell data for other -omics data types, our method will also signiﬁcantly expand the utility and increase the value of scRNA- seq experiments. Our Aim 3 addresses the challenge of integrating different data types generated by different single-cell genomic technologies from different cells. We will develop a method to align single-cell RNA-seq and single-cell regulome data to generate an integrated map of transcriptome and regulome.  Upon completion of this proposal, we will deliver our methods through open-source software tools. These tools will be widely useful for analyzing and integrating single-cell regulome and transcriptome data. By addressing several major challenges in single-cell genomics, our new methods and tools will help unleash the full potential of single-cell genomic technologies for studying gene regulation. As such, they can have a major impact on advancing our understanding of both basic biology and human diseases. Project Narrative Understanding how genes' activities are controlled at single-cell resolution is crucial for studying human diseases. This proposal will develop a coordinated set of computational and statistical methods and software tools for mapping and analyzing gene regulatory programs using single-cell genomic data. These methods and tools will allow scientists to more accurately and comprehensively reconstruct gene regulatory landscape of individual cells in complex tissue and disease samples, and they can have a major impact on advancing our understanding of both basic biology and human diseases.",Computational tools for regulome mapping using single-cell genomic data,10001077,R01HG010889,"['Address', 'Atlases', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Cellular Assay', 'Chromatin', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Foundations', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Molecular', 'Multiomic Data', 'Noise', 'Organ', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Software Tools', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stem Cell Development', 'System', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transposase', 'base', 'computer framework', 'computerized tools', 'epigenome', 'experimental study', 'functional genomics', 'genomic data', 'histone modification', 'human disease', 'innovation', 'multiple data types', 'multiple omics', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'rapid growth', 'single cell analysis', 'single cell technology', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'user-friendly']",NHGRI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,409375,0.03408136185498706
"Big Flow Cytometry Data: Data Standards, Integration and Analysis PROJECT SUMMARY Flow cytometry is a single-cell measurement technology that is data-rich and plays a critical role in basic research and clinical diagnostics. The volume and dimensionality of data sets currently produced with modern instrumentation is orders of magnitude greater than in the past. Automated analysis methods in the field have made great progress in the past five years. The tools are available to perform automated cell population identification, but the infrastructure, methods and data standards do not yet exist to integrate and compare non-standardized big flow cytometry data sets available in public repositories. This proposal will develop the data standards, software infrastructure and computational methods to enable researchers to leverage the large amount of public cytometry data in order to integrate, re-analyze, and draw novel biological insights from these data sets. The impact of this project will be to provide researchers with tools that can be used to bridge the gap between inference from isolated single experiments or studies, to insights drawn from large data sets from cross-study analysis and multi-center trials. PROJECT NARRATIVE The aims of this project are to develop standards, software and methods for integrating and analyzing big and diverse flow cytometry data sets.

"Quantitative SRS Imaging of Cancer Metabolism at Single Cell Level Project summary: Although altered cell metabolism is becoming an established hallmark of cancer, there remains a crucial need of new tools for quantitation of metabolites at single living cell level. In particular, due to lack of specific labels for metabolites, there is an unmet need for high-resolution imaging tools capable of mapping metabolites and small molecules (fatty acids, carbohydrates, amino acids) that play essential roles in pathogenesis of cancer. Supported by a R21 grant through the IMAT program, our team partially addressed this need via developing a multiplex stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) microscope, which enabled vibrational imaging of metabolites in live tumor cells and intact biopsies at the speed of 5 microseconds per spectrum. This R33 application aims to push the hyperspectral stimulated Raman imaging technology to the next level through (i) technical simplification and validation, (ii) developing a robust hyperspectral image segmentation framework, and (iii) integrating the SRS modality with a commercial spontaneous Raman microscope towards broad use by non-experts. We have assembled an inter-disciplinary team for the proposed development. The three specific aims are: (1) Developing an easy-to-operate, highly sensitive line-by-line hyperspectral SRS microscope and validate its capacity for cancer metabolic imaging at single cell level. (2) Establishing a feature analysis framework for segmentation of hyperspectral SRS images using the non-parametric Bayesian model. (3) Integrating and validating the stimulated Raman imaging modality on a spontaneous Raman microscope.

"Single-Cell Transcriptomic Analysis to Identify Drivers of Pulmonary Fibrosis PROJECT SUMMARY This proposal for a K08 Award is motivated by two overarching goals: 1) to support the scientific and professional development of the candidate, Dr. Paul Reyfman, towards achieving his career goal of succeeding as a physician scientist and independent investigator with expertise in systems biology approaches applied to the study of chronic lung disease, and 2) to investigate whether single-cell transcriptomic profiling can provide novel insights into the pathobiology of pulmonary fibrosis. Pulmonary fibrosis is a deadly and progressive condition for which diagnostic approaches remain imprecise and effective therapies are lacking. Together with his mentors, Drs. Scott Budinger and Luís Amaral, the candidate has developed a comprehensive training plan that will ensure Dr. Reyfman acquires new knowledge and proficiencies in developing hypotheses, designing and completing experiments, analyzing data, and communicating findings to the scientific community. As an essential component of this training plan, the candidate will employ systems biology approaches to developing tools for analysis of single-cell transcriptomic datasets generated from patients with pulmonary fibrosis. Single-cell transcriptomic profiling is increasingly used to investigate the pathobiology of disease in humans and as a basis for developing novel biomarkers of disease. Developing and validating tools for analyzing the rapidly growing quantity of single-cell transcriptomic data is as much of a challenge as refining techniques for generating data from healthy and diseased tissues. In particular, it is not known whether analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) and single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-Seq) data can be used to quantify accurately the cellular composition of the lung and to identify gene expression differences between health and pulmonary fibrosis. Our preliminary data suggest that scRNA-Seq of lung identifies profibrotic gene expression in patients with pulmonary fibrosis that is heterogeneous between individuals. We also found that scRNA-Seq undersampled certain constituent lung cellular populations. Accordingly, we designed this proposal to test the hypothesis that single-cell transcriptomic analysis of lung samples from patients with pulmonary fibrosis can be used to identify disease endotypes. In Specific Aim 1, the candidate will determine whether snRNA-Seq enables quantification of the cellular composition of the lung during pulmonary fibrosis. In Specific Aim 2, the candidate will develop tools for using scRNA-Seq performed on specimens obtained from patients with SSc-ILD and normal controls to gain novel insights into disease pathobiology. Over the course of this award, the candidate will gain new skills including in generating snRNA-Seq from cryopreserved lung tissue, in lung stereology, in RNA in situ hybridization, in analysis of complementary genomic datasets, and in incorporation of clinical phenotypic information into genomic analyses. Accomplishing the proposed work will provide a rigorous training program for Dr. Reyfman and will provide insights that could lead to improved therapies for patients with pulmonary fibrosis. PROJECT NARRATIVE The studies outlined in this proposal will be essential for future investigations that employ systems biology approaches to investigate the pathobiology of pulmonary fibrosis or to develop novel biomarkers of disease. This proposal will deepen our understanding of the strengths and limitations of single-cell transcriptomic profiling technology for studying human lung samples during health and disease. These findings may form a foundation for the development of biomarkers for diagnosis, prognosis, and prediction of response to therapy in pulmonary fibrosis, and may uncover new targets for therapy.",Single-Cell Transcriptomic Analysis to Identify Drivers of Pulmonary Fibrosis,9892329,K08HL146943,"['Address', 'Aging', 'Alveolar', 'Alveolar Macrophages', 'Automobile Driving', 'Award', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Process', 'Bleomycin', 'Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Chronic lung disease', 'Cicatrix', 'Clinical Data', 'Communities', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Connective Tissue Diseases', 'Cryopreservation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Digestion', 'Disease', 'Donor person', 'Drug Exposure', 'Ensure', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Fibroblasts', 'Fibrosis', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gases', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Image', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Impairment', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Lung', 'Lung Compliance', 'Lung Transplantation', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentors', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Occupational Exposure', 'Patient Selection', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Protocols documentation', 'Pulmonary Fibrosis', 'RNA', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk stratification', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Small Nuclear RNA', 'Specimen', 'Structure of parenchyma of lung', 'System', 'Systemic Scleroderma', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Work', 'base', 'biomarker development', 'career', 'career development', 'cell type', 'clinical care', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical practice', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'differential expression', 'effective therapy', 'experimental study', 'genomic data', 'idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'macrophage', 'monocyte', 'mouse model', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'novel strategies', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized approach', 'predicting response', 'recruit', 'single cell analysis', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'skills', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment response']",NHLBI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,K08,2020,163296,0.009460809916006951
