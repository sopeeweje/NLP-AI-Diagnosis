"Crowd-Assisted Deep Learning (CrADLe) Digital Curation to Translate Big Data into Precision Medicine PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The NIH and other agencies are funding high-throughput genomics (‘omics) experiments that deposit digital samples of data into the public domain at breakneck speeds. This high-quality data measures the ‘omics of diseases, drugs, cell lines, model organisms, etc. across the complete gamut of experimental factors and conditions. The importance of these digital samples of data is further illustrated in linked peer-reviewed publications that demonstrate its scientific value. However, meta-data for digital samples is recorded as free text without biocuration necessary for in-depth downstream scientific inquiry.  Deep learning is revolutionary machine intelligence paradigm that allows for an algorithm to program itself thereby removing the need to explicitly specify rules or logic. Whereas physicians / scientists once needed to first understand a problem to program computers to solve it, deep learning algorithms optimally tune themselves to solve problems. Given enough example data to train on, deep learning machine intelligence outperform humans on a variety of tasks. Today, deep learning is state-of-the-art performance for image classification, and, most importantly for this proposal, for natural language processing.  This proposal is about engineering Crowd Assisted Deep Learning (CrADLe) machine intelligence to rapidly scale the digital curation of public digital samples. We will first use our NIH BD2K-funded Search Tag Analyze Resource for Gene Expression Omnibus (STARGEO.org) to crowd-source human annotation of open digital samples. We will then develop and train deep learning algorithms for STARGEO digital curation based on learning the associated free text meta-data each digital sample. Given the ongoing deluge of biomedical data in the public domain, CrADLe may perhaps be the only way to scale the digital curation towards a precision medicine ideal.  Finally, we will demonstrate the biological utility to leverage CrADLe for digital curation with two large- scale and independent molecular datasets in: 1) The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and 2) The Accelerating Medicines Partnership-Alzheimer’s Disease (AMP-AD). We posit that CrADLe digital curation of open samples will augment these two distinct disease projects with a host big data to fuel the discovery of potential biomarker and gene targets. Therefore, successful funding and completion of this work may greatly reduce the burden of disease on patients by enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of digital curation for biomedical big data. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal is about engineering Crowd Assisted Deep Learning (CrADLe) machine intelligence to rapidly scale the digital curation of public digital samples and directly translating this ‘omics data into useful biological inference. We will first use our NIH BD2K-funded Search Tag Analyze Resource for Gene Expression Omnibus (STARGEO.org) to crowd-source human annotation of open digital samples on which we will develop and train deep learning algorithms for STARGEO digital curation of free-text sample-level metadata.

"QuBBD: Deep Poisson Methods for Biomedical Time-to-Event and Longitude Data  The proposed research directly addresses the mission of NIH's BD2K initiative by developing appropriate tools to derive novel insights from available Big Data and by adapting sophisticated machine learning methodology to a framework familiar to biomedical researchers. This new methodology will be one of the first to enable use of machine learning techniques with time-to-event and continuous longitudinal outcome data, and will be the first such extension of the deep Poisson model. In essence, this undertaking builds the missing bridge between the need for advanced prognostic and predictive techniques among biomedical and clinical researchers and the unrealized potential of deep learning methods in the context of biomedical data collected longitudinally. To facilitate smooth adoption in clinical research, the results will be translated into terms familiar to applied practitioners through publications and well-described software packages. The application of the methodology developed will be illustrated using data from the NIH dbGAP repository, thereby further promoting the use of open access data sources. Optimal risk models are essential to realize the promise of precision medicine. This project develops novel machine learning methods for time-to-event and continuous longitudinal data to enhance risk model performance by exploiting correlations between large numbers of predictors and genetic data. This will enable biomedical researchers to better stratify patients in terms of their likelihood of response to multiple therapies.",QuBBD: Deep Poisson Methods for Biomedical Time-to-Event and Longitude Data ,9771473,R01EB025020,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Advanced Development', 'Architecture', 'Big Data', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Blood Glucose', 'Blood Pressure', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Comorbidity', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Event', 'Factor Analysis', 'Formulation', 'Funding', 'Gaussian model', 'Genetic', 'Hazard Models', 'Health system', 'Individual', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medical History', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Pharmacology', 'Principal Investigator', 'Publications', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'analog', 'cardiovascular disorder epidemiology', 'data access', 'data modeling', 'database of Genotypes and Phenotypes', 'deep learning', 'genetic information', 'hazard', 'insight', 'learning algorithm', 'learning strategy', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'patient stratification', 'practical application', 'precision medicine', 'prognostic', 'repository', 'response', 'risk prediction model', 'semiparametric', 'temporal measurement', 'time use', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NIBIB,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,251983,-0.01712926154805223
"Integrative data science approaches for rare disease discovery in health records ABSTRACT: There are nearly 7,000 diseases that have a prevalence of only one in 2,000 individuals or less. Yet, such rare diseases are estimated to collectively affect over 300 million people worldwide, representing a significant healthcare concern. Although rare diseases have predominantly genetic origins, nearly half of them do not manifest symptoms until adulthood and frequently confound discovery and diagnosis. Even in the case of early onset disorders, the sheer number of possible diagnoses can often overwhelm clinicians. As a result, rare diseases are often diagnosed with delay, misdiagnosed or even remain undiagnosed, not only disrupting patient lives but also hindering progress on our understanding of such diseases. Data science methods that mine large-scale retrospective health record data for phenotypic information will aid in timely and accurate diagnoses of rare diseases, especially when combined with additional data types, thus, having significant real- world impact. This proposal will integrate electronic health record (EHR) data sets with publicly available vocabularies and ontologies, and genomic data for the improved identification and characterization of patients with rare diseases, using approaches from machine learning, natural language processing (NLP) and basic bioinformatics. The work has three specific aims and will be carried out in two phases. During the mentored phase, the principal investigator (PI) will develop data-driven methods to extract standardized concepts related to rare diseases from clinical notes and infer the occurrence of each disease (Aim 1). He will also develop data science approaches to compare and contrast longitudinal patterns associated with patients' journeys through the healthcare system when seeking a diagnosis for a rare disease, and aid in clinical decision-making by leveraging these patterns (Aim 2). During the independent phase (Aim 3), computational methods will be developed for the integrated modeling and analysis of genotypic (from Aim 3) and phenotypic information (from Aims 1 and 2). Cohorts to be sequenced will cover diseases for which causal genes or disease definitions are unclear (discovery), as well as those for which these are well known (validation). This work will be carried out under the mentorship of four faculty members with complementary expertise in biomedical informatics, data science, NLP, and rare disease genomics at the University of Washington, the largest medical system in the Pacific Northwest (four million EHRs), world-renowned researchers in medical genetics, and a robust data science environment. In addition, under the direction of the mentoring team, the PI will complete advanced coursework, receive training in translational bioinformatics and clinical research informatics, submit manuscripts, and seek an independent research position. This proposal will yield preliminary results for subsequent studies on data-driven phenotyping and enable the realization of the PI's career goals by providing him with the necessary training to build on his machine learning and basic bioinformatics expertise to transition into an independent investigator in biomedical data science. PROJECT NARRATIVE Rare genetic diseases are estimated to affect the lives of 25 to 30 million Americans and their families, and present a significant economic burden on the healthcare system. Currently, our knowledge of the broad spectrum of the 7,000 observed rare diseases is limited to a few well-studied ones, hindering our ability to make correct and timely diagnoses. The objective of this study is to improve the identification of patients with rare diseases in healthcare systems by developing data science approaches that automatically recognize rare disease-related patterns in patient health records and correlate them with genomic data, thus, aiding in diagnosis and discovery.",Integrative data science approaches for rare disease discovery in health records,9645433,K99LM012992,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'American', 'Award', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Bioinformatics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Research', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostics Research', 'Disease', 'Economic Burden', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuscripts', 'Markov Chains', 'Medical', 'Medical Genetics', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Natural Language Processing pipeline', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Pacific Northwest', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Principal Investigator', 'Rare Diseases', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Standardization', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Vocabulary', 'Washington', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'career', 'causal variant', 'clinical data warehouse', 'clinical decision-making', 'cohort', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'disease phenotype', 'early onset disorder', 'exome sequencing', 'gene discovery', 'genomic data', 'health care delivery', 'health data', 'health record', 'improved', 'member', 'multimodal data', 'novel', 'open source', 'phenotypic data', 'prototype', 'psychologic', 'rare condition', 'rare genetic disorder', 'recruit', 'skills', 'software development', 'support tools', 'tool', 'trait']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,K99,2019,92070,-0.02970367092338439
"Knowledge-Based Biomedical Data Science Knowledge-based biomedical data science  In the previous funding period, we designed and constructed breakthrough methods for creating a semantically coherent and logically consistent knowledge-base by automatically transforming and integrating many biomedical databases, and by directly extracting information from the literature. Building on decades of work in biomedical ontology development, and exploiting the architectures supporting the Semantic Web, we have demonstrated methods that allow effective querying spanning any combination of data sources in purely biological terms, without the queries having to reflect anything about the structure or distribution of information among any of the sources. These methods are also capable of representing apparently conflicting information in a logically consistent manner, and tracking the provenance of all assertions in the knowledge-base. Perhaps the most important feature of these methods is that they scale to potentially include nearly all knowledge of molecular biology.  We now hypothesize that using these technologies we can build knowledge-bases with broad enough coverage to overcome the “brittleness” problems that stymied previous approaches to symbolic artificial intelligence, and then create novel computational methods which leverage that knowledge to provide critical new tools for the interpretation and analysis of biomedical data. To test this hypothesis, we propose to address the following specific aims:  1. Identify representative and significant analytical needs in knowledge-based data science, and  refine and extend our knowledge-base to address those needs in three distinct domains: clinical  pharmacology, cardiovascular disease and rare genetic disease.  2. Develop novel and implement existing symbolic, statistical, network-based, machine learning  and hybrid approaches to goal-driven inference from very large knowledge-bases. Create a goal-  directed framework for selecting and combining these inference methods to address particular  analytical problems.  3. Overcome barriers to broad external adoption of developed methods by analyzing their  computational complexity, optimizing performance of knowledge-based querying and inference,  developing simplified, biology-focused query languages, lightweight packaging of knowledge  resources and systems, and addressing issues of licensing and data redistribution.

"SimTK: An Ecosystem for Data and Model Sharing in the Biomechanics Community Physics-based simulations provide a powerful framework for understanding biological form and function. They harmonize heterogeneous experimental data with real-world physical constraints, helping researchers understand biological systems as they engineer novel drugs, new diagnostics, medical devices, and surgical interventions. The rise in new sensors and simulation tools is generating an increasing amount of data, but this data is often inaccessible, preventing reuse and limiting scientific progress. In 2005, we launched SimTK, a website to develop and share biosimulation tools, models, and data, to address these issues. SimTK now supports 62,000+ researchers globally and 950+ projects. Members use it to meet their grants’ data sharing responsibilities; experiment with new ways of collaborating; and build communities around their datasets and tools. However, challenges remain: many researchers still do not share their digital assets due to the time needed to prepare, document, and maintain those assets, and since SimTK hosts a growing number of diverse digital assets, the site now also faces the challenge of making these assets discoverable and reusable. Thus, we propose a plan to extend SimTK and implement new solutions to promote scientific data sharing and reuse. First, we will maintain the reliable, user-friendly foundation upon which SimTK is built, continuing to provide the excellent support our members expect and supporting the site’s existing features for sharing and building communities. Second, we will implement methods to establish a culture of model and data sharing in the biomechanics community. We will encourage researchers to adopt new habits, making sharing part of their workflow, by enabling the software and systems they use to automatically upload models and data to SimTK via an application programming interface (API) and by recruiting leading researchers in the community to serve as beta testers and role models. Third, we will create tools to easily replicate and extend biomechanics simulations. Containers and cloud computing services allow researchers to capture and share a snapshot of their computing environment, enabling unprecedented fidelity in sharing. We will integrate these technologies into SimTK and provide custom, easy-to-use interfaces to replicate and extend simulation studies. Lastly, we will develop a metadata standard for models and data for the biomechanics community, increasing reusability and discoverability of the rich set of resources shared on SimTK. We will use the new standard on SimTK and fill in the metadata fields automatically using natural language processing and machine learning, minimizing the burden and inaccuracies of manual metadata entry. We will evaluate our success in achieving these aims by tracking the number of assets shared and the frequency they are used as a springboard to new research. These changes will accelerate biomechanics research and provide new tools to increase the reusability and impact of shared resources. By lowering barriers to data sharing in the biosimulation community, SimTK will continue to serve as a model for how to create national infrastructure for scientific subdisciplines. SimTK is a vibrant hub for the development and sharing of simulation software, data, and models of biological structures and processes. SimTK-based resources are being used to design medical devices and drugs, to generate new diagnostics, to create surgical interventions, and to provide insights into biology. The proposed enhancements to SimTK will accelerate progress in the field by lowering barriers to and standardizing data and model sharing, thus 1) increasing the quantity and also, importantly, the quality of resources that researchers share and 2) enabling others to reproduce and build on the wealth of past biomechanics research studies.",SimTK: An Ecosystem for Data and Model Sharing in the Biomechanics Community,9636581,R01GM124443,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Biomechanics', 'Biophysics', 'Cloud Computing', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Consumption', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Files', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Documentation', 'Ecosystem', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Explosion', 'Face', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Habits', 'Infrastructure', 'Letters', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Device', 'Medical Device Designs', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physics', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Sharing', 'Resources', 'Security', 'Services', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Update', 'Work', 'application programming interface', 'base', 'biological systems', 'biomechanical model', 'community building', 'complex biological systems', 'data access', 'data sharing', 'digital', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'insight', 'member', 'new technology', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel therapeutics', 'prevent', 'recruit', 'research study', 'response', 'role model', 'sensor', 'simulation', 'simulation software', 'software systems', 'success', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'web site']",NIGMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,489919,0.017339988568460953
"Anatomy Directly from Imagery: General-purpose, Scalable, and Open-source Machine Learning Approaches Project Summary The form (or shape) and function relationship of anatomical structures is a central theme in biology where abnor- mal shape changes are closely tied to pathological functions. Morphometrics has been an indispensable quan- titative tool in medical and biological sciences to study anatomical forms for more than 100 years. Recently, the increased availability of high-resolution in-vivo images of anatomy has led to the development of a new generation of morphometric approaches, called statistical shape modeling (SSM), that take advantage of modern computa- tional techniques to model anatomical shapes and their variability within populations with unprecedented detail. SSM stands to revolutionize morphometric analysis, but its widespread adoption is hindered by a number of sig- niﬁcant challenges, including the complexity of the approaches and their increased computational requirements, relative to traditional morphometrics. Arguably, however, the most important roadblock to more widespread adop- tion is the lack of user-friendly and scalable software tools for a variety of anatomical surfaces that can be readily incorporated into biomedical research labs. The goal of this proposal is thus to address these challenges in the context of a ﬂexible and general SSM approach termed particle-based shape modeling (PSM), which automat- ically constructs optimal statistical landmark-based shape models of ensembles of anatomical shapes without relying on any speciﬁc surface parameterization. The proposed research will provide an automated, general- purpose, and scalable computational solution for constructing shape models of general anatomy. In Aim 1, we will build computational and machine learning algorithms to model anatomies with complex surface topologies (e.g., surface openings and shared boundaries) and highly variable anatomical populations. In Aim 2, we will introduce an end-to-end machine learning approach to extract statistical shape representation directly from im- ages, requiring no parameter tuning, image pre-processing, or user assistance. In Aim 3, we will provide intuitive graphical user interfaces and visualization tools to incorporate user-deﬁned modeling preferences and promote the visual interpretation of shape models. We will also make use of recent advances in cloud computing to enable researchers with limited computational resources and/or large cohorts to build and execute custom SSM work- ﬂows using remote scalable computational resources. Algorithmic developments will be thoroughly evaluated and validated using existing, fully funded, large-scale, and constantly growing databases of CT and MRI images lo- cated on-site. Furthermore, we will develop and disseminate standard workﬂows and domain-speciﬁc use cases for complex anatomies to promote reproducibility. Efforts to develop the proposed technology are aligned with the mission of the National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS), and its third strategic goal: to bridge biology and quantitative science for better global health through supporting the development of and access to computational research tools for biomedical research. Our long-term goal is to increase the clinical utility and widespread adoption of SSM, and the proposed research will establish the groundwork for achieving this goal. Project Narrative This project will develop general-purpose, scalable, and open-source statistical shape modeling (SSM) tools, which will present unique capabilities for automated anatomy modeling with less user input. The proposed tech- nology will introduce a number of signiﬁcant improvements to current SSM approaches and tools, including the support for challenging modeling problems, inferring shapes directly from images (and hence bypassing the seg- mentation step), parallel optimizations for speed, and new user interfaces that will be much easier and scalable than the current tools. The proposed technology will constitute an indispensable resource for the biomedical and clinical communities that will enable new avenues for biomedical research and clinical investigations, provide new ways to answer biologically related questions, allow new types of questions to be asked, and open the door for the integration of SSM with clinical care.","Anatomy Directly from Imagery: General-purpose, Scalable, and Open-source Machine Learning Approaches",9803774,R01AR076120,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomic Models', 'Anatomic Surface', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biological Sciences', 'Biological Testing', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Brain', 'Bypass', 'Cardiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cloud Computing', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Complex Analysis', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Felis catus', 'Funding', 'Generations', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Ice', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Injury', 'Intuition', 'Laboratory Research', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mathematical Computing', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Modification', 'Morphogenesis', 'National Institute of General Medical Sciences', 'Occupations', 'Online Systems', 'Organism', 'Orthopedics', 'Pathologic', 'Population', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Software Engineering', 'Software Tools', 'Specialist', 'Speed', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Visualization software', 'Work', 'base', 'biomedical resource', 'clinical care', 'clinical investigation', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'computing resources', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'global health', 'graphical user interface', 'image archival system', 'image processing', 'imaging Segmentation', 'in vivo imaging', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'model development', 'multidisciplinary', 'open source', 'particle', 'preference', 'software development', 'tool', 'usability', 'user-friendly']",NIAMS,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R01,2019,631809,0.0001809378371674875
"IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging Project Summary This proposal requests funds to provide travel support for graduates to attend and participate in the IEEE Inter- national Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI) 2019 conference, Venice, Italy on April 08-11, 2019. The main objective of the IEEE ISBI is to bring together researchers with interests in mathematical and computa- tional aspects of biomedical imaging, with a focus on addressing problems of significance to the development and application of imaging systems across spatial scales, from microscopy to whole-body imaging. ISBI partici- pants – on the order of 600-700 from across the world are involved in biomedical imaging research and development in academic institutions, government laboratories, or R&D departments of private companies. ISBI is co-sponsored by two IEEE societies: Signal Processing Society (SPS) and Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBS), representing academia, industry, and healthcare, and considered the world's foremost societies in biomedical engineering and imaging. SPS and EMBS publish IEEE Transactions on Medical Imag- ing, Transactions on Image Processing, Transactions on Biomedical Engineering, Transactions on Computational Imaging, and IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics, among others. Since incep- tion in 2002, ISBI has become the leading international conference bringing together researchers from diverse algorithmic fields, applications, modalities, and size scales, to facilitate cross-fertilization of ideas across imag- ing modalities and scales. Conference topics include physical, biological and statistical modeling, image formation and reconstruction, computational and statistical image analysis, visualization and image quality as- sessment, and artificial intelligence and machine learning for big image data. ISBI, like other IEEE SPS and EMBS conferences, requires submission and review of a 4-page paper. Peer reviews are handled by a 50-mem- ber editorial board (area editors) of leading experts in the community, who in turn assign papers to well- qualified reviewers. All oral and poster papers are published in IEEExplore as Proceedings of ISBI. If awarded, IEEE anticipates the primary impact of this R13 grant will be increased attendance of U.S.-based students, postdoctoral fellows, and early career faculty. By offering to cover a significant portion of attendee's travel expenses, the cost-benefit ratio for attending ISBI 2019 will be extremely favorable. Furthermore, IEEE will award travel grants based on need and scientific excellence, creating opportunities for those early career researchers who have accepted papers (of which less than 50% are accepted to ISBI) and who have limited means to travel. IEEE will be particularly supportive in providing travel awards to women, under-represented groups, and persons with disabilities. Benefits can largely be summarized as “exposure” and education. ISBI provides opportunity for student exposure to many more areas of computational imaging research than generally available in her/his home institution, and concurrently provides opportunity for students to interact with leaders in the field through tutorials, plenary, oral, and poster presentations, and individual discussions.

"A deep learning platform to evaluate the reliability of scientific claims by citation analysis. The opioid epidemic in the United States has been traced to a 1980 letter reporting in the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine that synthetic opioids are not addictive. A belated citation analysis led the journal to append this letter with a warning this letter has been “heavily and uncritically cited” as evidence that addiction is rare with opioid therapy.” This epidemic is but one example of how unreliable and uncritically cited scientific claims can affect public health, as studies from industry report that a substantial part of biomedical reports cannot be independently verified. Yet, there is no publicly available resource or indicator to determine how reliable a scientific claim is without becoming an expert on the subject or retaining one. The total citation count, the commonly used measure, is inherently a poor proxy for research quality because confirming and refuting citations are counted as equal, while the prestige of the journal is not a guarantee that a claim published there is true. The lack of indicators for the veracity of reported claims costs the public, businesses, and governments, billions of dollars per year. We have developed a prototype that automatically classifies statements citing a scientific claim into three classes: those that provide supporting or contradicting evidence, or merely mention the claim. This unique capability enables scite users to analyze the reliability of scientific claims at an unprecedented scale and speed, helping them to make better-informed decisions. The prototype has attracted potential customers among top biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, research institutions, academia, and academic publishers. We propose to conduct research that will refine scite into an MVP by optimizing prototype efficiency and accuracy until they reach feasible milestones, and will refine the product-market fit in our beachhead market, academic publishing, whose influence on the integrity and reliability of research is difficult to overestimate. We propose to develop a platform that can be used to evaluate the reliability of scientific claims. Our deep learning model, combined with a network of experts, automatically classifies citations as supporting, contradicting, or mentioning, allowing users to easily assess the veracity of scientific articles and consequently researchers. By introducing a system that can identify how a research article has been cited, not just how many times, we can assess research better than traditional analytical approaches, thus helping to improve public health by identifying and promoting reliable research and by increasing the return on public and private investment in research.",A deep learning platform to evaluate the reliability of scientific claims by citation analysis.,9885663,R44DA050155,"['Academia', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Architecture', 'Biotechnology', 'Businesses', 'Classification', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Epidemic', 'Government', 'Human', 'Industry', 'Institution', 'Investments', 'Journals', 'Letters', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Marketing', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'New England', 'Performance', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Privatization', 'Program Description', 'Proxy', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Readiness', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Sales', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Speed', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Traction', 'Training', 'United States', 'Vision', 'Visual system structure', 'addiction', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'dashboard', 'deep learning', 'design', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'literature citation', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid therapy', 'product development', 'programs', 'prototype', 'success', 'synthetic opioid', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NIDA,"SCITE, INC.",R44,2019,206139,-0.055558746185608646
"Common Fund Data Supplement: Integration of KOMP2 (IMPC) and PHAROS into MARRVEL 2.0 for machine learning-assisted rare variant prioritization Project Summary  This application is being submitted in response to NOT-RM-19-009 as a supplement to the parent award U54NS093793.  The Common Fund supports a number of resources that can significantly enhance gene and variant prioritization for study in the Model Organisms Screening Center of the Undiagnosed Diseases Network and beyond. To facilitate the use of these resources, we propose to create a tool that can be easily accessed by clinical geneticists and model organism scientists alike.  MARRVEL (Model organism Aggregated Resources for Rare Variant ExpLoration) was created two years ago because important data that is necessary for rare variant analysis for personalized medicine is spread throughout the internet in tens of different locations. To improve efficiency and streamline access to these data sources, we created a web-tool that allows users to query tens of data sources at once, including GTEx, and links to IMPC, the display portal for KOMP2.  In this proposal, our goal is to develop version 2 of MARRVEL to promote the use of Common Fund resources in the rare disease research community for manual and automated data analysis. This goal will be accomplished by developing MARRVEL 2.0 by integrating KOMP2 (IMPC) and PHAROS data and using the aggregated dataset to develop a machine-assisted gene and variant prioritization for diagnosis and animal model generation.  Our goals align with those of the NIH Common Fund to increase the utility of resources for broader use in the biomedical community. Project Narrative  We aim to promote the use of Common Fund resources and facilitate the diagnosis of rare diseases and the subsequent generation of animal models for the Undiagnosed Diseases Network and beyond.

"Leveraging Twitter to monitor nicotine and tobacco-related cancer communication Patterns in Twitter data have revolutionized understanding of public health events such as influenza outbreaks. While researchers have begun to examine messaging related to substance use on Twitter, this project will strengthen the use of Twitter as an infoveillance tool to more rigorously examine nicotine, tobacco, and cancer- related communication. Twitter is particularly suited to this work because its users are commonly adolescents, young adults, and racial and ethnic minorities, all of whom are at increased risk for nicotine and tobacco product (NTP) use and related health consequences. Additionally, due to the openness of the platform, searches are replicable and transparent, enabling large-scale systematic research. Therefore, our multidisciplinary team of experts in diverse relevant fields—including public health, behavioral science, computational linguistics, computer science, biomedical informatics, and information privacy and security—will build upon our previous research to develop and validate structured algorithms providing automated surveillance of Twitter’s multifaceted and continuously evolving information related to NTPs. First, we will qualitatively assess a stratified random sample of relevant NTP-related tweets for specific coded variables, such as the message’s primary sentiment and other key information of potential value (e.g., whether a message involves buying/selling, policy/law, and cancer-related communication). Tweets will be obtained directly from Twitter using software we developed that leverages a comprehensive list of Twitter-optimized search strings related to NTPs. Second, we will statistically determine what message characteristics (e.g., the presence of certain words, punctuation, and/or structures) are most strongly associated with each of the coded variables for each search string. Using this information, we will create specialized Machine Learning (ML) algorithms based on state-of-the-art methods from Natural Language Processing (NLP) to automatically assess and categorize future Twitter data. Third, we will use this information to provide automatic assessment of current and future streaming data. Time series analyses using seasonal Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Averages (ARIMA) will determine if there are significant changes over time in volume of messaging related to each specific coded variables of interest. Trends will be examined at the daily, weekly, and monthly level, because each of these levels is potentially valuable for intervention. To maximize the translational value of this project, we will partner with public health department stakeholders who are experts in streamlining dissemination of actionable trends data. In summary, this project will substantially advance our understanding of representations of NTPs on social media—as well as our ability to conduct automated surveillance and analysis of this content. This project will result in important and concrete deliverables, including open-source algorithms for future researchers and processes to quickly disseminate actionable data for tailoring community- level interventions. For this project, we gathered a team of public health researchers and computer scientists to leverage the power of Twitter as a novel surveillance tool to better understand communication about nicotine and tobacco products (NTPs) and related messages about cancer and cancer prevention. We will gather a random sample of Twitter messages (“tweets”) related to NTPs and examine them in depth and use this information to create specialized computer algorithms that can automatically categorize future Twitter data. Then, we will examine changes over time related to attitudes towards and interest in NTPs, as well as cancer-related discussion around various NTPs, which will dramatically improve our ability to better understand Twitter as a tool for this type of surveillance.",Leveraging Twitter to monitor nicotine and tobacco-related cancer communication,9656981,R01CA225773,"['Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Algorithms', 'Attitude', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Cancer Control', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Cigarette', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Linguistics', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'County', 'Data', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Electronic cigarette', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Event', 'Food', 'Football game', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Individual', 'Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype', 'Intervention', 'Laws', 'Linguistics', 'Literature', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Marketing', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nicotine', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Policies', 'Privacy', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Public Opinion', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Security', 'Specificity', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco use', 'Tobacco-Related Carcinoma', 'Twitter', 'Work', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'cancer prevention', 'computer program', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'ethnic minority population', 'geographic difference', 'hookah', 'improved', 'influenza outbreak', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'nicotine use', 'novel', 'open source', 'phrases', 'prospective', 'racial minority', 'social', 'social media', 'software development', 'statistics', 'time use', 'tobacco products', 'tool', 'trend', 'vaping', 'young adult']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2019,431185,-0.024215889535092877
"BECKON - Block Estimate Chain: creating Knowledge ON demand & protecting privacy 7. Project Summary/Abstract With the wide adoption of electronic health record systems, cross-institutional genomic medicine predictive modeling is becoming increasingly important, and have the potential to enable generalizable models to accelerate research and facilitate quality improvement initiatives. For example, understanding whether a particular variable has clinical significance depends on a variety of factors, one important one being statistically significant associations between the variant and clinical phenotypes. Multivariate models that predict predisposition to disease or outcomes after receiving certain therapeutic agents can help propel genomic medicine into mainstream clinical care. However, most existing privacy-preserving machine learning methods that have been used to build predictive models given clinical data are based on centralized architecture, which presents security and robustness vulnerabilities such as single-point-of-failure. In this proposal, we will develop novel methods for decentralized privacy-preserving genomic medicine predictive modeling, which can advance comparative effectiveness research, biomedical discovery, and patient-care. Our first aim is to develop a predictive modeling framework on private Blockchain networks. This aim relies on the Blockchain technology and consensus protocols, as well as the online and batch machine learning algorithms, to provide an open-source Blockchain-based privacy-preserving predictive modeling library for further Blockchain-related studies and applications. We will characterize settings in which Blockchain technology offers advances over current technologies. The second aim is to develop a Blockchain-based privacy-preserving genomic medicine modeling architecture for real-world clinical data research networks. These aims are devoted to the mission of the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) to develop biomedical technologies with application domain of genomics and healthcare. The NIH Pathway to Independence Award provides a great opportunity for the applicant to complement his computer science background with biomedical knowledge, and specialized training in machine learning and knowledge-based systems. It will also allow him to investigate new techniques to advance genomic and healthcare privacy protection. The success of the proposed project will help his long-term career goal of obtaining a faculty position at a biomedical informatics program at a major US research university and conduct independently funded research in the field of decentralized privacy-preserving computation. 8. Project Narrative The proposed research will develop practical methods to support privacy-preserving genomic and healthcare predictive modeling, and build innovations based on Blockchain technology for secure and robust machine learning training processes. The development of such privacy technology may increase public trust in research and quality improvement. The technology we propose will also contribute to the sharing of predictive models in ways that meet the needs of genomic research and healthcare.",BECKON - Block Estimate Chain: creating Knowledge ON demand & protecting privacy,9857305,R00HG009680,"['Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Authorization documentation', 'Award', 'Biomedical Technology', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Client', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Collection', 'Decentralization', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Distributed Databases', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ethics', 'Faculty', 'Failure', 'Fibrinogen', 'Funding', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health Care Research', 'Healthcare', 'Hybrids', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'Institutional Policy', 'Intuition', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Mainstreaming', 'Maintenance', 'Medicine', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Privacy', 'Privatization', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Secure', 'Security', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transact', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'blockchain', 'career', 'clinical care', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinically significant', 'comparative effectiveness', 'computer science', 'data sharing', 'design', 'digital', 'effectiveness research', 'health care delivery', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interoperability', 'knowledge base', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'medical specialties', 'network architecture', 'novel', 'open source', 'peer', 'peer networks', 'point of care', 'predictive modeling', 'preservation', 'privacy protection', 'programs', 'public trust', 'structural genomics', 'success', 'trend', 'web portal', 'web services']",NHGRI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R00,2019,249000,0.0027605437364396977
"THE XNAT IMAGING INFORMATICS PLATFORM PROJECT SUMMARY This proposal aims to continue the development of XNAT. XNAT is an imaging informatics platform designed to facilitate common management and productivity tasks for imaging and associated data. We will develop the next generation of XNAT technology to support the ongoing evolution of imaging research. Development will focus on modernizing and expanding the current system. In Aim 1, we will implement new web application infrastructure that includes a new archive file management system, a new event bus to manage cross-service orchestration and a new Javascript library to simplify user interface development. We will also implement new core services, including a Docker Container service, a dynamic scripting engine, and a global XNAT federation. In Aim 2, we will implement two innovative new capabilities that build on the services developed in Aim 1. The XNAT Publisher framework will streamline the process of data sharing by automating the creation and curation of data releases following best practices for data publication and stewardship. The XNAT Machine Learning framework will streamline the development and use of machine learning applications by integrating XNAT with the TensorFlow machine learning environment and implementing provenance and other monitoring features to help avoid the pitfalls that often plague machine learning efforts.

"Big Omics Data Engine 2 Supercomputer Computational and data science has transformed biomedical scientific discovery: its approaches are embedded into a wide range of workflows for diseases such as schizophrenia, depression, Alzheimer's, epilepsy, influenza, autism, drug addiction, pediatric cardiac care, Inflammatory Bowel Disease, prostate cancer and multiple myleloma. Sixty-one basic and translational researchers at Mount Sinai representing over $100 million in NIH funding, along with their collaborators from 75 external institutions, have utilized the Big Omics Data Engine (BODE) supercomputer to elucidate significant scientific findings in over 167 publications, including high impact journals such as Nature and Science, with 2,427 citations in three years. These researchers have also shared the data generated on BODE throughout their consortia and into national data sharing repositories. BODE is nearing the end of its vendor maintainable life, and researchers need increased computational throughput and storage space. To empower researchers to not only continue their inquiries, but to also tackle more complex scientific questions with decreased time to solution, we propose the Big Omics Data Engine 2 Supercomputer (BODE2). BODE2 will contain a total of 3,200 Intel Cascade Lake cores with 15 terabytes of memory and 14 petabytes of raw storage, and will leverage an existing 250 terabytes of SSDs. An instrument of this size is not available elsewhere affordably. With the proposed instrument, researchers will be able to take advantage of three major benefits: (1) the ability to receive results faster for overall greater scientific throughput; (2) the ability to increase the fidelity of their simulations and analyses; and (3) the ability to migrate research applications seamlessly to the software environment for greater scientific productivity. As with data produced on BODE, BODE2 data products will also be shared with the broader scientific community. BODE2 will provide the critical infrastructure needed by the wide range of researchers and clinicians for the genetics and population analysis, gene expression, machine learning and structural and chemical biology approaches used to make advances in these diseases. A specialized Big Omics Data Engine 2 Supercomputer instrument will provide necessary computational and data science infrastructure for 61 research projects with 75 collaborating institutions in diverse areas such as Alzheimer's, autism, schizophrenia, drug addiction, influenza, pediatric cardiac care, depression, epilepsy, prostate cancer and multiple myeloma.

"Biomedical Data Translator Technical Feasibility Assessment and Architecture Design Our Vision: We propose DeepLink, a versatile data translator that integrate multi-scale, heterogeneous, and multi-source biomedical and clinical data. The primary goal of DeepLink is to enable meaningful bidirectional translation between clinical and molecular science by closing the interoperability gap between models and knowledge at different scales. The translator will enhance clinical science with molecular insights from basic and translational research (e.g. genetic variants, protein interactions, pathway functions, and cellular organization), and enable the molecular sciences by connecting biological discoveries with their pathophysiological consequences (e.g. diseases, signs and symptoms, pharmacological effects, physiological systems). Fundamental differences in the language and semantics used to describe the models and knowledge between the clinical and molecular domains results in an interoperability gap. DeepLink will systematically and comprehensively close this gap. We will begin with the latest technology in semantic knowledge graphs to support an extensible architecture for dynamic data federation and knowledge harmonization. We will design a system for multi-scale model integration that is ontology-based and will combine model execution with prior, curated biomedical knowledge. Our design strategy will be iterative and participatory and anchored by 10 major milestones. In a series of demonstrations of DeepLink’s functions, we will address one of the major challenges facing translational science: reproducibility of biomedical research findings that are based on evolving molecular datasets. Reproducibility of analyses and replication of results are central to scientific advancement. Many landmark studies have used data that are constantly being updated, curated, and pared down over time. Our series of demonstrations projects are designed to prototype the technology required for a scalable and robust translator as well as the techniques we will use to close the interoperability gap for a specific use case. The demonstration project will, itself, will be a significant and novel contribution to science. DeepLink will be able to answer questions that are currently enigmatic. Examples include: - From clinicians: What is the comparative effectiveness of all the treatments for disease Y given a patient's genetic/metabolic/proteomic profile? What are the functional variants in cell type X that are associated with differential treatment outcomes? What metabolite perturbations in cell type Y are associated with different subtypes of disease X? - From basic science researchers: What is known about disease Y across all model organisms (even those not designed to model Y)? What are all the clinical phenotypes that result from a change in function in protein X? Which biological pathways are affected by a pathogenic variant of disease Y? What patient data are available to evaluate a molecularlyderived clinical hypothesis? Challenges and Our Approaches: DeepLink will close the interoperability gap that currently prohibits molecular discoveries from leading to clinical innovations. DeepLink will be technologically driven, addressing the challenges associated with large, heterogeneous, semantically ambiguous, continuously changing, partially overlapping, and contextually dependent data by using (1) scalable, distributed, and versioned graph stores; (2) semantic technologies such as ontologies and Linked Data; (3) network analysis quality control methods; (4) machine-learning focused data fusion methods; (5) context-aware text mining, entity recognition and relation extraction; (6) multi-scale knowledge discovery using patient and molecular data; and (7) presentation of actionable knowledge to clinicians and basic scientists via user-friendly interfaces. n/a",Biomedical Data Translator Technical Feasibility Assessment and Architecture Design,9855180,OT3TR002027,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Architecture', 'Awareness', 'Basic Science', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Research', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Language', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Ontology', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmacology', 'Physiological', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Quality Control', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Personnel', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Semantics', 'Series', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Source', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'Treatment outcome', 'Update', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'base', 'cell type', 'clinical phenotype', 'comparative effectiveness', 'design', 'disorder subtype', 'genetic variant', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interoperability', 'molecular domain', 'multi-scale modeling', 'novel', 'prototype', 'text searching', 'user-friendly']",NCATS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,OT3,2019,702655,0.0028766733244727366
"Arkansas Bioinformatics Consortium Project Summary/Abstract The Arkansas Research Alliance proposes to hold five annual workshops on the subject of bioinformatics. The purpose is to bring six major Arkansas institutions into closer collaboration. Those institutions are: University of Arkansas-Fayetteville; Arkansas State University; University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences; University of Arkansas at Little Rock; University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff; and the National Center for Toxicological Research. The workshops will focus on capabilities at each of the six in sciences related to bioinformatics including artificial intelligence, big data, machine learning, food and agriculture, high speed computing, and visualization capabilities. As this work progresses, educational coordination and student encouragement will be important components. Principals from all six institutions are collaborating to accomplish the workshop goals. Project Narrative The FDA ability to protect the public health is directly related to its ability to access and utilize the latest scientific data. Increased proficiency in collecting, presenting, validating, understanding, and drawing quantitative inference from the massive volume of new scientific results is necessary for success in that effort. The complexity involved requires continued development of new tools available and being developed within the realm of information technology, and the workshops proposed here will address this need. Specific Aims  • Thoroughly understand the resources in Arkansas available for furthering the capabilities in  bioinformatics and its associated needs, e.g., access to high speed computing capability and use  of computational tools. • Develop a set of plans to harness and grow those capabilities, especially those that are relevant  to the needs of NCTR and FDA. • Stimulate interest and capability across Arkansas in bioinformatics to produce a larger cadre of  expertise as these plans are implemented. • Enlist NCTR’s help in directing the effort toward seeking local, national and international data  that can be more effectively analyzed to produce results needed by FDA and others, e.g.,  reviewing decades of genomic/treatment data on myeloma patients at the University of  Arkansas for Medical Sciences. • Develop ways in which the Arkansas capabilities can be combined into a coordinated, synergistic  force larger than the sum of its parts. • Encourage students and faculty in the development of new models and techniques to be used in  bioinformatics and related fields. • Improve inter-institutional communication, including developing standardized bioinformatics  curricula and more universal course acceptance.",Arkansas Bioinformatics Consortium,9911854,R13FD006690,[' '],FDA,ARKANSAS RESEARCH ALLIANCE,R13,2019,15000,-0.02670718442148048
"Conference on Modern Challenges in Imaging in the Footsteps of Allan Cormack Project Summary: Tufts University physics professor Allan Cormack pioneered the field of tomography. His seminal work, from 1963 and 1964, provided both the mathematical foundations of computerized tomography (CT), and tangible proof-of-concept by engineering a rudimentary CT scanner. Taken together, this effort represented the first practical method to ""see into"" an object without physically breaking it open. Along with the engineer Godfrey Hounsfield, he won the 1979 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for these contributions. Since then, tomography has broadened to include a wide range of modalities and problems. This field is unique for the rich interplay among applications in medicine, security, earth sciences, industry, physics, and the mathematics required to solve these problems. This international conference at Tufts, “Modern Challenges in Imaging: In the Footsteps of Allan Cormack” will honor the achievements of Cormack and reflect this diversity in the field by gathering top international researchers in mathematics, engineering, science, and medicine to communicate the most current research and challenges in the field. This will include work on mathematical models of emerging modalities, tomographic machine learning, dynamic methods, and spectral imaging with applications include medicine and security. The best research from the conference will be disseminated in a special issue of the journal Inverse Problems. Talks will be posted on the conference website. The organizers will recruit a diverse set of experienced participants and trainees, and the conference will be advertised in a range of publications reflecting the scientific and demographic diversity of the field. This conference is unique in that it combines high-level mathematical participants with experts in medical and industrial CT. It is structured to encourage participants from different fields to talk with each other, broaden their horizons, and make connections between problems and methodologies in the various fields. Several of the plenary talks will provide introductions to the areas. Trainees will be integrated into the conference through an informal welcome lunch and a poster session to introduce them to researchers in the field. This supports goals 1, 4, and 5, of the NIBIB: Researchers will present innovative biomedical technologies, engineering solutions, and mathematical methods to better image the body and objects more generally. The synergy between research areas will support the translation of technologies from the academic sphere to medical utility. The training opportunities for graduate students and beginners support the training of the next generation of diverse scientists. Project Narrative This conference will bring together medical, scientific, engineering, and applied mathematical researchers to present their newest research for a range of tomographic problems. Graduate students and beginners will be encouraged to participate and learn by being offered introductory talks, a student poster session, a welcome event, and an informal atmosphere. The conference will be structured so researchers will learn about important challenges in practical tomography as well as new techniques and methods, thereby creating synergies and research connections among the areas.",Conference on Modern Challenges in Imaging in the Footsteps of Allan Cormack,9837131,R13EB028700,"['Achievement', 'Advertising', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biomedical Technology', 'Communication', 'Development', 'Earth science', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Fertilization', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Industrialization', 'Industry', 'International', 'Journals', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Lightning', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modernization', 'National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering', 'Nobel Prize', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Physics', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Problem Solving', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Security', 'Seminal', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training Support', 'Translations', 'Underrepresented Groups', 'Universities', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'cohort', 'demographics', 'design', 'experience', 'graduate student', 'higher level mathematics', 'informal atmosphere', 'innovation', 'mathematical methods', 'mathematical model', 'meetings', 'member', 'next generation', 'posters', 'professor', 'recruit', 'spectrograph', 'symposium', 'synergism', 'tomography', 'training opportunity', 'web site']",NIBIB,TUFTS UNIVERSITY MEDFORD,R13,2019,10000,-0.0383459023684923
"Unifying Templates, Ontologies and Tools to Achieve Effective Annotation of Bioassay Protocols Project Summary Biological assays are the foundation for developing chemical probes and drugs, but new Big Data approaches – which have revolutionized other areas of biomedical science – have not yet advanced this early step of biomedical research: analysis of assay data. The obstacle is that scientists specify their assays through text descriptions written in scientific English, which need to be translated into standardized annotations readable by computers. This lack of standardized and machine-readable assay descriptions is a major impediment to manage, find, aggregate, compare, re-use, and learn from the ever-growing corpus of assays (e.g., >1.2 million in PubChem). Thus, there is a critical need for better annotation and curation tools for drug discovery assays. However, the process to go from a simple text protocol to highly detailed machine-readable semantic annotations is not trivial. Multiple tools and technologies are required: ontologies or the structured controlled vocabularies; templates that map specific vocabularies to properties that are to be captured; and software tools to actually apply these ontologies to a given text. Currently, each of these exists in isolation; yet, a bottleneck in any one tool or technology, or a gap between the different pieces, disrupts the overall process, resulting in poor or no annotation of the datasets. Here we propose a project to combine and integrate these three technologies (which are also the core competencies of the three groups collaborating on this proposal). We will deliver a novel, comprehensive, user-friendly data annotation and curation system that is highly interconnected, encompassing the full cycle, and real-world practice, of required tasks and decisions, by all parties within the `bioassay annotation ecosystem' (researchers performing curation, dedicated curators, IT specialists, ontology owners, and librarians/repositories). The alliance between academic and commercial collaborators, who already work together, will greatly benefit the project and minimize execution risk. Our specific aims are to: (1) Develop a bioassay-specific template editor and templates by adopting the Stanford (Center for Expanded Data Annotation and Retrieval, CEDAR) data model to the machine learning-based curation tool BioAssay Express, to exploit the broad functionality of its data structures, tools and interfaces; (2) Define and create an ontology update process and tool (`OntoloBridge') to support rapid feedback between curators/users and ontology experts and enable semi-automated incorporation of suggestions for updates to existing published ontologies; (3) Develop new tools to export annotated data into public repositories such as PubChem; and (4) Evaluate our solution across diverse audiences (pharma, academia, repositories). The system will improve bioassay curation efficiency, quality, and effectiveness, enabling scientists to generate standardized annotations for their experiments to make these data FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable). We envision this suite of tools will encourage annotation earlier in the data lifecycle while still supporting annotation at later stages (e.g., submission to repositories or to journals). Project Narrative Biological assays are the foundation for developing drugs, but new Big Data approaches – which have revolu- tionized other areas of biomedical science – have not yet advanced this early step of biomedical research: analysis of assay data. The obstacle is that assays are written in scientific English, which need to be translated into standardized descriptions readable by computers. This lack of machine-readable annotations is a major impediment to manage, find, compare, re-use, and learn from the millions of assays. This project will develop a formal process and integrated tools to support the complete cycle of tasks and decisions required for bioassay annotation, enabling expedited (and more cost-effective) drug discovery.","Unifying Templates, Ontologies and Tools to Achieve Effective Annotation of Bioassay Protocols",9747967,U01LM012630,"['Academia', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Area', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'Biological Assay', 'Biomedical Research', 'Chemicals', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Competence', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Controlled Vocabulary', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Ecosystem', 'Effectiveness', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Exercise', 'FAIR principles', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Hour', 'Journals', 'Learning', 'Librarians', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Metadata', 'Ontology', 'Output', 'Participant', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Polishes', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'PubChem', 'Publishing', 'Readability', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrieval', 'Risk', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Semantics', 'Site', 'Software Engineering', 'Software Tools', 'Specialist', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Suggestion', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Tweens', 'Update', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'base', 'cost effective', 'data modeling', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'drug mechanism', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'improved functioning', 'in vivo', 'informatics training', 'novel', 'ontology development', 'open source', 'practical application', 'predictive modeling', 'repository', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,U01,2019,514129,-0.011741894514910712
"Sci-Score, a tool suite to support Rigor and Transparency NIH and Journal Guidelines Project​ ​Summary While standards in reporting of scientific methods are absolutely critical to producing reproducible science, meeting such standards is tedious and difficult. Checklists and instructions are tough to follow often resulting in low and inconsistent compliance. Scientific journals and societies as well as the National Institutes of Health are now actively proposing general guidelines to address reproducibility issues, particularly in the reporting of methods,​ ​but​ ​the​ ​trickier​ ​part​ ​is​ ​to​ ​train​ ​the​ ​biomedical​ ​community​ ​to​ ​use​ ​these​ ​standards​ ​to​ ​effectively. To support new standards in methods reporting, especially the RRID standard for Rigor and Transparency of Key Biological Resources, we propose to build Sci-Score a text mining based tool suite to help authors meet the standard. Sci-Score will provide an automated check on compliance with the RRID standard already implemented by over 100 journals including Cell, Journal of Neuroscience, and eLife and other Rigor and transparency standards put forward by the NIH. The innovation behind Sci-score is the provision of a score, which can be obtained by individual investigators or journals. This score reflects an aspect of quality of methods reporting. We posit that the score will serve as a tool that investigators can use to compete with themselves​ ​and​ ​each​ ​other,​ ​the​ ​way​ ​they​ ​currently​ ​compete​ ​on​ ​metrics​ ​of​ ​popularity,​ ​i.e.,​ ​the​ ​H-index. In Phase I of this project and before, our group has successfully developed a text mining algorithm that can detect antibodies, cell lines, organisms and digital resources (all 4 RRID types) and has created a preliminary score. We propose to extend this approach to all research inputs, like chemicals and plasmids that are requested as part of Cell press’ STAR Methods (http://www.cell.com/star-methods)​. We also propose to build a set of algorithms to detect whether authors discuss the major sources of irreproducibility outlined by NIH, including investigator blinding, proper randomization and sufficient reporting of sex and other biological variables. Resource identification along with other quality metrics will be used to score the quality of scientific methods section text. If successful, the tool could be used by editors, reviewers, and investigators to improve the​ ​quality​ ​of​ ​the​ ​scientific​ ​paper. Our Phase II specific aims include 1) enhancing and hardening the core natural language processing pipelines to recognize a broader range of sentences in near real time; 2) building a set of modular tools that will be provided for different groups of users to take advantage of the text mining capability we develop in aim 1. At the end of Phase II, we should have a commercially viable product that will be able to be licensed to serve the needs​ ​of​ ​the​ ​publishers​ ​and​ ​the​ ​broader​ ​research​ ​community. Standards​ ​for​ ​scientific​ ​methods​ ​reporting​ ​are​ ​absolutely​ ​critical​ ​to​ ​producing​ ​reproducible​ ​science,​ ​but​ ​meeting such​ ​standards​ ​is​ ​difficult.​ ​Checklists​ ​and​ ​instructions​ ​are​ ​tough​ ​to​ ​follow​ ​often​ ​resulting​ ​in​ ​low​ ​and​ ​inconsistent compliance.​ ​To​ ​support​ ​new​ ​standards​ ​in​ ​methods​ ​reporting,​ ​especially​ ​the​ ​RRID​ ​standard​ ​for​ ​Rigor​ ​and Transparency,​ ​we​ ​propose​ ​to​ ​build​ ​​Sci-Score​​ ​a​ ​text​ ​mining​ ​based​ ​tool​ ​suite​ ​to​ ​help​ ​authors​ ​meet​ ​the​ ​standard.

"Preparing the Next Generation of Biostatisticians in the Era of Data and Translational Sciences PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT In the era of newly emerging computational tools for data science, biostatisticians need to play a fundamental role in health sciences research. There is an urgent need to encourage US Citizens and Permanent Residents to pursue graduate training in biostatistics. The design, conduct, and analysis of clinical trials and observational studies; the setting of regulatory policy; and the conception of laboratory experiments have been shaped by the fundamental contributions of biostatisticians for decades. Advances in genomics, medical imaging technologies, and computational biology; the increasing emphasis on precision and evidence-based medicine; and the widespread adoption of electronic health records; demand the skills of biostatisticians trained to collaborate effectively in a multidisciplinary environment and to develop statistical and machine learning methods to address the challenges presented by this data-rich revolutionary era of health sciences research. The proposed summer program which includes world-renowned clinical scientists and biostatisticians from two local universities, will provide an immense opportunity for student participants to learn basic yet modern statistical methods that are critical to uncovering new insights from such big and complex biomedical data and also illustrate the potential pitfalls of confounding and bias that may arise when analyzing biomedical data. A unique feature of the proposed training program is thus to expose the participants to not only basic statistical methods but also to the topics of computer science and bioinformatics which will be invaluable in creating the multidisciplinary teams required to tackle the complex research questions that often requires multipronged approaches. The proposed six-week training program will be structured around the NIH's Translation Science Spectrum and will introduce participants to opportunities in biostatistics through the lens of the science advanced by the contributions of biostatisticians. Following an initial set of weeks on basic training of biostatistical methods, the program will culminate in a data hack-a-thon style competition in which participants will employ the statistical and scientific knowledge gained during the program to produce the most innovative, statistically-sound, scientifically-relevant and effectively-communicated response to a set of research questions. The proposed research education program will enroll up to 20 such participants from across the nation and, through lectures, field trips, and opportunities to analyze data from real health sciences, inspire them to pursue graduate training. The program will draw upon considerable past collaborations and complementary resources of two local world-renowned universities to provide participants with an unparalleled view of the field, including award-winning instructors, internationally known methodological and clinical researchers, and a local area rich in opportunities to showcase careers in biostatistics. Special efforts will be made to enroll participants from underrepresented groups. Participants will be followed after completion, and the numbers attending graduate school in statistics and pursuing biostatistics careers will be documented. PROJECT NARRATIVE Biostatisticians are indispensible contributors to health sciences research. The demand for professionals with advanced training in biostatistics is high and will continue to increase, especially with the expanding challenges posed by big biomedical data. This six week summer research education program, a joint effort of North Carolina State University and Duke University, will enroll up to 20 US citizen/permanent resident participants from across the nation in the summers of 2020-2022 and expose them to the opportunities presented by careers in biostatistics and encourage them to seek graduate training in the field.",Preparing the Next Generation of Biostatisticians in the Era of Data and Translational Sciences,9734597,R25HL147228,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biomedical Research', 'Biometry', 'Biostatistical Methods', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Conceptions', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Exposure to', 'Faculty', 'Future', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health Sciences', 'Health system', 'Imaging technology', 'Institution', 'International', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical center', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Names', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'North Carolina', 'Observational Study', 'Participant', 'Play', 'Policies', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Principal Investigator', 'Program Effectiveness', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Statistical Methods', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Talents', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'Underrepresented Groups', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'analytical method', 'big biomedical data', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'data resource', 'design', 'education research', 'experience', 'field trip', 'graduate student', 'health science research', 'innovation', 'insight', 'instructor', 'interest', 'investigator training', 'laboratory experiment', 'learning strategy', 'lectures', 'lens', 'multidisciplinary', 'next generation', 'programs', 'public health research', 'recruit', 'response', 'skills', 'sound', 'statistics', 'summer institute', 'summer program', 'summer research', 'tool', 'undergraduate student']",NHLBI,NORTH CAROLINA STATE UNIVERSITY RALEIGH,R25,2019,249789,-0.03193645072889063
"Boston University CCCR OVERALL ABSTRACT The Boston University CCCR will serve as a central resource for clinical research focused mostly on the most common musculoskeletal disorders, osteoarthritis and gout and will also provide research resources for investigator based research in scleroderma, spondyloarthritis, musculoskeletal pain and osteoporosis. Center grant funding has supported 30-35 papers annually in peer reviewed journals, most in the leading arthritis journals and some in leading general medical journals. This center has trained many of the leading clinical researchers in rheumatology throughout the US and internationally, and many of these former trainees have active collaborations with the center. We will include a broad research community and a core group of faculty in this CCCR. The research community's ready access to core faculty and to the sophisticated research methods and assistance they provide will enhance the clinical and translational research of the community and will increase collaborative opportunities for the core faculty and the community. The CCCR updates BU's historical focus on epidemiologic methods to include new approaches to causal inference and adds new methods in machine learning and mobile health. The Research and Evaluation Support Core Unit (RESCU) is the focal point of this CCCR. A key feature is the weekly research (RESCU meetings in which ongoing and proposed research projects are critically evaluated. This feature ensures frequent interactions between clinician researchers, epidemiologists and biostatisticians who are the core members of the CCCR. The RESCU core unit has provided critical support for other Center grants related to rheumatic and arthritic disorders at Boston University, three current R01/U01's; five current NIH K awards (one K24, 3 K23's, one K01), an R03, an NIH trial planning grant (U34), and multiple ACR RRF awards. The overall goal of this center is to carry out and disseminate high-level clinical research informed both by state of the art clinical research methods and by clinical and biological scientific discoveries. Ultimately, we aim either to prevent the diseases we are studying or to improve the lives of those living with the diseases. NARRATIVE The Boston University Core Center for Clinical Research will provide broad clinical research methods expertise to a large multidisciplinary group of investigators whose research focuses on osteoarthritis and gout with a secondary emphasis on scleroderma, spondyloarthritis, osteoporosis and musculoskeletal pain. The group, which includes persons with backgrounds in rheumatology, physical therapy, epidemiology, biostatistics and  . behavioral science, meets weekly to critically review research projects and serves a broad research community with which it actively engages.

"An Informatics Framework for Discovery and Ascertainment of Drug-Supplement Interactions Most U.S. adults (68%) take dietary supplements (DS) and there is increasing evidence of drug-supplement interactions (DSIs); our ability to readily identify interactions between DS with prescription medications is currently very limited. To optimize the safe use of DS, there remains a critical and unmet need for informatics methods to detect DSIs. Our rationale is that an innovative informatics framework to discover potential DSIs from the large scale of biomedical literature will enable a new line of research for targeted DSI validation and will also significantly narrow the range of DSIs that must be further explored. Our long-term goal is to use informatics approaches to enhance DSI clinical research and translate its findings to clinical practice ultimately via clinical decision support systems. The objective of this application is to develop an informatics framework to enable the discovery of DSIs by creating a DS terminology and mining scientific evidence from the biomedical literature. Towards these objectives, we propose the following specific aims: (1) Compile a comprehensive DS terminology using online resources; and (2) Discover potential DSIs from the biomedical literature. The successful accomplishment of this project will deliver a novel informatics paradigm and resources for identifying most clinically significant DSI signals and their biological mechanisms. This information is critical to subsequent efforts aimed at improving patient safety and efficacy of therapeutic interventions. The results from this study are imperative in order to achieve the ultimate goal of reducing an individual’s risk of potential DSIs. n/a",An Informatics Framework for Discovery and Ascertainment of Drug-Supplement Interactions,9882672,R01AT009457,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Adverse event', 'Biological', 'Cancer Patient', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Research', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Drug Targeting', 'Education', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Failure', 'Food', 'Ginkgo biloba', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Herbal supplement', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Link', 'Literature', 'MEDLINE', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Minnesota', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Natural Products', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient risk', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Postoperative Hemorrhage', 'Probability', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Semantics', 'Signal Transduction', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Targeted Research', 'Terminology', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Translating', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Warfarin', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical practice', 'clinically significant', 'colon cancer patients', 'data modeling', 'design', 'dietary supplements', 'drug testing', 'evidence base', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'nutrition', 'online resource', 'open source', 'patient population', 'patient safety', 'post-market', 'screening', 'tool']",NCCIH,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2019,149810,-0.010032990361033426
"Biomedical Data Translator Technical Feasibility Assessment and Architecture Design New technologies afford the acquisition of dense “data clouds” of individual humans. However, heterogeneity, dimensionality and multi-scale nature of such data (genomes, transcriptomes, clinical variables, etc.) pose a new challenge: How can one query such dense data clouds of mixed data as an integrated set (as opposed to variable by variable) against multiple knowledge bases, and translate the joint molecular information into the clinical realm? Current lexical mapping and brute-force data mining seek to make heterogeneous data interoperable and accessible but their output is fragmented and requires expertise to assemble into coherent actionable information. We propose DeepTranslate, an innovative approach that incorporates the known actual physical organization of biological entities that are the substrate of pathogenesis into (i) networks (data graphs) and (ii) hierarchies of concepts that span the multiscale space from molecule to clinic. Organizing data sources along such natural structures will allow translation of burgeoning high-dimensional data sets into concepts familiar to clinicians, while capturing mechanistic relationships. DeepTranslate will take a hybrid approach to learn and organize its content from both (i) existing generic comprehensive knowledge sources (GO, KEGG, IDC, etc.) and (ii) newly measured instances of individual data clouds from two demonstration projects: (1) ISB’s Pioneer 100 and (2) St. Jude Lifetime cancer survivors. We will focus on diabetes as test case. These two studies cover a deep biological scale-space and thus can test the full extent of the multiscale capacity of DeepTranslate in a focused application. 1. TYPES OF RESEARCH QUESTION ENABLED. How can a clinician find out that the dozens of “out of range” variables observed in a patient’s data cloud, form a connected set with respect to pathophysiology pathways, from gene to clinical variable? How can the high-dimensional data of studies that measure for each individual 100+ data points of various types (“personal data clouds”) be analyzed as one set in an integrated fashion (as opposed to variable by variable) against existing knowledge bases and also be used to improve the databases? DeepTranslate addresses these two types of questions and thereby will accelerate translation of future personal data clouds into (A) care decisions and (B) hypotheses on new disease mechanisms / treatments, thereby benefiting providers as well as researchers. 2. USE OF EXPERTISE AND RESOURCES. • ISB: pioneer in personalized, big-data driven medicine (Demo Project 1); biomedical content expertise; multiscale omics and molecular pathogenesis, big data analysis, housing of databases for public access; query engine designs, GUI. • UCSD: leader in biomedical data integration; automated assembly of molecular and clinical data into hierarchical structures; translation between data types • U Montreal: biomedical database curation from literature and construction of gene/protein/drug interaction networks; machine learning, open resource database • St Jude CRH: Cancer monitoring Demo Project 2, cancer patient data analytics. 3. POTENTIAL DATA AND INFRASTRUCTURE CHALLENGES. (a) Existing comprehensive clinical data sources are not uniform and not explicitly based on biological networks; cross-mapping is being performed at NLM based on lexical relationships: HPO (phenotypes) vs. SNOMED CT (for EMR) vs. IDC or Merck Manual (for diseases). Careful selection of these sources in close collaboration with NLM is needed. (b) Existing molecular pathway databases are static, based on averages of heterogeneous non-stratified populations, while the newly measured high-dimensional data clouds are varied due to intra-individual temporal fluctuation and inter-individual variation. How this will affect building of ontotypes in our hybrid approach, and how large cohorts of data clouds must be to offer statistical power is yet to be determined. Our two Demonstration Projects with their uniquely deep (high-dimensional and multiscale) data in cohorts of limited but growing size are thus crucial first steps in a long journey of collective learning in the TRANSLATOR community. n/a",Biomedical Data Translator Technical Feasibility Assessment and Architecture Design,9853317,OT3TR002026,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Architecture', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'CRH gene', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Survivor', 'Caring', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Drug Interactions', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Graph', 'Heterogeneity', 'Housing', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Output', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Provider', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'SNOMED Clinical Terms', 'Saint Jude Children&apos', 's Research Hospital', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'base', 'cohort', 'data integration', 'data mining', 'design', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'inter-individual variation', 'interoperability', 'knowledge base', 'lexical', 'molecular assembly/self assembly', 'multidimensional data', 'new technology', 'transcriptome']",NCATS,INSTITUTE FOR SYSTEMS BIOLOGY,OT3,2019,855741,-0.013377508799106987
"Acquisition of a next-generation computing cluster We request funds to purchase our next-generation computing cluster to support computationally intensive NIH-funded research at Washington University in St. Louis. This system will become the foundation of the Center for High Performance Computing (CHPC) to support our active, diverse user community. It has been designed to meet our current and future computing needs. It adds additional capabilities to support emerging fields such as “Deep Learning”. The CHPC currently supports over 775 users from 300 different groups across 33 departments. 58 papers have cited the CHPC. The Center has a proven funding model and is economically sustainable. The Center has partnered with other University organizations to offer training workshops, not only on the use of the cluster, but also on introductory programming for users with no prior programming experience. If this proposal is funded, we will be able to continue to support this ever-growing diverse community of researchers. The proposed system would replace critical components including the management node, the login nodes, the storage, and upgrade the Infiniband networking. We would add substantial upgrades to our computing power with state-of-the-art processors, increased memory capacity for growing jobs, General Purpose Graphical Processing units (GPGPUs), and new capabilities for “Deep Learning”.

"New Jersey Alliance for Clinical Translational Science: NJ ACTS Coordinated by Rutgers Biomedical and Health Sciences (RBHS), the New Jersey Alliance for Clinical and Translational Science (NJ ACTS) comprises a consortium with Rutgers and Princeton Universities (PU), NJ Institute for Technology (NJIT), medical, nursing, dental and public health schools, hospitals, community health centers, outpatient practices, industry, policymakers and health information exchanges. All Alliance universities and affiliates have provided substantial resources and contributed to the planning, development and leadership of the consortium. With access to ~7 million people, NJ ACTS serves as a ‘natural laboratory’ for translational and clinical research. With a state population of ~9 million, New Jersey ranks 11th in the US, 1st in population density and higher than average in racial and ethnic diversity. Surprisingly, NJ has no CTSA Hub to coordinate translational and clinical research. Our CTSA Hub focuses on two overarching themes: the heterogeneity of disease pathogenesis and response to treatment, and the value of linking large clinical databases with interventional clinical investigations to identify cause-and-effect and predict therapeutic responses. NJ ACTS will provide: innovative approaches to link information from large databases and electronic health records to inform clinical trial design, execution and analysis; and novel platforms for biomarker discovery using fluorescence in situ hybridization and machine learning to identify unique neural signatures of chronic illness. NJ ACTS will access a large health system with significant member diversity; a rich legacy of community engagement and community-based research platforms; and proven approaches to enhance workforce development in clinical research. With a substantial investment in streamlining research administration and IRB practices at Rutgers and with the inception of NJ ACTS, there exists an unparalleled opportunity for logarithmic growth in clinical research in New Jersey. To build our capacity for participant and clinical interactions as a CTSA Hub, the newly established Trial Accelerator and Recruitment Office will coordinate feasibility assessment, implementation, recruitment, and evaluation of clinical studies. Additionally, our organization of five clinical research units into a cohesive network provides extraordinary expertise in strategic locations to enhance participant recruitment from diverse communities with a particular focus on: children; the elderly; those with serious mental illness or substance abuse issues; low-income individuals served by Medicaid; those with HIV/AIDS; and people of all ages who are minorities, underserved, and victims of health and environmental disparities. With a history of collaboration, partners and affiliates share unique skills, expertise, training and mentoring capabilities that will be greatly amplified within the infrastructure of a CTSA Hub. Princeton and NJIT, without medical schools or hospital affiliates, seeks collaboration with Rutgers to provide clinical research platforms; Rutgers seeks the PU and NJIT expertise in novel informatics platforms, expertise in natural language and ontology, machine learning and cognitive neurosciences. Together NJ ACTS will provide an alliance that will catalyze clinical research and training across New Jersey to improve population health and contribute to the CTSA Consortium.

"The Antibody Registry: A Community Authority for Antibody Research Resource Identifiers Project Summary  One of the most glaring yet easily addressable gaps in our current scientific workflow and publication system is improving the way that methods are reported, in particular, the lack of key methodological details necessary for interpreting and reproducing a study. Most authors continue to cite the name of the reagent, like an antibody using the vendor, and the city where the vendor is located, but omit the catalog and lot number making antibodies very difficult to track down, thereby reducing reproducibility of the paper. The Resource Identification, RRID, Initiative has successfully implemented a solution to this lack of identification, by asking authors to include a persistent unique identifier (RRID) for each antibody along with a standard syntax that includes the lot information. This syntax is now required in about 100 journals and accepted in at least 400, was accepted into the EQUATOR network of standards and is under consideration by the JATS committee, the NISO standard for journal article metadata. For antibodies, RRIDs are assigned by the AntibodyRegistry.org, which accepts full catalogs from antibody companies and individual antibody records from authors, who are unable to locate the record for the antibody that they used in a study or one which they created in their lab. This process should be made as easy as possible for authors, and through text analysis we have devised a set of tools that should help authors create better records with less work.  The AntibodyRegistry.org was created as part of an academic project and it has successfully incorporated millions of antibody records, thousands of which have now been cited in scientific papers using the RRID syntax. The use of RRID is growing, and in order to support the longer term sustainability of the AntibodyRegistry.org, a core community authority for RRIDs, this resource needs to be enhanced to align with the available commercial and non-commercial funding sources. We propose the addition of features, valuable to antibody companies and journals, to improve market intelligence and reporting around antibodies. We also propose to auto-generate antibody entries for authors and curators when submitting/curating an antibody to decrease the time it takes to complete the task, thereby reducing the barrier to entry and cost. Project Narrative The AntibodyRegistry.org is a catalog of antibodies used in research and serves as the antibody identifier source for the Research Resource Identifier (RRID) initiative. The use of these identifiers improves rigor and transparency in compliance with both journal and NIH standards. As the RRID initiative grows, the AntibodyRegistry.org is becoming an increasingly well-used and valuable resource; requiring increased attention from curation staff. Improvements to the AntibodyRegistry.org are needed to increase commercial value and thereby its sustainability, decrease curation cost, and provide a higher level of service to the scientific community.",The Antibody Registry: A Community Authority for Antibody Research Resource Identifiers,9680073,R41GM131551,"['Adopted', 'Antibodies', 'Asia', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Businesses', 'California', 'Catalogs', 'Cities', 'Cloud Computing', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Databases', 'Electronic Mail', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Europe', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Funding Agency', 'Generations', 'Glare', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Intelligence', 'International', 'Journals', 'Machine Learning', 'Marketing', 'Metadata', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Names', 'Neurosciences', 'Paper', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Publications', 'Reagent', 'Records', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Science', 'Services', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Source', 'System', 'Text', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Vendor', 'Work', 'authority', 'base', 'cost', 'improved', 'information framework', 'journal article', 'syntax', 'text searching', 'tool']",NIGMS,"SCICRUNCH, INC.",R41,2019,149373,0.006739158825571224
"Administrative Supplement to the OAIC Pepper Center Coordinating Center We wish to advantage of 2 new key opportunities that could significantly enhance achievement of the overall goals of the OIAC Coordinating Center (OAIC CC) and 2 key, unexpected administrative needs. Project 1) Develop, test and implement an innovative set of tools to perform Integrative Data Analysis (IDA) for combining and analyzing independent data sets across the OAIC network An over-arching goal of the OAIC CC is to build collaborations between OAICs that unlock synergy. Each of the OAICs has many small/medium-sized completed studies relevant to the OAIC theme, and that have measured key domains of physical function. Combining these studies could provide large, powerful databases for answering critical questions not possible with individual studies. However, this is currently not possible because different measurement instruments are often used across centers and across studies. This project overcomes this critical limitation by taking advantage of 2 newly available technologies and an ongoing study. IDA is a set of strategies in which two or more independent data sets which contain measures addressing similar domains but using different measurement instruments are combined into one and then statistically analyzed. The proposed project is timely because it leverages an ongoing clinical study to validate new procedures for harmonizing measures of physical and cognitive function across 20 Pepper center studies. The resources created by the project will significantly enhance collaboration across the OAIC program network, benefiting researchers at all OAICs, and can be disseminated to other NIA center programs. Project 2) Develop a robust, interactive database of OAIC Program accomplishments that will automatically be updated via an efficient, streamlined, electronic annual reporting process.  It is widely believed that the NIA-funded Pepper Center program has been highly productive. However, there is no means of assessing the overall effectiveness of the Pepper Center, or of ‘cataloging’ its impressive accomplishments. This project will take advantage of new open-source technology to efficiently develop a robust, comprehensive, searchable, interactive database of past accomplishments. It will also develop a streamlined electronic Annual Directory Report template, and link it to the new OAIC database so that it is automatically updated each year. Achieving the goals of this project will reduce administrative burden for sites, facilitate NIA review of performance of centers, and create an annually updated database of OAIC accomplishments, projects, publications, and outcomes, and facilitate collaborations between centers and investigators across NIA programs. This application also requests support for 2 key, unexpected administrative needs that have arisen: 1) Increase in funding amount for the annual OAIC CC Multi-center pilot project. 2) Support for additional Pepper Centers that will soon be added to the OAIC network. Relevance Statement for OAIC Coordinating Center Administrative Supplement The Coordinating Center of the OAIC coordinates the activities of all the individual centers in the NIA- funded, OAIC network; its over-arching goal is to build collaborations between the individual OAICs and thereby unlock synergy and enable projects that could not be undertaken by any single OAIC center. This administrative supplement application proposes 2 developmental projects that will significantly enhance the capabilities of the OAIC to achieve these goals and which takes advantage of newly available methods and technology. This also includes additional support for the possible increase in the number of Pepper Centers and an increase in the pilot award budget.",Administrative Supplement to the OAIC Pepper Center Coordinating Center,9961004,U24AG059624,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Administrative Supplement', 'Aging', 'Annual Reports', 'Award', 'Budgets', 'Capsicum', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognition', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Directories', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Evaluation', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Individual', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Performance', 'Physical Function', 'Pilot Projects', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychometrics', 'Publications', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Site', 'Source', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Update', 'Walking', 'analytical method', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'cognitive function', 'cost effective', 'data modeling', 'forest', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'interest', 'lifestyle intervention', 'new technology', 'novel', 'open source', 'programs', 'recruit', 'response', 'synergism', 'theories', 'tool']",NIA,WAKE FOREST UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,U24,2019,149775,0.007443425169783366

"AUGS/DUKE UrogynCREST program PROJECT SUMMARY Health Services Research (HSR) and predictive analytics are rapidly growing fields and will have enormous implications for women’s health research in pelvic floor disorders (PFDs). The AUGS/DUKE Urogynecology Clinical Research Educational Scientist Training (UrogynCREST) program will prepare participants to recognize the critical role that data play in delivering high quality health care. It brings together expertise in health service and women’s health research, medical informatics and prediction modeling. This program will target Urogynecology Faculty at the Assistant Professor level who seek successful careers in health services research (HSR) and analytics. Participants will obtain skills through a combination of didactic and interactive coursework; hands-on manipulation of data through extraction, cleaning, and analysis; and project-based one on one mentoring. The UrogynCREST program will be an interactive, hands-on educational program with centralized activities organized and delivered by distance through a popular on-line learning platform called Sakai, with educational software designed to support teaching, research and collaboration. A diverse faculty with expertise in data sciences teaches courses and the advanced methodology required to perform HSR. Yearly in-person meetings at the annual American Urogynecologic Society meeting enhance networking and the development of partnerships between participants from various institutions, as well as, interactions with the mentors and other HSR in the field. The program’s strategy allows national leaders with particular skills in the field to provide their knowledge to the participants and help mentor them through development of a relevant research question and identification of an appropriate and existing database(s) to address the question. With the guidance of a dedicated statistician and analyst programmer, participants will learn and perform the necessary computer programming needed to extract, clean and analyze these data. Participants whose projects involve the development of prediction models in the form of scores, nomograms or other tools will learn how to build and validate such tools in the existing project. Each participant’s project will culminate in the completion of a submitted manuscript to a peer- reviewed journal or study proposal and publicly available tools when relevant. Overall, the program will shape future scientific leaders in Urogynecology by encouraging the development of clinical-scientists and provide the skills and resources for invigorating data discovery and tools for investigations in HSR specifically addressing (PFDs).

"COINSTAC: Decentralized, Scalable Analysis of Loosely Coupled Data The brain imaging community is greatly benefiting from extensive data sharing efforts currently underway. However, there is a significant gap in existing strategies which focus on anonymized, post-hoc sharing of either 1) full raw or preprocessed data [in the case of open studies] or 2) manually computed summary measures [such as hippocampal volume, in the case of closed (or not yet shared) studies] which we propose to address. Current approaches to data sharing often include significant logistical hurdles both for the investigator sharing the dat as well as for the individual requesting the data (e.g. often times multiple data sharing agreements and approvals are required from US and international institutions). This needs to change, so that the scientific community becomes a venue where data can be collected, managed, widely shared and analyzed while also opening up access to the (many) data sets which are not currently available (see recent overview on this from our group).    The large amount of existing data requires an approach that can analyze data in a distributed way while also leaving control of the source data with the individual investigator; this motivates  dynamic, decentralized way of approaching large scale analyses. We are proposing a peer-to-peer system called the Collaborative Informatics and Neuroimaging Suite Toolkit for Anonymous Computation (COINSTAC). The system will provide an independent, open, no-strings-attached tool that performs analysis on datasets distributed across different locations. Thus, the step of actually aggregating data can be avoided, while the strength of large-scale analyses can be retained. To achieve this, in Aim 1, the uniform data interfaces that we propose will make it easy to share and cooperate. Robust and novel quality assurance and replicability tools will also be incorporated. Collaboration and data sharing will be done through forming temporary (need and project-based) virtual clusters of studies performing automatically generated local computation on their respective data and aggregating statistics in global inference procedures. The communal organization will provide a continuous stream of large scale projects that can be formed and completed without the need of creating new rigid organizations or project-oriented storage vaults. In Aim 2, we develop, evaluate, and incorporate privacy-preserving algorithms to ensure that the data used are not re-identifiable even with multiple re-uses. We also will develop advanced distributed and privacy preserving approaches for several key multivariate families of algorithms (general linear model, matrix factorization [e.g. independent component analysis], classification) to estimate intrinsic networks and perform data fusion. Finally, in Aim 3, we will demonstrate the utility of this approach in a proof of concept study through distributed analyses of substance abuse datasets across national and international venues with multiple imaging modalities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Hundreds of millions of dollars have been spent to collect human neuroimaging data for clinical and research purposes, many of which don't have data sharing agreements or collect sensitive data which are not easily shared, such as genetics. Opportunities for large scale aggregated analyses to infer health-relevant facts create new challenges in protecting the privacy of individuals' data. Open sharing of raw data, though desirable from the research perspective, and growing rapidly, is not a good solution for a large number of datasets which have additional privacy risks or IRB concerns. The COINSTAC solution we are proposing will capture this 'missing data' and allow for pooling of both open and 'closed' repositories by developing privacy preserving versions of widely-used algorithms and incorporating within an easy-to-use platform which enables distributed computation. In addition, COINSTAC will accelerate research on both open and closed data by offering a distributed computational solution for a large toolkit of widely used algorithms.","COINSTAC: Decentralized, Scalable Analysis of Loosely Coupled Data",9938885,R01DA040487,"['AODD relapse', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Agreement', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Brain imaging', 'Classification', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Consent Forms', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Set', 'Decentralization', 'Development', 'Ensure', 'Family', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Health', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Intelligence', 'International', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Letters', 'Linear Models', 'Location', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Movement', 'Paper', 'Plant Roots', 'Poaceae', 'Population', 'Privacy', 'Privatization', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Science', 'Site', 'Source', 'Stream', 'Substance abuse problem', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'base', 'commune', 'computational platform', 'computer framework', 'computing resources', 'connectome', 'cost', 'data anonymization', 'data sharing', 'distributed data', 'flexibility', 'imaging genetics', 'imaging modality', 'independent component analysis', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'open data', 'peer', 'preservation', 'public health relevance', 'quality assurance', 'repository', 'statistics', 'tool', 'virtual']",NIDA,GEORGIA STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,585151,0.003819767370666971
"Knowledge Management Center for Illuminating the Druggable Genome The main goal of the Knowledge Management Center (KMC) for the Illuminating the Druggable Genome (IDG) program is to aggregate, update and articulate protein-centric data, information and knowledge for the entire human proteome with emphasis on understudied proteins from the 3 families that are the focus of the IDG (“IDG List”). The long-term objective of the KMC is to encourage and support biomedical research aimed at understudied proteins by providing an extensive resource of data, information, knowledge, methods and reagents for the entire human proteome, and to support the growing online community focused on understudied proteins. With focus on the IDG List and human proteins, the KMC will enable support for expanded coverage for non-human proteins of therapeutic interest and other associated human health data, in order to catalyze novel biomedical discoveries. To support the overall IDG objective, and to maintain, update and improve these integrated resources, the KMC draws upon expertise from multiple knowledge domains, specifically biology, chemistry and medicine, as well as computer science, graphic design and web programming. Specifically, for the Phase 2 of the IDG KMC we propose 4 Aims:1. Create an automated workflow that captures relevant public data for the entire proteome and manual annotations for the IDG list. The KMC knowledge management system will be built around knowledge graphs, focused on five major branches of the target knowledge tree, tkt: Genotype, Phenotype, Expression, Structure & Function, and Interactions & Pathways, respectively. Aim 2: Design, develop and implement a protein knowledgebase with Data Analytics support. Our protein-centric biomedical knowledge base, TCKB (Target Central Knowledgebase) will be comprised of the data, knowledge and information container, together with its codebase and software pipelines. TCKB will be the repository for experimental, processed and computed data and reagents originating from the IDG DRGCs (Data and Resource Generation Centers). We will provide informatics and modeling support for DRGC activities. Aim 3: We will expand, improve and maintain Pharos. Particularly “knowledge packages,” support automated data summaries for Protein Dossiers, and actively seek feedback from our community. Aim 4. Outreach to scientific community. We will support a series of activities that will leverage TCKB, Pharos and other IDG resources to increase adoption of IDG work, while observing FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable) principles for our knowledgebase, portal and pipelines. The KMC will engage in community outreach by leading tutorials and feedback sessions and dissemination of the Pharos system. To meet its goals, the KMC will coordinate all core activities in close coordination with the IDG Steering Committee and IDG Project Scientists (PS), and include members of the IDG Consortium (IDG- C), other NIH Common Fund programs, NIH Commons, as well as other initiatives.

"Semantic Data Lake for Biomedical Research Capitalizing on the transformative opportunities afforded by the extremely large and ever-growing volume, velocity, and variety of biomedical data being continuously produced is a major challenge. The development and increasingly widespread adoption of several new technologies, including next generation genetic sequencing, electronic health records and clinical trials systems, and research data warehouses means that we are in the midst of a veritable explosion in data production. This in turn results in the migration of the bottleneck in scientific productivity into data management and interpretation: tools are urgently needed to assist cancer researchers in the assembly, integration, transformation, and analysis of these Big Data sets. In this project, we propose to develop the Semantic Data Lake for Biomedical Research (SDL-BR) system, a cluster-computing software environment that enables rapid data ingestion, multifaceted data modeling, logical and semantic querying and data transformation, and intelligent resource discovery. SDL-BR is based on the idea of a data lake, a distributed store that does not make any assumptions about the structure of incoming data, and that delays modeling decisions until data is to be used.

"Sequencing and Genotyping in Diverse Populations:  Who Wants What Back (and When)? PROJECT SUMMARY The North Coast Conference on Precision Medicine is a national annual mid-sized conference series held in Cleveland, Ohio. The conference series aims to serve as a venue for the continuing education and exchange of scientific ideas related to the rapidly evolving and highly interdisciplinary landscape that is precision medicine research. The topics for each conference coincide with the national conversation and research agenda set by national research programs focused on precision medicine. The 2018 conference is a symposium that will focus on issues related to return of genomic results both in clinical and research settings with an emphasis on diverse populations. The conference will be organized as a traditional format with invited speakers from among national experts for topics ranging from issues returning research results to culturally diverse participants and family members, inclusion of diverse patient and participant populations in the Clinical Sequencing Evidence- Generating Research (CSER) consortium and the Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) Program, pharmacogenomics-guided dosing and race/ethnicity, strategies used to return results, among others. 2019 and beyond conference topics are being considered from previous symposia attendees and trends in precision medicine research. Odd-numbered year conferences include a workshop component that has previously covered outcome and exposure variable extraction from electronic health records. Future workshop topics being considered include integration of multiple ‘omics, drug response in different populations, pharmacogenomics clinical implementation, precision medicine in cancer, data sharing and informed consent, and the use of apps for recruitment, diagnosis, follow-up, and treatment. Our second major objective of this conference series is the promotion of diversity in the biomedical workforce. It is well-known that the pipeline from training to full professor for women in biomedical research is leaky whereas the pipeline for under-represented minorities is practically non-existent. Drawing from national and local sources, we vet women and under-represented minorities for every invited speaker opportunity, thereby providing valuable career currency and networking opportunities. We will also encourage women and under-represented minorities, particularly at the trainee level, to attend and participate in this conference series to spur interest in pursuing precision medicine research as a career. Overall, the North Coast Conference on Precision Medicine series is a valuable addition to the national conference landscape, and with its unique location and low cost to participants, will serve as an important educational opportunity as precision medicine research accelerates in earnest. PROJECT NARRATIVE The North Coast Conference on Precision Medicine is a yearly fall conference series in Cleveland, Ohio designed as a continuing education forum in the burgeoning area of precision medicine research. The conference brings together national experts on a host of topics ranging from bioethics to bioinformatics to biomedical informatics to speak and lead workshops on timely challenges posed in translating complex genomic and health data into clinical practice. The conference series also serves to promote diversity in the biomedical workforce. This year’s symposium will focus issues related to return of genomic results in both clinical and research settings with an emphasis on diverse populations.",Sequencing and Genotyping in Diverse Populations:  Who Wants What Back (and When)?,9762963,R13HG010286,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Acceleration', 'African American', 'Area', 'Back', 'Big Data', 'Bioethics', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biomedical Research', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer Simulation', 'Continuing Education', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Dose', 'Educational workshop', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Family member', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitals', 'Incidental Findings', 'Informed Consent', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mining', 'Names', 'Ohio', 'Outcome', 'PMI cohort', 'Participant', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Race', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Schedule', 'Science', 'Series', 'Source', 'Surveys', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine', 'Translating', 'Travel', 'Underrepresented Groups', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'United States', 'United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services', 'Variant', 'Veterans', 'Woman', 'base', 'big biomedical data', 'biomedical informatics', 'career', 'clinical care', 'clinical implementation', 'clinical practice', 'clinical sequencing', 'clinically relevant', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'data sharing', 'design', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'forging', 'frontier', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'health data', 'health disparity', 'health information technology', 'incentive program', 'individual patient', 'interest', 'medical specialties', 'multiple omics', 'patient population', 'point of care', 'posters', 'precision medicine', 'programs', 'recruit', 'response', 'science education', 'senior faculty', 'symposium', 'trend']",NHGRI,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,R13,2019,10000,-0.0005370514309500147
"Protege: A Knowledge-Engineering Environment for Advancing Biomedical Sciences Project Abstract The engineering of ontologies that define the entities in an application area and the relationships among them has become essential for modern work in biomedicine. Ontologies help both humans and computers to manage burgeoning numbers of data. The need to annotate, retrieve, and integrate high- throughput data sets, to process natural language, and to build systems for decision support has set many communities of investigators to work building large ontologies. The Protégé system has become an indispensable open-source resource for an enormous international community of scientists—supporting the development, maintenance, and use of ontologies and electronic knowledge bases by biomedical investigators everywhere. The number of registered Protégé users has grown from 3,500 in 2002 to more than 300,000 users as of this writing. The widespread use of ontologies in biomedicine and the availability of tools, such as Protégé, have taken the biomedical field forward to a new set of challenges that current technology has not been designed to address: Biomedical ontologies have grown in size and scope, and their creation, maintenance and quality assurance have become particularly effort-intensive and error-prone. In this proposal, we will develop new methods and tools that will significantly aid biomedical researchers in easily creating and testing biomedical ontologies throughout their lifecycle. Our plan entails four specific aims. First, we will develop methods and tools to allow biomedical scientist to easily create ontologies directly from their source documents, such as spreadsheets, tab indented hierarchies, and document outlines. Second, we will provide the methods and tools to allow biomedical scientist to identify potential “hot spots” in their ontologies that might affect their quality. Third, we will implement a comprehensive, automated testing framework for ontologies that will assist biomedical researchers in performing ontology and data quality assurance throughout the development cycle. Fourth, we will continue to expand and support the thriving Protégé user community, as it grows to include new clinicians and biomedical scientists as they build the ontologies needed to support clinical care, data-driven research, and the elucidation of new discoveries. Project Narrative Protégé is a software system that helps a burgeoning user community to develop ontologies that enhance biomedical research and improve patient care. Protégé supports scientists, clinician researchers, and workers in informatics in data annotation, data integration, information retrieval, natural-language processing, electronic patient record systems, and decision-support systems. The Protégé resource provides critical semantic-technology infrastructure and expertise for biomedical research and the development of advanced clinical information systems.",Protege: A Knowledge-Engineering Environment for Advancing Biomedical Sciences,9607599,R01GM121724,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Advanced Development', 'Affect', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Biomedical Research', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computerized Patient Records', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Education and Outreach', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Hot Spot', 'Human', 'Informatics', 'Information Retrieval', 'Information Systems', 'Infrastructure', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Letters', 'Maintenance', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Ontology', 'Patient Care', 'Process', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Semantics', 'Source', 'System', 'Technology', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Update', 'Work', 'Writing', 'biomedical ontology', 'biomedical scientist', 'clinical care', 'data integration', 'data sharing', 'design', 'document outlines', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interoperability', 'knowledge base', 'natural language', 'next generation', 'ontology development', 'open source', 'quality assurance', 'software systems', 'tool']",NIGMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,559237,0.061252610306597746

"2020 Nanoscale Science and Engineering for Agriculture and Food Systems Gordon Research Conference and Gordon Research Seminar Project Summary The objectives of this GRC are: 1) To bring together experts and stakeholders to discuss nanotechnology advances, directions, and needs in food and agriculture; 2) To identify cutting-edge research and emerging opportunities to address global challenges of food security, environmental sustainability, food safety, and agricultural productivity. A major goal of this GRC is to promote exceptional early career and female investigators, as well as those of traditionally underrepresented populations, to ensure the continued growth in diversity of scholars in our vibrant community. A diverse range of invited speakers and discussion leaders will present a comprehensive vision of critical and emerging nanotechnology research advances across the field of agricultural science. The program illustrates a targeted excellent diversity of leadership (6), speakers (23), and discussion leaders (11) across the spectrum of: i) gender diversity (19 females, 21 males); ii) USA (24) /International participation (16), representing Austria, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, Denmark, Germany, India, Italy, Korea, Singapore, Spain, Switzerland, and Taiwan; and iii) industry and government (3), which includes the FDA, FAO, a founder of a blockchain startup company, and senior research scientist at a non-governmental organization. The following topics will be included in the program: Food and nutrition, bioinspired and targeted technologies, sensing and tracking, microbiomes, food contact materials and human health and disease. Discussions on the safe deployment of nanotechnology in these areas, public perception and policy, and influence on industry and entrepreneurship are integral to this GRC. The Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (CFSAN), the FDA center responsible for protecting the health of US consumers, will find the following sessions of great interest, Convergence of Nanotechnology with Food & Agriculture; Advances in Nanomaterials; Environmental Nanotechnology; Nano-enabled Approaches to Improving Human & Animal Health; Translation of Nano-Based Science for Application in Food & Agriculture; Big Data, Machine Learning, AI & Modeling; and Nanotechnology's Impact on Food Safety. The significant contributions of this diverse population will provide the strong intellectual infrastructure required to develop safe and sustainable nano-enabled applications in food and agriculture in direct support of the FDA CFSAN goal of ensuring the safety, security, sanitation, and proper labeling of the U.S. food supply. Project Narrative Nanomaterials and nanotechnology are rapidly entering almost every industry around the world. The co-chairs of this GRC envision that the convergence between nanotechnology, biotechnology and information science within plant science, animal science, crop and food science/technology and environmental science will lead to revolutionary advances in improving public health. The successful achievement of this lofty vision requires the profound intellectual commitment of scientists and engineers in a highly integrated engagement across numerous disciplines. Some success examples with a focus on nanotechnology in food include: nano- biosensors for identification of pathogens, toxins and bacteria in foods; identification systems for tracking animal and plant materials from origination to consumption; development of nanotechnology-based foods with lower calories and with less fat, salt and sugar, while retaining flavor and texture; integrated systems for sensing, monitoring and active response intervention for plant and animal production; “smart field systems” to detect, locate, report and direct application of water; precision and controlled release of fertilizers and pesticides; development of plants that exhibit drought resistance and tolerance to salt and excess moisture; and nanoscale films for food packaging and contact materials that extend shelf life, retain quality, and reduce cooling requirements. Overall, nanoscale science and engineering has an important role in creating a safer and more productive agriculture and food system. Commercial advances and technological impacts have been limited somewhat due to the relative “newness” of nanotechnology in agriculture and food systems. Given that research at the nanoscale in agriculture and food systems is only into its second decade, safety of nano-enabled applications in agriculture are still up for debate. The Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (CFSAN), the FDA center responsible for protecting the health of US consumers, will find the following sessions of great interest, Convergence of Nanotechnology with Food & Agriculture; Advances in Nanomaterials; Environmental Nanotechnology; Nano-enabled Approaches to Improving Human & Animal Health; Translation of Nano-Based Science for Application in Food & Agriculture; Big Data, Machine Learning, AI & Modeling; and Nanotechnology's Impact on Food Safety. In the spirit of the GRC mission, the 2020 Nano Ag & Food GRC and GRS will again bring together a diverse array of scientists and engineers, both senior and junior, postdocs, and graduate students from academia, as well as scientists and engineers from business, government, and Non-governmental organizations (NGOs); with an emphasis to attract researchers from around the world to engage in open scientific exchange.

"INvestigations In Gout, Hyperuricemia, and comorbidiTies (INSIGHT) Center of Research Translation (CORT) Project Summary Gout impacts around 4% of the U.S. adult population and is the most common form of inflammatory arthritis in men. The incidence of gout is increasing worldwide. Gout significantly burdens the healthcare system, and is associated with both decreased work productivity and quality of life. With the ever-increasing impact of gout and its associated comorbidities on the population, investigation of novel translational mechanisms mediating gout flares as well as approaches to improving gout and hyperuricemia outcomes comprise an unmet and urgent medical need. When funded, the INvestigationS In Gout, Hyperuricemia, and comorbidiTies (INSIGHT) Center of Research Translation (CORT) included 4 active research projects and an Administrative Core focused on the theme, “Gout, Hyperuricemia, and Associated Comorbidities”. Projects include studies to: determine if adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activity metabolomics have promise as gout biomarkers independent of serum urate (P1), examine the influence of key gene-environment interactions within an internet study of gout flares (P2), unravel the functional genomics of urate transporter genes identified in previously reported genome wide association studies (P3), and investigate the mechanism of urate lowering therapy on renal function within VA STOP-GOUT (P4). Projects range from basic research translation of underlying genetics and inflammatory pathobiology of gout, to understanding mechanisms of CKD progression in gout, and translation of genetic interaction with environmental factors and medications, to precision medicine. The proposed revision project (P5) aims to utilize a novel emergency department based intervention to test methods to improve the care gout patients in the Deep South, with a secondary goal of concurrently enhancing participation of minorities in research. The revised INSIGHT CORT aims to: (1) Conduct five outstanding, innovative, and synergistic research projects drawing on the unique strengths of multidisciplinary research teams at our four major centers: University of Alabama at Birmingham, Harvard University, University of California San Diego, and now Vanderbilt University Medical Center; (2) Foster the development of pilot and feasibility projects and the development and application of new translational methods to research in gout and hyperuricemia and their associated major comorbidities, particularly CKD and metabolic syndrome; and (3) Promote training of translational investigators in current methods of research applicable to gout and hyperuricemia through enrichment activities overseen by our Administrative Core. The proposed revision project directly ties to the CORT through patient enrollment into the Gout CORT Registry and Biorepository, which contributes clinical data and biological samples to projects. The INSIGHT CORT is a multi-disciplinary translational research program at UAB and partner institutions. We have assembled an outstanding team and are uniquely prepared and strongly committed to scientific rigor, innovation, and development of knowledge and translational techniques. Project Narrative The prevalence of gout has been steadily increasing over several decades and is correlated with the rising burden of obesity, chronic cardiac and renal disease; all conditions overrepresented in the Southeastern U.S. – particularly in African Americans. Through a novel emergency department led intervention we aim to improve the care patients with gout receive, both during acute exacerbations and long-term. A secondary goal of the project is to concurrently enhance participation of minorities in biomedical research in the Deep South.","INvestigations In Gout, Hyperuricemia, and comorbidiTies (INSIGHT) Center of Research Translation (CORT)",9902085,P50AR060772,"['Absenteeism', 'Academic Medical Centers', 'Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adenosine Monophosphate', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Alabama', 'Basic Science', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomedical Research', 'Biometry', 'California', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Continuity of Patient Care', 'Deep South', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease Progression', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early identification', 'Educational Intervention', 'Emergency Department-based Intervention', 'Emergency Medicine', 'Enrollment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Face', 'Flare', 'Fostering', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Translation', 'Goals', 'Gout', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hyperuricemia', 'Incidence', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Arthritis', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'International', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Minority Participation', 'Mission', 'Modernization', 'National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nephrology', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Education', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Premature Mortality', 'Prevalence', 'Productivity', 'Protein Kinase', 'Quality of life', 'Recommendation', 'Registries', 'Renal function', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Rheumatology', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Specimen', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Universities', 'Urate', 'Work', 'aging population', 'base', 'biobank', 'clinically relevant', 'functional genomics', 'gene environment interaction', 'genome wide association study', 'health care service utilization', 'health disparity', 'improved', 'innovation', 'men', 'metabolomics', 'minority health', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'productivity loss', 'recruit', 'tool', 'translational research program', 'translational scientist', 'urate transporter']",NIAMS,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,P50,2019,961116,-0.018441660383535625
"Washington University School of Medicine Undiagnosed Diseases Network Clinical Site 1.0 PROJECT SUMMARY The scientific premise of this application is that the individualized translational research process of the Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN) developed during Phase I is scalable and that its impact on patients, families, and disease discovery can be advanced and sustained by addition of a Clinical Site at Washington University School of Medicine (WUSM). WUSM represents a large academic medical center that is fully integrated with world-renowned basic science capabilities and demonstrated expertise in a gene first approach for patients with undiagnosed diseases. The highly collaborative clinical and biomedical research culture at WUSM promotes interactions within and across Departments, with institutional genomic, clinical, computational, and model system experts, and with colleagues regionally, nationally, and internationally. These interactions support recruitment, selection, evaluation, diagnosis discovery, and follow up of pediatric and adult patients with undiagnosed diseases through both established networks and individual referrals. Building on this infrastructure, WUSM faculty and staff will advance the success of the UDN in diagnosing and managing disease in undiagnosed patients by, first, using, refining, and improving protocols designed during Phase I of the UDN for comprehensive, timely clinical evaluations of 30 undiagnosed patients annually. Secondly, we will collect, securely store, and share standardized, high-quality clinical and laboratory data including genotyping, phenotyping, and documentation of environmental exposures and promote an integrated and collaborative community across the UDN and among laboratory and clinical investigators focused on defining the pathophysiology, cell biologic, and molecular mechanisms that cause these difficult to diagnose diseases. Thirdly, the WUSM UDN Clinical Site will propose a bioinformatics plan for leveraging institutional infrastructure and expertise to develop innovative strategies to improve discovery of pathogenic variants. Fourthly, the assessment, dissemination, outreach, and training plan will accelerate assessment and dissemination of data, protocols, consent materials, and methods, availability of educational and outreach materials for participants, clinicians, and other researchers, engagement of underrepresented minorities, and training for students, fellows, staff, and faculty in collaboration with WUSM’s Clinical and Translational Science Award infrastructure. Finally, WUSM will make a clear institutional commitment to maintain its Clinical Site, to adapt UDN Phase I practices for sustainability, to contribute to formation of a sustainable national UDN resource, and to adapt to unique needs and unexpected circumstances that may arise once Common Fund support ends in fiscal year 2022. 2.0 PROJECT NARRATIVE Undiagnosed diseases in children and adults represent frustrating and costly challenges for patients, families, physicians, and society. Building on established institutional infrastructure similar to the Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN), Washington University School of Medicine (WUSM) will establish a UDN Clinical Site to improve the level of diagnosis and care for patients with undiagnosed diseases, facilitate research into the etiology of undiagnosed diseases, and promote an integrated and collaborative community across multiple UDN Clinical Sites, Sequencing Cores, Model Organisms Screening Centers, and among laboratory and clinical investigators. Specifically, the WUSM UDN Clinical Site will annually recruit, select, evaluate, and follow 30 participants with disorders in any clinical specialty, adult and pediatric, provide comprehensive clinical evaluations that require <5 days and follow up, and participate in all UDN protocols, data management and sharing, and sustainability planning.",Washington University School of Medicine Undiagnosed Diseases Network Clinical Site,9789913,U01HG010215,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Accreditation', 'Adult', 'Animal Model', 'Basic Science', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Research', 'Businesses', 'Cells', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Clinical and Translational Science Awards', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer Simulation', 'Consent', 'DNA Sequencing Facility', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Documentation', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Expert Systems', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Family Physicians', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Geographic Locations', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'International', 'Laboratories', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Network-based', 'Participant', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Phase I Clinical Trials', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Review Committee', 'Secure', 'Societies', 'Standardization', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Washington', 'clinical practice', 'clinical research site', 'cost', 'data management', 'data sharing', 'deep learning', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'exome sequencing', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'improved', 'innovation', 'medical schools', 'medical specialties', 'network models', 'operation', 'outreach', 'recruit', 'research clinical testing', 'screening', 'sequencing platform', 'student training', 'success', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NHGRI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,U01,2019,750000,-0.006028249953561744
"Research and development of an open, extensible, web-based information extraction workbench for systematic review Project Summary  1 More than 4,000 systematic reviews are performed each year in the fields of environmental health and evidence-based  2 medicine, with each review requiring, on average, between six months to one year of effort to complete. One of the most  3 time consuming and repetitive aspects of this endeavor involves extraction of detailed information from a large number  4 of scientific documents. The specific data items extracted differ among disciplines, but within a given scientific domain,  5 certain data points are extracted repeatedly for each review conducted. Research on use of natural language processing  6 (NLP) for extracting individual data elements has shown that it has the potential to greatly reduce the laborious, time  7 intensive, and repetitive nature of this step. However, there is currently no integrated, automatic data extraction platform  8 that meets the needs of the systematic review community. We propose a web-based data extraction software platform  9 specifically designed for usage in the domain of systematic review. By combining multiple state-of-the-art data extraction 10 methods utilizing NLP, text mining and machine learning, into a single, unified user interface, we will thereby empower 11 the end-user with a powerful and novel tool for automating an otherwise arduous task. 12 The research we propose encompasses three specific aims: (1) develop new data extraction models using deep learning 13 and a new technique called “data programming”; (2) develop a web-based platform to semi-automate the process; (3) 14 design protocols and standards for packaging extraction models as software components and integrating work done by 15 other research groups and vendors. In the first aim, we will contribute novel data extraction modules designed and 16 trained specifically to extract data elements of interest to those conducting systematic reviews in the domain of 17 environmental health. For this research, we will employ state-of-the-art machine learning, NLP and text mining 18 methodologies to train and evaluate several novel extraction components. In our second aim, we will develop a web- 19 based workbench which will allow users to upload scientific documents for automated data extraction. Our system will 20 also be designed to allow for integration of data extraction approaches (components) from other research groups, thus 21 enabling end users to choose from a wide variety of advanced data extraction methodologies within one unified and 22 intuitive software environment. In our third aim, we will develop new protocols to standardize the inputs and outputs 23 for data extraction components. The resulting interface, which will enable seamless integration of third party extraction 24 components into the workbench, will also facilitate the incorporation of feedback from users such that extraction 25 components can be continuously improved based on real-time data. 26 Our overarching goal is to translate emerging semi-automated extraction technologies out of the lab and into practical 27 software and to bring to market both the software itself as well as several premium data extraction components. The 28 results of the research conducted for Aims 1-3 represent the first step in this direction and will provide the foundation for 29 future developments. These result will take us one step closer to the dream of creating “living systematic reviews,” which 30 are maintained using automated or semi-automated methods and updated regularly as new evidence becomes available. Project Narrative Systematic review is a formal process used widely in evidence-based medicine and environmental health research to identify, assess, and integrate the primary scientific literature with the goal of answering a specific, targeted question in pursuit of the current scientific consensus. By conducting research and development to build a flexible, extensible software system that automates the crucial and resource-intensive process of extracting key data elements from scientific documents, we will make an important contribution toward ongoing efforts to automate systematic review. These efforts will serve to make systematic reviews both more efficient to produce and less expensive to maintain, a result which will greatly accelerate the process by which scientific consensus is obtained in a variety of medical and health-related disciplines having great public significance.","Research and development of an open, extensible, web-based information extraction workbench for systematic review",9623091,R43ES029901,"['Communities', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Dreams', 'Environment', 'Environmental Health', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Intuition', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'One-Step dentin bonding system', 'Online Systems', 'Output', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Update', 'Vendor', 'Work', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'data integration', 'deep learning', 'design', 'evidence base', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'model design', 'novel', 'research and development', 'software systems', 'systematic review', 'text searching', 'tool']",NIEHS,"SCIOME, LLC",R43,2018,225000,0.0011526241301518675
"Crowd-Assisted Deep Learning (CrADLe) Digital Curation to Translate Big Data into Precision Medicine PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The NIH and other agencies are funding high-throughput genomics (‘omics) experiments that deposit digital samples of data into the public domain at breakneck speeds. This high-quality data measures the ‘omics of diseases, drugs, cell lines, model organisms, etc. across the complete gamut of experimental factors and conditions. The importance of these digital samples of data is further illustrated in linked peer-reviewed publications that demonstrate its scientific value. However, meta-data for digital samples is recorded as free text without biocuration necessary for in-depth downstream scientific inquiry.  Deep learning is revolutionary machine intelligence paradigm that allows for an algorithm to program itself thereby removing the need to explicitly specify rules or logic. Whereas physicians / scientists once needed to first understand a problem to program computers to solve it, deep learning algorithms optimally tune themselves to solve problems. Given enough example data to train on, deep learning machine intelligence outperform humans on a variety of tasks. Today, deep learning is state-of-the-art performance for image classification, and, most importantly for this proposal, for natural language processing.  This proposal is about engineering Crowd Assisted Deep Learning (CrADLe) machine intelligence to rapidly scale the digital curation of public digital samples. We will first use our NIH BD2K-funded Search Tag Analyze Resource for Gene Expression Omnibus (STARGEO.org) to crowd-source human annotation of open digital samples. We will then develop and train deep learning algorithms for STARGEO digital curation based on learning the associated free text meta-data each digital sample. Given the ongoing deluge of biomedical data in the public domain, CrADLe may perhaps be the only way to scale the digital curation towards a precision medicine ideal.  Finally, we will demonstrate the biological utility to leverage CrADLe for digital curation with two large- scale and independent molecular datasets in: 1) The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and 2) The Accelerating Medicines Partnership-Alzheimer’s Disease (AMP-AD). We posit that CrADLe digital curation of open samples will augment these two distinct disease projects with a host big data to fuel the discovery of potential biomarker and gene targets. Therefore, successful funding and completion of this work may greatly reduce the burden of disease on patients by enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of digital curation for biomedical big data. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal is about engineering Crowd Assisted Deep Learning (CrADLe) machine intelligence to rapidly scale the digital curation of public digital samples and directly translating this ‘omics data into useful biological inference. We will first use our NIH BD2K-funded Search Tag Analyze Resource for Gene Expression Omnibus (STARGEO.org) to crowd-source human annotation of open digital samples on which we will develop and train deep learning algorithms for STARGEO digital curation of free-text sample-level metadata.

"QuBBD: Deep Poisson Methods for Biomedical Time-to-Event and Longitude Data  The proposed research directly addresses the mission of NIH's BD2K initiative by developing appropriate tools to derive novel insights from available Big Data and by adapting sophisticated machine learning methodology to a framework familiar to biomedical researchers. This new methodology will be one of the first to enable use of machine learning techniques with time-to-event and continuous longitudinal outcome data, and will be the first such extension of the deep Poisson model. In essence, this undertaking builds the missing bridge between the need for advanced prognostic and predictive techniques among biomedical and clinical researchers and the unrealized potential of deep learning methods in the context of biomedical data collected longitudinally. To facilitate smooth adoption in clinical research, the results will be translated into terms familiar to applied practitioners through publications and well-described software packages. The application of the methodology developed will be illustrated using data from the NIH dbGAP repository, thereby further promoting the use of open access data sources. Optimal risk models are essential to realize the promise of precision medicine. This project develops novel machine learning methods for time-to-event and continuous longitudinal data to enhance risk model performance by exploiting correlations between large numbers of predictors and genetic data.

"Knowledge-Based Biomedical Data Science Knowledge-based biomedical data science  In the previous funding period, we designed and constructed breakthrough methods for creating a semantically coherent and logically consistent knowledge-base by automatically transforming and integrating many biomedical databases, and by directly extracting information from the literature. Building on decades of work in biomedical ontology development, and exploiting the architectures supporting the Semantic Web, we have demonstrated methods that allow effective querying spanning any combination of data sources in purely biological terms, without the queries having to reflect anything about the structure or distribution of information among any of the sources. These methods are also capable of representing apparently conflicting information in a logically consistent manner, and tracking the provenance of all assertions in the knowledge-base. Perhaps the most important feature of these methods is that they scale to potentially include nearly all knowledge of molecular biology.  We now hypothesize that using these technologies we can build knowledge-bases with broad enough coverage to overcome the “brittleness” problems that stymied previous approaches to symbolic artificial intelligence, and then create novel computational methods which leverage that knowledge to provide critical new tools for the interpretation and analysis of biomedical data. To test this hypothesis, we propose to address the following specific aims:  1. Identify representative and significant analytical needs in knowledge-based data science, and  refine and extend our knowledge-base to address those needs in three distinct domains: clinical  pharmacology, cardiovascular disease and rare genetic disease.  2. Develop novel and implement existing symbolic, statistical, network-based, machine learning  and hybrid approaches to goal-driven inference from very large knowledge-bases. Create a goal-  directed framework for selecting and combining these inference methods to address particular  analytical problems.  3. Overcome barriers to broad external adoption of developed methods by analyzing their  computational complexity, optimizing performance of knowledge-based querying and inference,  developing simplified, biology-focused query languages, lightweight packaging of knowledge  resources and systems, and addressing issues of licensing and data redistribution.

"SimTK: An Ecosystem for Data and Model Sharing in the Biomechanics Community Physics-based simulations provide a powerful framework for understanding biological form and function. They harmonize heterogeneous experimental data with real-world physical constraints, helping researchers understand biological systems as they engineer novel drugs, new diagnostics, medical devices, and surgical interventions. The rise in new sensors and simulation tools is generating an increasing amount of data, but this data is often inaccessible, preventing reuse and limiting scientific progress. In 2005, we launched SimTK, a website to develop and share biosimulation tools, models, and data, to address these issues. SimTK now supports 62,000+ researchers globally and 950+ projects. Members use it to meet their grants’ data sharing responsibilities; experiment with new ways of collaborating; and build communities around their datasets and tools. However, challenges remain: many researchers still do not share their digital assets due to the time needed to prepare, document, and maintain those assets, and since SimTK hosts a growing number of diverse digital assets, the site now also faces the challenge of making these assets discoverable and reusable. Thus, we propose a plan to extend SimTK and implement new solutions to promote scientific data sharing and reuse. First, we will maintain the reliable, user-friendly foundation upon which SimTK is built, continuing to provide the excellent support our members expect and supporting the site’s existing features for sharing and building communities. Second, we will implement methods to establish a culture of model and data sharing in the biomechanics community. We will encourage researchers to adopt new habits, making sharing part of their workflow, by enabling the software and systems they use to automatically upload models and data to SimTK via an application programming interface (API) and by recruiting leading researchers in the community to serve as beta testers and role models. Third, we will create tools to easily replicate and extend biomechanics simulations. Containers and cloud computing services allow researchers to capture and share a snapshot of their computing environment, enabling unprecedented fidelity in sharing. We will integrate these technologies into SimTK and provide custom, easy-to-use interfaces to replicate and extend simulation studies. Lastly, we will develop a metadata standard for models and data for the biomechanics community, increasing reusability and discoverability of the rich set of resources shared on SimTK. We will use the new standard on SimTK and fill in the metadata fields automatically using natural language processing and machine learning, minimizing the burden and inaccuracies of manual metadata entry. We will evaluate our success in achieving these aims by tracking the number of assets shared and the frequency they are used as a springboard to new research. These changes will accelerate biomechanics research and provide new tools to increase the reusability and impact of shared resources. By lowering barriers to data sharing in the biosimulation community, SimTK will continue to serve as a model for how to create national infrastructure for scientific subdisciplines. SimTK is a vibrant hub for the development and sharing of simulation software, data, and models of biological structures and processes. SimTK-based resources are being used to design medical devices and drugs, to generate new diagnostics, to create surgical interventions, and to provide insights into biology. The proposed enhancements to SimTK will accelerate progress in the field by lowering barriers to and standardizing data and model sharing, thus 1) increasing the quantity and also, importantly, the quality of resources that researchers share and 2) enabling others to reproduce and build on the wealth of past biomechanics research studies.",SimTK: An Ecosystem for Data and Model Sharing in the Biomechanics Community,9523638,R01GM124443,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Biomechanics', 'Biophysics', 'Cloud Computing', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Files', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Documentation', 'Ecosystem', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Explosion', 'Face', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Habits', 'Letters', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Device', 'Medical Device Designs', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physics', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Sharing', 'Resources', 'Security', 'Services', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Update', 'Work', 'application programming interface', 'base', 'biological systems', 'biomechanical model', 'community building', 'complex biological systems', 'data access', 'data sharing', 'digital', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'insight', 'member', 'new technology', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel therapeutics', 'prevent', 'recruit', 'research study', 'response', 'role model', 'sensor', 'simulation', 'simulation software', 'software systems', 'success', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'web site']",NIGMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,478806,0.017339988568460953
"Leveraging Twitter to monitor nicotine and tobacco-related cancer communication Patterns in Twitter data have revolutionized understanding of public health events such as influenza outbreaks. While researchers have begun to examine messaging related to substance use on Twitter, this project will strengthen the use of Twitter as an infoveillance tool to more rigorously examine nicotine, tobacco, and cancer- related communication. Twitter is particularly suited to this work because its users are commonly adolescents, young adults, and racial and ethnic minorities, all of whom are at increased risk for nicotine and tobacco product (NTP) use and related health consequences. Additionally, due to the openness of the platform, searches are replicable and transparent, enabling large-scale systematic research. Therefore, our multidisciplinary team of experts in diverse relevant fields—including public health, behavioral science, computational linguistics, computer science, biomedical informatics, and information privacy and security—will build upon our previous research to develop and validate structured algorithms providing automated surveillance of Twitter’s multifaceted and continuously evolving information related to NTPs. First, we will qualitatively assess a stratified random sample of relevant NTP-related tweets for specific coded variables, such as the message’s primary sentiment and other key information of potential value (e.g., whether a message involves buying/selling, policy/law, and cancer-related communication). Tweets will be obtained directly from Twitter using software we developed that leverages a comprehensive list of Twitter-optimized search strings related to NTPs. Second, we will statistically determine what message characteristics (e.g., the presence of certain words, punctuation, and/or structures) are most strongly associated with each of the coded variables for each search string. Using this information, we will create specialized Machine Learning (ML) algorithms based on state-of-the-art methods from Natural Language Processing (NLP) to automatically assess and categorize future Twitter data. Third, we will use this information to provide automatic assessment of current and future streaming data. Time series analyses using seasonal Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Averages (ARIMA) will determine if there are significant changes over time in volume of messaging related to each specific coded variables of interest. Trends will be examined at the daily, weekly, and monthly level, because each of these levels is potentially valuable for intervention. To maximize the translational value of this project, we will partner with public health department stakeholders who are experts in streamlining dissemination of actionable trends data. In summary, this project will substantially advance our understanding of representations of NTPs on social media—as well as our ability to conduct automated surveillance and analysis of this content. This project will result in important and concrete deliverables, including open-source algorithms for future researchers and processes to quickly disseminate actionable data for tailoring community- level interventions. For this project, we gathered a team of public health researchers and computer scientists to leverage the power of Twitter as a novel surveillance tool to better understand communication about nicotine and tobacco products (NTPs) and related messages about cancer and cancer prevention.

"An Intelligent Concept Agent for Assisting with the Application of Metadata PROJECT ABSTRACT Biomedical investigators are generating increasing amounts of complex and diverse data. This data varies tremendously, from genome sequences through phenotypic measurements and imaging data. If researchers and data scientists can tap into this data effectively, then we can gain insights into disease mechanisms and how to tackle them. However, the main stumbling block is that it is increasingly hard to find and integrate the relevant datasets due to the lack of sufficient metadata. A researcher studying Crohn's disease may miss a crucial dataset on how certain microbial communities affect gut histology due to the lack of descriptive tags on the data. Currently, applying metadata is difficult, time-consuming and error prone due to the vast sea of confusing and overlapping standards for each datatype. Often specialized `data wranglers' are employed to apply metadata, but even these experts are hindered by lack of good tools. Here we propose to develop an intelligent agent that researchers and data wranglers can use to assist them apply metadata. The agent is based around a personalized dashboard of metadata elements that can be collected from multiple specialized portals, as well as sites such as Wikipedia. These elements can be coupled with classifiers that can be used to self-identify datasets to which they may be relevant, making the selection of appropriate vocabularies easier for researchers. We will deploy the system for a number of targeted use cases, including annotation of the National Center for Biomedical Information Bio-Samples repository, and annotation of images within the Figshare repository. Project Narrative Biomedical data is being generated at an increasing rate, and it is becoming increasingly difficult for researchers to be able to locate and effectively operate over this data, which has negative impacts on the rate of new discoveries. One solution is to attach metadata (data about data) onto all information generated in a research project, but application of metadata is currently difficult and time consuming due to the diverse range of standards on offer, typically requiring the expertise of trained data wranglers. Here we propose to develop an intelligent concept assistant that will allow researchers to generate and share sets of metadata elements relevant to their project, and will use machine learning techniques to automatically apply this to data.",An Intelligent Concept Agent for Assisting with the Application of Metadata,9545836,U01HG009453,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Crohn&apos', 's disease', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Disease', 'Distributed Systems', 'Ecosystem', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Fostering', 'Frustration', 'Genome', 'Histology', 'Human Microbiome', 'Image', 'Intelligence', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Metadata', 'Ontology', 'Phenotype', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Sampling', 'Sea', 'Site', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Suggestion', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Vision', 'Vocabulary', 'base', 'dashboard', 'deep learning', 'improved', 'insight', 'microbial community', 'peer', 'prospective', 'repository', 'social', 'tool', 'transcriptomics']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIF-LAWRENC BERKELEY LAB,U01,2018,569784,0.01672930206184768
"BECKON - Block Estimate Chain: creating Knowledge ON demand & protecting privacy 7. Project Summary/Abstract With the wide adoption of electronic health record systems, cross-institutional genomic medicine predictive modeling is becoming increasingly important, and have the potential to enable generalizable models to accelerate research and facilitate quality improvement initiatives. For example, understanding whether a particular variable has clinical significance depends on a variety of factors, one important one being statistically significant associations between the variant and clinical phenotypes. Multivariate models that predict predisposition to disease or outcomes after receiving certain therapeutic agents can help propel genomic medicine into mainstream clinical care. However, most existing privacy-preserving machine learning methods that have been used to build predictive models given clinical data are based on centralized architecture, which presents security and robustness vulnerabilities such as single-point-of-failure. In this proposal, we will develop novel methods for decentralized privacy-preserving genomic medicine predictive modeling, which can advance comparative effectiveness research, biomedical discovery, and patient-care. Our first aim is to develop a predictive modeling framework on private Blockchain networks. This aim relies on the Blockchain technology and consensus protocols, as well as the online and batch machine learning algorithms, to provide an open-source Blockchain-based privacy-preserving predictive modeling library for further Blockchain-related studies and applications. We will characterize settings in which Blockchain technology offers advances over current technologies. The second aim is to develop a Blockchain-based privacy-preserving genomic medicine modeling architecture for real-world clinical data research networks. These aims are devoted to the mission of the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) to develop biomedical technologies with application domain of genomics and healthcare. The NIH Pathway to Independence Award provides a great opportunity for the applicant to complement his computer science background with biomedical knowledge, and specialized training in machine learning and knowledge-based systems. It will also allow him to investigate new techniques to advance genomic and healthcare privacy protection. The success of the proposed project will help his long-term career goal of obtaining a faculty position at a biomedical informatics program at a major US research university and conduct independently funded research in the field of decentralized privacy-preserving computation. 8. Project Narrative The proposed research will develop practical methods to support privacy-preserving genomic and healthcare predictive modeling, and build innovations based on Blockchain technology for secure and robust machine learning training processes. The development of such privacy technology may increase public trust in research and quality improvement. The technology we propose will also contribute to the sharing of predictive models in ways that meet the needs of genomic research and healthcare.",BECKON - Block Estimate Chain: creating Knowledge ON demand & protecting privacy,9549126,K99HG009680,"['Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Authorization documentation', 'Award', 'Biomedical Technology', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Client', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Collection', 'Decentralization', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Distributed Databases', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ethics', 'Faculty', 'Failure', 'Fibrinogen', 'Funding', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health Care Research', 'Healthcare', 'Hybrids', 'Institution', 'Institutional Policy', 'Intuition', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Mainstreaming', 'Maintenance', 'Medicine', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Privacy', 'Privatization', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Secure', 'Security', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transact', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'career', 'clinical care', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinically significant', 'comparative effectiveness', 'computer science', 'data sharing', 'design', 'digital', 'effectiveness research', 'health care delivery', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interoperability', 'knowledge base', 'learning strategy', 'medical specialties', 'network architecture', 'novel', 'open source', 'peer', 'peer networks', 'point of care', 'predictive modeling', 'privacy protection', 'programs', 'public trust', 'success', 'trend', 'web portal', 'web services']",NHGRI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",K99,2018,81977,0.0027605437364396977
"The Center for Predictive Computational Phenotyping-1 Overall DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The biomedical sciences are being radically transformed by advances in our ability to monitor, record, store and integrate information characterizing human biology and health at scales that range from individual molecules to large populations of subjects. This wealth of information has the potential to substantially advance both our understanding of human biology and our ability to improve human health. Perhaps the most central and general approach for exploiting biomedical data is to use methods from machine learning and statistical modeling to infer predictive models. Such models take as input observable data representing some object of interest, and produce as output a prediction about a particular, unobservable property of the object. This approach has proven to be of high value for a wide range of biomedical tasks, but numerous significant challenges remain to be solved in order for the full potential of predictive modeling to be realized.  To address these challenges, we propose to establish The Center for Predictive Computational Phenotyping (CPCP). Our proposed center will focus on a broad range of problems that can be cast as computational phenotyping. Although some phenotypes are easily measured and interpreted, and are available in an accessible format, a wide range of scientifically and clinically important phenotypes do not satisfy these criteria. In such cases, computational phenotyping methods are required either to (i) extract a relevant  phenotype from a complex data source or collection of heterogeneous data sources, (ii) predict clinically  important phenotypes before they are exhibited, or (iii) do both in the same application. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We will develop innovative new approaches and tools that are able to discover, and make crucial inferences with large data sets that include molecular profiles, medical images, electronic health records, population-level data, and various combinations of these and other data types. These approaches will significantly advance the state of the art in wide range of biological and clinical investigations, such as predicting which patients are most at risk for breast cancer, heart attacks and severe blood clots.",The Center for Predictive Computational Phenotyping-1 Overall,9478117,U54AI117924,"['Address', 'Biological', 'Blood coagulation', 'Breast Cancer Risk Factor', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'General Population', 'Generations', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Greek', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Biology', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Organism', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Property', 'Regulatory Element', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Statistical Algorithm', 'Statistical Models', 'Time', 'Training Activity', 'biomedical scientist', 'clinical investigation', 'clinical predictors', 'education research', 'graduate student', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'novel strategies', 'outcome forecast', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'undergraduate student']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,U54,2018,897471,0.010621463666318698
"Biomedical Data Translator Technical Feasibility Assessment and Architecture Design Our Vision: We propose DeepLink, a versatile data translator that integrate multi-scale, heterogeneous, and multi-source biomedical and clinical data. The primary goal of DeepLink is to enable meaningful bidirectional translation between clinical and molecular science by closing the interoperability gap between models and knowledge at different scales. The translator will enhance clinical science with molecular insights from basic and translational research (e.g. genetic variants, protein interactions, pathway functions, and cellular organization), and enable the molecular sciences by connecting biological discoveries with their pathophysiological consequences (e.g. diseases, signs and symptoms, pharmacological effects, physiological systems). Fundamental differences in the language and semantics used to describe the models and knowledge between the clinical and molecular domains results in an interoperability gap. DeepLink will systematically and comprehensively close this gap. We will begin with the latest technology in semantic knowledge graphs to support an extensible architecture for dynamic data federation and knowledge harmonization. We will design a system for multi-scale model integration that is ontology-based and will combine model execution with prior, curated biomedical knowledge. Our design strategy will be iterative and participatory and anchored by 10 major milestones. In a series of demonstrations of DeepLink’s functions, we will address one of the major challenges facing translational science: reproducibility of biomedical research findings that are based on evolving molecular datasets. Reproducibility of analyses and replication of results are central to scientific advancement. Many landmark studies have used data that are constantly being updated, curated, and pared down over time. Our series of demonstrations projects are designed to prototype the technology required for a scalable and robust translator as well as the techniques we will use to close the interoperability gap for a specific use case. The demonstration project will, itself, will be a significant and novel contribution to science. DeepLink will be able to answer questions that are currently enigmatic. Examples include: - From clinicians: What is the comparative effectiveness of all the treatments for disease Y given a patient's genetic/metabolic/proteomic profile? What are the functional variants in cell type X that are associated with differential treatment outcomes? What metabolite perturbations in cell type Y are associated with different subtypes of disease X? - From basic science researchers: What is known about disease Y across all model organisms (even those not designed to model Y)? What are all the clinical phenotypes that result from a change in function in protein X? Which biological pathways are affected by a pathogenic variant of disease Y? What patient data are available to evaluate a molecularlyderived clinical hypothesis? Challenges and Our Approaches: DeepLink will close the interoperability gap that currently prohibits molecular discoveries from leading to clinical innovations. DeepLink will be technologically driven, addressing the challenges associated with large, heterogeneous, semantically ambiguous, continuously changing, partially overlapping, and contextually dependent data by using (1) scalable, distributed, and versioned graph stores; (2) semantic technologies such as ontologies and Linked Data; (3) network analysis quality control methods; (4) machine-learning focused data fusion methods; (5) context-aware text mining, entity recognition and relation extraction; (6) multi-scale knowledge discovery using patient and molecular data; and (7) presentation of actionable knowledge to clinicians and basic scientists via user-friendly interfaces. n/a",Biomedical Data Translator Technical Feasibility Assessment and Architecture Design,9635840,OT3TR002027,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Architecture', 'Awareness', 'Basic Science', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Research', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Language', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Ontology', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmacology', 'Physiological', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Quality Control', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Personnel', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Semantics', 'Series', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Source', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'Treatment outcome', 'Update', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'base', 'cell type', 'clinical phenotype', 'comparative effectiveness', 'design', 'disorder subtype', 'genetic variant', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interoperability', 'molecular domain', 'multi-scale modeling', 'novel', 'prototype', 'text searching', 'user-friendly']",NCATS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,OT3,2018,854309,0.0028766733244727366

"Unifying Templates, Ontologies and Tools to Achieve Effective Annotation of Bioassay Protocols Project Summary Biological assays are the foundation for developing chemical probes and drugs, but new Big Data approaches – which have revolutionized other areas of biomedical science – have not yet advanced this early step of biomedical research: analysis of assay data. The obstacle is that scientists specify their assays through text descriptions written in scientific English, which need to be translated into standardized annotations readable by computers. This lack of standardized and machine-readable assay descriptions is a major impediment to manage, find, aggregate, compare, re-use, and learn from the ever-growing corpus of assays (e.g., >1.2 million in PubChem). Thus, there is a critical need for better annotation and curation tools for drug discovery assays. However, the process to go from a simple text protocol to highly detailed machine-readable semantic annotations is not trivial. Multiple tools and technologies are required: ontologies or the structured controlled vocabularies; templates that map specific vocabularies to properties that are to be captured; and software tools to actually apply these ontologies to a given text. Currently, each of these exists in isolation; yet, a bottleneck in any one tool or technology, or a gap between the different pieces, disrupts the overall process, resulting in poor or no annotation of the datasets. Here we propose a project to combine and integrate these three technologies (which are also the core competencies of the three groups collaborating on this proposal). We will deliver a novel, comprehensive, user-friendly data annotation and curation system that is highly interconnected, encompassing the full cycle, and real-world practice, of required tasks and decisions, by all parties within the `bioassay annotation ecosystem' (researchers performing curation, dedicated curators, IT specialists, ontology owners, and librarians/repositories). The alliance between academic and commercial collaborators, who already work together, will greatly benefit the project and minimize execution risk. Our specific aims are to: (1) Develop a bioassay-specific template editor and templates by adopting the Stanford (Center for Expanded Data Annotation and Retrieval, CEDAR) data model to the machine learning-based curation tool BioAssay Express, to exploit the broad functionality of its data structures, tools and interfaces; (2) Define and create an ontology update process and tool (`OntoloBridge') to support rapid feedback between curators/users and ontology experts and enable semi-automated incorporation of suggestions for updates to existing published ontologies; (3) Develop new tools to export annotated data into public repositories such as PubChem; and (4) Evaluate our solution across diverse audiences (pharma, academia, repositories). The system will improve bioassay curation efficiency, quality, and effectiveness, enabling scientists to generate standardized annotations for their experiments to make these data FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable). We envision this suite of tools will encourage annotation earlier in the data lifecycle while still supporting annotation at later stages (e.g., submission to repositories or to journals). Project Narrative Biological assays are the foundation for developing drugs, but new Big Data approaches – which have revolu- tionized other areas of biomedical science – have not yet advanced this early step of biomedical research: analysis of assay data. The obstacle is that assays are written in scientific English, which need to be translated into standardized descriptions readable by computers. This lack of machine-readable annotations is a major impediment to manage, find, compare, re-use, and learn from the millions of assays. This project will develop a formal process and integrated tools to support the complete cycle of tasks and decisions required for bioassay annotation, enabling expedited (and more cost-effective) drug discovery.","Unifying Templates, Ontologies and Tools to Achieve Effective Annotation of Bioassay Protocols",9527186,U01LM012630,"['Academia', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Area', 'Big Data', 'Biological Assay', 'Biomedical Research', 'Chemicals', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Competence', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Controlled Vocabulary', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Ecosystem', 'Effectiveness', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Exercise', 'FAIR principles', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Hour', 'Journals', 'Learning', 'Librarians', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Ontology', 'Output', 'Participant', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Polishes', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'PubChem', 'Publishing', 'Readability', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrieval', 'Risk', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Semantics', 'Site', 'Software Engineering', 'Software Tools', 'Specialist', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Suggestion', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Tweens', 'Update', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'base', 'cost effective', 'data modeling', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'drug mechanism', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'improved functioning', 'in vivo', 'informatics training', 'novel', 'ontology development', 'open source', 'practical application', 'predictive modeling', 'repository', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,U01,2018,516810,-0.011741894514910712

Quarles, Ph.D., Chief Scientist, The Optical Society  2010 Massachusetts Ave, NW, Washington, DC  gquarles@osa.org, 202-416-1954 Project Summary /Abstract:  The 2018 OSA Biophotonics Congress: Biomedical Optics, 3-6 April 2018, Hollywood, FL, consists of four topical meetings. Two of these meetings, Optical Tomography and Spectroscopy (OTS) and Microscopy, Histopathology and Analytics (Microscopy) provide broad exposure to a very active multidisciplinary field in biomedical imaging and bioengineering focused on illness treatment and health enhancement. The interdisciplinary nature of the co- located meetings will provide cross-fertilization of concepts and techniques between fields with the resulting synergies obtained from such interactions. This proposal is to provide registration and travel support for students and early career professionals presenting at one of these topical meetings.  OTS will focus on new developments in diffuse optics, spectroscopy and other non- invasive tomographic imaging approaches, including the fields of diffuse optical tomography (DOT), photoacoustic tomography (PAT), optical coherence tomography (OCT), wavefront engineering to overcome scattering, as well as new developments in spectroscopic technologies.  Microscopy will include topics central to the development of optical microscopy and in vitro optical sensing for the clinic. Areas such as novel optical approaches, including computational optics, new image processing and segmentation techniques, development of decision-assistance algorithms via machine-learning and other strategies, testing technologies in pre-clinical models, applications to clinical samples, and validation in the clinic will be discussed. Optically enabled microfluidics are included in this track as well. The goal of these efforts should be towards clinical translation.  The general purpose of these meetings is to create an inclusive, open forum for the presentation of high-quality scientific research through plenary and technical sessions, short courses, panels, networking and special events. This method of face-to-face information sharing allows researchers to learn what others in their field and related disciplines are doing and to efficiently learn about new research, tools, and techniques that might be relevant to their work.

"Sci-Score, a tool suite to support Rigor and Transparency NIH and Journal Guidelines Project​ ​Summary While standards in reporting of scientific methods are absolutely critical to producing reproducible science, meeting such standards is tedious and difficult. Checklists and instructions are tough to follow often resulting in low and inconsistent compliance. Scientific journals and societies as well as the National Institutes of Health are now actively proposing general guidelines to address reproducibility issues, particularly in the reporting of methods,​ ​but​ ​the​ ​trickier​ ​part​ ​is​ ​to​ ​train​ ​the​ ​biomedical​ ​community​ ​to​ ​use​ ​these​ ​standards​ ​to​ ​effectively. To support new standards in methods reporting, especially the RRID standard for Rigor and Transparency of Key Biological Resources, we propose to build Sci-Score a text mining based tool suite to help authors meet the standard. Sci-Score will provide an automated check on compliance with the RRID standard already implemented by over 100 journals including Cell, Journal of Neuroscience, and eLife and other Rigor and transparency standards put forward by the NIH. The innovation behind Sci-score is the provision of a score, which can be obtained by individual investigators or journals. This score reflects an aspect of quality of methods reporting. We posit that the score will serve as a tool that investigators can use to compete with themselves​ ​and​ ​each​ ​other,​ ​the​ ​way​ ​they​ ​currently​ ​compete​ ​on​ ​metrics​ ​of​ ​popularity,​ ​i.e.,​ ​the​ ​H-index. In Phase I of this project and before, our group has successfully developed a text mining algorithm that can detect antibodies, cell lines, organisms and digital resources (all 4 RRID types) and has created a preliminary score. We propose to extend this approach to all research inputs, like chemicals and plasmids that are requested as part of Cell press’ STAR Methods (http://www.cell.com/star-methods)​. We also propose to build a set of algorithms to detect whether authors discuss the major sources of irreproducibility outlined by NIH, including investigator blinding, proper randomization and sufficient reporting of sex and other biological variables. Resource identification along with other quality metrics will be used to score the quality of scientific methods section text. If successful, the tool could be used by editors, reviewers, and investigators to improve the​ ​quality​ ​of​ ​the​ ​scientific​ ​paper. Our Phase II specific aims include 1) enhancing and hardening the core natural language processing pipelines to recognize a broader range of sentences in near real time; 2) building a set of modular tools that will be provided for different groups of users to take advantage of the text mining capability we develop in aim 1. At the end of Phase II, we should have a commercially viable product that will be able to be licensed to serve the needs​ ​of​ ​the​ ​publishers​ ​and​ ​the​ ​broader​ ​research​ ​community. Standards​ ​for​ ​scientific​ ​methods​ ​reporting​ ​are​ ​absolutely​ ​critical​ ​to​ ​producing​ ​reproducible​ ​science,​ ​but​ ​meeting such​ ​standards​ ​is​ ​difficult.​ ​Checklists​ ​and​ ​instructions​ ​are​ ​tough​ ​to​ ​follow​ ​often​ ​resulting​ ​in​ ​low​ ​and​ ​inconsistent compliance.​ ​To​ ​support​ ​new​ ​standards​ ​in​ ​methods​ ​reporting,​ ​especially​ ​the​ ​RRID​ ​standard​ ​for​ ​Rigor​ ​and Transparency,​ ​we​ ​propose​ ​to​ ​build​ ​​Sci-Score​​ ​a​ ​text​ ​mining​ ​based​ ​tool​ ​suite​ ​to​ ​help​ ​authors​ ​meet​ ​the​ ​standard.

"Semantic Literature Annotation and Integrative Panomics Analysis for PTM-Disease Knowledge Network Discovery PROJECT SUMMARY Protein post-translational modification (PTM) plays a critical role in many diseases; however, critical gaps remain in research infrastructure for global analysis of PTMs. Key PTM information concerning enzyme- substrate relationships, regulation of PTM enzymes, PTM cross-talk, and functional consequences of PTM remains buried in the scientific literature. Meanwhile, while high-throughput panomics (genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, PTM proteomic) data offer an unprecedented opportunity for the discovery of PTM-disease relationships, the data must be analyzed in an integrated and easily accessible knowledge framework in order for researchers and clinicians to gain a molecular understanding of disease. The goal of this application is to develop a collaborative knowledge environment for semantic annotation of scientific literature and integrative panomics analysis for PTM-disease knowledge discovery in precision medicine. We propose to connect PTM information from literature mining and curated databases in a knowledge resource on an ontological framework that supports analysis of panomics data in the context of PTM networks. To broaden impact and foster collaborative development, our resource will be FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) and interoperable with community standards.  The specific aims are: (i) develop a novel NLP (natural language processing) system for full-scale literature mining and PTM-disease knowledge extraction; (ii) develop a PTM knowledge resource for integrative panomics analysis and network discovery; and (iii) provide a FAIR collaborative environment for scalable semantic annotation and knowledge integration. The proposed system will build upon the NLP technologies and text mining tools already developed by our team and the bioinformatics infrastructure at the Protein Information Resource (PIR). The iPTMnet web portal will allow searching, browsing, visualization and analysis of PTM networks and PTM-related mutations in conjunction with user-supplied omics data, including panomics data from major national initiatives. Use scenarios will include identification of disease-driving genetic variants and analysis of cellular responses to kinase inhibitors. Our PTM knowledgebase will be disseminated with an RDF triple-store and a SPARQL endpoint for semantic queries, while our text mining tools and full-scale literature mining results will be disseminated in the BioC community standard for seamless integration to other text mining pipelines. To engage the community semantic annotation of scientific literature, we will host a hackathon to develop tools to expose BioC-annotated literature corpora to the semantic web, as well as an annotation jamboree to explore tagging of scientific text with precise ontological terms. This project will thus offer a unique research resource for PTM-disease network discovery as well as an integrable collaborative knowledge framework to support Big Data to Knowledge in precision medicine. PROJECT NARRATIVE Precision medicine requires a detailed understanding of the molecular events that are disrupted in disease, including changes in protein post-translational modifications (PTM) that are hallmarks of many diseases. The proposed resource will support analysis of genomic-scale data for exploring PTM-disease networks and PTM-related mutations, as well as knowledge dissemination on the semantic web. These combined efforts will accelerate basic understanding of disease processes and discovery of diagnostic targets and more effective individualized therapies.",Semantic Literature Annotation and Integrative Panomics Analysis for PTM-Disease Knowledge Network Discovery,9532909,U01GM120953,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Automobile Driving', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Controlled Vocabulary', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Drug resistance', 'Educational workshop', 'Environment', 'Enzymes', 'Europe', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'FAIR principles', 'Fostering', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Hybrids', 'Imagery', 'Information Resources', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Knowledge Extraction', 'Length', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'MicroRNAs', 'Mining', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Ontology', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Phosphorylation', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Play', 'Post Translational Modification Analysis', 'Post-Translational Modification Site', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Post-Translational Regulation', 'Process', 'Protein Family', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'PubMed', 'Publications', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Semantics', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Site', 'System', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Tissues', 'Translational Research', 'Variant', 'bioinformatics resource', 'cell type', 'collaborative environment', 'computer based Semantic Analysis', 'enzyme substrate', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic variant', 'hackathon', 'indexing', 'individualized medicine', 'information organization', 'innovation', 'interoperability', 'kinase inhibitor', 'knowledge base', 'knowledge integration', 'novel', 'precision medicine', 'protein complex', 'protein protein interaction', 'response', 'system architecture', 'text searching', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'web portal', 'web services', 'web site']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF DELAWARE,U01,2018,365327,0.015171083373140675
"The Center for Innovation in Intensive Longitudinal Studies (CIILS) PROJECT SUMMARY Significance. The Intensive Longitudinal Behavior Network (ILHBN) provides an unprecedented opportunity to advance and shape the future landscape of health behavior science and related intervention practice. The proposed Research Coordinating Center, the Center for Innovation in Intensive Longitudinal Studies (CIILS), housed at the Pennsylvania State University (Penn State), will bring together an interdisciplinary team to synergistically support and coordinate research activities across a diverse portfolio of anticipated U01 projects to accomplish the Network’s larger goal of sustained innovation in the use of intensive longitudinal data (ILD) and associated methods in the study of health behavior change, and in informing prevention and intervention designs. Innovation. The proposed organizational structure of the ILHBN as a small-world network is motivated by our team’s collective decades of experience with multidisciplinary and multi-site collaborations, and is designed to facilitate information flow, collective decision making, and coordination of goals and effort within the ILHBN.

"COINSTAC: decentralized, scalable analysis of loosely coupled data Project Summary/Abstract  The brain imaging community is greatly benefiting from extensive data sharing efforts currently underway5,10. However, there is a significant gap in existing strategies which focus on anonymized, post-hoc sharing of either 1) full raw or preprocessed data [in the case of open studies] or 2) manually computed summary measures [such as hippocampal volume11, in the case of closed (or not yet shared) studies] which we propose to address. Current approaches to data sharing often include significant logistical hurdles both for the investigator sharing the data as well as for the individual requesting the data (e.g. often times multiple data sharing agreements and approvals are required from US and international institutions). This needs to change, so that the scientific community be- comes a venue where data can be collected, managed, widely shared and analyzed while also opening up access to the (many) data sets which are not currently available (see recent overview on this from our group2). The large amount of existing data requires an approach that can analyze data in a distributed way while also leaving control of the source data with the individual investigator; this motivates a dynamic, decentralized way of approaching large scale analyses. We are proposing a peer-to-peer system called the Collaborative Informat- ics and Neuroimaging Suite Toolkit for Anonymous Computation (COINSTAC). The system will provide an inde- pendent, open, no-strings-attached tool that performs analysis on datasets distributed across different locations. Thus, the step of actually aggregating data can be avoided, while the strength of large-scale analyses can be retained. To achieve this, in Aim 1, the uniform data interfaces that we propose will make it easy to share and cooperate. Robust and novel quality assurance and replicability tools will also be incorporated. Collaboration and data sharing will be done through forming temporary (need and project-based) virtual clusters of studies performing automatically generated local computation on their respective data and aggregating statistics in global inference procedures. The communal organization will provide a continuous stream of large scale projects that can be formed and completed without the need of creating new rigid organizations or project-oriented stor- age vaults. In Aim 2, we develop, evaluate, and incorporate privacy-preserving algorithms to ensure that the data used are not re-identifiable even with multiple re-uses. We also will develop advanced distributed and pri- vacy preserving approaches for several key multivariate families of algorithms (general linear model, matrix fac- torization [e.g. independent component analysis], classification) to estimate intrinsic networks and perform data fusion. Finally, in Aim 3, we will demonstrate the utility of this approach in a proof of concept study through distributed analyses of substance abuse datasets across national and international venues with multiple imaging modalities. 4 Project Narrative  Hundreds of millions of dollars have been spent to collect human neuroimaging data for clinical and research purposes, many of which don’t have data sharing agreements or collect sensitive data which are not easily shared, such as genetics. Opportunities for large scale aggregated analyses to infer health-relevant facts create new challenges in protecting the privacy of individuals' data. Open sharing of raw data, though desirable from the research perspective, and growing rapidly, is not a good solution for a large number of datasets which have additional privacy risks or IRB concerns. The COINSTAC solution we are proposing will capture this ‘missing data’ and allow for pooling of both open and ‘closed’ repositories by developing privacy preserving versions of widely-used algorithms and incorporating within an easy-to-use platform which enables distributed computation. In addition, COINSTAC will accelerate research on both open and closed data by offering a distributed compu- tational solution for a large toolkit of widely used algorithms. 3","COINSTAC: decentralized, scalable analysis of loosely coupled data",9717051,R01DA040487,"['AODD relapse', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Agreement', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Brain imaging', 'Classification', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Consent Forms', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Set', 'Decentralization', 'Development', 'Ensure', 'Family', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Health', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'International', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Letters', 'Linear Models', 'Location', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Movement', 'Paper', 'Plant Roots', 'Poaceae', 'Population', 'Privacy', 'Privatization', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Science', 'Site', 'Source', 'Stream', 'Substance abuse problem', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'base', 'commune', 'computer framework', 'computing resources', 'connectome', 'cost', 'data sharing', 'distributed data', 'flexibility', 'imaging genetics', 'imaging modality', 'independent component analysis', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'open data', 'peer', 'quality assurance', 'repository', 'statistics', 'tool', 'virtual']",NIDA,THE MIND RESEARCH NETWORK,R01,2018,282320,0.0014528555701583243
"Knowledge Management Center for Illuminating the Druggable Genome The main goal of the Knowledge Management Center (KMC) for the Illuminating the Druggable Genome (IDG) program is to aggregate, update and articulate protein-centric data, information and knowledge for the entire human proteome with emphasis on understudied proteins from the 3 families that are the focus of the IDG (“IDG List”). The long-term objective of the KMC is to encourage and support biomedical research aimed at understudied proteins by providing an extensive resource of data, information, knowledge, methods and reagents for the entire human proteome, and to support the growing online community focused on understudied proteins. With focus on the IDG List and human proteins, the KMC will enable support for expanded coverage for non-human proteins of therapeutic interest and other associated human health data, in order to catalyze novel biomedical discoveries. To support the overall IDG objective, and to maintain, update and improve these integrated resources, the KMC draws upon expertise from multiple knowledge domains, specifically biology, chemistry and medicine, as well as computer science, graphic design and web programming. Specifically, for the Phase 2 of the IDG KMC we propose 4 Aims:1. Create an automated workflow that captures relevant public data for the entire proteome and manual annotations for the IDG list. The KMC knowledge management system will be built around knowledge graphs, focused on five major branches of the target knowledge tree, tkt: Genotype, Phenotype, Expression, Structure & Function, and Interactions & Pathways, respectively. Aim 2: Design, develop and implement a protein knowledgebase with Data Analytics support. Our protein-centric biomedical knowledge base, TCKB (Target Central Knowledgebase) will be comprised of the data, knowledge and information container, together with its codebase and software pipelines. TCKB will be the repository for experimental, processed and computed data and reagents originating from the IDG DRGCs (Data and Resource Generation Centers). We will provide informatics and modeling support for DRGC activities. Aim 3: We will expand, improve and maintain Pharos. Particularly “knowledge packages,” support automated data summaries for Protein Dossiers, and actively seek feedback from our community. Aim 4. Outreach to scientific community. We will support a series of activities that will leverage TCKB, Pharos and other IDG resources to increase adoption of IDG work, while observing FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable) principles for our knowledgebase, portal and pipelines. The KMC will engage in community outreach by leading tutorials and feedback sessions and dissemination of the Pharos system. To meet its goals, the KMC will coordinate all core activities in close coordination with the IDG Steering Committee and IDG Project Scientists (PS), and include members of the IDG Consortium (IDG- C), other NIH Common Fund programs, NIH Commons, as well as other initiatives.

"Sequencing and Genotyping in Diverse Populations:  Who Wants What Back (and When)? PROJECT SUMMARY The North Coast Conference on Precision Medicine is a national annual mid-sized conference series held in Cleveland, Ohio. The conference series aims to serve as a venue for the continuing education and exchange of scientific ideas related to the rapidly evolving and highly interdisciplinary landscape that is precision medicine research. The topics for each conference coincide with the national conversation and research agenda set by national research programs focused on precision medicine. The 2018 conference is a symposium that will focus on issues related to return of genomic results both in clinical and research settings with an emphasis on diverse populations. The conference will be organized as a traditional format with invited speakers from among national experts for topics ranging from issues returning research results to culturally diverse participants and family members, inclusion of diverse patient and participant populations in the Clinical Sequencing Evidence- Generating Research (CSER) consortium and the Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) Program, pharmacogenomics-guided dosing and race/ethnicity, strategies used to return results, among others. 2019 and beyond conference topics are being considered from previous symposia attendees and trends in precision medicine research. Odd-numbered year conferences include a workshop component that has previously covered outcome and exposure variable extraction from electronic health records. Future workshop topics being considered include integration of multiple ‘omics, drug response in different populations, pharmacogenomics clinical implementation, precision medicine in cancer, data sharing and informed consent, and the use of apps for recruitment, diagnosis, follow-up, and treatment. Our second major objective of this conference series is the promotion of diversity in the biomedical workforce. It is well-known that the pipeline from training to full professor for women in biomedical research is leaky whereas the pipeline for under-represented minorities is practically non-existent. Drawing from national and local sources, we vet women and under-represented minorities for every invited speaker opportunity, thereby providing valuable career currency and networking opportunities. We will also encourage women and under-represented minorities, particularly at the trainee level, to attend and participate in this conference series to spur interest in pursuing precision medicine research as a career. Overall, the North Coast Conference on Precision Medicine series is a valuable addition to the national conference landscape, and with its unique location and low cost to participants, will serve as an important educational opportunity as precision medicine research accelerates in earnest. PROJECT NARRATIVE The North Coast Conference on Precision Medicine is a yearly fall conference series in Cleveland, Ohio designed as a continuing education forum in the burgeoning area of precision medicine research. The conference brings together national experts on a host of topics ranging from bioethics to bioinformatics to biomedical informatics to speak and lead workshops on timely challenges posed in translating complex genomic and health data into clinical practice. The conference series also serves to promote diversity in the biomedical workforce. This year’s symposium will focus issues related to return of genomic results in both clinical and research settings with an emphasis on diverse populations.",Sequencing and Genotyping in Diverse Populations:  Who Wants What Back (and When)?,9612854,R13HG010286,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Acceleration', 'African American', 'Area', 'Back', 'Big Data', 'Bioethics', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biomedical Research', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer Simulation', 'Continuing Education', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Dose', 'Educational workshop', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Family member', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitals', 'Incidental Findings', 'Informed Consent', 'Institution', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mining', 'Names', 'Ohio', 'Outcome', 'PMI cohort', 'Participant', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Race', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Schedule', 'Science', 'Series', 'Source', 'Surveys', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine', 'Translating', 'Travel', 'Underrepresented Groups', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'United States', 'United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services', 'Variant', 'Veterans', 'Woman', 'base', 'big biomedical data', 'biomedical informatics', 'career', 'clinical care', 'clinical implementation', 'clinical practice', 'clinical sequencing', 'clinically relevant', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'data sharing', 'design', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'forging', 'frontier', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'health data', 'health disparity', 'health information technology', 'incentive program', 'individual patient', 'interest', 'medical specialties', 'multiple omics', 'patient population', 'point of care', 'posters', 'precision medicine', 'programs', 'recruit', 'response', 'science education', 'senior faculty', 'symposium', 'trend']",NHGRI,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,R13,2018,10000,-0.0005370514309500147
"Protege: A Knowledge-Engineering Environment for Advancing Biomedical Sciences Project Abstract The engineering of ontologies that define the entities in an application area and the relationships among them has become essential for modern work in biomedicine. Ontologies help both humans and computers to manage burgeoning numbers of data. The need to annotate, retrieve, and integrate high- throughput data sets, to process natural language, and to build systems for decision support has set many communities of investigators to work building large ontologies. The Protégé system has become an indispensable open-source resource for an enormous international community of scientists—supporting the development, maintenance, and use of ontologies and electronic knowledge bases by biomedical investigators everywhere. The number of registered Protégé users has grown from 3,500 in 2002 to more than 300,000 users as of this writing. The widespread use of ontologies in biomedicine and the availability of tools, such as Protégé, have taken the biomedical field forward to a new set of challenges that current technology has not been designed to address: Biomedical ontologies have grown in size and scope, and their creation, maintenance and quality assurance have become particularly effort-intensive and error-prone. In this proposal, we will develop new methods and tools that will significantly aid biomedical researchers in easily creating and testing biomedical ontologies throughout their lifecycle. Our plan entails four specific aims. First, we will develop methods and tools to allow biomedical scientist to easily create ontologies directly from their source documents, such as spreadsheets, tab indented hierarchies, and document outlines. Second, we will provide the methods and tools to allow biomedical scientist to identify potential “hot spots” in their ontologies that might affect their quality. Third, we will implement a comprehensive, automated testing framework for ontologies that will assist biomedical researchers in performing ontology and data quality assurance throughout the development cycle. Fourth, we will continue to expand and support the thriving Protégé user community, as it grows to include new clinicians and biomedical scientists as they build the ontologies needed to support clinical care, data-driven research, and the elucidation of new discoveries. Project Narrative Protégé is a software system that helps a burgeoning user community to develop ontologies that enhance biomedical research and improve patient care. Protégé supports scientists, clinician researchers, and workers in informatics in data annotation, data integration, information retrieval, natural-language processing, electronic patient record systems, and decision-support systems. The Protégé resource provides critical semantic-technology infrastructure and expertise for biomedical research and the development of advanced clinical information systems.",Protege: A Knowledge-Engineering Environment for Advancing Biomedical Sciences,9404042,R01GM121724,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Advanced Development', 'Affect', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Biomedical Research', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computerized Patient Records', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Education and Outreach', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Hot Spot', 'Human', 'Informatics', 'Information Retrieval', 'Information Systems', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Letters', 'Maintenance', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Ontology', 'Patient Care', 'Process', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Semantics', 'Source', 'System', 'Technology', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Update', 'Work', 'Writing', 'biomedical ontology', 'biomedical scientist', 'clinical care', 'data integration', 'data sharing', 'design', 'document outlines', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interoperability', 'knowledge base', 'natural language', 'next generation', 'ontology development', 'open source', 'quality assurance', 'software systems', 'tool']",NIGMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,564487,0.061252610306597746
"HIGH THROUGHPUT LITERATURE CURATION OF GENETIC REGULATION IN BACTERIAL MODELS DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The aim of this proposal is to implement a novel way of processing and accessing the vast detailed knowledge contained within collections of scientific publications on the regulation of transcription initiation in bacterial models. In princple, this model for processing and reading information and new knowledge is applicable to other biological domains, potentially benefiting any area of biomedical knowledge. It is certainly criticl to generate new strategies to cope with the ever-increasing amount of knowledge generated in genomics and in biomedical research at large. Improving the efficiency of the traditional high-quality manual curation of scientific publications will enable us also to expand the type of biological knowledge, beyond mechanisms and their elements in the genome, to start including their connections with larger regulated processes and eventually physiological properties of the cell. We will first implement the necessary technology to improve our curation by means of a computational system that has text mining capabilities for preprocessing the papers before a human expert curator identifies which sentences contain the information that is to be added to the database. Premarked options selected by the curators will accelerate their decisions. The accumulative precise mapping between sentences and curated knowledge will provide training sets for text mining technologies to improve their automatic extraction. The curator practices will become more efficient, enabling us to curate selected high-impact published reviews to place mechanisms into a rich context of their physiological processes and general biology. Another relevant component of our proposal is the improved modeling of regulated processes by means of new concepts in biology that capture larger collections of coregulated genes and their concatenated reactions. Starting from all interactions of a local regulator, coregulated regulators and their domain of action will be incorporated to construct the biobricks of complex decisions, as they are encoded in the genome. These are conceptual containers that capture the organization of knowledge to describe the genetic programming of cellular capabilities. These proposals will be formalized and proposed within an international consortium focused in enriching standard models or ontologies of gene regulation for use by the scientific community. Finally, a portal to navigate across all the sentences of a given corpus of a large number (more than 5,000) of related papers will be implemented. The different avenues of navigation will essentially use two technologies, one dealing with automatically generating simpler sentences from original sentences as input, and the other one with the classification of papers based on their theme or ontology. Their combination will enable a novel navigation reading system. If we achieve our aims, this project will give a proof-of-principle prototype with clearly innovative higher levels of large amounts of integrated knowledge. Future directions may adapt these concepts and methods to the biology of higher organisms, including humans. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Scientific knowledge reported within publications provides a wealth of knowledge that we barely capture in databases for genomics. Enhancing the effectiveness of the processing and representation of all this knowledge will change the way we encode our understanding of concatenated interactions that are organized into networks and processes governing cell behavior. Given the conservation in evolution of the nature of biological complexity, a better encoding of our understanding of a bacterial cell shall influence that of any other living organism.",HIGH THROUGHPUT LITERATURE CURATION OF GENETIC REGULATION IN BACTERIAL MODELS,9407024,R01GM110597,"['Area', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Model', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Effectiveness', 'Elements', 'Escherichia coli', 'Evolution', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Programming', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Growth', 'Human', 'International', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Letters', 'Linguistics', 'Literature', 'Manuals', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Ontology', 'Operon', 'Organism', 'Paper', 'Physiological', 'Physiological Processes', 'Planet Earth', 'Process', 'Property', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Reaction', 'Reading', 'Regulation', 'Regulon', 'Reporting', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Solid', 'Source', 'System', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Training', 'Transcription Initiation', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'base', 'cell behavior', 'digital', 'electronic book', 'experience', 'feeding', 'functional genomics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'member', 'microbial community', 'model organisms databases', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'promoter', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'software development', 'text searching', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'usability']",NIGMS,CENTER FOR GENOMIC SCIENCES,R01,2018,395628,0.015588267712223285
"Health Quest: Engaging Adolescents in Health Careers with Technology-Rich Personalized Learning Project Summary/Abstract Engaging adolescents' interest in pursuing careers in health science and the health professions offers significant promise for building our nation's healthcare and health research capacity. The goal of this project is to create Health Quest, an intelligent game-based learning environment that increases adolescents' knowledge of, interest in, and self-efficacy to pursue health science careers. Three specific aims will be accomplished by the project: 1. Design and develop Health Quest to engage adolescents' interest in the health sciences utilizing  personalized learning technologies that integrate the following components: (a) the Health Quest Career  Adventure Game, an intelligent game-based learning environment that leverages AI technologies to  create personalized health career adventures; (b) the Health Quest Student Discovery website, which  will feature interactive video interviews with health professionals about their biomedical, behavioral, and  clinical research careers; and (c) the Health Quest Teacher Resource Center website, which will provide  online professional development materials and in-class support for teachers' classroom implementation of  Health Quest. 2. Investigate the impact of Health Quest on adolescents' (1) knowledge of biomedical, behavioral, and  clinical research careers; (2) interest in biomedical, behavioral, and clinical research careers; and (3) self-  efficacy for pursuing biomedical, behavioral, and clinical research careers by conducting a matched  comparison study in middle school classes. ! 3.

"Washington University School of Medicine Undiagnosed Diseases Network Clinical Site 1.0 PROJECT SUMMARY The scientific premise of this application is that the individualized translational research process of the Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN) developed during Phase I is scalable and that its impact on patients, families, and disease discovery can be advanced and sustained by addition of a Clinical Site at Washington University School of Medicine (WUSM). WUSM represents a large academic medical center that is fully integrated with world-renowned basic science capabilities and demonstrated expertise in a gene first approach for patients with undiagnosed diseases. The highly collaborative clinical and biomedical research culture at WUSM promotes interactions within and across Departments, with institutional genomic, clinical, computational, and model system experts, and with colleagues regionally, nationally, and internationally. These interactions support recruitment, selection, evaluation, diagnosis discovery, and follow up of pediatric and adult patients with undiagnosed diseases through both established networks and individual referrals. Building on this infrastructure, WUSM faculty and staff will advance the success of the UDN in diagnosing and managing disease in undiagnosed patients by, first, using, refining, and improving protocols designed during Phase I of the UDN for comprehensive, timely clinical evaluations of 30 undiagnosed patients annually. Secondly, we will collect, securely store, and share standardized, high-quality clinical and laboratory data including genotyping, phenotyping, and documentation of environmental exposures and promote an integrated and collaborative community across the UDN and among laboratory and clinical investigators focused on defining the pathophysiology, cell biologic, and molecular mechanisms that cause these difficult to diagnose diseases. Thirdly, the WUSM UDN Clinical Site will propose a bioinformatics plan for leveraging institutional infrastructure and expertise to develop innovative strategies to improve discovery of pathogenic variants. Fourthly, the assessment, dissemination, outreach, and training plan will accelerate assessment and dissemination of data, protocols, consent materials, and methods, availability of educational and outreach materials for participants, clinicians, and other researchers, engagement of underrepresented minorities, and training for students, fellows, staff, and faculty in collaboration with WUSM’s Clinical and Translational Science Award infrastructure. Finally, WUSM will make a clear institutional commitment to maintain its Clinical Site, to adapt UDN Phase I practices for sustainability, to contribute to formation of a sustainable national UDN resource, and to adapt to unique needs and unexpected circumstances that may arise once Common Fund support ends in fiscal year 2022. 2.0 PROJECT NARRATIVE Undiagnosed diseases in children and adults represent frustrating and costly challenges for patients, families, physicians, and society. Building on established institutional infrastructure similar to the Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN), Washington University School of Medicine (WUSM) will establish a UDN Clinical Site to improve the level of diagnosis and care for patients with undiagnosed diseases, facilitate research into the etiology of undiagnosed diseases, and promote an integrated and collaborative community across multiple UDN Clinical Sites, Sequencing Cores, Model Organisms Screening Centers, and among laboratory and clinical investigators. Specifically, the WUSM UDN Clinical Site will annually recruit, select, evaluate, and follow 30 participants with disorders in any clinical specialty, adult and pediatric, provide comprehensive clinical evaluations that require <5 days and follow up, and participate in all UDN protocols, data management and sharing, and sustainability planning.",Washington University School of Medicine Undiagnosed Diseases Network Clinical Site,9593059,U01HG010215,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Accreditation', 'Adult', 'Animal Model', 'Basic Science', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biomedical Research', 'Businesses', 'Cells', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Clinical and Translational Science Awards', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer Simulation', 'Consent', 'DNA Sequencing Facility', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Documentation', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Expert Systems', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Family Physicians', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Geographic Locations', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'International', 'Laboratories', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Network-based', 'Participant', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Phase I Clinical Trials', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Review Committee', 'Secure', 'Societies', 'Standardization', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Washington', 'clinical practice', 'clinical research site', 'cost', 'data management', 'deep learning', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'exome sequencing', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'improved', 'innovation', 'medical schools', 'medical specialties', 'network models', 'operation', 'outreach', 'recruit', 'research clinical testing', 'screening', 'sequencing platform', 'student training', 'success', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NHGRI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,U01,2018,750000,-0.006028249953561744
"Crowd-Assisted Deep Learning (CrADLe) Digital Curation to Translate Big Data into Precision Medicine PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The NIH and other agencies are funding high-throughput genomics (‘omics) experiments that deposit digital samples of data into the public domain at breakneck speeds. This high-quality data measures the ‘omics of diseases, drugs, cell lines, model organisms, etc. across the complete gamut of experimental factors and conditions. The importance of these digital samples of data is further illustrated in linked peer-reviewed publications that demonstrate its scientific value. However, meta-data for digital samples is recorded as free text without biocuration necessary for in-depth downstream scientific inquiry.  Deep learning is revolutionary machine intelligence paradigm that allows for an algorithm to program itself thereby removing the need to explicitly specify rules or logic. Whereas physicians / scientists once needed to first understand a problem to program computers to solve it, deep learning algorithms optimally tune themselves to solve problems. Given enough example data to train on, deep learning machine intelligence outperform humans on a variety of tasks. Today, deep learning is state-of-the-art performance for image classification, and, most importantly for this proposal, for natural language processing.  This proposal is about engineering Crowd Assisted Deep Learning (CrADLe) machine intelligence to rapidly scale the digital curation of public digital samples. We will first use our NIH BD2K-funded Search Tag Analyze Resource for Gene Expression Omnibus (STARGEO.org) to crowd-source human annotation of open digital samples. We will then develop and train deep learning algorithms for STARGEO digital curation based on learning the associated free text meta-data each digital sample. Given the ongoing deluge of biomedical data in the public domain, CrADLe may perhaps be the only way to scale the digital curation towards a precision medicine ideal.  Finally, we will demonstrate the biological utility to leverage CrADLe for digital curation with two large- scale and independent molecular datasets in: 1) The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and 2) The Accelerating Medicines Partnership-Alzheimer’s Disease (AMP-AD). We posit that CrADLe digital curation of open samples will augment these two distinct disease projects with a host big data to fuel the discovery of potential biomarker and gene targets. Therefore, successful funding and completion of this work may greatly reduce the burden of disease on patients by enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of digital curation for biomedical big data. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal is about engineering Crowd Assisted Deep Learning (CrADLe) machine intelligence to rapidly scale the digital curation of public digital samples and directly translating this ‘omics data into useful biological inference. We will first use our NIH BD2K-funded Search Tag Analyze Resource for Gene Expression Omnibus (STARGEO.org) to crowd-source human annotation of open digital samples on which we will develop and train deep learning algorithms for STARGEO digital curation of free-text sample-level metadata.

"QuBBD: Deep Poisson Methods for Biomedical Time-to-Event and Longitude Data  The proposed research directly addresses the mission of NIH's BD2K initiative by developing appropriate tools to derive novel insights from available Big Data and by adapting sophisticated machine learning methodology to a framework familiar to biomedical researchers. This new methodology will be one of the first to enable use of machine learning techniques with time-to-event and continuous longitudinal outcome data, and will be the first such extension of the deep Poisson model. In essence, this undertaking builds the missing bridge between the need for advanced prognostic and predictive techniques among biomedical and clinical researchers and the unrealized potential of deep learning methods in the context of biomedical data collected longitudinally. To facilitate smooth adoption in clinical research, the results will be translated into terms familiar to applied practitioners through publications and well-described software packages. The application of the methodology developed will be illustrated using data from the NIH dbGAP repository, thereby further promoting the use of open access data sources. Optimal risk models are essential to realize the promise of precision medicine. This project develops novel machine learning methods for time-to-event and continuous longitudinal data to enhance risk model performance by exploiting correlations between large numbers of predictors and genetic data.

"MACE2K - Molecular And Clinical Extraction: A Natural Language Processing Tool for Personalized Medicine ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The velocity, variety, volume and veracity of data from relevant information sources make it extremely challenging for oncologists to collect and review pertinent data that can support routine personalized treatment for their patients. There is an urgent need to develop data wrangling approaches including Natural Language Processing and information retrieval methods to extract and curate personalized-therapy related publications and clinical trials. Once curated, the structured data can be used by biomedical researchers to generate novel scientific hypotheses, design new studies, obtain a better understanding of biological mechanisms of disease, perform meta-analyses, and create clinical decision support systems. There is an urgent need to develop improved search interfaces specific to the field of personalized therapy, including ways to display, rank, and save results by end users. While several database and web-based keyword search engine algorithms exist, there is a lack of tools that meet the unique challenges of personalized medicine. There is also an urgent need to develop software that allows for verification and validation of information extracted and ranked through computational methods using subject matter expertise to improve the gold standard corpus that can be used for biomedical research into personalized therapies.  To address these issues, we will build an innovative software stack (MACE2K) to adapt and extend widely tested Biocreative natural language processing (NLP) tools to automatically retrieve and pre-process targeted therapy information from clinicaltrials.gov, PubMed abstracts as well as open access articles, and conference proceedings. We will build an entity extraction cartridge to accurately parse gene mutations, translocations, gene expression, protein expression, and protein phosphorylation. A marker disambiguation cartridge will be built to assess for trial inclusion or exclusion criteria and to determine marker-related primary endpoints. We will include a ranking cartridge that uses the disambiguated information on markers, drugs and trials to provide a rigorous scoring of trials and studies according to their relevance for personalized medicine. A novel gamification cartridge will be built to allow subject matter experts to verify and validate the information corpus. Our research leverages National Cancer Institute's investments in several programs (many of which we are involved in) including the NCI drug dictionary, National Cancer Informatics Program (NCIP), I-SPY trials, and Center for cancer systems biology (CCSB) to efficiently accomplish our aims. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will develop new computational methods and software to retrieve targeted molecular and drug therapy information from multiple sources of big data including: clinicaltrials.gov, PubMed abstracts, open access articles, and conference proceedings. The software can be used by biomedical researchers to generate new hypotheses for research on personalized cancer treatment decisions based on enormous volumes of public data already in existence.

"Crowd Sourcing Labels From Electronic Medical Records to Enable Biomedical Research ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Supervised machine learning is a popular method that uses labeled training examples to predict future outcomes.  Unfortunately, supervised machine learning for biomedical research is often limited by a lack of labeled data.  Current methods to produce labeled data involve manual chart reviews that are laborious and do not scale with data creation rates.  This project aims to develop a framework to crowd source labeled data sets from electronic medical records by forming a crowd of clinical personnel labelers.  The construction of these labeled data sets will allow for new biomedical research studies that were previously infeasible to conduct.  There are numerous practical and theoretical challenges of developing a crowd sourcing platform for clinical data.  First, popular, public crowd sourcing platforms such as Amazon's Mechanical Turk are not suitable for medical record labeling as HIPAA makes clinical data sharing risky.  Second, the types of clinical questions that are amenable for crowd sourcing are not well understood.  Third, it is unclear if the clinical crowd can produce labels quickly and accurately.  Each of these challenges will be addressed in a separate Aim. As the first Aim of this project, the team will evaluate different clinical crowd sourcing architectures.  The architecture must leverage the scale of the crowd, while minimizing patient information exposure.  De-identification tools will be considered to scrub clinical notes t reduce information leakage.  Using this design, the team will extend a popular open source crowd sourcing tool, Pybossa, and release it to the public.  As the second Aim, the team will study the type, structure, topic and specificity of clinical prediction questions, and how these characteristics impact labeler quality.  Lastly, the team will evaluate the quality and accuracy of collected clinical crowd sourced data on two existing chart review problems to determine the platform's utility. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Traditionally, clinical prediction models rely on supervised machine learning algorithms to probabilistically predict clinical events using labeled medical records.  When data sets are small, manual chart reviews performed by clinical staff are sufficient to label each outcome; however, as data sets have scaled up and researchers aim to study larger cohorts, current manual approaches become intractable.  The goal of this proposal is to develop a framework to crowd source labeled data sets from electronic medical records to support prediction model development.",Crowd Sourcing Labels From Electronic Medical Records to Enable Biomedical Research,9270528,UH2CA203708,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Asthma', 'Biomedical Research', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collection', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Disclosure', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Extravasation', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'Human Resources', 'Incentives', 'Interview', 'Label', 'Machine Learning', 'Management Audit', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical Records', 'Medical Research', 'Medical Students', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nurses', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Privacy', 'Productivity', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Security', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Time', 'Training', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'computer science', 'crowdsourcing', 'data sharing', 'design', 'member', 'model development', 'open source', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'response', 'scale up', 'tool']",NCI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,UH2,2017,316000,-0.0019860590392063965
"THE XNAT IMAGING INFORMATICS PLATFORM PROJECT SUMMARY This proposal aims to continue the development of XNAT. XNAT is an imaging informatics platform designed to facilitate common management and productivity tasks for imaging and associated data. We will develop the next generation of XNAT technology to support the ongoing evolution of imaging research. Development will focus on modernizing and expanding the current system. In Aim 1, we will implement new web application infrastructure that includes a new archive file management system, a new event bus to manage cross-service orchestration and a new Javascript library to simplify user interface development. We will also implement new core services, including a Docker Container service, a dynamic scripting engine, and a global XNAT federation. In Aim 2, we will implement two innovative new capabilities that build on the services developed in Aim 1. The XNAT Publisher framework will streamline the process of data sharing by automating the creation and curation of data releases following best practices for data publication and stewardship. The XNAT Machine Learning framework will streamline the development and use of machine learning applications by integrating XNAT with the TensorFlow machine learning environment and implementing provenance and other monitoring features to help avoid the pitfalls that often plague machine learning efforts. For both Aim 1 and 2, all capabilities will be developed and evaluated in the context of real world scientific programs that are actively using the XNAT platform. In Aim 3, we will provide extensive support to the XNAT community, including training workshops, online documentation, discussion forums, and . These activities will be targeted at both XNAT users and developers. RELEVANCE Medical imaging is one of the key methods used by biomedical researchers to study human biology in health and disease. The imaging informatics platform described in this application will enable biomedical researchers to capture, analyze, and share imaging and related data. These capabilities address key bottlenecks in the pathway to discovering cures to complex diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, cancer, and heart disease.",THE XNAT IMAGING INFORMATICS PLATFORM,9384200,R01EB009352,"['Address', 'Administrator', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Architecture', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Automation', 'Biomedical Research', 'Brain', 'Cardiology', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Documentation', 'Educational workshop', 'Ensure', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heart Diseases', 'Human', 'Human Biology', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Instruction', 'Internet', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Neurosciences', 'Newsletter', 'Optics', 'Paper', 'Pathway interactions', 'Peer Review', 'Persons', 'Plague', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Security', 'Services', 'System', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Validation', 'base', 'biomedical resource', 'computer framework', 'computing resources', 'data sharing', 'design', 'distributed data', 'educational atmosphere', 'hackathon', 'imaging informatics', 'imaging program', 'improved', 'innovation', 'next generation', 'online tutorial', 'open source', 'outreach program', 'pre-clinical', 'programs', 'skills', 'symposium', 'tool', 'virtual', 'web app']",NIBIB,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,685783,-0.004649271000496915
"SWIFT-ActiveScreener: research and development of an intelligent web-based document screening system Project Summary More than 4,000 systematic reviews are performed each year in the fields of environmental health and evidence- based medicine, with each review requiring, on average, between six months to one year of effort to complete. In order to remain accurate, systematic reviews require regular updates after their initial publication, with most reviews out of date within five years. In the screening phase of systematic review, researchers use detailed inclusion/exclusion criteria to decide whether each article in a set of candidate citations is relevant to the research question under consideration. For each article considered, a researcher reads the title and abstract and evaluates its content with respect to the prespecified criteria. A typical review may require screening thousands or tens of thousands of articles in this manner. Under the assumption that it takes a skilled reviewer 30-90 seconds, on average, to screen a single abstract, dual-screening a set of 10,000 abstracts may require between 150 to 500 hours of labor. We have shown in previous work that automated machine learning methods for article prioritization can reduce by more than 50% the human effort required to screen articles for inclusion in a systematic review. Recently, we have further extended these methods and packaged them into a web-based, collaborative systematic review software application called SWIFT-Active Screener. Active Screener has been used successfully to reduce the effort required to screen articles for systematic reviews conducted at a variety of organizations including the National Institute of Environmental Health Science (NIEHS), the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), The Endocrine Disruption Exchange (TEDX), and the Evidence Based Toxicology Collaboration (EBTC). These early adopters have provided us with an abundance of useful data and user feedback, and we have identified several areas where we can continue to improve our methods and software. Our goal for the current proposal is to conduct additional research and development to make significant improvements to SWIFT-Active Screener, including several innovations that will be necessary for commercial success. The research we propose encompasses three specific aims: (1) Investigate several improvements to statistical algorithms used for article prioritization and recall estimation. We will explore promising avenues for further improving the performance of our existing algorithms and address critical technical issues that limit the applicability of our current methods (Aim 1 – Improved Statistical Models). (2) Explore ways in which we can improve our models and methods to handle the scenario in which an existing systematic review is updated with new data several years after its initial publication (Aim 2 – New Methods for Systematic Review Updates). (3) Investigate several questions related to scaling the system to support hundreds to thousands of simultaneous screeners (Aim 3 - Software Engineering for Scalability, Usability and Full Text Extraction). Project Narrative Systematic review is a formal process used widely in evidence-based medicine and environmental health research to identify, assess, and integrate the primary scientific literature with the goal of answering a specific, targeted question in pursuit of the current scientific consensus. By conducting research and development to build a web-based, collaborative systematic review software application that uses machine learning to prioritize documents for screening, we will make an important contribution toward ongoing efforts to automate systematic review. These efforts will serve to make systematic reviews both more efficient to produce and less expensive to maintain, a result which will greatly accelerate the process by which scientific consensus is obtained in a variety of medical and health-related disciplines having great public significance.",SWIFT-ActiveScreener: research and development of an intelligent web-based document screening system,9467160,R43ES029001,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Collaborations', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Discipline', 'Endocrine disruption', 'Environmental Health', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Exclusion Criteria', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'Online Systems', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Software Engineering', 'Statistical Algorithm', 'Statistical Models', 'System', 'Text', 'Toxicology', 'United States Department of Agriculture', 'United States Environmental Protection Agency', 'Update', 'Work', 'evidence base', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'research and development', 'screening', 'success', 'systematic review', 'usability']",NIEHS,"SCIOME, LLC",R43,2017,211900,-0.004527330252921584
"BECKON - Block Estimate Chain: creating Knowledge ON demand & protecting privacy 7. Project Summary/Abstract With the wide adoption of electronic health record systems, cross-institutional genomic medicine predictive modeling is becoming increasingly important, and have the potential to enable generalizable models to accelerate research and facilitate quality improvement initiatives. For example, understanding whether a particular variable has clinical significance depends on a variety of factors, one important one being statistically significant associations between the variant and clinical phenotypes. Multivariate models that predict predisposition to disease or outcomes after receiving certain therapeutic agents can help propel genomic medicine into mainstream clinical care. However, most existing privacy-preserving machine learning methods that have been used to build predictive models given clinical data are based on centralized architecture, which presents security and robustness vulnerabilities such as single-point-of-failure. In this proposal, we will develop novel methods for decentralized privacy-preserving genomic medicine predictive modeling, which can advance comparative effectiveness research, biomedical discovery, and patient-care. Our first aim is to develop a predictive modeling framework on private Blockchain networks. This aim relies on the Blockchain technology and consensus protocols, as well as the online and batch machine learning algorithms, to provide an open-source Blockchain-based privacy-preserving predictive modeling library for further Blockchain-related studies and applications. We will characterize settings in which Blockchain technology offers advances over current technologies. The second aim is to develop a Blockchain-based privacy-preserving genomic medicine modeling architecture for real-world clinical data research networks. These aims are devoted to the mission of the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) to develop biomedical technologies with application domain of genomics and healthcare. The NIH Pathway to Independence Award provides a great opportunity for the applicant to complement his computer science background with biomedical knowledge, and specialized training in machine learning and knowledge-based systems. It will also allow him to investigate new techniques to advance genomic and healthcare privacy protection. The success of the proposed project will help his long-term career goal of obtaining a faculty position at a biomedical informatics program at a major US research university and conduct independently funded research in the field of decentralized privacy-preserving computation. 8. Project Narrative The proposed research will develop practical methods to support privacy-preserving genomic and healthcare predictive modeling, and build innovations based on Blockchain technology for secure and robust machine learning training processes. The development of such privacy technology may increase public trust in research and quality improvement.

"The Center for Predictive Computational Phenotyping-1 Overall DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The biomedical sciences are being radically transformed by advances in our ability to monitor, record, store and integrate information characterizing human biology and health at scales that range from individual molecules to large populations of subjects. This wealth of information has the potential to substantially advance both our understanding of human biology and our ability to improve human health. Perhaps the most central and general approach for exploiting biomedical data is to use methods from machine learning and statistical modeling to infer predictive models. Such models take as input observable data representing some object of interest, and produce as output a prediction about a particular, unobservable property of the object. This approach has proven to be of high value for a wide range of biomedical tasks, but numerous significant challenges remain to be solved in order for the full potential of predictive modeling to be realized.  To address these challenges, we propose to establish The Center for Predictive Computational Phenotyping (CPCP). Our proposed center will focus on a broad range of problems that can be cast as computational phenotyping. Although some phenotypes are easily measured and interpreted, and are available in an accessible format, a wide range of scientifically and clinically important phenotypes do not satisfy these criteria. In such cases, computational phenotyping methods are required either to (i) extract a relevant  phenotype from a complex data source or collection of heterogeneous data sources, (ii) predict clinically  important phenotypes before they are exhibited, or (iii) do both in the same application. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We will develop innovative new approaches and tools that are able to discover, and make crucial inferences with large data sets that include molecular profiles, medical images, electronic health records, population-level data, and various combinations of these and other data types. These approaches will significantly advance the state of the art in wide range of biological and clinical investigations, such as predicting which patients are most at risk for breast cancer, heart attacks and severe blood clots.",The Center for Predictive Computational Phenotyping-1 Overall,9266344,U54AI117924,"['Address', 'Biological', 'Blood coagulation', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'General Population', 'Generations', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Greek', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Biology', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Organism', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Property', 'Regulatory Element', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Statistical Algorithm', 'Statistical Models', 'Time', 'Training Activity', 'biomedical scientist', 'clinical investigation', 'clinical predictors', 'education research', 'graduate student', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'novel strategies', 'outcome forecast', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'undergraduate student']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,U54,2017,229691,0.010621463666318698
"Unifying Templates, Ontologies and Tools to Achieve Effective Annotation of Bioassay Protocols Project Summary Biological assays are the foundation for developing chemical probes and drugs, but new Big Data approaches – which have revolutionized other areas of biomedical science – have not yet advanced this early step of biomedical research: analysis of assay data. The obstacle is that scientists specify their assays through text descriptions written in scientific English, which need to be translated into standardized annotations readable by computers. This lack of standardized and machine-readable assay descriptions is a major impediment to manage, find, aggregate, compare, re-use, and learn from the ever-growing corpus of assays (e.g., >1.2 million in PubChem). Thus, there is a critical need for better annotation and curation tools for drug discovery assays. However, the process to go from a simple text protocol to highly detailed machine-readable semantic annotations is not trivial. Multiple tools and technologies are required: ontologies or the structured controlled vocabularies; templates that map specific vocabularies to properties that are to be captured; and software tools to actually apply these ontologies to a given text. Currently, each of these exists in isolation; yet, a bottleneck in any one tool or technology, or a gap between the different pieces, disrupts the overall process, resulting in poor or no annotation of the datasets. Here we propose a project to combine and integrate these three technologies (which are also the core competencies of the three groups collaborating on this proposal). We will deliver a novel, comprehensive, user-friendly data annotation and curation system that is highly interconnected, encompassing the full cycle, and real-world practice, of required tasks and decisions, by all parties within the `bioassay annotation ecosystem' (researchers performing curation, dedicated curators, IT specialists, ontology owners, and librarians/repositories). The alliance between academic and commercial collaborators, who already work together, will greatly benefit the project and minimize execution risk. Our specific aims are to: (1) Develop a bioassay-specific template editor and templates by adopting the Stanford (Center for Expanded Data Annotation and Retrieval, CEDAR) data model to the machine learning-based curation tool BioAssay Express, to exploit the broad functionality of its data structures, tools and interfaces; (2) Define and create an ontology update process and tool (`OntoloBridge') to support rapid feedback between curators/users and ontology experts and enable semi-automated incorporation of suggestions for updates to existing published ontologies; (3) Develop new tools to export annotated data into public repositories such as PubChem; and (4) Evaluate our solution across diverse audiences (pharma, academia, repositories). The system will improve bioassay curation efficiency, quality, and effectiveness, enabling scientists to generate standardized annotations for their experiments to make these data FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable). We envision this suite of tools will encourage annotation earlier in the data lifecycle while still supporting annotation at later stages (e.g., submission to repositories or to journals). Project Narrative Biological assays are the foundation for developing drugs, but new Big Data approaches – which have revolu- tionized other areas of biomedical science – have not yet advanced this early step of biomedical research: analysis of assay data. The obstacle is that assays are written in scientific English, which need to be translated into standardized descriptions readable by computers. This lack of machine-readable annotations is a major impediment to manage, find, compare, re-use, and learn from the millions of assays. This project will develop a formal process and integrated tools to support the complete cycle of tasks and decisions required for bioassay annotation, enabling expedited (and more cost-effective) drug discovery.","Unifying Templates, Ontologies and Tools to Achieve Effective Annotation of Bioassay Protocols",9398728,U01LM012630,"['Academia', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Area', 'Big Data', 'Biological Assay', 'Biomedical Research', 'Chemicals', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Competence', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Controlled Vocabulary', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Development', 'Ecosystem', 'Effectiveness', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Exercise', 'FAIR principles', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Hour', 'Journals', 'Learning', 'Librarians', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Ontology', 'Output', 'Participant', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Polishes', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'PubChem', 'Publishing', 'Readability', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrieval', 'Risk', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Semantics', 'Site', 'Software Engineering', 'Software Tools', 'Specialist', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Suggestion', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Tweens', 'Update', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'base', 'cost effective', 'data modeling', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'drug mechanism', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'improved functioning', 'in vivo', 'informatics training', 'novel', 'open source', 'practical application', 'predictive modeling', 'repository', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,U01,2017,546372,-0.011741894514910712
"Boosting the Translational Impact of Scientific Competitions by Ensemble Learning ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): ""Big data"" such as those arising from sequencing, imaging, genomics and other emerging technologies are playing a critical role in modern biology and medicine. The generation of hypotheses about biological processes and disease mechanisms is now increasingly being driven by the production and analysis of large and complex datasets. Advanced computational methods have been developed for the robust analysis of these datasets, and the growth in number and sophistication of these methods has closely tracked the growth in volume and complexity of biomedical data. In such a crowded environment of diverse computational methods and data, it is difficult to judge how generalizable the performance of these methods is from one setting to another. Crowdsourcing-based scientific competitions, or challenges, have now become popular mechanisms for the rigorous, blinded and unbiased evaluation of the performance of these methods and the identification of best-performing methods for biomedical problems. However, despite the benefits of these challenges to the biomedical research enterprise, the impact of their findings has been remarkably limited in laboratory and clinical settings. This is likely due to two important aspects of current challenges: (i) their over-emphasis on identifying the ""best"" solutions rather than tryig to comprehensively assimilate the knowledge embedded in all the submitted solutions, and (ii) the absence of a stable channel of communication and collaboration between problem and solution providers due to a lack of sufficient incentives to do so. The aim of this project is to boost the translational impact of scientific challenges through a combination of novel machine learning methods, development of novel scalable software and unique collaborations with disease experts to ensure the effective translation of knowledge accrued in challenges to real clinical settings and practice. These novel methods and software are designed to effectively assimilate the knowledge embedded in all the submissions to challenges into ""ensemble"" solutions. In a first of its kind effort, the ensemble solutions derived from disease-focused challenges under the DREAM project will be brought directly to scientists and clinicians that are experts in these disease areas. Initial effort in this project will focus on active DREAM challenges aiming at the accurate prediction of drug response and clinical outcomes respectively in Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) and Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML). Both these diseases are difficult to treat and thus they pose major medical and public health concerns. In collaboration with RA and AML experts, the ensemble solutions learnt in these challenges will be validated in independent patient cohorts and carefully designed clinical studies. This second-level validation is essential to judge the clinical applicability of any method, but is rarely done As the methodology is general, similar efforts will be made for other diseases in later stages of the project. Overall, using a smart combination of crowdsourcing-based challenges and computational methods and software, we aim to demonstrate a unique pathway for studying and treating disease by truly leveraging the ""wisdom of the crowds"". PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Crowdsourcing-based scientific competitions, or challenges, have become a popular mechanism to identify innovative solutions to complex biomedical problems. However, the collective effort of all the challenge participants has been under utilized, and the overall impact on actual clinical and laboratory practice has been remarkably limited. Using novel computational methods and novel ""big data""-friendly software implementation, we plan to demonstrate how biomedical challenges, combined with our approach, can influence clinical practice in Acute Myeloid Leukemia and Rheumatoid Arthritis, as well as rigorously validate our approach.",Boosting the Translational Impact of Scientific Competitions by Ensemble Learning,9251828,R01GM114434,"['Acute Myelocytic Leukemia', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Advanced Development', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Blinded', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Explosion', 'Generations', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Heterogeneity', 'High Performance Computing', 'Image', 'Incentives', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modernization', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Problem Solving', 'Production', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Research Personnel', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Role', 'Running', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Software Design', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'computer science', 'crowdsourcing', 'design', 'innovation', 'interest', 'interoperability', 'knowledge translation', 'learning progression', 'method development', 'novel', 'open source', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'stem', 'tool', 'translational impact']",NIGMS,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2017,428512,-0.021715013275317843

"Biomedical Data Translator Technical Feasibility Assessment and Architecture Design New technologies afford the acquisition of dense “data clouds” of individual humans. However, heterogeneity, dimensionality and multi-scale nature of such data (genomes, transcriptomes, clinical variables, etc.) pose a new challenge: How can one query such dense data clouds of mixed data as an integrated set (as opposed to variable by variable) against multiple knowledge bases, and translate the joint molecular information into the clinical realm? Current lexical mapping and brute-force data mining seek to make heterogeneous data interoperable and accessible but their output is fragmented and requires expertise to assemble into coherent actionable information. We propose DeepTranslate, an innovative approach that incorporates the known actual physical organization of biological entities that are the substrate of pathogenesis into (i) networks (data graphs) and (ii) hierarchies of concepts that span the multiscale space from molecule to clinic. Organizing data sources along such natural structures will allow translation of burgeoning high-dimensional data sets into concepts familiar to clinicians, while capturing mechanistic relationships. DeepTranslate will take a hybrid approach to learn and organize its content from both (i) existing generic comprehensive knowledge sources (GO, KEGG, IDC, etc.) and (ii) newly measured instances of individual data clouds from two demonstration projects: (1) ISB’s Pioneer 100 and (2) St. Jude Lifetime cancer survivors. We will focus on diabetes as test case. These two studies cover a deep biological scale-space and thus can test the full extent of the multiscale capacity of DeepTranslate in a focused application. 1. TYPES OF RESEARCH QUESTION ENABLED. How can a clinician find out that the dozens of “out of range” variables observed in a patient’s data cloud, form a connected set with respect to pathophysiology pathways, from gene to clinical variable? How can the high-dimensional data of studies that measure for each individual 100+ data points of various types (“personal data clouds”) be analyzed as one set in an integrated fashion (as opposed to variable by variable) against existing knowledge bases and also be used to improve the databases? DeepTranslate addresses these two types of questions and thereby will accelerate translation of future personal data clouds into (A) care decisions and (B) hypotheses on new disease mechanisms / treatments, thereby benefiting providers as well as researchers. 2. USE OF EXPERTISE AND RESOURCES. ■ ISB: pioneer in personalized, big-data driven medicine (Demo Project 1); biomedical content expertise; multiscale omics and molecular pathogenesis, big data analysis, housing of databases for public access; query engine designs, GUI. ■ UCSD: leader in biomedical data integration; automated assembly of molecular and clinical data into hierarchical structures; translation between data types ■ U Montreal: biomedical database curation from literature and construction of gene/protein/drug interaction networks; machine learning, open resource database ■ St Jude CRH: Cancer monitoring Demo Project 2, cancer patient data analytics. 3. POTENTIAL DATA AND INFRASTRUCTURE CHALLENGES. (a) Existing comprehensive clinical data sources are not uniform and not explicitly based on biological networks; cross-mapping is being performed at NLM based on lexical relationships: HPO (phenotypes) vs. SNOMED CT (for EMR) vs. IDC or Merck Manual (for diseases). Careful selection of these sources in close collaboration with NLM is needed. (b) Existing molecular pathway databases are static, based on averages of heterogeneous non-stratified populations, while the newly measured high-dimensional data clouds are varied due to intra-individual temporal fluctuation and inter-individual variation. How this will affect building of ontotypes in our hybrid approach, and how large cohorts of data clouds must be to offer statistical power is yet to be determined. Our two Demonstration Projects with their uniquely deep (high-dimensional and multiscale) data in cohorts of limited but growing size are thus crucial first steps in a long journey of collective learning in the TRANSLATOR community. n/a",Biomedical Data Translator Technical Feasibility Assessment and Architecture Design,9486059,OT3TR002026,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Architecture', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'CRH gene', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Survivor', 'Caring', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Drug Interactions', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gene Proteins', 'Generic Drugs', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Graph', 'Heterogeneity', 'Housing', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Output', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Provider', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'SNOMED Clinical Terms', 'Saint Jude Children&apos', 's Research Hospital', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'base', 'cohort', 'data integration', 'data mining', 'design', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'inter-individual variation', 'interoperability', 'knowledge base', 'lexical', 'molecular assembly/self assembly', 'new technology', 'transcriptome']",NCATS,INSTITUTE FOR SYSTEMS BIOLOGY,OT3,2017,1408263,-0.013377508799106987
"Developing and applying information extraction resources and technology to create DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Building on 8 years of highly productive work in technology development that included the creation of the Colorado Richly Annotated Full Text corpus (CRAFT), we hypothesize that text mining resources and methods are approaching the level of maturity required to productively process a significant proportion of the full text biomedical literature to create a well-represented formal knowledge base of molecular biology. We propose a detailed, integrated plan to achieve this long-standing goal. Success in this effort will make possible a transformative new way for the biomedical research community to identify access and integrate existing knowledge, breaking down disciplinary boundaries and other silos that have kept scientists from fully exploiting relevant prior results in their research.      Our successes in the prior funding period broadened the applicability of biomedical concept identification systems to a much wider set of tasks, demonstrating the ability to target multiple community-curated ontologies in text mining, and generate scientifically significant insights from the results. The proposed work would take advantage of the resources we produced to transcend several of the limitations of previous efforts. We propose innovative new approaches to formal knowledge representation and to characterizing relationships between textual elements and semantic content. We will design, implement and evaluate computational systems that have the potential to transform enormous text collections into semantically rich, logic-based, standards-compliant, formal representations of biomedical knowledge with clearly identified provenance. The resulting representations will express complex assertions about a very wide range of entities, processes, qualities, and, most importantly, their specific relationships with one another.

"An Intelligent Concept Agent for Assisting with the Application of Metadata PROJECT ABSTRACT Biomedical investigators are generating increasing amounts of complex and diverse data. This data varies tremendously, from genome sequences through phenotypic measurements and imaging data. If researchers and data scientists can tap into this data effectively, then we can gain insights into disease mechanisms and how to tackle them. However, the main stumbling block is that it is increasingly hard to find and integrate the relevant datasets due to the lack of sufficient metadata. A researcher studying Crohn's disease may miss a crucial dataset on how certain microbial communities affect gut histology due to the lack of descriptive tags on the data. Currently, applying metadata is difficult, time-consuming and error prone due to the vast sea of confusing and overlapping standards for each datatype. Often specialized `data wranglers' are employed to apply metadata, but even these experts are hindered by lack of good tools. Here we propose to develop an intelligent agent that researchers and data wranglers can use to assist them apply metadata. The agent is based around a personalized dashboard of metadata elements that can be collected from multiple specialized portals, as well as sites such as Wikipedia. These elements can be coupled with classifiers that can be used to self-identify datasets to which they may be relevant, making the selection of appropriate vocabularies easier for researchers. We will deploy the system for a number of targeted use cases, including annotation of the National Center for Biomedical Information Bio-Samples repository, and annotation of images within the Figshare repository. Project Narrative Biomedical data is being generated at an increasing rate, and it is becoming increasingly difficult for researchers to be able to locate and effectively operate over this data, which has negative impacts on the rate of new discoveries. One solution is to attach metadata (data about data) onto all information generated in a research project, but application of metadata is currently difficult and time consuming due to the diverse range of standards on offer, typically requiring the expertise of trained data wranglers. Here we propose to develop an intelligent concept assistant that will allow researchers to generate and share sets of metadata elements relevant to their project, and will use machine learning techniques to automatically apply this to data.",An Intelligent Concept Agent for Assisting with the Application of Metadata,9357656,U01HG009453,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Crohn&apos', 's disease', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Disease', 'Distributed Systems', 'Ecosystem', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Fostering', 'Frustration', 'Genome', 'Histology', 'Human Microbiome', 'Image', 'Intelligence', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Metadata', 'Ontology', 'Phenotype', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Sampling', 'Sea', 'Site', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Suggestion', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Vision', 'Vocabulary', 'base', 'dashboard', 'improved', 'insight', 'microbial community', 'peer', 'prospective', 'repository', 'social', 'tool', 'transcriptomics']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIF-LAWRENC BERKELEY LAB,U01,2017,572778,0.01672930206184768
"Sci-Score, a tool to support rigor and transparency guidelines Project Summary While  standards  in  reporting  of  scientific  methods  are  absolutely  critical  to  producing  reproducible  science,  meeting  such  standards  is  difficult.  Checklists  and  instructions  are  tough  to  follow  often  resulting  in  low  and inconsistent  compliance.  Scientific  journals  and  societies  as  well  as  the  National  Institutes  of  Health  are  now actively proposing general guidelines to address reproducibility issues, particularly in the reporting of methods  (e.g.,  http://www.cell.com/star-­methods),  but  the  trickier  part  will  be  to  train  the  biomedical  community  to  use these standards to effectively improve how scientific methods are communicated. To support new standards in methods reporting, specifically the RRID standard for Rigor and Transparency of  Key Biological Resources, we propose to build Sci-­Score a text mining based tool suite to help authors meet the  standard.  Sci-­Score  will  provide  an  automated  check  on  compliance  with  the  RRID  standard  already  implemented by over 100 journals including Cell, Journal of Neuroscience, and eLife. The innovation behind Sci-­ score is the provision of a score, which can be obtained by individual investigators, which reflects a numerical  validation of the quality of their methods reporting. We posit that the score will serve as a tool that investigators  and journals can use to compete with themselves and each other, or in the very least allow them to see how  close they are to the average in meeting quality requirements.   Recently, our group has developed a text mining algorithm that has now been successfully been used to detect software tools and databases from the SciCrunch Registry in published papers. Digital tools are one of four resource types that the RRID standard identifies. We propose to extend this approach to the other types of entities: antibodies, cell lines and model organisms. Resource identification along with other quality metrics twill be used to train an algorithm to score the overall quality of the methods document. If successful, the tool could be used by editors, reviewers, and investigators to improve the number of RRIDs, therefore the quality of descriptors of key biological resources in published papers. This SBIR project will build a set of algorithms similar to the resource finding pipeline and develop it into an industrial robust and reconfigurable software system. Our Phase I specific aims include to 1) creating gold sets of data for each resource type and training a set of algorithms for each resource type; 2) designing and evaluating the scoring system; 3) designing and evaluating a report generating system based on the previous aims.

"Semantic Literature Annotation and Integrative Panomics Analysis for PTM-Disease Knowledge Network Discovery PROJECT SUMMARY Protein post-translational modification (PTM) plays a critical role in many diseases; however, critical gaps remain in research infrastructure for global analysis of PTMs. Key PTM information concerning enzyme- substrate relationships, regulation of PTM enzymes, PTM cross-talk, and functional consequences of PTM remains buried in the scientific literature. Meanwhile, while high-throughput panomics (genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, PTM proteomic) data offer an unprecedented opportunity for the discovery of PTM-disease relationships, the data must be analyzed in an integrated and easily accessible knowledge framework in order for researchers and clinicians to gain a molecular understanding of disease. The goal of this application is to develop a collaborative knowledge environment for semantic annotation of scientific literature and integrative panomics analysis for PTM-disease knowledge discovery in precision medicine. We propose to connect PTM information from literature mining and curated databases in a knowledge resource on an ontological framework that supports analysis of panomics data in the context of PTM networks. To broaden impact and foster collaborative development, our resource will be FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) and interoperable with community standards.  The specific aims are: (i) develop a novel NLP (natural language processing) system for full-scale literature mining and PTM-disease knowledge extraction; (ii) develop a PTM knowledge resource for integrative panomics analysis and network discovery; and (iii) provide a FAIR collaborative environment for scalable semantic annotation and knowledge integration. The proposed system will build upon the NLP technologies and text mining tools already developed by our team and the bioinformatics infrastructure at the Protein Information Resource (PIR). The iPTMnet web portal will allow searching, browsing, visualization and analysis of PTM networks and PTM-related mutations in conjunction with user-supplied omics data, including panomics data from major national initiatives. Use scenarios will include identification of disease-driving genetic variants and analysis of cellular responses to kinase inhibitors. Our PTM knowledgebase will be disseminated with an RDF triple-store and a SPARQL endpoint for semantic queries, while our text mining tools and full-scale literature mining results will be disseminated in the BioC community standard for seamless integration to other text mining pipelines. To engage the community semantic annotation of scientific literature, we will host a hackathon to develop tools to expose BioC-annotated literature corpora to the semantic web, as well as an annotation jamboree to explore tagging of scientific text with precise ontological terms. This project will thus offer a unique research resource for PTM-disease network discovery as well as an integrable collaborative knowledge framework to support Big Data to Knowledge in precision medicine. PROJECT NARRATIVE Precision medicine requires a detailed understanding of the molecular events that are disrupted in disease, including changes in protein post-translational modifications (PTM) that are hallmarks of many diseases. The proposed resource will support analysis of genomic-scale data for exploring PTM-disease networks and PTM-related mutations, as well as knowledge dissemination on the semantic web. These combined efforts will accelerate basic understanding of disease processes and discovery of diagnostic targets and more effective individualized therapies.",Semantic Literature Annotation and Integrative Panomics Analysis for PTM-Disease Knowledge Network Discovery,9326315,U01GM120953,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Automobile Driving', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Controlled Vocabulary', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Drug resistance', 'Educational workshop', 'Environment', 'Enzymes', 'Europe', 'Event', 'FAIR principles', 'Fostering', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Hybrids', 'Imagery', 'Information Resources', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Knowledge Extraction', 'Length', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'MicroRNAs', 'Mining', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Ontology', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Phosphorylation', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Play', 'Post Translational Modification Analysis', 'Post-Translational Modification Site', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Post-Translational Regulation', 'Process', 'Protein Family', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'PubMed', 'Publications', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Semantics', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Site', 'System', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Tissues', 'Translational Research', 'Variant', 'cell type', 'collaborative environment', 'computer based Semantic Analysis', 'enzyme substrate', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic variant', 'hackathon', 'indexing', 'information organization', 'innovation', 'interoperability', 'kinase inhibitor', 'knowledge base', 'knowledge integration', 'novel', 'precision medicine', 'protein complex', 'protein protein interaction', 'response', 'system architecture', 'text searching', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'web portal', 'web services', 'web site']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF DELAWARE,U01,2017,370434,0.015171083373140675
"COINSTAC: decentralized, scalable analysis of loosely coupled data ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     The brain imaging community is greatly benefiting from extensive data sharing efforts currently underway5,10. However, there is a significant gap in existing strategies which focus on anonymized, post-hoc sharing of either 1) full raw or preprocessed data [in the case of open studies] or 2) manually computed summary measures [such as hippocampal volume11, in the case of closed (or not yet shared) studies] which we propose to address. Current approaches to data sharing often include significant logistical hurdles both for the investigator sharing the dat as well as for the individual requesting the data (e.g. often times multiple data sharing agreements and approvals are required from US and international institutions). This needs to change, so that the scientific community becomes a venue where data can be collected, managed, widely shared and analyzed while also opening up access to the (many) data sets which are not currently available (see recent overview on this from our group2).    The large amount of existing data requires an approach that can analyze data in a distributed way while also leaving control of the source data with the individual investigator; this motivates  dynamic, decentralized way of approaching large scale analyses. We are proposing a peer-to-peer system called the Collaborative Informatics and Neuroimaging Suite Toolkit for Anonymous Computation (COINSTAC). The system will provide an independent, open, no-strings-attached tool that performs analysis on datasets distributed across different locations. Thus, the step of actually aggregating data can be avoided, while the strength of large-scale analyses can be retained. To achieve this, in Aim 1, the uniform data interfaces that we propose will make it easy to share and cooperate. Robust and novel quality assurance and replicability tools will also be incorporated. Collaboration and data sharing will be done through forming temporary (need and project-based) virtual clusters of studies performing automatically generated local computation on their respective data and aggregating statistics in global inference procedures. The communal organization will provide a continuous stream of large scale projects that can be formed and completed without the need of creating new rigid organizations or project-oriented storage vaults. In Aim 2, we develop, evaluate, and incorporate privacy-preserving algorithms to ensure that the data used are not re-identifiable even with multiple re-uses. We also will develop advanced distributed and privacy preserving approaches for several key multivariate families of algorithms (general linear model, matrix factorization [e.g. independent component analysis], classification) to estimate intrinsic networks and perform data fusion. Finally, in Aim 3, we will demonstrate the utility of this approach in a proof of concept study through distributed analyses of substance abuse datasets across national and international venues with multiple imaging modalities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Hundreds of millions of dollars have been spent to collect human neuroimaging data for clinical and research purposes, many of which don't have data sharing agreements or collect sensitive data which are not easily shared, such as genetics. Opportunities for large scale aggregated analyses to infer health-relevant facts create new challenges in protecting the privacy of individuals' data. Open sharing of raw data, though desirable from the research perspective, and growing rapidly, is not a good solution for a large number of datasets which have additional privacy risks or IRB concerns. The COINSTAC solution we are proposing will capture this 'missing data' and allow for pooling of both open and 'closed' repositories by developing privacy preserving versions of widely-used algorithms and incorporating within an easy-to-use platform which enables distributed computation. In addition, COINSTAC will accelerate research on both open and closed data by offering a distributed computational solution for a large toolkit of widely used algorithms.","COINSTAC: decentralized, scalable analysis of loosely coupled data",9268713,R01DA040487,"['AODD relapse', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Agreement', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Brain imaging', 'Classification', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Consent Forms', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Decentralization', 'Development', 'Ensure', 'Family', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Health', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'International', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Letters', 'Linear Models', 'Location', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Movement', 'Paper', 'Plant Roots', 'Poaceae', 'Population', 'Privacy', 'Privatization', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Science', 'Site', 'Stream', 'Substance abuse problem', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'base', 'commune', 'computer framework', 'computing resources', 'connectome', 'cost', 'data sharing', 'distributed data', 'flexibility', 'imaging genetics', 'imaging modality', 'independent component analysis', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'open data', 'peer', 'public health relevance', 'quality assurance', 'repository', 'statistics', 'tool', 'virtual']",NIDA,THE MIND RESEARCH NETWORK,R01,2017,655080,0.004430774485571943

"Protege: A Knowledge-Engineering Environment for Advancing Biomedical Sciences Project Abstract The engineering of ontologies that define the entities in an application area and the relationships among them has become essential for modern work in biomedicine. Ontologies help both humans and computers to manage burgeoning numbers of data. The need to annotate, retrieve, and integrate high- throughput data sets, to process natural language, and to build systems for decision support has set many communities of investigators to work building large ontologies. The Protégé system has become an indispensable open-source resource for an enormous international community of scientists—supporting the development, maintenance, and use of ontologies and electronic knowledge bases by biomedical investigators everywhere. The number of registered Protégé users has grown from 3,500 in 2002 to more than 300,000 users as of this writing. The widespread use of ontologies in biomedicine and the availability of tools, such as Protégé, have taken the biomedical field forward to a new set of challenges that current technology has not been designed to address: Biomedical ontologies have grown in size and scope, and their creation, maintenance and quality assurance have become particularly effort-intensive and error-prone. In this proposal, we will develop new methods and tools that will significantly aid biomedical researchers in easily creating and testing biomedical ontologies throughout their lifecycle. Our plan entails four specific aims. First, we will develop methods and tools to allow biomedical scientist to easily create ontologies directly from their source documents, such as spreadsheets, tab indented hierarchies, and document outlines. Second, we will provide the methods and tools to allow biomedical scientist to identify potential “hot spots” in their ontologies that might affect their quality. Third, we will implement a comprehensive, automated testing framework for ontologies that will assist biomedical researchers in performing ontology and data quality assurance throughout the development cycle. Fourth, we will continue to expand and support the thriving Protégé user community, as it grows to include new clinicians and biomedical scientists as they build the ontologies needed to support clinical care, data-driven research, and the elucidation of new discoveries. Project Narrative Protégé is a software system that helps a burgeoning user community to develop ontologies that enhance biomedical research and improve patient care. Protégé supports scientists, clinician researchers, and workers in informatics in data annotation, data integration, information retrieval, natural-language processing, electronic patient record systems, and decision-support systems. The Protégé resource provides critical semantic-technology infrastructure and expertise for biomedical research and the development of advanced clinical information systems.",Protege: A Knowledge-Engineering Environment for Advancing Biomedical Sciences,9217457,R01GM121724,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Advanced Development', 'Affect', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Biomedical Research', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computerized Patient Records', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Education and Outreach', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Hot Spot', 'Human', 'Informatics', 'Information Retrieval', 'Information Systems', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Letters', 'Maintenance', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Ontology', 'Patient Care', 'Process', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Semantics', 'Source', 'System', 'Technology', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Update', 'Work', 'Writing', 'biomedical ontology', 'biomedical scientist', 'clinical care', 'clinical development', 'data integration', 'data sharing', 'design', 'document outlines', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interoperability', 'knowledge base', 'natural language', 'next generation', 'open source', 'quality assurance', 'software systems', 'tool']",NIGMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,578512,0.061252610306597746
"HIGH THROUGHPUT LITERATURE CURATION OF GENETIC REGULATION IN BACTERIAL MODELS DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The aim of this proposal is to implement a novel way of processing and accessing the vast detailed knowledge contained within collections of scientific publications on the regulation of transcription initiation in bacterial models. In princple, this model for processing and reading information and new knowledge is applicable to other biological domains, potentially benefiting any area of biomedical knowledge. It is certainly criticl to generate new strategies to cope with the ever-increasing amount of knowledge generated in genomics and in biomedical research at large. Improving the efficiency of the traditional high-quality manual curation of scientific publications will enable us also to expand the type of biological knowledge, beyond mechanisms and their elements in the genome, to start including their connections with larger regulated processes and eventually physiological properties of the cell. We will first implement the necessary technology to improve our curation by means of a computational system that has text mining capabilities for preprocessing the papers before a human expert curator identifies which sentences contain the information that is to be added to the database. Premarked options selected by the curators will accelerate their decisions. The accumulative precise mapping between sentences and curated knowledge will provide training sets for text mining technologies to improve their automatic extraction. The curator practices will become more efficient, enabling us to curate selected high-impact published reviews to place mechanisms into a rich context of their physiological processes and general biology. Another relevant component of our proposal is the improved modeling of regulated processes by means of new concepts in biology that capture larger collections of coregulated genes and their concatenated reactions. Starting from all interactions of a local regulator, coregulated regulators and their domain of action will be incorporated to construct the biobricks of complex decisions, as they are encoded in the genome. These are conceptual containers that capture the organization of knowledge to describe the genetic programming of cellular capabilities. These proposals will be formalized and proposed within an international consortium focused in enriching standard models or ontologies of gene regulation for use by the scientific community. Finally, a portal to navigate across all the sentences of a given corpus of a large number (more than 5,000) of related papers will be implemented. The different avenues of navigation will essentially use two technologies, one dealing with automatically generating simpler sentences from original sentences as input, and the other one with the classification of papers based on their theme or ontology. Their combination will enable a novel navigation reading system. If we achieve our aims, this project will give a proof-of-principle prototype with clearly innovative higher levels of large amounts of integrated knowledge. Future directions may adapt these concepts and methods to the biology of higher organisms, including humans. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Scientific knowledge reported within publications provides a wealth of knowledge that we barely capture in databases for genomics. Enhancing the effectiveness of the processing and representation of all this knowledge will change the way we encode our understanding of concatenated interactions that are organized into networks and processes governing cell behavior. Given the conservation in evolution of the nature of biological complexity, a better encoding of our understanding of a bacterial cell shall influence that of any other living organism.",HIGH THROUGHPUT LITERATURE CURATION OF GENETIC REGULATION IN BACTERIAL MODELS,9193091,R01GM110597,"['Area', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Model', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Effectiveness', 'Elements', 'Escherichia coli', 'Evolution', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Programming', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Growth', 'Human', 'International', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Letters', 'Linguistics', 'Literature', 'Manuals', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Ontology', 'Operon', 'Organism', 'Paper', 'Physiological', 'Physiological Processes', 'Planet Earth', 'Process', 'Property', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Reaction', 'Reading', 'Regulation', 'Regulon', 'Reporting', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Solid', 'Source', 'System', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Training', 'Transcription Initiation', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'base', 'cell behavior', 'digital', 'electronic book', 'experience', 'feeding', 'functional genomics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'member', 'microbial community', 'model organisms databases', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'promoter', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'software development', 'text searching', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'usability']",NIGMS,CENTER FOR GENOMIC SCIENCES,R01,2017,396248,0.015588267712223285

"MACE2K - Molecular And Clinical Extraction: A Natural Language Processing Tool for Personalized Medicine ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The velocity, variety, volume and veracity of data from relevant information sources make it extremely challenging for oncologists to collect and review pertinent data that can support routine personalized treatment for their patients. There is an urgent need to develop data wrangling approaches including Natural Language Processing and information retrieval methods to extract and curate personalized-therapy related publications and clinical trials. Once curated, the structured data can be used by biomedical researchers to generate novel scientific hypotheses, design new studies, obtain a better understanding of biological mechanisms of disease, perform meta-analyses, and create clinical decision support systems. There is an urgent need to develop improved search interfaces specific to the field of personalized therapy, including ways to display, rank, and save results by end users. While several database and web-based keyword search engine algorithms exist, there is a lack of tools that meet the unique challenges of personalized medicine. There is also an urgent need to develop software that allows for verification and validation of information extracted and ranked through computational methods using subject matter expertise to improve the gold standard corpus that can be used for biomedical research into personalized therapies.  To address these issues, we will build an innovative software stack (MACE2K) to adapt and extend widely tested Biocreative natural language processing (NLP) tools to automatically retrieve and pre-process targeted therapy information from clinicaltrials.gov, PubMed abstracts as well as open access articles, and conference proceedings. We will build an entity extraction cartridge to accurately parse gene mutations, translocations, gene expression, protein expression, and protein phosphorylation.

"Crowd Sourcing Labels From Electronic Medical Records to Enable Biomedical Research ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Supervised machine learning is a popular method that uses labeled training examples to predict future outcomes.  Unfortunately, supervised machine learning for biomedical research is often limited by a lack of labeled data.  Current methods to produce labeled data involve manual chart reviews that are laborious and do not scale with data creation rates.  This project aims to develop a framework to crowd source labeled data sets from electronic medical records by forming a crowd of clinical personnel labelers.  The construction of these labeled data sets will allow for new biomedical research studies that were previously infeasible to conduct.  There are numerous practical and theoretical challenges of developing a crowd sourcing platform for clinical data.  First, popular, public crowd sourcing platforms such as Amazon's Mechanical Turk are not suitable for medical record labeling as HIPAA makes clinical data sharing risky.  Second, the types of clinical questions that are amenable for crowd sourcing are not well understood.  Third, it is unclear if the clinical crowd can produce labels quickly and accurately.  Each of these challenges will be addressed in a separate Aim. As the first Aim of this project, the team will evaluate different clinical crowd sourcing architectures.  The architecture must leverage the scale of the crowd, while minimizing patient information exposure.  De-identification tools will be considered to scrub clinical notes t reduce information leakage.  Using this design, the team will extend a popular open source crowd sourcing tool, Pybossa, and release it to the public.  As the second Aim, the team will study the type, structure, topic and specificity of clinical prediction questions, and how these characteristics impact labeler quality.  Lastly, the team will evaluate the quality and accuracy of collected clinical crowd sourced data on two existing chart review problems to determine the platform's utility.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Traditionally, clinical prediction models rely on supervised machine learning algorithms to probabilistically predict clinical events using labeled medical records.  When data sets are small, manual chart reviews performed by clinical staff are sufficient to label each outcome; however, as data sets have scaled up and researchers aim to study larger cohorts, current manual approaches become intractable.  The goal of this proposal is to develop a framework to crowd source labeled data sets from electronic medical records to support prediction model development.        ",Crowd Sourcing Labels From Electronic Medical Records to Enable Biomedical Research,9076555,UH2CA203708,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Asthma', 'Biomedical Research', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collection', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disclosure', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Extravasation', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'Human Resources', 'Incentives', 'Interview', 'Label', 'Machine Learning', 'Management Audit', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical Records', 'Medical Research', 'Medical Students', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nurses', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Privacy', 'Productivity', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Security', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'System', 'Time', 'Training', 'cohort', 'computer science', 'crowdsourcing', 'design', 'member', 'model development', 'open source', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'response', 'scale up', 'tool']",NCI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,UH2,2016,316000,-0.0019860590392063965

"Biomedical Data Translator Technical Feasibility Assessment and Architecture Design Our Vision: We propose DeepLink, a versatile data translator that integrate multi-scale, heterogeneous, and multi-source biomedical and clinical data. The primary goal of DeepLink is to enable meaningful bidirectional translation between clinical and molecular science by closing the interoperability gap between models and knowledge at different scales. The translator will enhance clinical science with molecular insights from basic and translational research (e.g. genetic variants, protein interactions, pathway functions, and cellular organization), and enable the molecular sciences by connecting biological discoveries with their pathophysiological consequences (e.g. diseases, signs and symptoms, pharmacological effects, physiological systems). Fundamental differences in the language and semantics used to describe the models and knowledge between the clinical and molecular domains results in an interoperability gap. DeepLink will systematically and comprehensively close this gap. We will begin with the latest technology in semantic knowledge graphs to support an extensible architecture for dynamic data federation and knowledge harmonization. We will design a system for multi-scale model integration that is ontology-based and will combine model execution with prior, curated biomedical knowledge. Our design strategy will be iterative and participatory and anchored by 10 major milestones. In a series of demonstrations of DeepLink’s functions, we will address one of the major challenges facing translational science: reproducibility of biomedical research findings that are based on evolving molecular datasets. Reproducibility of analyses and replication of results are central to scientific advancement. Many landmark studies have used data that are constantly being updated, curated, and pared down over time. Our series of demonstrations projects are designed to prototype the technology required for a scalable and robust translator as well as the techniques we will use to close the interoperability gap for a specific use case. The demonstration project will, itself, will be a significant and novel contribution to science. DeepLink will be able to answer questions that are currently enigmatic. Examples include: - From clinicians: What is the comparative effectiveness of all the treatments for disease Y given a patient's genetic/metabolic/proteomic profile? What are the functional variants in cell type X that are associated with differential treatment outcomes? What metabolite perturbations in cell type Y are associated with different subtypes of disease X? - From basic science researchers: What is known about disease Y across all model organisms (even those not designed to model Y)? What are all the clinical phenotypes that result from a change in function in protein X? Which biological pathways are affected by a pathogenic variant of disease Y? What patient data are available to evaluate a molecularlyderived clinical hypothesis? Challenges and Our Approaches: DeepLink will close the interoperability gap that currently prohibits molecular discoveries from leading to clinical innovations. DeepLink will be technologically driven, addressing the challenges associated with large, heterogeneous, semantically ambiguous, continuously changing, partially overlapping, and contextually dependent data by using (1) scalable, distributed, and versioned graph stores; (2) semantic technologies such as ontologies and Linked Data; (3) network analysis quality control methods; (4) machine-learning focused data fusion methods; (5) context-aware text mining, entity recognition and relation extraction; (6) multi-scale knowledge discovery using patient and molecular data; and (7) presentation of actionable knowledge to clinicians and basic scientists via user-friendly interfaces. n/a",Biomedical Data Translator Technical Feasibility Assessment and Architecture Design,9338982,OT3TR002027,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Architecture', 'Basic Science', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cell physiology', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Language', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Ontology', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Physiological', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Quality Control', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Personnel', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Semantics', 'Series', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Source', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'Treatment outcome', 'Update', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'base', 'cell type', 'clinical phenotype', 'comparative effectiveness', 'design', 'disorder subtype', 'genetic variant', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interoperability', 'molecular domain', 'multi-scale modeling', 'novel', 'prototype', 'text searching', 'user-friendly']",NCATS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,OT3,2016,1183132,0.0028766733244727366
"Boosting the Translational Impact of Scientific Competitions by Ensemble Learning ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): ""Big data"" such as those arising from sequencing, imaging, genomics and other emerging technologies are playing a critical role in modern biology and medicine. The generation of hypotheses about biological processes and disease mechanisms is now increasingly being driven by the production and analysis of large and complex datasets. Advanced computational methods have been developed for the robust analysis of these datasets, and the growth in number and sophistication of these methods has closely tracked the growth in volume and complexity of biomedical data. In such a crowded environment of diverse computational methods and data, it is difficult to judge how generalizable the performance of these methods is from one setting to another. Crowdsourcing-based scientific competitions, or challenges, have now become popular mechanisms for the rigorous, blinded and unbiased evaluation of the performance of these methods and the identification of best-performing methods for biomedical problems. However, despite the benefits of these challenges to the biomedical research enterprise, the impact of their findings has been remarkably limited in laboratory and clinical settings. This is likely due to two important aspects of current challenges: (i) their over-emphasis on identifying the ""best"" solutions rather than tryig to comprehensively assimilate the knowledge embedded in all the submitted solutions, and (ii) the absence of a stable channel of communication and collaboration between problem and solution providers due to a lack of sufficient incentives to do so. The aim of this project is to boost the translational impact of scientific challenges through a combination of novel machine learning methods, development of novel scalable software and unique collaborations with disease experts to ensure the effective translation of knowledge accrued in challenges to real clinical settings and practice. These novel methods and software are designed to effectively assimilate the knowledge embedded in all the submissions to challenges into ""ensemble"" solutions. In a first of its kind effort, the ensemble solutions derived from disease-focused challenges under the DREAM project will be brought directly to scientists and clinicians that are experts in these disease areas. Initial effort in this project will focus on active DREAM challenges aiming at the accurate prediction of drug response and clinical outcomes respectively in Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) and Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML). Both these diseases are difficult to treat and thus they pose major medical and public health concerns. In collaboration with RA and AML experts, the ensemble solutions learnt in these challenges will be validated in independent patient cohorts and carefully designed clinical studies. This second-level validation is essential to judge the clinical applicability of any method, but is rarely done As the methodology is general, similar efforts will be made for other diseases in later stages of the project. Overall, using a smart combination of crowdsourcing-based challenges and computational methods and software, we aim to demonstrate a unique pathway for studying and treating disease by truly leveraging the ""wisdom of the crowds"". PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Crowdsourcing-based scientific competitions, or challenges, have become a popular mechanism to identify innovative solutions to complex biomedical problems. However, the collective effort of all the challenge participants has been under utilized, and the overall impact on actual clinical and laboratory practice has been remarkably limited. Using novel computational methods and novel ""big data""-friendly software implementation, we plan to demonstrate how biomedical challenges, combined with our approach, can influence clinical practice in Acute Myeloid Leukemia and Rheumatoid Arthritis, as well as rigorously validate our approach.",Boosting the Translational Impact of Scientific Competitions by Ensemble Learning,9049511,R01GM114434,"['Acute Myelocytic Leukemia', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Advanced Development', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Blinded', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Explosion', 'Generations', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'High Performance Computing', 'Image', 'Incentives', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Problem Solving', 'Production', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Research Personnel', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Role', 'Running', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Software Design', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'computer science', 'crowdsourcing', 'design', 'innovation', 'interest', 'knowledge translation', 'learning progression', 'learning strategy', 'meetings', 'method development', 'novel', 'open source', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'response', 'stem', 'tool']",NIGMS,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2016,428512,-0.021715013275317843
"Biomedical Data Translator Technical Feasibility Assessment and Architecture Design New technologies afford the acquisition of dense “data clouds” of individual humans. However, heterogeneity, dimensionality and multi-scale nature of such data (genomes, transcriptomes, clinical variables, etc.) pose a new challenge: How can one query such dense data clouds of mixed data as an integrated set (as opposed to variable by variable) against multiple knowledge bases, and translate the joint molecular information into the clinical realm? Current lexical mapping and brute-force data mining seek to make heterogeneous data interoperable and accessible but their output is fragmented and requires expertise to assemble into coherent actionable information. We propose DeepTranslate, an innovative approach that incorporates the known actual physical organization of biological entities that are the substrate of pathogenesis into (i) networks (data graphs) and (ii) hierarchies of concepts that span the multiscale space from molecule to clinic. Organizing data sources along such natural structures will allow translation of burgeoning high-dimensional data sets into concepts familiar to clinicians, while capturing mechanistic relationships. DeepTranslate will take a hybrid approach to learn and organize its content from both (i) existing generic comprehensive knowledge sources (GO, KEGG, IDC, etc.) and (ii) newly measured instances of individual data clouds from two demonstration projects: (1) ISB’s Pioneer 100 and (2) St. Jude Lifetime cancer survivors. We will focus on diabetes as test case. These two studies cover a deep biological scale-space and thus can test the full extent of the multiscale capacity of DeepTranslate in a focused application. 1. TYPES OF RESEARCH QUESTION ENABLED. How can a clinician find out that the dozens of “out of range” variables observed in a patient’s data cloud, form a connected set with respect to pathophysiology pathways, from gene to clinical variable? How can the high-dimensional data of studies that measure for each individual 100+ data points of various types (“personal data clouds”) be analyzed as one set in an integrated fashion (as opposed to variable by variable) against existing knowledge bases and also be used to improve the databases? DeepTranslate addresses these two types of questions and thereby will accelerate translation of future personal data clouds into (A) care decisions and (B) hypotheses on new disease mechanisms / treatments, thereby benefiting providers as well as researchers. 2. USE OF EXPERTISE AND RESOURCES. ■ ISB: pioneer in personalized, big-data driven medicine (Demo Project 1); biomedical content expertise; multiscale omics and molecular pathogenesis, big data analysis, housing of databases for public access; query engine designs, GUI. ■ UCSD: leader in biomedical data integration; automated assembly of molecular and clinical data into hierarchical structures; translation between data types ■ U Montreal: biomedical database curation from literature and construction of gene/protein/drug interaction networks; machine learning, open resource database ■ St Jude CRH: Cancer monitoring Demo Project 2, cancer patient data analytics. 3. POTENTIAL DATA AND INFRASTRUCTURE CHALLENGES. (a) Existing comprehensive clinical data sources are not uniform and not explicitly based on biological networks; cross-mapping is being performed at NLM based on lexical relationships: HPO (phenotypes) vs. SNOMED CT (for EMR) vs. IDC or Merck Manual (for diseases). Careful selection of these sources in close collaboration with NLM is needed. (b) Existing molecular pathway databases are static, based on averages of heterogeneous non-stratified populations, while the newly measured high-dimensional data clouds are varied due to intra-individual temporal fluctuation and inter-individual variation. How this will affect building of ontotypes in our hybrid approach, and how large cohorts of data clouds must be to offer statistical power is yet to be determined. Our two Demonstration Projects with their uniquely deep (high-dimensional and multiscale) data in cohorts of limited but growing size are thus crucial first steps in a long journey of collective learning in the TRANSLATOR community. n/a",Biomedical Data Translator Technical Feasibility Assessment and Architecture Design,9338977,OT3TR002026,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Architecture', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'CRH gene', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Survivor', 'Caring', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Drug Interactions', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gene Proteins', 'Generic Drugs', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Graph', 'Heterogeneity', 'Housing', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Output', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Provider', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'SNOMED Clinical Terms', 'Saint Jude Children&apos', 's Research Hospital', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'base', 'cohort', 'data integration', 'data mining', 'design', 'improved', 'innovation', 'inter-individual variation', 'knowledge base', 'lexical', 'molecular assembly/self assembly', 'new technology', 'transcriptome']",NCATS,INSTITUTE FOR SYSTEMS BIOLOGY,OT3,2016,1071976,-0.013377508799106987
"An Intelligent Concept Agent for Assisting with the Application of Metadata PROJECT ABSTRACT Biomedical investigators are generating increasing amounts of complex and diverse data. This data varies tremendously, from genome sequences through phenotypic measurements and imaging data. If researchers and data scientists can tap into this data effectively, then we can gain insights into disease mechanisms and how to tackle them. However, the main stumbling block is that it is increasingly hard to find and integrate the relevant datasets due to the lack of sufficient metadata. A researcher studying Crohn's disease may miss a crucial dataset on how certain microbial communities affect gut histology due to the lack of descriptive tags on the data. Currently, applying metadata is difficult, time-consuming and error prone due to the vast sea of confusing and overlapping standards for each datatype. Often specialized `data wranglers' are employed to apply metadata, but even these experts are hindered by lack of good tools. Here we propose to develop an intelligent agent that researchers and data wranglers can use to assist them apply metadata. The agent is based around a personalized dashboard of metadata elements that can be collected from multiple specialized portals, as well as sites such as Wikipedia. These elements can be coupled with classifiers that can be used to self-identify datasets to which they may be relevant, making the selection of appropriate vocabularies easier for researchers. We will deploy the system for a number of targeted use cases, including annotation of the National Center for Biomedical Information Bio-Samples repository, and annotation of images within the Figshare repository. Project Narrative Biomedical data is being generated at an increasing rate, and it is becoming increasingly difficult for researchers to be able to locate and effectively operate over this data, which has negative impacts on the rate of new discoveries. One solution is to attach metadata (data about data) onto all information generated in a research project, but application of metadata is currently difficult and time consuming due to the diverse range of standards on offer, typically requiring the expertise of trained data wranglers. Here we propose to develop an intelligent concept assistant that will allow researchers to generate and share sets of metadata elements relevant to their project, and will use machine learning techniques to automatically apply this to data.",An Intelligent Concept Agent for Assisting with the Application of Metadata,9161233,U01HG009453,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Crohn&apos', 's disease', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Disease', 'Distributed Systems', 'Ecosystem', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Fostering', 'Frustration', 'Histology', 'Human Microbiome', 'Image', 'Intelligence', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Metadata', 'Ontology', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Sampling', 'Sea', 'Site', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Suggestion', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Vision', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'base', 'dashboard', 'empowered', 'genome sequencing', 'improved', 'insight', 'meetings', 'microbial community', 'peer', 'repository', 'social', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'web portal']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIF-LAWRENC BERKELEY LAB,U01,2016,575532,0.01672930206184768
"Developing and applying information extraction resources and technology to create DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Building on 8 years of highly productive work in technology development that included the creation of the Colorado Richly Annotated Full Text corpus (CRAFT), we hypothesize that text mining resources and methods are approaching the level of maturity required to productively process a significant proportion of the full text biomedical literature to create a well-represented formal knowledge base of molecular biology. We propose a detailed, integrated plan to achieve this long-standing goal. Success in this effort will make possible a transformative new way for the biomedical research community to identify access and integrate existing knowledge, breaking down disciplinary boundaries and other silos that have kept scientists from fully exploiting relevant prior results in their research.      Our successes in the prior funding period broadened the applicability of biomedical concept identification systems to a much wider set of tasks, demonstrating the ability to target multiple community-curated ontologies in text mining, and generate scientifically significant insights from the results. The proposed work would take advantage of the resources we produced to transcend several of the limitations of previous efforts. We propose innovative new approaches to formal knowledge representation and to characterizing relationships between textual elements and semantic content. We will design, implement and evaluate computational systems that have the potential to transform enormous text collections into semantically rich, logic-based, standards-compliant, formal representations of biomedical knowledge with clearly identified provenance. The resulting representations will express complex assertions about a very wide range of entities, processes, qualities, and, most importantly, their specific relationships with one another.

"In silico identification of phyto-therapies DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Plants have been acknowledged as forming the basis of medicines dating back to the most ancient civilizations. To complement synthetic drug discovery processes, there remains a significant opportunity for identifying potential new therapies from plant-based sources (""phyto-therapies""). Current approaches used for the discovery of potential phyto-therapies are laborious, time-consuming, and mostly manual. The increased availability of ethnobotanical and biomedical knowledge in digital formats suggests that there may be the potential to leverage automated techniques to facilitate the phyto-therapy discovery process. The long-term goal of this initiative is thus to develop a semantically integrated framework that could be used to identify and validate potential phyto-therapies embedded within ethnobotanical and biomedical knowledge sources, and thus encourage the conservation of this knowledge and biodiversity. The overall project is built around three major aims, which are to: (1) develop a standards-driven gold standard that can be used for benchmarking automated phyto-therapy identification approaches; (2) develop an automated approach to identify potential phyto-therapies from digitized biodiversity literature (Biodiversity Heritage Library), biomedical literature citations (MEDLINE) or digital full-text (PubMed Central), genomic (GenBank), clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov), and chemical (PubChem) resources; and (3) leverage vector space modeling techniques to predict the relevance of potential phyto-therapies. The success of this endeavor will set the stage for the translation of a growing, but currently disjointed, evidence-base of medicinal plant knowledge into tools for the elucidation of potential phyto-therapies. Furthermore, through achieving these aims, this project will also establish a first-of- its-kind in silico platform that could be extended to identify additional therapeutics from a broad spectrum of biodiversity sources. The core aspects of this project will build on experience with developing computational techniques to bridge biodiversity and biomedical knowledge, including those that have been pioneered by the research team.      This project will bring together biomedical informatics, library science, and ethnobotany experience and expertise from two institutions: the University of Vermont and The New York Botanical Garden. The multi- institutional and multi-PI aspects of this project support the feasibility of the proposed project aims and will furthermore enable the load-balancing of essential tasks such that they may meet the proposed milestones set for each aim. To this end, the success of the proposed endeavor will be built on a foundation of experiences in gathering ethnobotanical knowledge, analyzing and linking biodiversity and biomedical knowledge sources, and developing approaches for systematically annotating corpora for subsequent purposes in support of natural language processing and data mining pursuits. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH  The identification of potential therapies is a significant area of research with direct public health implications. As such, the integration of knowledge from traditionally disjoint knowledge sources may offer a more holistic view of the ethnobotanical and biomedical research knowledge that can support the development of new disease treatment regimens.",In silico identification of phyto-therapies,9123422,R01LM011963,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Automated Annotation', 'Back', 'Benchmarking', 'Biodiversity', 'Biomedical Research', 'Books', 'Botanicals', 'Chemicals', 'Civilization', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complement', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Equilibrium', 'Ethnobotany', 'Evaluation', 'Expert Opinion', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genbank', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'HIV', 'Health', 'Hepatitis', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Island', 'Knowledge', 'Libraries', 'Library Science', 'Link', 'Literature', 'MEDLINE', 'Manuals', 'Medicinal Plants', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Natural Products', 'New York', 'Ontology', 'Peer Review', 'Performance', 'Plants', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'PubChem', 'PubMed', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Review Literature', 'Samoan', 'Source', 'Space Models', 'Staging', 'Surveys', 'System', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Techniques', 'Text', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Uses', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Translations', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Trees', 'Universities', 'Vermont', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'clinical application', 'computer infrastructure', 'data mining', 'digital', 'drug candidate', 'drug discovery', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'indexing', 'literature citation', 'meetings', 'novel therapeutics', 'prostratin', 'success', 'synthetic drug', 'tool', 'vector']",NLM,BROWN UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,419732,0.04278892860600037
"Semantic Literature Annotation and Integrative Panomics Analysis for PTM-Disease Knowledge Network Discovery PROJECT SUMMARY Protein post-translational modification (PTM) plays a critical role in many diseases; however, critical gaps remain in research infrastructure for global analysis of PTMs. Key PTM information concerning enzyme- substrate relationships, regulation of PTM enzymes, PTM cross-talk, and functional consequences of PTM remains buried in the scientific literature. Meanwhile, while high-throughput panomics (genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, PTM proteomic) data offer an unprecedented opportunity for the discovery of PTM-disease relationships, the data must be analyzed in an integrated and easily accessible knowledge framework in order for researchers and clinicians to gain a molecular understanding of disease. The goal of this application is to develop a collaborative knowledge environment for semantic annotation of scientific literature and integrative panomics analysis for PTM-disease knowledge discovery in precision medicine. We propose to connect PTM information from literature mining and curated databases in a knowledge resource on an ontological framework that supports analysis of panomics data in the context of PTM networks. To broaden impact and foster collaborative development, our resource will be FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) and interoperable with community standards.  The specific aims are: (i) develop a novel NLP (natural language processing) system for full-scale literature mining and PTM-disease knowledge extraction; (ii) develop a PTM knowledge resource for integrative panomics analysis and network discovery; and (iii) provide a FAIR collaborative environment for scalable semantic annotation and knowledge integration. The proposed system will build upon the NLP technologies and text mining tools already developed by our team and the bioinformatics infrastructure at the Protein Information Resource (PIR). The iPTMnet web portal will allow searching, browsing, visualization and analysis of PTM networks and PTM-related mutations in conjunction with user-supplied omics data, including panomics data from major national initiatives. Use scenarios will include identification of disease-driving genetic variants and analysis of cellular responses to kinase inhibitors. Our PTM knowledgebase will be disseminated with an RDF triple-store and a SPARQL endpoint for semantic queries, while our text mining tools and full-scale literature mining results will be disseminated in the BioC community standard for seamless integration to other text mining pipelines. To engage the community semantic annotation of scientific literature, we will host a hackathon to develop tools to expose BioC-annotated literature corpora to the semantic web, as well as an annotation jamboree to explore tagging of scientific text with precise ontological terms. This project will thus offer a unique research resource for PTM-disease network discovery as well as an integrable collaborative knowledge framework to support Big Data to Knowledge in precision medicine. PROJECT NARRATIVE Precision medicine requires a detailed understanding of the molecular events that are disrupted in disease, including changes in protein post-translational modifications (PTM) that are hallmarks of many diseases. The proposed resource will support analysis of genomic-scale data for exploring PTM-disease networks and PTM-related mutations, as well as knowledge dissemination on the semantic web. These combined efforts will accelerate basic understanding of disease processes and discovery of diagnostic targets and more effective individualized therapies.",Semantic Literature Annotation and Integrative Panomics Analysis for PTM-Disease Knowledge Network Discovery,9195864,U01GM120953,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Automobile Driving', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Controlled Vocabulary', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Drug resistance', 'Educational workshop', 'Environment', 'Enzymes', 'Europe', 'Event', 'Fostering', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Hybrids', 'Imagery', 'Information Resources', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Knowledge Extraction', 'Length', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'MicroRNAs', 'Mining', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Ontology', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Phosphorylation', 'Phosphorylation Site', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Play', 'Post Translational Modification Analysis', 'Post-Translational Modification Site', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Process', 'Protein Databases', 'Protein Family', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'PubMed', 'Publications', 'Regulation', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Semantics', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Staging', 'System', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Tissues', 'Translational Research', 'Variant', 'abstracting', 'cell type', 'collaborative environment', 'computer based Semantic Analysis', 'enzyme substrate', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic variant', 'hackathon', 'indexing', 'information organization', 'innovation', 'kinase inhibitor', 'knowledge base', 'novel', 'precision medicine', 'protein complex', 'protein protein interaction', 'response', 'system architecture', 'text searching', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'web portal', 'web services', 'web site']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF DELAWARE,U01,2016,374400,0.015171083373140675
"COINSTAC: decentralized, scalable analysis of loosely coupled data ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     The brain imaging community is greatly benefiting from extensive data sharing efforts currently underway5,10. However, there is a significant gap in existing strategies which focus on anonymized, post-hoc sharing of either 1) full raw or preprocessed data [in the case of open studies] or 2) manually computed summary measures [such as hippocampal volume11, in the case of closed (or not yet shared) studies] which we propose to address. Current approaches to data sharing often include significant logistical hurdles both for the investigator sharing the dat as well as for the individual requesting the data (e.g. often times multiple data sharing agreements and approvals are required from US and international institutions). This needs to change, so that the scientific community becomes a venue where data can be collected, managed, widely shared and analyzed while also opening up access to the (many) data sets which are not currently available (see recent overview on this from our group2).    The large amount of existing data requires an approach that can analyze data in a distributed way while also leaving control of the source data with the individual investigator; this motivates  dynamic, decentralized way of approaching large scale analyses. We are proposing a peer-to-peer system called the Collaborative Informatics and Neuroimaging Suite Toolkit for Anonymous Computation (COINSTAC). The system will provide an independent, open, no-strings-attached tool that performs analysis on datasets distributed across different locations. Thus, the step of actually aggregating data can be avoided, while the strength of large-scale analyses can be retained. To achieve this, in Aim 1, the uniform data interfaces that we propose will make it easy to share and cooperate. Robust and novel quality assurance and replicability tools will also be incorporated. Collaboration and data sharing will be done through forming temporary (need and project-based) virtual clusters of studies performing automatically generated local computation on their respective data and aggregating statistics in global inference procedures. The communal organization will provide a continuous stream of large scale projects that can be formed and completed without the need of creating new rigid organizations or project-oriented storage vaults. In Aim 2, we develop, evaluate, and incorporate privacy-preserving algorithms to ensure that the data used are not re-identifiable even with multiple re-uses. We also will develop advanced distributed and privacy preserving approaches for several key multivariate families of algorithms (general linear model, matrix factorization [e.g. independent component analysis], classification) to estimate intrinsic networks and perform data fusion. Finally, in Aim 3, we will demonstrate the utility of this approach in a proof of concept study through distributed analyses of substance abuse datasets across national and international venues with multiple imaging modalities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Hundreds of millions of dollars have been spent to collect human neuroimaging data for clinical and research purposes, many of which don't have data sharing agreements or collect sensitive data which are not easily shared, such as genetics. Opportunities for large scale aggregated analyses to infer health-relevant facts create new challenges in protecting the privacy of individuals' data. Open sharing of raw data, though desirable from the research perspective, and growing rapidly, is not a good solution for a large number of datasets which have additional privacy risks or IRB concerns. The COINSTAC solution we are proposing will capture this 'missing data' and allow for pooling of both open and 'closed' repositories by developing privacy preserving versions of widely-used algorithms and incorporating within an easy-to-use platform which enables distributed computation. In addition, COINSTAC will accelerate research on both open and closed data by offering a distributed computational solution for a large toolkit of widely used algorithms.","COINSTAC: decentralized, scalable analysis of loosely coupled data",9100683,R01DA040487,"['AODD relapse', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Agreement', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Brain imaging', 'Classification', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Consent Forms', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Ensure', 'Family', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Health', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'International', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Left', 'Letters', 'Linear Models', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Movement', 'Paper', 'Plant Roots', 'Poaceae', 'Population', 'Privacy', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Science', 'Site', 'Stream', 'Substance abuse problem', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'base', 'computing resources', 'connectome', 'cost', 'data sharing', 'distributed data', 'flexibility', 'imaging genetics', 'imaging modality', 'independent component analysis', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'open data', 'peer', 'quality assurance', 'repository', 'statistics', 'tool', 'virtual']",NIDA,THE MIND RESEARCH NETWORK,R01,2016,680020,0.004430774485571943
"Semantic Data Lake for Biomedical Research Capitalizing on the transformative opportunities afforded by the extremely large and ever-growing volume, velocity, and variety of biomedical data being continuously produced is a major challenge. The development and increasingly widespread adoption of several new technologies, including next generation genetic sequencing, electronic health records and clinical trials systems, and research data warehouses means that we are in the midst of a veritable explosion in data production. This in turn results in the migration of the bottleneck in scientific productivity into data management and interpretation: tools are urgently needed to assist cancer researchers in the assembly, integration, transformation, and analysis of these Big Data sets. In this project, we propose to develop the Semantic Data Lake for Biomedical Research (SDL-BR) system, a cluster-computing software environment that enables rapid data ingestion, multifaceted data modeling, logical and semantic querying and data transformation, and intelligent resource discovery. SDL-BR is based on the idea of a data lake, a distributed store that does not make any assumptions about the structure of incoming data, and that delays modeling decisions until data is to be used. This project adds to the data lake paradigm methods for semantic data modeling, integration, and querying, and for resource discovery based on learned relationships between users and data resources. The SDL-BR System is a distributed computing software solution that enables research institutions to manage, integrate, and make available large institutional data sets to researchers, and that permits users to generate data models specific to particular applications. It uses state of the art cluster computing, Semantic Web, and machine learning technologies to provide for rapid data ingestion, semantic modeling and querying, and search and discovery of data resources through a sophisticated, Web-based user interface.",Semantic Data Lake for Biomedical Research,9200905,R44CA206782,"['Accelerometer', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Area', 'Big Data', 'Biomedical Computing', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Chronic Myeloid Leukemia', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Data Discovery', 'Data Quality', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Decision Modeling', 'Demographic Factors', 'Development', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Explosion', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Immigration', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Ingestion', 'Institution', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Extraction', 'Learning', 'Legal', 'Legal patent', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma', 'Online Systems', 'Ontology', 'Phase', 'Policies', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Production', 'Productivity', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Risk', 'Secure', 'Security', 'Semantics', 'Services', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'cluster computing', 'computer based Semantic Analysis', 'cost effective', 'data access', 'data exchange', 'data integration', 'data management', 'data modeling', 'design', 'disease heterogeneity', 'experience', 'genetic information', 'handheld mobile device', 'indexing', 'individualized medicine', 'melanoma', 'natural language', 'new technology', 'next generation', 'novel', 'precision medicine', 'prototype', 'success', 'systems research', 'targeted treatment', 'technology development', 'time use', 'tool']",NCI,"INFOTECH SOFT, INC.",R44,2016,221175,-0.007042141567265494
"Collaborative Development of Biomedical Ontologies and Terminologies DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The construction of ontologies that define the entities in an application area and the relationships among them has become essential for modern work in biomedicine.  Ontologies help both humans and computers to manage burgeoning numbers of data.  The need to annotate, retrieve, and integrate high-throughput data sets, to process  natural language, and to build systems for decision support has set many communities  of biomedical investigators to work building large ontologies.  We developed and evaluated the Collaborative Prot¿g¿ system in the first phase of our research project. This software system has become an indispensable open-source resource for an international community of scientists who develop ontologies in a cooperative, distributed manner. In this competing renewal proposal, we describe novel data-driven methods and tools that promise to make collaborative ontology design both more streamlined and more principled. Our goal is to create a more empirical basis for ontology engineering, and to develop methods whereby the ontology-engineering enterprise both can profit from data regarding the underlying processes and those processes in turn can generate increasing amounts of data to inform future ontology-engineering activities.  Our research plan entails three specific aims. First, we will enable ontology developers to apply ontology-design patterns (ODPs) to their ontologies, and we will measure the way in which these patterns alter the ontology-engineering process. Second, we will analyze the vast amounts of log data that we collect from users of Collaborative Prot¿g¿ to understand the patterns of ontology development. We will use these patterns to recommend to developers areas of ontologies that may need their attention, facilitating the process of reaching consensus and making collaborative ontology engineering more efficient. Finally, we will use the extensive data collected by our group and others to understand how scientists reuse terms from various ontologies and we will use these emerging patterns to facilitate term reuse. Each of these analyses not only will increase our understanding of collaboration in scientific modeling, but also will lead to new technology within our Collaborative Prot¿g¿ suite that will improve the ontology-development process and make collaboration among biomedical scientists more efficient. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Collaborative Prot�g� is a software system that helps a burgeoning user community to cooperate in developing ontologies that enhance biomedical research and improve patient care. Collaborative Prot�g� supports scientists, clinician researchers, and workers in informatics to build ontologies to solve problems in data annotation, data integration, information retrieval, natural-language processing, electronic patient record systems, and decision support.

"Protege: An Ontology-Development Platform for Biomedical Scientists DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The engineering of ontologies that define the entities in an application area and the relationships among them has become essential for modern work in  biomedicine.  Ontologies help both humans and computers to manage burgeoning numbers of data.  The need to annotate, retrieve, and integrate high-throughput data sets, to process natural language, and to build systems for decision support has set many communities of investigators to work building large ontologies. The Protégé system has become an indispensable open-source resource for an enormous internationa community of scientists-supporting the development, maintenance, and use of ontologies and electronic knowledge bases by biomedical investigators everywhere. The number of registered Protégé users has grown from 3,500 in 2002 to more than 195,000 users as of this writing. To date, however, the use of ontologies in biomedicine has been limited by the complexity of the ontology-development tools, which often make ontologies inaccessible to many biomedical scientists.  In this proposal, we will develop new methods and tools that will significantly lower the barrier of entry for ontology development, expanding Protégé to provide intuitive and user-friendly ontology-acquisition methods throughout the ontology lifecycle.  Our plan entails five specific aims.  First, we will develop methods that enable initial specification of ontology terms in an informal manner, using lists and diagrams.  Scientists will be able to start modeling their domain without having to think in terms of formal ontological distinctions. Second, we will provide intuitive, easy-to-use tools for ontology specification that will aid developers as they start to formalize their models.  Third, we will track the requirements that an ontology must address and develop novel  methods  for  evaluating  ontology  coverage  based  on  these  requirements.  Fourth, for ontologies that inherently have complex internal structure that cannot be represented fully using only simple ontology constructs, we will develop methods that will create templates covering regular structures in the ontology. Scientists will then be able to fill out forms based o these templates, with Protégé generating the corresponding logical structure in the background.  Fifth, we will continue to expand and support the thriving Protégé user community, as it expands to include the biomedical scientists who will now be able to build the ontologies to support their data-driven research and discoveries. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Protégé is a software system that helps a burgeoning user community to develop ontologies that enhance biomedical research and improve patient care.  Protégé supports scientists, clinician researchers, and workers in informatics in data annotation, data integration, information retrieval, natural-language processing, electronic patient record systems, and decision-support systems.

"HIGH THROUGHPUT LITERATURE CURATION OF GENETIC REGULATION IN BACTERIAL MODELS DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The aim of this proposal is to implement a novel way of processing and accessing the vast detailed knowledge contained within collections of scientific publications on the regulation of transcription initiation in bacterial models. In princple, this model for processing and reading information and new knowledge is applicable to other biological domains, potentially benefiting any area of biomedical knowledge. It is certainly criticl to generate new strategies to cope with the ever-increasing amount of knowledge generated in genomics and in biomedical research at large. Improving the efficiency of the traditional high-quality manual curation of scientific publications will enable us also to expand the type of biological knowledge, beyond mechanisms and their elements in the genome, to start including their connections with larger regulated processes and eventually physiological properties of the cell. We will first implement the necessary technology to improve our curation by means of a computational system that has text mining capabilities for preprocessing the papers before a human expert curator identifies which sentences contain the information that is to be added to the database. Premarked options selected by the curators will accelerate their decisions. The accumulative precise mapping between sentences and curated knowledge will provide training sets for text mining technologies to improve their automatic extraction. The curator practices will become more efficient, enabling us to curate selected high-impact published reviews to place mechanisms into a rich context of their physiological processes and general biology. Another relevant component of our proposal is the improved modeling of regulated processes by means of new concepts in biology that capture larger collections of coregulated genes and their concatenated reactions. Starting from all interactions of a local regulator, coregulated regulators and their domain of action will be incorporated to construct the biobricks of complex decisions, as they are encoded in the genome. These are conceptual containers that capture the organization of knowledge to describe the genetic programming of cellular capabilities. These proposals will be formalized and proposed within an international consortium focused in enriching standard models or ontologies of gene regulation for use by the scientific community. Finally, a portal to navigate across all the sentences of a given corpus of a large number (more than 5,000) of related papers will be implemented. The different avenues of navigation will essentially use two technologies, one dealing with automatically generating simpler sentences from original sentences as input, and the other one with the classification of papers based on their theme or ontology. Their combination will enable a novel navigation reading system. If we achieve our aims, this project will give a proof-of-principle prototype with clearly innovative higher levels of large amounts of integrated knowledge. Future directions may adapt these concepts and methods to the biology of higher organisms, including humans. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Scientific knowledge reported within publications provides a wealth of knowledge that we barely capture in databases for genomics. Enhancing the effectiveness of the processing and representation of all this knowledge will change the way we encode our understanding of concatenated interactions that are organized into networks and processes governing cell behavior. Given the conservation in evolution of the nature of biological complexity, a better encoding of our understanding of a bacterial cell shall influence that of any other living organism.",HIGH THROUGHPUT LITERATURE CURATION OF GENETIC REGULATION IN BACTERIAL MODELS,8985684,R01GM110597,"['Area', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Model', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Effectiveness', 'Elements', 'Escherichia coli', 'Evolution', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Programming', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Human', 'Indium', 'International', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Letters', 'Life', 'Linguistics', 'Literature', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Ontology', 'Operon', 'Organism', 'Paper', 'Physiological', 'Physiological Processes', 'Process', 'Property', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Reaction', 'Reading', 'Regulation', 'Regulon', 'Reporting', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Solid', 'Source', 'System', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Training', 'Transcription Initiation', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'base', 'cell behavior', 'coping', 'digital', 'electronic book', 'experience', 'feeding', 'functional genomics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'member', 'microbial community', 'model organisms databases', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'promoter', 'prototype', 'response', 'software development', 'text searching', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'usability']",NIGMS,CENTER FOR GENOMIC SCIENCES,R01,2016,405708,0.015588267712223285
"Supporting Systematic Review Production with Article Similarity Network Visualization PROJECT SUMMARY Systematic reviews (SRs), or systematic reviews of literature, summarize evidence drawn from high quality studies, and are often the preferred source of evidence-based practice (EBP). However, conducting an SR is labor-intensive and time consuming, typically requiring several months to complete. It has been reported that more than ten thousands of SRs are needed to synthesize existing medical knowledge. An Article screening process is one of the most intensive and time consuming steps, which requires SR researchers to screen a large amount of references, ranging from hundreds to more than 10,000 articles, depending on the size of a SR. In the past 10 years, machine learning model training approaches24-29 were developed to accelerate the article selection process through automation. However, they are not widely used due to diffusion challenges.7,14 Major obstacles include 1) a training sample is required to generate the automation algorithm. If the training sample is biased, the article selection process will systematically fail; 2) the automation approach is not made available for non-computer science specialists, therefore SR researchers will not be able to “fine-tune” the automation algorithm for particular conditions in various SR topics; 3) As there is no global automation algorithm, the generalizability is significantly limited; 4) It is difficult to assess the actual workload saved, while finding every relevant article is required in SR. We propose a new approach to provide views of article relationships in an article network. This is different from other bibliometric networks constructing citation, co-author, or co-occurrence networks. Article network is a simple and logical concept: visualizing article relationships and distribution based on articles' similarities in titles, abstracts, keywords, publication types, etc. SR researchers can also alter the article distribution by adjusting the similarities. This approach does not aim to suggest an end-point of the screening process. Rather, it provides a view of distribution for included, excluded, and undecided articles. In the proposed research, we will integrate advanced techniques to sparsify article networks with mixed sparsification methods, and improve the quality and efficiency of large network visualization layouts by constructing a multi-level network structure and advanced force model. We aim to provide approaches to sparsify and visualize article networks with more than 10,000 articles. Our approach is highly generalizable that it can be used for any health science topics. By viewing the article distribution, SR researchers will be able to screen a large amount of literature more efficiently. This approach can be integrated into current SR technologies and used directly by SR researchers. The success of this project can support SR production on any health science topics, and thus streamline their ultimate application in EBP paradigms. PROJECT NARRATIVE Systematic reviews (SRs) provide the highest quality of research evidence for patient care. To accelerate the production of SRs, we will implement advanced visualization techniques to view article relationships and distribution with article networks and in a timely and human readable manner. The success of the project will support SR production and thus streamline their ultimate application to evidence-based practice.",Supporting Systematic Review Production with Article Similarity Network Visualization,9227858,R03HS025047,[' '],AHRQ,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,R03,2016,100000,-0.004983219347364983
"Exploring Natural Language Processing, Image Processing, Machine Learning, and Us DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Most biomedical text mining systems target only text information and do not provide intelligent access to other important data such as Figures. More than any other documentation, figures usually represent the ""evidence"" of discovery in the biomedical literature. Full-text biomedical articles nearly always incorporate images that are the crucial content of biomedical knowledge discovery. Biomedical scientists need to access images to validate research facts and to formulate or to test novel research hypotheses. Evaluation has shown that textual statements reported in the literature are frequently noisy (i.e., contain ""false facts""). Capturing images that are essentially experimental ""evidence"" to support the textual ""fact"" will benefit biomedical information systems, databases, and biomedical scientists. We are developing a biomedical literature figure search engine BioFigureSearch. We develop innovative algorithms and models in natural language processing, image processing, machine learning and user interfacing. The deliverables will be novel biomedical natural language figure processing (bNLfP) algorithms and iBioFigureSearch allowing biomedical scientists to access figure data effectively, and open-source tools that will enhance biomedical information retrieval, summarization, and question answering. The bNLfP algorithms we will be developing can be applied or integrated into other biomedical text-mining systems. This project proposes innovative algorithms and models in natural language processing, image processing, machine learning, and user interfacing, to return figures in response to biomedical queries. It is anticipated that the algorithms, models, and tools developed will significantly enhance biomedical scientists' access to figures reported in literature, and thereby expedite biomedical knowledge discovery.","Exploring Natural Language Processing, Image Processing, Machine Learning, and Us",8840267,R01GM095476,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biomedical Computing', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Comprehension', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Evaluation', 'Genomics', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Information Retrieval', 'Information Retrieval Systems', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Libraries', 'Licensing', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Process', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Proteins', 'PubMed', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Reading', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrieval', 'Semantics', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Validation', 'abstracting', 'base', 'biomedical information system', 'biomedical scientist', 'design', 'genome-wide', 'image processing', 'improved', 'innovation', 'medical schools', 'natural language', 'novel', 'open source', 'response', 'text searching', 'tool']",NIGMS,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,R01,2015,490160,0.02016079881858275
"MACE2K - Molecular And Clinical Extraction: A Natural Language Processing Tool for Personalized Medicine ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The velocity, variety, volume and veracity of data from relevant information sources make it extremely challenging for oncologists to collect and review pertinent data that can support routine personalized treatment for their patients. There is an urgent need to develop data wrangling approaches including Natural Language Processing and information retrieval methods to extract and curate personalized-therapy related publications and clinical trials. Once curated, the structured data can be used by biomedical researchers to generate novel scientific hypotheses, design new studies, obtain a better understanding of biological mechanisms of disease, perform meta-analyses, and create clinical decision support systems. There is an urgent need to develop improved search interfaces specific to the field of personalized therapy, including ways to display, rank, and save results by end users. While several database and web-based keyword search engine algorithms exist, there is a lack of tools that meet the unique challenges of personalized medicine. There is also an urgent need to develop software that allows for verification and validation of information extracted and ranked through computational methods using subject matter expertise to improve the gold standard corpus that can be used for biomedical research into personalized therapies.  To address these issues, we will build an innovative software stack (MACE2K) to adapt and extend widely tested Biocreative natural language processing (NLP) tools to automatically retrieve and pre-process targeted therapy information from clinicaltrials.gov, PubMed abstracts as well as open access articles, and conference proceedings. We will build an entity extraction cartridge to accurately parse gene mutations, translocations, gene expression, protein expression, and protein phosphorylation. A marker disambiguation cartridge will be built to assess for trial inclusion or exclusion criteria and to determine marker-related primary endpoints. We will include a ranking cartridge that uses the disambiguated information on markers, drugs and trials to provide a rigorous scoring of trials and studies according to their relevance for personalized medicine. A novel gamification cartridge will be built to allow subject matter experts to verify and validate the information corpus. Our research leverages National Cancer Institute's investments in several programs (many of which we are involved in) including the NCI drug dictionary, National Cancer Informatics Program (NCIP), I-SPY trials, and Center for cancer systems biology (CCSB) to efficiently accomplish our aims.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will develop new computational methods and software to retrieve targeted molecular and drug therapy information from multiple sources of big data including: clinicaltrials.gov, PubMed abstracts, open access articles, and conference proceedings. The software can be used by biomedical researchers to generate new hypotheses for research on personalized cancer treatment decisions based on enormous volumes of public data already in existence.

"The Center for Predictive Computational Phenotyping-1 Overall     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The biomedical sciences are being radically transformed by advances in our ability to monitor, record, store and integrate information characterizing human biology and health at scales that range from individual molecules to large populations of subjects. This wealth of information has the potential to substantially advance both our understanding of human biology and our ability to improve human health. Perhaps the most central and general approach for exploiting biomedical data is to use methods from machine learning and statistical modeling to infer predictive models. Such models take as input observable data representing some object of interest, and produce as output a prediction about a particular, unobservable property of the object. This approach has proven to be of high value for a wide range of biomedical tasks, but numerous significant challenges remain to be solved in order for the full potential of predictive modeling to be realized.  To address these challenges, we propose to establish The Center for Predictive Computational Phenotyping (CPCP). Our proposed center will focus on a broad range of problems that can be cast as computational phenotyping. Although some phenotypes are easily measured and interpreted, and are available in an accessible format, a wide range of scientifically and clinically important phenotypes do not satisfy these criteria. In such cases, computational phenotyping methods are required either to (i) extract a relevant  phenotype from a complex data source or collection of heterogeneous data sources, (ii) predict clinically  important phenotypes before they are exhibited, or (iii) do both in the same application.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We will develop innovative new approaches and tools that are able to discover, and make crucial inferences with large data sets that include molecular profiles, medical images, electronic health records, population-level data, and various combinations of these and other data types. These approaches will significantly advance the state of the art in wide range of biological and clinical investigations, such as predicting which patients are most at risk for breast cancer, heart attacks and severe blood clots.            ",The Center for Predictive Computational Phenotyping-1 Overall,8935748,U54AI117924,"['Address', 'Arts', 'Biological', 'Blood coagulation', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Education', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'General Population', 'Generations', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Greek', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Biology', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Organism', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Property', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Statistical Algorithm', 'Statistical Models', 'Time', 'Training Activity', 'clinical investigation', 'graduate student', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'novel strategies', 'outcome forecast', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment planning']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,U54,2015,73173,0.010621463666318698
"Boosting the Translational Impact of Scientific Competitions by Ensemble Learning ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): ""Big data"" such as those arising from sequencing, imaging, genomics and other emerging technologies are playing a critical role in modern biology and medicine. The generation of hypotheses about biological processes and disease mechanisms is now increasingly being driven by the production and analysis of large and complex datasets. Advanced computational methods have been developed for the robust analysis of these datasets, and the growth in number and sophistication of these methods has closely tracked the growth in volume and complexity of biomedical data. In such a crowded environment of diverse computational methods and data, it is difficult to judge how generalizable the performance of these methods is from one setting to another. Crowdsourcing-based scientific competitions, or challenges, have now become popular mechanisms for the rigorous, blinded and unbiased evaluation of the performance of these methods and the identification of best-performing methods for biomedical problems. However, despite the benefits of these challenges to the biomedical research enterprise, the impact of their findings has been remarkably limited in laboratory and clinical settings. This is likely due to two important aspects of current challenges: (i) their over-emphasis on identifying the ""best"" solutions rather than tryig to comprehensively assimilate the knowledge embedded in all the submitted solutions, and (ii) the absence of a stable channel of communication and collaboration between problem and solution providers due to a lack of sufficient incentives to do so. The aim of this project is to boost the translational impact of scientific challenges through a combination of novel machine learning methods, development of novel scalable software and unique collaborations with disease experts to ensure the effective translation of knowledge accrued in challenges to real clinical settings and practice. These novel methods and software are designed to effectively assimilate the knowledge embedded in all the submissions to challenges into ""ensemble"" solutions. In a first of its kind effort, the ensemble solutions derived from disease-focused challenges under the DREAM project will be brought directly to scientists and clinicians that are experts in these disease areas. Initial effort in this project will focus on active DREAM challenges aiming at the accurate prediction of drug response and clinical outcomes respectively in Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) and Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML). Both these diseases are difficult to treat and thus they pose major medical and public health concerns. In collaboration with RA and AML experts, the ensemble solutions learnt in these challenges will be validated in independent patient cohorts and carefully designed clinical studies. This second-level validation is essential to judge the clinical applicability of any method, but is rarely done As the methodology is general, similar efforts will be made for other diseases in later stages of the project. Overall, using a smart combination of crowdsourcing-based challenges and computational methods and software, we aim to demonstrate a unique pathway for studying and treating disease by truly leveraging the ""wisdom of the crowds"".         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Crowdsourcing-based scientific competitions, or challenges, have become a popular mechanism to identify innovative solutions to complex biomedical problems. However, the collective effort of all the challenge participants has been under utilized, and the overall impact on actual clinical and laboratory practice has been remarkably limited. Using novel computational methods and novel ""big data""-friendly software implementation, we plan to demonstrate how biomedical challenges, combined with our approach, can influence clinical practice in Acute Myeloid Leukemia and Rheumatoid Arthritis, as well as rigorously validate our approach.                 ",Boosting the Translational Impact of Scientific Competitions by Ensemble Learning,8864679,R01GM114434,"['Acute Myelocytic Leukemia', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Advanced Development', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Blinded', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Explosion', 'Generations', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Heterogeneity', 'High Performance Computing', 'Image', 'Incentives', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Problem Solving', 'Production', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Research Personnel', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Role', 'Running', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Software Design', 'Solutions', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'computer science', 'design', 'innovation', 'interest', 'knowledge translation', 'meetings', 'method development', 'novel', 'open source', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'stem', 'tool']",NIGMS,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2015,445887,-0.021715013275317843
"Developing and applying information extraction resources and technology to create DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Building on 8 years of highly productive work in technology development that included the creation of the Colorado Richly Annotated Full Text corpus (CRAFT), we hypothesize that text mining resources and methods are approaching the level of maturity required to productively process a significant proportion of the full text biomedical literature to create a well-represented formal knowledge base of molecular biology. We propose a detailed, integrated plan to achieve this long-standing goal. Success in this effort will make possible a transformative new way for the biomedical research community to identify access and integrate existing knowledge, breaking down disciplinary boundaries and other silos that have kept scientists from fully exploiting relevant prior results in their research.      Our successes in the prior funding period broadened the applicability of biomedical concept identification systems to a much wider set of tasks, demonstrating the ability to target multiple community-curated ontologies in text mining, and generate scientifically significant insights from the results. The proposed work would take advantage of the resources we produced to transcend several of the limitations of previous efforts. We propose innovative new approaches to formal knowledge representation and to characterizing relationships between textual elements and semantic content. We will design, implement and evaluate computational systems that have the potential to transform enormous text collections into semantically rich, logic-based, standards-compliant, formal representations of biomedical knowledge with clearly identified provenance. The resulting representations will express complex assertions about a very wide range of entities, processes, qualities, and, most importantly, their specific relationships with one another.

"In silico identification of phyto-therapies DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Plants have been acknowledged as forming the basis of medicines dating back to the most ancient civilizations. To complement synthetic drug discovery processes, there remains a significant opportunity for identifying potential new therapies from plant-based sources (""phyto-therapies""). Current approaches used for the discovery of potential phyto-therapies are laborious, time-consuming, and mostly manual. The increased availability of ethnobotanical and biomedical knowledge in digital formats suggests that there may be the potential to leverage automated techniques to facilitate the phyto-therapy discovery process. The long-term goal of this initiative is thus to develop a semantically integrated framework that could be used to identify and validate potential phyto-therapies embedded within ethnobotanical and biomedical knowledge sources, and thus encourage the conservation of this knowledge and biodiversity. The overall project is built around three major aims, which are to: (1) develop a standards-driven gold standard that can be used for benchmarking automated phyto-therapy identification approaches; (2) develop an automated approach to identify potential phyto-therapies from digitized biodiversity literature (Biodiversity Heritage Library), biomedical literature citations (MEDLINE) or digital full-text (PubMed Central), genomic (GenBank), clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov), and chemical (PubChem) resources; and (3) leverage vector space modeling techniques to predict the relevance of potential phyto-therapies. The success of this endeavor will set the stage for the translation of a growing, but currently disjointed, evidence-base of medicinal plant knowledge into tools for the elucidation of potential phyto-therapies. Furthermore, through achieving these aims, this project will also establish a first-of- its-kind in silico platform that could be extended to identify additional therapeutics from a broad spectrum of biodiversity sources. The core aspects of this project will build on experience with developing computational techniques to bridge biodiversity and biomedical knowledge, including those that have been pioneered by the research team.      This project will bring together biomedical informatics, library science, and ethnobotany experience and expertise from two institutions: the University of Vermont and The New York Botanical Garden. The multi- institutional and multi-PI aspects of this project support the feasibility of the proposed project aims and will furthermore enable the load-balancing of essential tasks such that they may meet the proposed milestones set for each aim. To this end, the success of the proposed endeavor will be built on a foundation of experiences in gathering ethnobotanical knowledge, analyzing and linking biodiversity and biomedical knowledge sources, and developing approaches for systematically annotating corpora for subsequent purposes in support of natural language processing and data mining pursuits.

"Improving the Efficiency and Efficacy in Authoring Essential Clinical FAQs DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Research plan: The use of clinical knowledge systems such as UpToDate that provide reliable information at the point of care has been shown to improve patient safety and decision-making. With similar content to UpToDate, Mayo Clinic's AskMayoExpert (AME) is an online knowledge system that primarily contains over 5000 (and increasing) specialist-vetted answers to FAQs for point of care use. However, because of the overabundance of clinical resources and guidelines, adding new answers manually to AME and ensuring that it is consistent with evidence is time consuming. This problem is also faced with other systems such as UpToDate. This career grant proposes to investigate the feasibility of using a novel text mining based informatics approach to semi-automate the management of a clinical knowledge system, using AME as the test bed. Although the methods will be applicable to any clinical knowledge system and any topic, they will be evaluated using two important test topics from cardiology (which has the biggest focus in AME) - atrial fibrillation (a topic exhaustively covered in AME) and congestive heart failure (a topic less covered, but is an increasingly complex vast field with knowledge from huge literature). While the existing content of AME is private, the methods and the code we develop to assist in generating the content will be released open-source as part of the Open Health Natural Language Processing (OHNLP) consortium in UIMA framework. Career plan: As most communication of information in clinical practice and biomedical research occurs through the medium of text, the development of methods to render this text computer-interpretable is a prerequisite to the use of this information to improve quality of care and support scientific discovery. The PI's long-term career goal is to become a leader in biomedical informatics (informatics applied to biomedical data), with focus on textual data such as scientific papers and clinical notes. He has BS in Computer Science, PhD in Biomedical Informatics and over a dozen of peer-reviewed publications in biomedical text mining. His career goal is to advance diverse methods and applications of text mining across biomedical informatics (BMI). He will focus on: a) discovering information needs and gaps that can be filled, b) adapting and extending existing text mining algorithms, and c) validating the utility of the applications in the biomedical environment. Rationale: Making the transition from a mentored researcher to an independent researcher requires three main facets of career growth: a) developing a working familiarity with clinical information systems and medical terminologies; b) understanding the information needs of clinicians; and c) training in clinical research. The proposal will translate the PI's knowledgeof the text mining methods to practical experience in an operation clinical environment. Courses listed in the ""Career Development/Training Activities"" will educate him more about the environment and train him on clinical research. He will continue sharpening his informatics expertise by attending scientific conferences. Project Narrative Medical errors are one of the leading causes of death in the United States. It has been observed that point of care access to relevant clinical knowledge support decision making and decreases medical errors, thereby improving patient safety and healthcare costs. The proposed research aims to empower physicians specialized in the area (specialists) in quickly gathering evidence from literature or finding citations supporting or qualifying their expert opinion. It will also generate the answers and suggest updates to the existing answers for their perusal.",Improving the Efficiency and Efficacy in Authoring Essential Clinical FAQs,8906938,R00LM011389,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Beds', 'Biomedical Research', 'Calculi', 'Cardiology', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Congestive Heart Failure', 'Cross-Over Studies', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Expert Opinion', 'Familiarity', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'General Practitioners', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Informatics', 'Information Retrieval Systems', 'Journals', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Medical', 'Medical Errors', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nurses', 'Paper', 'Peer Review', 'Physicians', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Qualifying', 'Quality of Care', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Semantics', 'Source', 'Specialist', 'System', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Translating', 'United States', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'Workload', 'Writing', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'computer science', 'empowered', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'improved', 'information gathering', 'medical information system', 'method development', 'novel', 'open source', 'operation', 'patient safety', 'point of care', 'statistics', 'symposium', 'text searching', 'usability']",NLM,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R00,2015,217378,0.022308800292773812
"COINSTAC: decentralized, scalable analysis of loosely coupled data ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     The brain imaging community is greatly benefiting from extensive data sharing efforts currently underway5,10. However, there is a significant gap in existing strategies which focus on anonymized, post-hoc sharing of either 1) full raw or preprocessed data [in the case of open studies] or 2) manually computed summary measures [such as hippocampal volume11, in the case of closed (or not yet shared) studies] which we propose to address. Current approaches to data sharing often include significant logistical hurdles both for the investigator sharing the dat as well as for the individual requesting the data (e.g. often times multiple data sharing agreements and approvals are required from US and international institutions). This needs to change, so that the scientific community becomes a venue where data can be collected, managed, widely shared and analyzed while also opening up access to the (many) data sets which are not currently available (see recent overview on this from our group2).    The large amount of existing data requires an approach that can analyze data in a distributed way while also leaving control of the source data with the individual investigator; this motivates  dynamic, decentralized way of approaching large scale analyses. We are proposing a peer-to-peer system called the Collaborative Informatics and Neuroimaging Suite Toolkit for Anonymous Computation (COINSTAC). The system will provide an independent, open, no-strings-attached tool that performs analysis on datasets distributed across different locations. Thus, the step of actually aggregating data can be avoided, while the strength of large-scale analyses can be retained. To achieve this, in Aim 1, the uniform data interfaces that we propose will make it easy to share and cooperate. Robust and novel quality assurance and replicability tools will also be incorporated. Collaboration and data sharing will be done through forming temporary (need and project-based) virtual clusters of studies performing automatically generated local computation on their respective data and aggregating statistics in global inference procedures. The communal organization will provide a continuous stream of large scale projects that can be formed and completed without the need of creating new rigid organizations or project-oriented storage vaults. In Aim 2, we develop, evaluate, and incorporate privacy-preserving algorithms to ensure that the data used are not re-identifiable even with multiple re-uses. We also will develop advanced distributed and privacy preserving approaches for several key multivariate families of algorithms (general linear model, matrix factorization [e.g. independent component analysis], classification) to estimate intrinsic networks and perform data fusion. Finally, in Aim 3, we will demonstrate the utility of this approach in a proof of concept study through distributed analyses of substance abuse datasets across national and international venues with multiple imaging modalities.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Hundreds of millions of dollars have been spent to collect human neuroimaging data for clinical and research purposes, many of which don't have data sharing agreements or collect sensitive data which are not easily shared, such as genetics. Opportunities for large scale aggregated analyses to infer health-relevant facts create new challenges in protecting the privacy of individuals' data. Open sharing of raw data, though desirable from the research perspective, and growing rapidly, is not a good solution for a large number of datasets which have additional privacy risks or IRB concerns. The COINSTAC solution we are proposing will capture this 'missing data' and allow for pooling of both open and 'closed' repositories by developing privacy preserving versions of widely-used algorithms and incorporating within an easy-to-use platform which enables distributed computation. In addition, COINSTAC will accelerate research on both open and closed data by offering a distributed computational solution for a large toolkit of widely used algorithms.                ","COINSTAC: decentralized, scalable analysis of loosely coupled data",8975906,R01DA040487,"['AODD relapse', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Agreement', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Brain imaging', 'Classification', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Consent Forms', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Ensure', 'Family', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Health', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'International', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Left', 'Letters', 'Linear Models', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Movement', 'Paper', 'Plant Roots', 'Poaceae', 'Population', 'Privacy', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Science', 'Site', 'Solutions', 'Stream', 'Substance abuse problem', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'base', 'computing resources', 'cost', 'data sharing', 'distributed data', 'flexibility', 'imaging modality', 'independent component analysis', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'peer', 'public health relevance', 'quality assurance', 'repository', 'statistics', 'tool', 'virtual']",NIDA,THE MIND RESEARCH NETWORK,R01,2015,727692,0.004430774485571943

"Collaborative Development of Biomedical Ontologies and Terminologies DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The construction of ontologies that define the entities in an application area and the relationships among them has become essential for modern work in biomedicine.  Ontologies help both humans and computers to manage burgeoning numbers of data.  The need to annotate, retrieve, and integrate high-throughput data sets, to process  natural language, and to build systems for decision support has set many communities  of biomedical investigators to work building large ontologies.  We developed and evaluated the Collaborative Prot¿g¿ system in the first phase of our research project. This software system has become an indispensable open-source resource for an international community of scientists who develop ontologies in a cooperative, distributed manner. In this competing renewal proposal, we describe novel data-driven methods and tools that promise to make collaborative ontology design both more streamlined and more principled. Our goal is to create a more empirical basis for ontology engineering, and to develop methods whereby the ontology-engineering enterprise both can profit from data regarding the underlying processes and those processes in turn can generate increasing amounts of data to inform future ontology-engineering activities.  Our research plan entails three specific aims. First, we will enable ontology developers to apply ontology-design patterns (ODPs) to their ontologies, and we will measure the way in which these patterns alter the ontology-engineering process. Second, we will analyze the vast amounts of log data that we collect from users of Collaborative Prot¿g¿ to understand the patterns of ontology development. We will use these patterns to recommend to developers areas of ontologies that may need their attention, facilitating the process of reaching consensus and making collaborative ontology engineering more efficient. Finally, we will use the extensive data collected by our group and others to understand how scientists reuse terms from various ontologies and we will use these emerging patterns to facilitate term reuse. Each of these analyses not only will increase our understanding of collaboration in scientific modeling, but also will lead to new technology within our Collaborative Prot¿g¿ suite that will improve the ontology-development process and make collaboration among biomedical scientists more efficient. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Collaborative Prot�g� is a software system that helps a burgeoning user community to cooperate in developing ontologies that enhance biomedical research and improve patient care. Collaborative Prot�g� supports scientists, clinician researchers, and workers in informatics to build ontologies to solve problems in data annotation, data integration, information retrieval, natural-language processing, electronic patient record systems, and decision support. The proposed research will develop data-driven methods to identify patterns in design, development, and use of ontologies, and will apply these methods to help us to build new technology that both facilitates the ontology-development process and makes ontology design more principled.",Collaborative Development of Biomedical Ontologies and Terminologies,8803385,R01GM086587,"['Address', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Biomedical Research', 'Classification', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computerized Patient Records', 'Computers', 'Consensus', 'Craniofacial Abnormalities', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Engineering', 'FaceBase', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Informatics', 'Information Retrieval', 'International', 'International Classification of Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'NCI Thesaurus', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Ontology', 'Parasites', 'Patient Care', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Scientist', 'Software Design', 'Software Engineering', 'Specialist', 'System', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Thesauri', 'Time', 'Traditional Medicine', 'Work', 'base', 'biomedical ontology', 'biomedical resource', 'biomedical scientist', 'craniofacial development', 'data integration', 'design', 'experience', 'improved', 'interoperability', 'new technology', 'novel', 'open source', 'repository', 'software systems', 'tool', 'tool development']",NIGMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,523965,0.02018373861887297
"Protege: An Ontology-Development Platform for Biomedical Scientists DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The engineering of ontologies that define the entities in an application area and the relationships among them has become essential for modern work in  biomedicine.  Ontologies help both humans and computers to manage burgeoning numbers of data.  The need to annotate, retrieve, and integrate high-throughput data sets, to process natural language, and to build systems for decision support has set many communities of investigators to work building large ontologies. The Protégé system has become an indispensable open-source resource for an enormous internationa community of scientists-supporting the development, maintenance, and use of ontologies and electronic knowledge bases by biomedical investigators everywhere. The number of registered Protégé users has grown from 3,500 in 2002 to more than 195,000 users as of this writing. To date, however, the use of ontologies in biomedicine has been limited by the complexity of the ontology-development tools, which often make ontologies inaccessible to many biomedical scientists.  In this proposal, we will develop new methods and tools that will significantly lower the barrier of entry for ontology development, expanding Protégé to provide intuitive and user-friendly ontology-acquisition methods throughout the ontology lifecycle.  Our plan entails five specific aims.  First, we will develop methods that enable initial specification of ontology terms in an informal manner, using lists and diagrams.  Scientists will be able to start modeling their domain without having to think in terms of formal ontological distinctions. Second, we will provide intuitive, easy-to-use tools for ontology specification that will aid developers as they start to formalize their models.  Third, we will track the requirements that an ontology must address and develop novel  methods  for  evaluating  ontology  coverage  based  on  these  requirements.  Fourth, for ontologies that inherently have complex internal structure that cannot be represented fully using only simple ontology constructs, we will develop methods that will create templates covering regular structures in the ontology. Scientists will then be able to fill out forms based o these templates, with Protégé generating the corresponding logical structure in the background.  Fifth, we will continue to expand and support the thriving Protégé user community, as it expands to include the biomedical scientists who will now be able to build the ontologies to support their data-driven research and discoveries. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Protégé is a software system that helps a burgeoning user community to develop ontologies that enhance biomedical research and improve patient care.  Protégé supports scientists, clinician researchers, and workers in informatics in data annotation, data integration, information retrieval, natural-language processing, electronic patient record systems, and decision-support systems.

"HIGH THROUGHPUT LITERATURE CURATION OF GENETIC REGULATION IN BACTERIAL MODELS     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The aim of this proposal is to implement a novel way of processing and accessing the vast detailed knowledge contained within collections of scientific publications on the regulation of transcription initiation in bacterial models. In princple, this model for processing and reading information and new knowledge is applicable to other biological domains, potentially benefiting any area of biomedical knowledge. It is certainly criticl to generate new strategies to cope with the ever-increasing amount of knowledge generated in genomics and in biomedical research at large. Improving the efficiency of the traditional high-quality manual curation of scientific publications will enable us also to expand the type of biological knowledge, beyond mechanisms and their elements in the genome, to start including their connections with larger regulated processes and eventually physiological properties of the cell. We will first implement the necessary technology to improve our curation by means of a computational system that has text mining capabilities for preprocessing the papers before a human expert curator identifies which sentences contain the information that is to be added to the database. Premarked options selected by the curators will accelerate their decisions. The accumulative precise mapping between sentences and curated knowledge will provide training sets for text mining technologies to improve their automatic extraction. The curator practices will become more efficient, enabling us to curate selected high-impact published reviews to place mechanisms into a rich context of their physiological processes and general biology. Another relevant component of our proposal is the improved modeling of regulated processes by means of new concepts in biology that capture larger collections of coregulated genes and their concatenated reactions. Starting from all interactions of a local regulator, coregulated regulators and their domain of action will be incorporated to construct the biobricks of complex decisions, as they are encoded in the genome. These are conceptual containers that capture the organization of knowledge to describe the genetic programming of cellular capabilities. These proposals will be formalized and proposed within an international consortium focused in enriching standard models or ontologies of gene regulation for use by the scientific community. Finally, a portal to navigate across all the sentences of a given corpus of a large number (more than 5,000) of related papers will be implemented. The different avenues of navigation will essentially use two technologies, one dealing with automatically generating simpler sentences from original sentences as input, and the other one with the classification of papers based on their theme or ontology. Their combination will enable a novel navigation reading system. If we achieve our aims, this project will give a proof-of-principle prototype with clearly innovative higher levels of large amounts of integrated knowledge. Future directions may adapt these concepts and methods to the biology of higher organisms, including humans.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Scientific knowledge reported within publications provides a wealth of knowledge that we barely capture in databases for genomics. Enhancing the effectiveness of the processing and representation of all this knowledge will change the way we encode our understanding of concatenated interactions that are organized into networks and processes governing cell behavior. Given the conservation in evolution of the nature of biological complexity, a better encoding of our understanding of a bacterial cell shall influence that of any other living organism.            ",HIGH THROUGHPUT LITERATURE CURATION OF GENETIC REGULATION IN BACTERIAL MODELS,8817212,R01GM110597,"['Area', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Model', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Books', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Effectiveness', 'Elements', 'Escherichia coli', 'Evolution', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Programming', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Indium', 'International', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Letters', 'Life', 'Linguistics', 'Literature', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Ontology', 'Operon', 'Organism', 'Paper', 'Physiological', 'Physiological Processes', 'Process', 'Property', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Reaction', 'Reading', 'Regulation', 'Regulon', 'Reporting', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Solid', 'Source', 'System', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Training', 'Transcription Initiation', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'base', 'cell behavior', 'coping', 'digital', 'experience', 'feeding', 'functional genomics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'member', 'microbial community', 'model organisms databases', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'promoter', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'software development', 'text searching', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'usability']",NIGMS,CENTER FOR GENOMIC SCIENCES,R01,2015,406247,0.015588267712223285
"Exploring Natural Language Processing, Image Processing, Machine Learning, and Us DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Most biomedical text mining systems target only text information and do not provide intelligent access to other important data such as Figures. More than any other documentation, figures usually represent the ""evidence"" of discovery in the biomedical literature. Full-text biomedical articles nearly always incorporate images that are the crucial content of biomedical knowledge discovery. Biomedical scientists need to access images to validate research facts and to formulate or to test novel research hypotheses. Evaluation has shown that textual statements reported in the literature are frequently noisy (i.e., contain ""false facts""). Capturing images that are essentially experimental ""evidence"" to support the textual ""fact"" will benefit biomedical information systems, databases, and biomedical scientists. We are developing a biomedical literature figure search engine BioFigureSearch. We develop innovative algorithms and models in natural language processing, image processing, machine learning and user interfacing. The deliverables will be novel biomedical natural language figure processing (bNLfP) algorithms and iBioFigureSearch allowing biomedical scientists to access figure data effectively, and open-source tools that will enhance biomedical information retrieval, summarization, and question answering. The bNLfP algorithms we will be developing can be applied or integrated into other biomedical text-mining systems. This project proposes innovative algorithms and models in natural language processing, image processing, machine learning, and user interfacing, to return figures in response to biomedical queries. It is anticipated that the algorithms, models, and tools developed will significantly enhance biomedical scientists' access to figures reported in literature, and thereby expedite biomedical knowledge discovery.","Exploring Natural Language Processing, Image Processing, Machine Learning, and Us",8734439,R01GM095476,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biomedical Computing', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Comprehension', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Evaluation', 'Genomics', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Information Retrieval', 'Information Retrieval Systems', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Libraries', 'Licensing', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Process', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Proteins', 'PubMed', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Reading', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrieval', 'Semantics', 'System', 'T-Cell Receptor-Rearrangement Excision DNA Circles', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Validation', 'abstracting', 'base', 'biomedical information system', 'biomedical scientist', 'design', 'genome-wide', 'image processing', 'improved', 'innovation', 'medical schools', 'natural language', 'novel', 'open source', 'response', 'text searching', 'tool']",NIGMS,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,R01,2014,489755,0.02016079881858275
"GPU COMPUTING RESOURCE TO ENABLE INNOVATION IN IMAGING AND NETWORK BIOLOGY     DESCRIPTION:  Many complex diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular disorders, and schizophrenia may be understood as failures in the functioning of nested hierarchies of biomolecular and cellular networks. These nested hierarchies control a range of processes including the differentiation and migration of cells, remodeling of extracellular matrices and tissues, and information encoding in neuronal subsystems. Washington University has established expertise in cutting edge imaging, molecular biology and genomic technologies synergistic with computational approaches such as machine learning and unraveling the principles of hierarchical organization and dynamics of complex systems. This collective expertise is being leveraged to develop new drugs, improve our ability to interpret sophisticated imaging data, understand how populations of neurons act collectively to accomplish complex tasks, and model the onset and progression of complex diseases as dynamical rewiring of hierarchical, multi-scale networks. Biological network analyses provide a rich set of tools for organizing and interpreting the vast quantities of data produced by state-of-the-art experimental protocols. The rapid advancement of computationally intensive research in these areas is outstripping the capabilities of CPU-based high performance computing (HPC) systems. This application would support the acquisition and integration of a large-scale IBM high performance cluster of Graphics Processor Units (GPUs) to be added as an upgrade to the existing IBM-designed Heterogeneous High Performance Computing environment to form a state-of-the-art hybrid computing capability. Such a resource is essential to match the growing need for high performance computing at Washington University and to support state of the art research software applications that are optimized for GPU computing. The acquisition and integration of a high performance GPU cluster will solve critical computing challenges that exist within Washington University's growing NIH research portfolio. The proposed state-of-the-art hybrid GPU/CPU computing capabilities will be deployed within the framework of a stable, productive and rapidly growing resource center. The addition of high-capacity GPU computing capabilities will allow critical calculation to be performed in hours instead of days and enable substantial increases in productivity for existing projects covering a broad range of application areas as well as enabling new research directions.             n/a",GPU COMPUTING RESOURCE TO ENABLE INNOVATION IN IMAGING AND NETWORK BIOLOGY,8640341,S10OD018091,"['Area', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Complex', 'Computer Systems', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Failure', 'Genomics', 'High Performance Computing', 'Hour', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Biology', 'Neurons', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Schizophrenia', 'System', 'Technology', 'Tissues', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'base', 'cell motility', 'computing resources', 'design', 'improved', 'innovation', 'tool']",OD,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,S10,2014,597700,-0.0007912864726675622
"The Center for Predictive Computational Phenotyping-1 Overall     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The biomedical sciences are being radically transformed by advances in our ability to monitor, record, store and integrate information characterizing human biology and health at scales that range from individual molecules to large populations of subjects. This wealth of information has the potential to substantially advance both our understanding of human biology and our ability to improve human health. Perhaps the most central and general approach for exploiting biomedical data is to use methods from machine learning and statistical modeling to infer predictive models. Such models take as input observable data representing some object of interest, and produce as output a prediction about a particular, unobservable property of the object. This approach has proven to be of high value for a wide range of biomedical tasks, but numerous significant challenges remain to be solved in order for the full potential of predictive modeling to be realized.  To address these challenges, we propose to establish The Center for Predictive Computational Phenotyping (CPCP). Our proposed center will focus on a broad range of problems that can be cast as computational phenotyping. Although some phenotypes are easily measured and interpreted, and are available in an accessible format, a wide range of scientifically and clinically important phenotypes do not satisfy these criteria. In such cases, computational phenotyping methods are required either to (i) extract a relevant  phenotype from a complex data source or collection of heterogeneous data sources, (ii) predict clinically  important phenotypes before they are exhibited, or (iii) do both in the same application.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We will develop innovative new approaches and tools that are able to discover, and make crucial inferences with large data sets that include molecular profiles, medical images, electronic health records, population-level data, and various combinations of these and other data types.

"Building an open-source cloud-based computational platform to improve data access   We propose to develop a novel, cost-effective, cloud-based data and analytics platform that will provide efficient data storage solutions and enhanced analytics, annotation and reporting capabilities for supporting and accelerating clinical and molecular research in the treatment of substance use disorders (SUD). This open source platform, which leverages existing BioDX technology, will provide a centralized, multi-user environment that enables and encourages collaborative research and information dissemination among team members.  One of the unmet infrastructural challenges of modern molecular research is the availability of computational platforms that allow the management of large databases, easy access to data, the availability of powerful customizable tools for data mining, analysis and visualization, and integration of different data sources to allow successful analysis of complex data problems. Such problems are commonplace in high- throughput molecular research. This proposal aims to fill this gap by developing a robust platform that integrates state-of-the-art open-source technologies for data storage, data access, data mining and analysis, annotation, visualization and reporting.  We previously developed a cloud-based BioDatomics platform for Next Generation Sequencing (NGS), BioDX, which has been successful and has been used commercially by several clients. This proposal aims to develop a new platform leveraging our experience with the BioDX platform that integrates: data storage and real-time data querying using Cloudera Impala; powerful and customizable analytics tools using R and its derivative Bioconductor suite of programs for bioinformatics; annotation integration and reporting which is an existing feature of BioDX; and a visual programming interface that will simplify and enhance the development and maintenance of reproducible analytics workflows. We believe this powerful integrated data platform, if successful, will enable real-time collaboration, dramatically reduce data repository costs, and increase the efficiency and efficacy of data analyses for translating experimental data into actionable research products.  We are committed to analyzing stakeholder needs and optimizing hardware, software and information technology systems to meet their demands. This platform will enhance stakeholder capabilities for developing, implementing and testing various models for substance addiction, risky behavior, discovery of molecular targets for treatment, genomic profiling of patients and other relevant scientific questions. Users will have access to modern statistical, machine learning, data mining and visualization tools.  The initial phase of work will involve development of the platform, optimizing performance on the cloud and testing the integration of new technology. BioDatomics is committed to funding the next phase of work which will include usability testing and finalizing a commercial product, following which full commercialization will proceed. Preliminary commercialization plans have demonstrated that the project has the capacity to generate a million dollars in revenue during the first full year after commercial release.  The ultimate beneficiaries of this platform will be government agencies, academic researchers and pharmaceutical companies pursuing collaborative projects to discover treatments for substance abuse disorders. This open source platform will enable significant savings to the end users in terms of data storage and analytic capabilities, and promises to have a major impact in increasing the success of molecular, clinical and translational research for substance abuse disorders.

"Developing and applying information extraction resources and technology to create     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Building on 8 years of highly productive work in technology development that included the creation of the Colorado Richly Annotated Full Text corpus (CRAFT), we hypothesize that text mining resources and methods are approaching the level of maturity required to productively process a significant proportion of the full text biomedical literature to create a well-represented formal knowledge base of molecular biology. We propose a detailed, integrated plan to achieve this long-standing goal. Success in this effort will make possible a transformative new way for the biomedical research community to identify access and integrate existing knowledge, breaking down disciplinary boundaries and other silos that have kept scientists from fully exploiting relevant prior results in their research.      Our successes in the prior funding period broadened the applicability of biomedical concept identification systems to a much wider set of tasks, demonstrating the ability to target multiple community-curated ontologies in text mining, and generate scientifically significant insights from the results. The proposed work would take advantage of the resources we produced to transcend several of the limitations of previous efforts. We propose innovative new approaches to formal knowledge representation and to characterizing relationships between textual elements and semantic content. We will design, implement and evaluate computational systems that have the potential to transform enormous text collections into semantically rich, logic-based, standards-compliant, formal representations of biomedical knowledge with clearly identified provenance. The resulting representations will express complex assertions about a very wide range of entities, processes, qualities, and, most importantly, their specific relationships with one another.              Program Director/Principal Investigator (Last, First, Middle): Hunter, Lawrence E.

"In silico identification of phyto-therapies     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Plants have been acknowledged as forming the basis of medicines dating back to the most ancient civilizations. To complement synthetic drug discovery processes, there remains a significant opportunity for identifying potential new therapies from plant-based sources (""phyto-therapies""). Current approaches used for the discovery of potential phyto-therapies are laborious, time-consuming, and mostly manual. The increased availability of ethnobotanical and biomedical knowledge in digital formats suggests that there may be the potential to leverage automated techniques to facilitate the phyto-therapy discovery process. The long-term goal of this initiative is thus to develop a semantically integrated framework that could be used to identify and validate potential phyto-therapies embedded within ethnobotanical and biomedical knowledge sources, and thus encourage the conservation of this knowledge and biodiversity. The overall project is built around three major aims, which are to: (1) develop a standards-driven gold standard that can be used for benchmarking automated phyto-therapy identification approaches; (2) develop an automated approach to identify potential phyto-therapies from digitized biodiversity literature (Biodiversity Heritage Library), biomedical literature citations (MEDLINE) or digital full-text (PubMed Central), genomic (GenBank), clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov), and chemical (PubChem) resources; and (3) leverage vector space modeling techniques to predict the relevance of potential phyto-therapies. The success of this endeavor will set the stage for the translation of a growing, but currently disjointed, evidence-base of medicinal plant knowledge into tools for the elucidation of potential phyto-therapies. Furthermore, through achieving these aims, this project will also establish a first-of- its-kind in silico platform that could be extended to identify additional therapeutics from a broad spectrum of biodiversity sources. The core aspects of this project will build on experience with developing computational techniques to bridge biodiversity and biomedical knowledge, including those that have been pioneered by the research team.      This project will bring together biomedical informatics, library science, and ethnobotany experience and expertise from two institutions: the University of Vermont and The New York Botanical Garden. The multi- institutional and multi-PI aspects of this project support the feasibility of the proposed project aims and will furthermore enable the load-balancing of essential tasks such that they may meet the proposed milestones set for each aim. To this end, the success of the proposed endeavor will be built on a foundation of experiences in gathering ethnobotanical knowledge, analyzing and linking biodiversity and biomedical knowledge sources, and developing approaches for systematically annotating corpora for subsequent purposes in support of natural language processing and data mining pursuits.                RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH  The identification of potential therapies is a significant area of research with direct public health implications. As such, the integration of knowledge from traditionally disjoint knowledge sources may offer a more holistic view of the ethnobotanical and biomedical research knowledge that can support the development of new disease treatment regimens.

"Improving the Efficiency and Efficacy in Authoring Essential Clinical FAQs     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Research plan: The use of clinical knowledge systems such as UpToDate that provide reliable information at the point of care has been shown to improve patient safety and decision-making. With similar content to UpToDate, Mayo Clinic's AskMayoExpert (AME) is an online knowledge system that primarily contains over 5000 (and increasing) specialist-vetted answers to FAQs for point of care use. However, because of the overabundance of clinical resources and guidelines, adding new answers manually to AME and ensuring that it is consistent with evidence is time consuming. This problem is also faced with other systems such as UpToDate. This career grant proposes to investigate the feasibility of using a novel text mining based informatics approach to semi-automate the management of a clinical knowledge system, using AME as the test bed. Although the methods will be applicable to any clinical knowledge system and any topic, they will be evaluated using two important test topics from cardiology (which has the biggest focus in AME) - atrial fibrillation (a topic exhaustively covered in AME) and congestive heart failure (a topic less covered, but is an increasingly complex vast field with knowledge from huge literature). While the existing content of AME is private, the methods and the code we develop to assist in generating the content will be released open-source as part of the Open Health Natural Language Processing (OHNLP) consortium in UIMA framework. Career plan: As most communication of information in clinical practice and biomedical research occurs through the medium of text, the development of methods to render this text computer-interpretable is a prerequisite to the use of this information to improve quality of care and support scientific discovery. The PI's long-term career goal is to become a leader in biomedical informatics (informatics applied to biomedical data), with focus on textual data such as scientific papers and clinical notes. He has BS in Computer Science, PhD in Biomedical Informatics and over a dozen of peer-reviewed publications in biomedical text mining. His career goal is to advance diverse methods and applications of text mining across biomedical informatics (BMI). He will focus on: a) discovering information needs and gaps that can be filled, b) adapting and extending existing text mining algorithms, and c) validating the utility of the applications in the biomedical environment. Rationale: Making the transition from a mentored researcher to an independent researcher requires three main facets of career growth: a) developing a working familiarity with clinical information systems and medical terminologies; b) understanding the information needs of clinicians; and c) training in clinical research. The proposal will translate the PI's knowledgeof the text mining methods to practical experience in an operation clinical environment. Courses listed in the ""Career Development/Training Activities"" will educate him more about the environment and train him on clinical research. He will continue sharpening his informatics expertise by attending scientific conferences.             Project Narrative Medical errors are one of the leading causes of death in the United States. It has been observed that point of care access to relevant clinical knowledge support decision making and decreases medical errors, thereby improving patient safety and healthcare costs. The proposed research aims to empower physicians specialized in the area (specialists) in quickly gathering evidence from literature or finding citations supporting or qualifying their expert opinion. It will also generate the answers and suggest updates to the existing answers for their perusal.",Improving the Efficiency and Efficacy in Authoring Essential Clinical FAQs,8727093,R00LM011389,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Beds', 'Biomedical Research', 'Calculi', 'Cardiology', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Congestive Heart Failure', 'Cross-Over Studies', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Expert Opinion', 'Familiarity', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'General Practitioners', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Informatics', 'Information Retrieval Systems', 'Journals', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Medical', 'Medical Errors', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nurses', 'Paper', 'Peer Review', 'Physicians', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Qualifying', 'Quality of Care', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Semantics', 'Source', 'Specialist', 'System', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Translating', 'United States', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'Workload', 'Writing', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'computer science', 'empowered', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'improved', 'information gathering', 'medical information system', 'method development', 'novel', 'open source', 'operation', 'patient safety', 'point of care', 'statistics', 'symposium', 'text searching', 'usability']",NLM,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R00,2014,223898,0.022308800292773812

"Ontology-Driven Methods for Knowledge Acquisition and Knowledge Discovery    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       A great challenge in the biomedical informatics domain is to develop computational methods that combine existing knowledge and experimental data to derive new knowledge regarding biological systems and disease mechanisms. Most knowledge regarding genes and proteins in biomedical literature is stored in the form of free text that is not suitable for computation, and the manual processes of encoding this body of knowledge into computable form cannot keep up with the rate of knowledge accumulation. The main thrust of the proposed research is to design novel statistical text-mining algorithms to acquire and represent knowledge regarding genes and proteins from free-text literature, and further to combine this acquired knowledge with experimental data to derive new knowledge. We will organize the proposed research to the following specific aims. Specific Aim 1. Develop ontology-guided semantic modeling algorithms for extracting biological concepts from free text, in which we will design hierarchical probabilistic topic models that are capable of representing biological concepts as a hierarchy and develop novel learning algorithms to infer biological concepts from free-text documents. Specific Aim 2. Integrate semantic modeling with BioNLP to extract textual evidence supporting protein-function annotations. We will develop information extraction algorithms that will combine the results of hierarchical semantic analysis and BioNLP to identify the text regions that will most likely provide evidence regarding the function of genes/proteins and map the extracted information to a controlled vocabulary. Specific Aim 3. Develop a framework to unify the procedures of knowledge reasoning and data mining for knowledge discovery. In this aim, we will reason using existing knowledge (represented in the form of an ontology) to reveal functional modules among the genes from the experimental data. We will then further develop algorithms that will reveal relationships between these gene modules by mining system-scaled experimental data. The overall framework will integrate functional reasoning and data mining in an iterative manner to refine the knowledge progressively and to derive rules such as: when genes involved in biological process X are perturbed, genes involved in biological process Y will respond. We will test the framework on the data from yeast-system biology studies and the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project to gain insights into the cellular systems and disease mechanisms of cancer cells.           In recent decades, biomedical sciences have achieved significant advances; most of the knowledge resulting from research is stored in the form of biomedical literature in the form free-text. This project develop computational approaches to extract knowledge from biomedical literature, represent the knowledge in computable form, and combined the knowledge with experiment data to gain insights into biological systems and disease mechanisms",Ontology-Driven Methods for Knowledge Acquisition and Knowledge Discovery,8714053,R01LM011155,"['Accounting', 'Achievement', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biomedical Research', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Controlled Vocabulary', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Knowledge acquisition', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Ontology', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Psyche structure', 'Research', 'Science', 'Semantics', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Training', 'Tweens', 'Yeasts', 'biological systems', 'biomedical informatics', 'cancer cell', 'data mining', 'design', 'insight', 'interest', 'knowledge of results', 'novel', 'protein function', 'protein protein interaction', 'research study', 'text searching']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2014,307471,0.02333953800180474
"Collaborative Development of Biomedical Ontologies and Terminologies     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The construction of ontologies that define the entities in an application area and the relationships among them has become essential for modern work in biomedicine.  Ontologies help both humans and computers to manage burgeoning numbers of data.  The need to annotate, retrieve, and integrate high-throughput data sets, to process  natural language, and to build systems for decision support has set many communities  of biomedical investigators to work building large ontologies.  We developed and evaluated the Collaborative Prot¿g¿ system in the first phase of our research project. This software system has become an indispensable open-source resource for an international community of scientists who develop ontologies in a cooperative, distributed manner. In this competing renewal proposal, we describe novel data-driven methods and tools that promise to make collaborative ontology design both more streamlined and more principled. Our goal is to create a more empirical basis for ontology engineering, and to develop methods whereby the ontology-engineering enterprise both can profit from data regarding the underlying processes and those processes in turn can generate increasing amounts of data to inform future ontology-engineering activities.  Our research plan entails three specific aims. First, we will enable ontology developers to apply ontology-design patterns (ODPs) to their ontologies, and we will measure the way in which these patterns alter the ontology-engineering process. Second, we will analyze the vast amounts of log data that we collect from users of Collaborative Prot¿g¿ to understand the patterns of ontology development. We will use these patterns to recommend to developers areas of ontologies that may need their attention, facilitating the process of reaching consensus and making collaborative ontology engineering more efficient. Finally, we will use the extensive data collected by our group and others to understand how scientists reuse terms from various ontologies and we will use these emerging patterns to facilitate term reuse. Each of these analyses not only will increase our understanding of collaboration in scientific modeling, but also will lead to new technology within our Collaborative Prot¿g¿ suite that will improve the ontology-development process and make collaboration among biomedical scientists more efficient.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Collaborative Prot�g� is a software system that helps a burgeoning user community to cooperate in developing ontologies that enhance biomedical research and improve patient care. Collaborative Prot�g� supports scientists, clinician researchers, and workers in informatics to build ontologies to solve problems in data annotation, data integration, information retrieval, natural-language processing, electronic patient record systems, and decision support. The proposed research will develop data-driven methods to identify patterns in design, development, and use of ontologies, and will apply these methods to help us to build new technology that both facilitates the ontology-development process and makes ontology design more principled.            ",Collaborative Development of Biomedical Ontologies and Terminologies,8628132,R01GM086587,"['Address', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Biomedical Research', 'Classification', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computerized Patient Records', 'Computers', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Engineering', 'FaceBase', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Informatics', 'Information Retrieval', 'International', 'International Classification of Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'NCI Thesaurus', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Ontology', 'Parasites', 'Patient Care', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Scientist', 'Software Design', 'Software Engineering', 'Specialist', 'System', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Thesauri', 'Time', 'Traditional Medicine', 'Work', 'base', 'biomedical ontology', 'biomedical resource', 'biomedical scientist', 'craniofacial', 'data integration', 'design', 'experience', 'improved', 'interoperability', 'malformation', 'new technology', 'novel', 'open source', 'public health relevance', 'repository', 'software systems', 'tool', 'tool development']",NIGMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2014,525880,0.02018373861887297
"Protege: An Ontology-Development Platform for Biomedical Scientists     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The engineering of ontologies that define the entities in an application area and the relationships among them has become essential for modern work in  biomedicine.  Ontologies help both humans and computers to manage burgeoning numbers of data.  The need to annotate, retrieve, and integrate high-throughput data sets, to process natural language, and to build systems for decision support has set many communities of investigators to work building large ontologies. The Prot¿g¿ system has become an indispensable open-source resource for an enormous internationa community of scientists-supporting the development, maintenance, and use of ontologies and electronic knowledge bases by biomedical investigators everywhere. The number of registered Prot¿g¿ users has grown from 3,500 in 2002 to more than 195,000 users as of this writing. To date, however, the use of ontologies in biomedicine has been limited by the complexity of the ontology-development tools, which often make ontologies inaccessible to many biomedical scientists.  In this proposal, we will develop new methods and tools that will significantly lower the barrier of entry for ontology development, expanding Prot¿g¿ to provide intuitive and user-friendly ontology-acquisition methods throughout the ontology lifecycle.  Our plan entails five specific aims.  First, we will develop methods that enable initial specification of ontology terms in an informal manner, using lists and diagrams.  Scientists will be able to start modeling their domain without having to think in terms of formal ontological distinctions. Second, we will provide intuitive, easy-to-use tools for ontology specification that will aid developers as they start to formalize their models.  Third, we will track the requirements that an ontology must address and develop novel  methods  for  evaluating  ontology  coverage  based  on  these  requirements.  Fourth, for ontologies that inherently have complex internal structure that cannot be represented fully using only simple ontology constructs, we will develop methods that will create templates covering regular structures in the ontology. Scientists will then be able to fill out forms based o these templates, with Prot¿g¿ generating the corresponding logical structure in the background.

"Exploring Natural Language Processing, Image Processing, Machine Learning, and Us DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Most biomedical text mining systems target only text information and do not provide intelligent access to other important data such as Figures. More than any other documentation, figures usually represent the ""evidence"" of discovery in the biomedical literature. Full-text biomedical articles nearly always incorporate images that are the crucial content of biomedical knowledge discovery. Biomedical scientists need to access images to validate research facts and to formulate or to test novel research hypotheses. Evaluation has shown that textual statements reported in the literature are frequently noisy (i.e., contain ""false facts""). Capturing images that are essentially experimental ""evidence"" to support the textual ""fact"" will benefit biomedical information systems, databases, and biomedical scientists. We are developing a biomedical literature figure search engine BioFigureSearch. We develop innovative algorithms and models in natural language processing, image processing, machine learning and user interfacing. The deliverables will be novel biomedical natural language figure processing (bNLfP) algorithms and iBioFigureSearch allowing biomedical scientists to access figure data effectively, and open-source tools that will enhance biomedical information retrieval, summarization, and question answering. The bNLfP algorithms we will be developing can be applied or integrated into other biomedical text-mining systems. This project proposes innovative algorithms and models in natural language processing, image processing, machine learning, and user interfacing, to return figures in response to biomedical queries. It is anticipated that the algorithms, models, and tools developed will significantly enhance biomedical scientists' access to figures reported in literature, and thereby expedite biomedical knowledge discovery.","Exploring Natural Language Processing, Image Processing, Machine Learning, and Us",8474789,R01GM095476,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biomedical Computing', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Comprehension', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Evaluation', 'Genomics', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Information Retrieval', 'Information Retrieval Systems', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Libraries', 'Licensing', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Process', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Proteins', 'PubMed', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Reading', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrieval', 'Semantics', 'System', 'T-Cell Receptor-Rearrangement Excision DNA Circles', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Validation', 'abstracting', 'base', 'biomedical information system', 'biomedical scientist', 'design', 'genome-wide', 'image processing', 'improved', 'innovation', 'medical schools', 'natural language', 'novel', 'open source', 'response', 'text searching', 'tool']",NIGMS,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,R01,2013,486484,0.02016079881858275

"Informatics Infrastructure for vector-based neuroanatomical atlases  Abstract The adage: 'all data is spatial' is especially pertinent in the field of neuroscience, since neuronal data must be indexed by the neuroanatomical location of phenomena or entities under study. Brain atlases are very widely used as laboratory tools, being some of the most highly cited publications in science. This proposal seeks to use brain atlases as a method for indexing data from the literature in a neuroinformatics system. This data includes both textual and graphical information, ranging from highly detailed maps constructed from vector- based spatial primitives, histological photographs and drawings, to textual reports of experimental findings in the literature (which we will analyze on a large scale). These data represent a significant scientific investment that are currently locked away in previously published journal articles (and the detailed data-sets and drawings from researchers that were used to write the articles). A prototype that summarizes the last fifteen years' output of one of the world's most prominent neuroanatomy laboratories is immediately available. This project will develop a collaborative environment to enable neuroscientists to use these valuable maps within the community as a whole by contributing data to a shared system with an open-source system (called 'NeuARt II') that permits querying, overlaying, viewing and annotating such data in an integrated manner. We will also use Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to index neuroanatomical references in large numbers of journal articles to be accessible within our infrastructure. As an initial text corpus, we over 110,000 documents taken from last 35 years of published information from the primary neuroanatomical literature. We will construct a neuroanatomical interface that conceptually resembles the 'Google Maps' system, permitting users to use an intuitive spatial interface to browse large amounts of biomedical data in spatial register. The proposed infrastructure will also provide new opportunities to compare and synthesize the anatomical components of neuroscience data multiple modalities (physiological, behavioral, clinical, genetic, molecular, etc.).  Narrative Given the scope of the use of neuroanatomical maps from the rat and mouse in the study of neurobiological disease, we expect our research impact scientists working in almost all subfields of the subject. Our collaborators who form the early adopters of this approach are neuroendocrinology researchers studying the mechanisms of stress and anxiety disorders which are estimated to affect 19.1 million people in the USA, costing $42 billion in health care costs per year (source: Anxiety Disorders Association of America). A better understanding of the neuronal mechanisms underlying these disorders could lead to new, effective therapies and treatments.",Informatics Infrastructure for vector-based neuroanatomical atlases,8426190,R01MH079068,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Americas', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Atlases', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Community Outreach', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Fluoro-Gold', 'Harvest', 'Health Care Costs', 'Image', 'Informatics', 'Investments', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Mus', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurobiology', 'Neuroendocrinology', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Online Systems', 'Output', 'Paper', 'Physiological', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Rattus', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Semantics', 'Source', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Text', 'Tissues', 'Work', 'Writing', 'abstracting', 'base', 'biomedical ontology', 'cost', 'effective therapy', 'indexing', 'journal article', 'neuroinformatics', 'novel', 'open source', 'prototype', 'research study', 'stress disorder', 'text searching', 'tool', 'vector', 'web services']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2013,315672,0.008218227915421261
"The Cardiovascular Research Grid DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    The Cardiovascular Research Grid (CVRG) Project is an R24 resource supporting the informatics needs of the cardiovascular (CV) research community. The CVRG Project has developed and deployed unique core technology for management and analysis of CV data that is being used in a broad range of Driving Biomedical Projects (DBFs). This includes: a) tools for storing and managing different types of biomedical data; b) methods for securing the data; c) tools for querying combinations of these data so that users may mine their data for new knowledge; d) new statistical learning methods for biomarker discovery; e) novel tools that analyze image data on heart shape and motion to discover biomarkers that are indicative of disease; f) tools for managing, analyzing, and annotating ECG data.

"Ontology-Driven Methods for Knowledge Acquisition and Knowledge Discovery    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       A great challenge in the biomedical informatics domain is to develop computational methods that combine existing knowledge and experimental data to derive new knowledge regarding biological systems and disease mechanisms. Most knowledge regarding genes and proteins in biomedical literature is stored in the form of free text that is not suitable for computation, and the manual processes of encoding this body of knowledge into computable form cannot keep up with the rate of knowledge accumulation. The main thrust of the proposed research is to design novel statistical text-mining algorithms to acquire and represent knowledge regarding genes and proteins from free-text literature, and further to combine this acquired knowledge with experimental data to derive new knowledge. We will organize the proposed research to the following specific aims. Specific Aim 1. Develop ontology-guided semantic modeling algorithms for extracting biological concepts from free text, in which we will design hierarchical probabilistic topic models that are capable of representing biological concepts as a hierarchy and develop novel learning algorithms to infer biological concepts from free-text documents. Specific Aim 2. Integrate semantic modeling with BioNLP to extract textual evidence supporting protein-function annotations. We will develop information extraction algorithms that will combine the results of hierarchical semantic analysis and BioNLP to identify the text regions that will most likely provide evidence regarding the function of genes/proteins and map the extracted information to a controlled vocabulary. Specific Aim 3. Develop a framework to unify the procedures of knowledge reasoning and data mining for knowledge discovery. In this aim, we will reason using existing knowledge (represented in the form of an ontology) to reveal functional modules among the genes from the experimental data. We will then further develop algorithms that will reveal relationships between these gene modules by mining system-scaled experimental data. The overall framework will integrate functional reasoning and data mining in an iterative manner to refine the knowledge progressively and to derive rules such as: when genes involved in biological process X are perturbed, genes involved in biological process Y will respond. We will test the framework on the data from yeast-system biology studies and the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project to gain insights into the cellular systems and disease mechanisms of cancer cells.           In recent decades, biomedical sciences have achieved significant advances; most of the knowledge resulting from research is stored in the form of biomedical literature in the form free-text.

"Collaborative Development of Biomedical Ontologies and Terminologies     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The construction of ontologies that define the entities in an application area and the relationships among them has become essential for modern work in biomedicine.  Ontologies help both humans and computers to manage burgeoning numbers of data.  The need to annotate, retrieve, and integrate high-throughput data sets, to process  natural language, and to build systems for decision support has set many communities  of biomedical investigators to work building large ontologies.  We developed and evaluated the Collaborative Prot¿g¿ system in the first phase of our research project. This software system has become an indispensable open-source resource for an international community of scientists who develop ontologies in a cooperative, distributed manner. In this competing renewal proposal, we describe novel data-driven methods and tools that promise to make collaborative ontology design both more streamlined and more principled. Our goal is to create a more empirical basis for ontology engineering, and to develop methods whereby the ontology-engineering enterprise both can profit from data regarding the underlying processes and those processes in turn can generate increasing amounts of data to inform future ontology-engineering activities.  Our research plan entails three specific aims. First, we will enable ontology developers to apply ontology-design patterns (ODPs) to their ontologies, and we will measure the way in which these patterns alter the ontology-engineering process. Second, we will analyze the vast amounts of log data that we collect from users of Collaborative Prot¿g¿ to understand the patterns of ontology development. We will use these patterns to recommend to developers areas of ontologies that may need their attention, facilitating the process of reaching consensus and making collaborative ontology engineering more efficient. Finally, we will use the extensive data collected by our group and others to understand how scientists reuse terms from various ontologies and we will use these emerging patterns to facilitate term reuse. Each of these analyses not only will increase our understanding of collaboration in scientific modeling, but also will lead to new technology within our Collaborative Prot¿g¿ suite that will improve the ontology-development process and make collaboration among biomedical scientists more efficient.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Collaborative Prot�g� is a software system that helps a burgeoning user community to cooperate in developing ontologies that enhance biomedical research and improve patient care.

The need to annotate, retrieve, and integrate high-throughput data sets, to process natural language, and to build systems for decision support has set many communities of investigators to work building large ontologies. The Prot¿g¿ system has become an indispensable open-source resource for an enormous internationa community of scientists-supporting the development, maintenance, and use of ontologies and electronic knowledge bases by biomedical investigators everywhere. The number of registered Prot¿g¿ users has grown from 3,500 in 2002 to more than 195,000 users as of this writing. To date, however, the use of ontologies in biomedicine has been limited by the complexity of the ontology-development tools, which often make ontologies inaccessible to many biomedical scientists.  In this proposal, we will develop new methods and tools that will significantly lower the barrier of entry for ontology development, expanding Prot¿g¿ to provide intuitive and user-friendly ontology-acquisition methods throughout the ontology lifecycle.  Our plan entails five specific aims.  First, we will develop methods that enable initial specification of ontology terms in an informal manner, using lists and diagrams.  Scientists will be able to start modeling their domain without having to think in terms of formal ontological distinctions. Second, we will provide intuitive, easy-to-use tools for ontology specification that will aid developers as they start to formalize their models.  Third, we will track the requirements that an ontology must address and develop novel  methods  for  evaluating  ontology  coverage  based  on  these  requirements.  Fourth, for ontologies that inherently have complex internal structure that cannot be represented fully using only simple ontology constructs, we will develop methods that will create templates covering regular structures in the ontology. Scientists will then be able to fill out forms based o these templates, with Prot¿g¿ generating the corresponding logical structure in the background.  Fifth, we will continue to expand and support the thriving Prot¿g¿ user community, as it expands to include the biomedical scientists who will now be able to build the ontologies to support their data-driven research and discoveries.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Prot�g� is a software system that helps a burgeoning user community to develop ontologies that enhance biomedical research and improve patient care.

"Textpresso information retrieval and extraction system for biological literature    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We developed an information retrieval and extraction system that processes the full text of biological papers. The system, called Textpresso, separates text into sentences, labels words and phrases according to an ontology (an organized lexicon), and allows queries to be performed on a database of labeled sentences. The current ontology comprises approximately one hundred categories of terms, such as ""gene"", ""regulation"", ""human disease"", ""brain area"" etc., and also contains main Gene Ontology (GO) categories. Extraction of particular biological facts, such as gene-gene interactions, or the curation of GO cellular components, can be accelerated significantly by ontologies, with Textpresso automatically performing nearly as well as expert curators to identify sentences. Search engine for four literatures, C. elegans, Drosophila, Arabidopsis and Neuroscience have been established by us, and nine systems for other literatures have been developed by other groups around the world. The system will be further developed in many aspects. In collaboration with the respective model organism databases, we will set up literature search engine for zebrafish, rat and Dictyostelium and consider systems for important diseases such as cancer, Alzheimer's and AIDS. We will improve the quality of searchable full text by carrying super- and subscripts as well as special character information, and recognizing subsections of a paper. Website and system enhancement will include synonym searches, better website customization features (""myTextpresso""), browsing and searching a paper taxonomy, implementation of batch queries and notification of search result changes due to corpus changes. We will offer webservices for Textpresso and maintain a public subversion system for the software. Named entity recognition algorithms will be implemented to find new terms for the ontology from full text. We will work on the problem of high specificity of terms in the lexica, which reduces recall, and enable searches for GO annotations. Strategies for (semi-) automated literature curation include installing a paper triage system and first pass curation to identify where in a paper which relevant data types can be found. Automated curation tasks include producing connections between a paper and a biological entity such as gene. We will develop learning algorithms that discover new categories and lexica in text. We will improve our curation strategy of developing specialized curation categories that are used to retrieve specific data, and develop corresponding curator interfaces to automate the processing pipeline from full text to database. We will research and implement new, more semantically oriented ways of searching by combining latent semantic indexing with new similarity measures. Machine learning algorithms for classifying sentences and extracting information will be implemented using hidden Markov models. A new approach of finding categories and lexica using graph theory will be investigated.

"Biomedical Language Processing Writ Large:  Scaling to all of PubMedCentral    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Recent developments in text mining research, and in scientific publication, have brought us to the moment when the long-standing potential of natural language processing technology to benefit biomedical researchers may finally be realized. Technological advances, recent results in computational linguistics, maturation of biomedical ontology, and the advent of resources such as PubMedCentral have set the stage for an attempt at an integrated computational analysis of a large proportion of the full text biomedical literature. Such an analysis has the potential to dramatically extend the way that biomedical researchers can effectively use the scientific literature, particularly in the analysis of genome-scale datasets, broadly accelerating and increasing the efficiency of scientific discovery. We hypothesize that it is now possible to extract a wide variety of ontologically-grounded entities and relationships by processing the entire PubMedCentral document collection accurately and with good coverage, to use this extracted information to produce new genres of scientifically valuable tools and analysis techniques, and to demonstrate its utility in the analysis of genome-scale data. The challenges that we plan to overcome range from fundamental linguistic issues (e.g. cross- document coreference resolution) to high-performance computing (e.g. scaling up integrated processing to include millions of complex documents), to fielding practical systems that can exploit enormous knowledge-bases to accelerate the analysis of very large molecular data sets.              Project narrative Enormous amounts of biomedical information are now available in the PubMedCentral database, but computers cannot work with it because it is in the form of human-language text and humans can't read it all due to its large volume. The goal of this project is to harvest large amounts of that information automatically, making it available to humans in summarized form and to computers in computer-readable form.",Biomedical Language Processing Writ Large:  Scaling to all of PubMedCentral,8318224,R01LM009254,"['Biological', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Evaluation Research', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Harvest', 'Health', 'High Performance Computing', 'Human', 'Imagery', 'Journals', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Linguistics', 'Literature', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Process', 'Publications', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Staging', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Work', 'biomedical ontology', 'clinically relevant', 'information organization', 'knowledge base', 'language processing', 'scale up', 'text searching', 'tool']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R01,2012,572436,0.01149513067702911
"Informatics Infrastructure for vector-based neuroanatomical atlases  Abstract The adage: 'all data is spatial' is especially pertinent in the field of neuroscience, since neuronal data must be indexed by the neuroanatomical location of phenomena or entities under study. Brain atlases are very widely used as laboratory tools, being some of the most highly cited publications in science. This proposal seeks to use brain atlases as a method for indexing data from the literature in a neuroinformatics system. This data includes both textual and graphical information, ranging from highly detailed maps constructed from vector- based spatial primitives, histological photographs and drawings, to textual reports of experimental findings in the literature (which we will analyze on a large scale). These data represent a significant scientific investment that are currently locked away in previously published journal articles (and the detailed data-sets and drawings from researchers that were used to write the articles). A prototype that summarizes the last fifteen years' output of one of the world's most prominent neuroanatomy laboratories is immediately available. This project will develop a collaborative environment to enable neuroscientists to use these valuable maps within the community as a whole by contributing data to a shared system with an open-source system (called 'NeuARt II') that permits querying, overlaying, viewing and annotating such data in an integrated manner. We will also use Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to index neuroanatomical references in large numbers of journal articles to be accessible within our infrastructure. As an initial text corpus, we over 110,000 documents taken from last 35 years of published information from the primary neuroanatomical literature. We will construct a neuroanatomical interface that conceptually resembles the 'Google Maps' system, permitting users to use an intuitive spatial interface to browse large amounts of biomedical data in spatial register. The proposed infrastructure will also provide new opportunities to compare and synthesize the anatomical components of neuroscience data multiple modalities (physiological, behavioral, clinical, genetic, molecular, etc.).  Narrative Given the scope of the use of neuroanatomical maps from the rat and mouse in the study of neurobiological disease, we expect our research impact scientists working in almost all subfields of the subject. Our collaborators who form the early adopters of this approach are neuroendocrinology researchers studying the mechanisms of stress and anxiety disorders which are estimated to affect 19.1 million people in the USA, costing $42 billion in health care costs per year (source: Anxiety Disorders Association of America). A better understanding of the neuronal mechanisms underlying these disorders could lead to new, effective therapies and treatments.",Informatics Infrastructure for vector-based neuroanatomical atlases,8238371,R01MH079068,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Americas', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Atlases', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Community Outreach', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Fluoro-Gold', 'Harvest', 'Health Care Costs', 'Image', 'Informatics', 'Investments', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Mus', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurobiology', 'Neuroendocrinology', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Online Systems', 'Output', 'Paper', 'Physiological', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Rattus', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Semantics', 'Source', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Text', 'Tissues', 'Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Work', 'Writing', 'abstracting', 'base', 'biomedical ontology', 'cost', 'effective therapy', 'indexing', 'journal article', 'neuroinformatics', 'novel', 'open source', 'prototype', 'research study', 'text searching', 'tool', 'vector', 'web services']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2012,326844,0.008218227915421261
"Ontology-based Information Network to Support Vaccine Research  Project Summary (Abstract):  Since the introduction of Edward Jenner's smallpox vaccine in 1796, vaccines have proven invaluable for their ability to stimulate the immune system and to confer protection against pathogenic organisms. Progress in modern vaccine research has been accompanied by a dramatic increase in the number of vaccine-related papers in the published literature. It has become increasingly challenging to identify and annotate vaccine data from this large and diverse literature which no one scientist or team can fully master. Although vaccine databases exist that emphasize commercialized vaccines, no public central repository is available to store research data concerning commercial vaccines, vaccines in clinical trials, or vaccine candidates in early stages of development, in a fashion that render such data available for advanced analyses. To fill this need, we have developed VIOLIN (http://www.violinet.org), a web-based database system for annotation, storage, and analysis of published vaccine data. An ontology represents consensus-based controlled vocabularies of terms and relations, with associated definitions which are logically formulated in such a way as to promote automated reasoning. A bottleneck of vaccine research and further VIOLIN development is the lack of a vaccine ontology, which in turn makes a significant obstacle for vaccine data standardization, retrieval, integration, and advanced analysis and prediction. Our goal is to develop the community-based Vaccine Ontology (VO) and apply it to efficient vaccine literature mining and analysis of protective immune mechanisms. We will focus on two model pathogens: Escherichia coli and Brucella species. This project contains three specific aims: (1) develop a community-based Vaccine Ontology (VO), and apply it to establish a vaccine knowledgebase and to promote vaccine data integration and query through Semantic Web. The VO development will be achieved through collaboration with vaccine researchers, the Infectious Disease Ontology (IDO) Initiative, and the National Center for Biomedical Ontology (NCBO); (2) develop a VO-based natural language processing (NLP) system and apply it for more efficient retrieval of Brucella and E. coli vaccine information, automated annotation of journal articles with VO terms, and VO improvement. This task will be achieved by collaboration with the National Center for Integrative Biomedical Informatics (NCIBI). (3) analyze and predict vaccine targets and protective immune networks attributable to the interactions between host and vaccine. This will be achieved mainly by VO-based literature mining and a novel genome- and literature-based statistical methodology. This project will be implemented by a strong collaborative team and supported from a large user community. The Vaccine Ontology and its applications to literature mining and for studying protective immunity against Brucella spp. and E. coli will lay a strong foundation for further advanced informatics research on vaccines against infectious diseases in the post-genomics and information era.  Narrative: Vaccines stimulate the immune system and confer protection against pathogenic microorganisms. A bottleneck of vaccine research is the lack of an ontology (consensus- based controlled vocabularies of terms and relations) to ensure consistency of literature curation and support automated reasoning. The goal of this project is to develop a community-based Vaccine Ontology and apply it to vaccine literature mining and analysis of vaccine-induced immune mechanisms.",Ontology-based Information Network to Support Vaccine Research,8311060,R01AI081062,"['Algorithms', 'Attenuated Live Virus Vaccine', 'Automated Annotation', 'Bacterial Genes', 'Brucella', 'Brucella Vaccine', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Consensus', 'Controlled Vocabulary', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Dictionary', 'Ensure', 'Escherichia coli', 'Escherichia coli Vaccines', 'Foundations', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunity', 'Informatics', 'Information Networks', 'Information Retrieval', 'Journals', 'Laboratories', 'Literature', 'MeSH Thesaurus', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Center for Integrative Biomedical Informatics', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Online Systems', 'Ontology', 'Organism', 'Paper', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrieval', 'Scientist', 'Semantics', 'Smallpox Vaccine', 'Staging', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Subunit Vaccines', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Vaccine Research', 'Vaccines', 'abstracting', 'base', 'biomedical ontology', 'computer based Semantic Analysis', 'data integration', 'editorial', 'gene function', 'genome-wide', 'interest', 'journal article', 'knowledge base', 'microorganism', 'novel', 'novel vaccines', 'pathogen', 'programs', 'repository', 'research study', 'statistics', 'text searching', 'user-friendly', 'vaccine candidate', 'vaccine development', 'vaccine evaluation', 'web interface']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2012,264994,0.019771605358642894
"Improving the Efficiency and Efficacy in Authoring Essential Clinical FAQs     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Research plan: The use of clinical knowledge systems such as UpToDate that provide reliable information at the point of care has been shown to improve patient safety and decision-making. With similar content to UpToDate, Mayo Clinic's AskMayoExpert (AME) is an online knowledge system that primarily contains over 5000 (and increasing) specialist-vetted answers to FAQs for point of care use. However, because of the overabundance of clinical resources and guidelines, adding new answers manually to AME and ensuring that it is consistent with evidence is time consuming. This problem is also faced with other systems such as UpToDate. This career grant proposes to investigate the feasibility of using a novel text mining based informatics approach to semi-automate the management of a clinical knowledge system, using AME as the test bed. Although the methods will be applicable to any clinical knowledge system and any topic, they will be evaluated using two important test topics from cardiology (which has the biggest focus in AME) - atrial fibrillation (a topic exhaustively covered in AME) and congestive heart failure (a topic less covered, but is an increasingly complex vast field with knowledge from huge literature). While the existing content of AME is private, the methods and the code we develop to assist in generating the content will be released open-source as part of the Open Health Natural Language Processing (OHNLP) consortium in UIMA framework. Career plan: As most communication of information in clinical practice and biomedical research occurs through the medium of text, the development of methods to render this text computer-interpretable is a prerequisite to the use of this information to improve quality of care and support scientific discovery. The PI's long-term career goal is to become a leader in biomedical informatics (informatics applied to biomedical data), with focus on textual data such as scientific papers and clinical notes. He has BS in Computer Science, PhD in Biomedical Informatics and over a dozen of peer-reviewed publications in biomedical text mining. His career goal is to advance diverse methods and applications of text mining across biomedical informatics (BMI). He will focus on: a) discovering information needs and gaps that can be filled, b) adapting and extending existing text mining algorithms, and c) validating the utility of the applications in the biomedical environment. Rationale: Making the transition from a mentored researcher to an independent researcher requires three main facets of career growth: a) developing a working familiarity with clinical information systems and medical terminologies; b) understanding the information needs of clinicians; and c) training in clinical research. The proposal will translate the PI's knowledgeof the text mining methods to practical experience in an operation clinical environment. Courses listed in the ""Career Development/Training Activities"" will educate him more about the environment and train him on clinical research. He will continue sharpening his informatics expertise by attending scientific conferences.              Project Narrative Medical errors are one of the leading causes of death in the United States. It has been observed that point of care access to relevant clinical knowledge support decision making and decreases medical errors, thereby improving patient safety and healthcare costs. The proposed research aims to empower physicians specialized in the area (specialists) in quickly gathering evidence from literature or finding citations supporting or qualifying their expert opinion. It will also generate the answers and suggest updates to the existing answers for their perusal.",Improving the Efficiency and Efficacy in Authoring Essential Clinical FAQs,8442618,K99LM011389,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Beds', 'Biomedical Research', 'Calculi', 'Cardiology', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Congestive Heart Failure', 'Cross-Over Studies', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Expert Opinion', 'Familiarity', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'General Practitioners', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Informatics', 'Information Retrieval Systems', 'Journals', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Medical', 'Medical Errors', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nurses', 'Paper', 'Peer Review', 'Physicians', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Qualifying', 'Quality of Care', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Semantics', 'Source', 'Specialist', 'System', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Translating', 'United States', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'Workload', 'Writing', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'computer science', 'empowered', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'improved', 'information gathering', 'medical information system', 'method development', 'novel', 'open source', 'operation', 'patient safety', 'point of care', 'statistics', 'symposium', 'text searching', 'usability']",NLM,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,K99,2012,96552,0.022308800292773812

"Ontology-Driven Methods for Knowledge Acquisition and Knowledge Discovery    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       A great challenge in the biomedical informatics domain is to develop computational methods that combine existing knowledge and experimental data to derive new knowledge regarding biological systems and disease mechanisms. Most knowledge regarding genes and proteins in biomedical literature is stored in the form of free text that is not suitable for computation, and the manual processes of encoding this body of knowledge into computable form cannot keep up with the rate of knowledge accumulation. The main thrust of the proposed research is to design novel statistical text-mining algorithms to acquire and represent knowledge regarding genes and proteins from free-text literature, and further to combine this acquired knowledge with experimental data to derive new knowledge. We will organize the proposed research to the following specific aims. Specific Aim 1. Develop ontology-guided semantic modeling algorithms for extracting biological concepts from free text, in which we will design hierarchical probabilistic topic models that are capable of representing biological concepts as a hierarchy and develop novel learning algorithms to infer biological concepts from free-text documents. Specific Aim 2. Integrate semantic modeling with BioNLP to extract textual evidence supporting protein-function annotations. We will develop information extraction algorithms that will combine the results of hierarchical semantic analysis and BioNLP to identify the text regions that will most likely provide evidence regarding the function of genes/proteins and map the extracted information to a controlled vocabulary. Specific Aim 3. Develop a framework to unify the procedures of knowledge reasoning and data mining for knowledge discovery. In this aim, we will reason using existing knowledge (represented in the form of an ontology) to reveal functional modules among the genes from the experimental data. We will then further develop algorithms that will reveal relationships between these gene modules by mining system-scaled experimental data. The overall framework will integrate functional reasoning and data mining in an iterative manner to refine the knowledge progressively and to derive rules such as: when genes involved in biological process X are perturbed, genes involved in biological process Y will respond. We will test the framework on the data from yeast-system biology studies and the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project to gain insights into the cellular systems and disease mechanisms of cancer cells.           In recent decades, biomedical sciences have achieved significant advances; most of the knowledge resulting from research is stored in the form of biomedical literature in the form free-text. This project develop computational approaches to extract knowledge from biomedical literature, represent the knowledge in computable form, and combined the knowledge with experiment data to gain insights into biological systems and disease mechanisms",Ontology-Driven Methods for Knowledge Acquisition and Knowledge Discovery,8326650,R01LM011155,"['Accounting', 'Achievement', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biomedical Research', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Controlled Vocabulary', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Knowledge acquisition', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Ontology', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Psyche structure', 'Research', 'Science', 'Semantics', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Training', 'Tweens', 'Yeasts', 'biological systems', 'biomedical informatics', 'cancer cell', 'data mining', 'design', 'insight', 'interest', 'knowledge of results', 'novel', 'protein function', 'protein protein interaction', 'research study', 'text searching']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2012,317212,0.02333953800180474
"Collaborative Development of Biomedical Ontologies and Terminologies    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The development of ontologies that define entities and the relationships among them has become essential for modern work in biomedicine. Ontologies help both humans and computers to manage the burgeoning data that are pervasive in biology and medicine. The need to annotate, retrieve, and integrate high-throughput data sets, to process natural language, and to build systems for decision support has set many communities of investigators to work building large ontologies. To date, these groups of ontology developers have been limited by the lack of methods and tools that facilitate distributed, collaborative engineering of large-scale ontologies and vocabularies. In this proposal, we outline three specific aims. First, we will explore basic computational methods that are essential for collaborative ontology engineering. We will investigate methods for representing diverse collaborative workflows, information about changes and concept history, trust, and provenance, and for recording decision making and design rationale. Empirical analysis of existing ontology-development projects will inform our construction of models for collaborative development workflows that will guide the processes of authoring, reviewing, and curating biomedical ontologies. Second, we will use the results from our first specific aim to build cProtigi, a set of robust, customizable, interactive tools to support distributed users in their collaborative work to build and edit terminologies and ontologies. Third, we will evaluate our work in the context of real-world, large-scale ontology-engineering projects, including the autism ontology of the National Database for Autism Research; the 11th revision of the WHO's International Classification of Diseases; the Ontology for Biomedical Investigations, under development by a wide range of NIH-supported researchers; and BiomedGT, under development by NCI. It is no longer feasible to imagine that investigators can create biomedical ontologies working independently. The collaborative methods that we will study and the tools that we will build will lead to expanded opportunities to support the diverse data- and knowledge-intensive activities that pervade BISTI, the CTSAs, the NCBCs, and myriad biomedical initiatives that require robust, scaleable ontologies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The knowledge-based nature of modern medicine requires the use of ontologies and terminologies to process and integrate data. Ontology development itself becomes a collaborative process, with members of the larger research community contributing to and commenting on emerging ontologies. We plan to extend the Protigi ontology editor-the most widely used ontology editor today, with almost 100,000 registered users-to support collaborative development of ontologies and to evaluate the new tools by deploying them at the World Health Organization for the development of ICD-11 and in other settings.             n/a",Collaborative Development of Biomedical Ontologies and Terminologies,8242742,R01GM086587,"['Adopted', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Beds', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Generic Drugs', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Industry', 'Institutes', 'International Classification of Diseases', 'Internet', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Mainstreaming', 'Maintenance', 'Medicine', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modern Medicine', 'NCI Thesaurus', 'NIH Program Announcements', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Online Systems', 'Ontology', 'Process', 'Program Development', 'Published Comment', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Scientist', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Systems Development', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Trust', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'biomedical ontology', 'biomedical scientist', 'cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid', 'conflict resolution', 'design', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'forging', 'knowledge base', 'member', 'open source', 'programs', 'research study', 'response', 'tool', 'usability']",NIGMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2012,392767,0.0282367758359166

"Exploring Natural Language Processing, Image Processing, Machine Learning, and Us    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Most biomedical text mining systems target only text information and do not provide intelligent access to other important data such as Figures. More than any other documentation, figures usually represent the ""evidence"" of discovery in the biomedical literature. Full-text biomedical articles nearly always incorporate images that are the crucial content of biomedical knowledge discovery. Biomedical scientists need to access images to validate research facts and to formulate or to test novel research hypotheses. Evaluation has shown that textual statements reported in the literature are frequently noisy (i.e., contain ""false facts""). Capturing images that are essentially experimental ""evidence"" to support the textual ""fact"" will benefit biomedical information systems, databases, and biomedical scientists. We are developing a biomedical literature figure search engine BioFigureSearch. We develop innovative algorithms and models in natural language processing, image processing, machine learning and user interfacing. The deliverables will be novel biomedical natural language figure processing (bNLfP) algorithms and iBioFigureSearch allowing biomedical scientists to access figure data effectively, and open-source tools that will enhance biomedical information retrieval, summarization, and question answering. The bNLfP algorithms we will be developing can be applied or integrated into other biomedical text-mining systems.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project proposes innovative algorithms and models in natural language processing, image processing, machine learning, and user interfacing, to return figures in response to biomedical queries.

"ADAPTIVE PERSONALIZED INFORMATION MANAGEMENT FOR BIOLOGISTS    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We propose development of an adaptive, personalizable, information management tool, which can be configured and trained by an individual biologist to most effectively exploit the particular knowledge bases and document collections that are most useful for him or her. The proposed tool represents a novel approach for monitoring scientific progress in biology, which has become a formidable task. We will exploit recent advances in machine learning and database systems to develop a useful approximation to a personalized biological knowledge base f.i.i.e., single information resource that would include all the knowledge sources on which a biologist relies. More specifically, we propose a scheme for loosely integrating both structured information and unstructured text, and then querying the integrated information using easily-formulated similarity queries. The system will also learn from every episode in which a biologist seeks information. The research team on this project includes a computer scientist and two biologists. The proposed work will make systems for monitoring scientific progress in biology more effective. This will make biologists, clinicians and medical researchers better able to track advances in the biomedical literature that are relevant to their work.          n/a",ADAPTIVE PERSONALIZED INFORMATION MANAGEMENT FOR BIOLOGISTS,8075593,R01GM081293,"['Address', 'Biological', 'Biological Phenomena', 'Biology', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computers', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Eukaryota', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Individual', 'Information Management', 'Information Resources', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Metric', 'Monitor', 'Output', 'Persons', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Ribosomes', 'Role', 'Scheme', 'Scientist', 'Solutions', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'design', 'experience', 'knowledge base', 'man', 'novel strategies', 'programs', 'tool']",NIGMS,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R01,2011,274386,0.033490038699412424
"Scalable Learning with Ensemble Techniques and Parallel Computing    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The ability to conduct basic and applied biomedical research is becoming increasingly dependent on data produced by new and emerging technologies. This data has an unprecedented amount of detail and volume. Researchers are therefore dependent on computing and computational tools to be able to visualize, analyze, model, and interpret these large and complex sets of data. Tools for disease detection, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention are common goals of many, if not all, biomedical research programs. Sound analytical and statistical theory and methodology for class pre- diction and class discovery lay the foundation for building these tools, of which the machine learning techniques of classification (supervised learning) and clustering (unsupervised learning) are crucial. Our goal is to produce software for analysis and interpretation of large data sets using ensemble machine learning techniques and parallel computing technologies. Ensemble techniques are recent advances in machine learning theory and methodology leading to great improvements in accuracy and stability in data set analysis and interpretation. The results from a committee of primary machine learners (classifiers or clusterers) that have been trained on different instance or feature subsets are combined through techniques such as voting. The high prediction accuracy of classifier ensembles (such as boosting, bagging, and random forests) has generated much excitement in the statistics and machine learning communities. Recent research extends the ensemble methodology to clustering, where class information is unavailable, also yielding superior performance in terms of accuracy and stability. In theory, most ensemble techniques are inherently parallel. However, existing implementations are generally serial and assume the data set is memory resident. Therefore current software will not scale to the large data sets produced in today's biomedical research. We propose to take two approaches to scale ensemble techniques to large data sets: data partitioning approaches and parallel computing. The focus of Phase I will be to prototype scalable classifier ensembles using parallel architectures. We intend to: establish the parallel computing infrastructures; produce a preliminary architecture and software design; investigate a wide range of ensemble generation schemes using data partitioning strategies; and implement scalable bagging and random forests based on the preliminary design. The focus of Phase II will be to complete the software architecture and implement the scalable classifier ensembles and scalable clusterer ensembles within this framework. We intend to: complete research and development of classifier ensembles; extend the classification framework to clusterer ensembles; research and develop a unified interface for building ensembles with differing generation mechanisms and combination strategies; and evaluate the effectiveness of the software on simulated and real data.

"Textpresso information retrieval and extraction system for biological literature    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We developed an information retrieval and extraction system that processes the full text of biological papers. The system, called Textpresso, separates text into sentences, labels words and phrases according to an ontology (an organized lexicon), and allows queries to be performed on a database of labeled sentences. The current ontology comprises approximately one hundred categories of terms, such as ""gene"", ""regulation"", ""human disease"", ""brain area"" etc., and also contains main Gene Ontology (GO) categories. Extraction of particular biological facts, such as gene-gene interactions, or the curation of GO cellular components, can be accelerated significantly by ontologies, with Textpresso automatically performing nearly as well as expert curators to identify sentences. Search engine for four literatures, C. elegans, Drosophila, Arabidopsis and Neuroscience have been established by us, and nine systems for other literatures have been developed by other groups around the world. The system will be further developed in many aspects. In collaboration with the respective model organism databases, we will set up literature search engine for zebrafish, rat and Dictyostelium and consider systems for important diseases such as cancer, Alzheimer's and AIDS. We will improve the quality of searchable full text by carrying super- and subscripts as well as special character information, and recognizing subsections of a paper. Website and system enhancement will include synonym searches, better website customization features (""myTextpresso""), browsing and searching a paper taxonomy, implementation of batch queries and notification of search result changes due to corpus changes. We will offer webservices for Textpresso and maintain a public subversion system for the software. Named entity recognition algorithms will be implemented to find new terms for the ontology from full text. We will work on the problem of high specificity of terms in the lexica, which reduces recall, and enable searches for GO annotations. Strategies for (semi-) automated literature curation include installing a paper triage system and first pass curation to identify where in a paper which relevant data types can be found. Automated curation tasks include producing connections between a paper and a biological entity such as gene. We will develop learning algorithms that discover new categories and lexica in text. We will improve our curation strategy of developing specialized curation categories that are used to retrieve specific data, and develop corresponding curator interfaces to automate the processing pipeline from full text to database. We will research and implement new, more semantically oriented ways of searching by combining latent semantic indexing with new similarity measures. Machine learning algorithms for classifying sentences and extracting information will be implemented using hidden Markov models. A new approach of finding categories and lexica using graph theory will be investigated. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Narrative Biomedical researchers need to read or skim many thousands of scientific articles each year, more than is humanly possible. This project will extend and improve an automatic system, Textpresso, that finds relevant sentences within millions of sentences that likely contain crucial information.

"Biomedical Language Processing Writ Large:  Scaling to all of PubMedCentral    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Recent developments in text mining research, and in scientific publication, have brought us to the moment when the long-standing potential of natural language processing technology to benefit biomedical researchers may finally be realized. Technological advances, recent results in computational linguistics, maturation of biomedical ontology, and the advent of resources such as PubMedCentral have set the stage for an attempt at an integrated computational analysis of a large proportion of the full text biomedical literature. Such an analysis has the potential to dramatically extend the way that biomedical researchers can effectively use the scientific literature, particularly in the analysis of genome-scale datasets, broadly accelerating and increasing the efficiency of scientific discovery. We hypothesize that it is now possible to extract a wide variety of ontologically-grounded entities and relationships by processing the entire PubMedCentral document collection accurately and with good coverage, to use this extracted information to produce new genres of scientifically valuable tools and analysis techniques, and to demonstrate its utility in the analysis of genome-scale data. The challenges that we plan to overcome range from fundamental linguistic issues (e.g. cross- document coreference resolution) to high-performance computing (e.g. scaling up integrated processing to include millions of complex documents), to fielding practical systems that can exploit enormous knowledge-bases to accelerate the analysis of very large molecular data sets.              Project narrative Enormous amounts of biomedical information are now available in the PubMedCentral database, but computers cannot work with it because it is in the form of human-language text and humans can't read it all due to its large volume.

"Informatics Infrastructure for vector-based neuroanatomical atlases    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The adage:  'all data is spatial' is especially pertinent in the field of neuroscience, since neuronal data must be indexed by the neuroanatomical location of phenomena or entities under study.  Brain atlases are very widely used as laboratory tools, being some of the most highly cited publications in science.  This proposal seeks to use brain atlases as a method for indexing data from the literature in a neuroinformatics system.  This data includes both textual and graphical information, ranging from highly detailed maps constructed from vector- based spatial primitives, histological photographs and drawings, to textual reports of experimental findings in the literature (which we will analyze on a large scale).  These data represent a significant scientific investment that are currently locked away in previously published journal articles (and the detailed data-sets and drawings from researchers that were used to write the articles).  A prototype that summarizes the last fifteen years' output of one of the world's most prominent neuroanatomy laboratories is immediately available.  This project will develop a collaborative environment to enable neuroscientists to use these valuable maps within the community as a whole by contributing data to a shared system with an open-source system (called 'NeuARt II') that permits querying, overlaying, viewing and annotating such data in an integrated manner.  We will also use Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to index neuroanatomical references in large numbers of journal articles to be accessible within our infrastructure.  As an initial text corpus, we over 110,000 documents taken from last 35 years of published information from the primary neuroanatomical literature.  We will construct a neuroanatomical interface that conceptually resembles the 'Google Maps' system, permitting users to use an intuitive spatial interface to browse large amounts of biomedical data in spatial register.  The proposed infrastructure will also provide new opportunities to compare and synthesize the anatomical components of neuroscience data multiple modalities (physiological, behavioral, clinical, genetic, molecular, etc.).PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Given the scope of the use of neuroanatomical maps from the rat and mouse in the study of neurobiological disease, we expect our research impact scientists working in almost all subfields of the subject.  Our collaborators who form the early adopters of this approach are neuroendocrinology researchers studying the mechanisms of stress and anxiety disorders which are estimated to affect 19.1 million people in the USA, costing $42 billion in health care costs per year (source:  Anxiety Disorders Association of America).

"Ontology-based Information Network to Support Vaccine Research    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Since the introduction of Edward Jenner's smallpox vaccine in 1796, vaccines have proven invaluable for their ability to stimulate the immune system and to confer protection against pathogenic organisms. Progress in modern vaccine research has been accompanied by a dramatic increase in the number of vaccine-related papers in the published literature. It has become increasingly challenging to identify and annotate vaccine data from this large and diverse literature which no one scientist or team can fully master. Although vaccine databases exist that emphasize commercialized vaccines, no public central repository is available to store research data concerning commercial vaccines, vaccines in clinical trials, or vaccine candidates in early stages of development, in a fashion that render such data available for advanced analyses. To fill this need, we have developed VIOLIN (http://www.violinet.org), a web-based database system for annotation, storage, and analysis of published vaccine data. An ontology represents consensus-based controlled vocabularies of terms and relations, with associated definitions which are logically formulated in such a way as to promote automated reasoning. A bottleneck of vaccine research and further VIOLIN development is the lack of a vaccine ontology, which in turn makes a significant obstacle for vaccine data standardization, retrieval, integration, and advanced analysis and prediction. Our goal is to develop the community-based Vaccine Ontology (VO) and apply it to efficient vaccine literature mining and analysis of protective immune mechanisms. We will focus on two model pathogens: Escherichia coli and Brucella species. This project contains three specific aims: (1) develop a community-based Vaccine Ontology (VO), and apply it to establish a vaccine knowledgebase and to promote vaccine data integration and query through Semantic Web. The VO development will be achieved through collaboration with vaccine researchers, the Infectious Disease Ontology (IDO) Initiative, and the National Center for Biomedical Ontology (NCBO); (2) develop a VO-based natural language processing (NLP) system and apply it for more efficient retrieval of Brucella and E. coli vaccine information, automated annotation of journal articles with VO terms, and VO improvement. This task will be achieved by collaboration with the National Center for Integrative Biomedical Informatics (NCIBI). (3) analyze and predict vaccine targets and protective immune networks attributable to the interactions between host and vaccine. This will be achieved mainly by VO-based literature mining and a novel genome- and literature-based statistical methodology. This project will be implemented by a strong collaborative team and supported from a large user community. The Vaccine Ontology and its applications to literature mining and for studying protective immunity against Brucella spp. and E. coli will lay a strong foundation for further advanced informatics research on vaccines against infectious diseases in the post-genomics and information era.            Narrative: Vaccines stimulate the immune system and confer protection against pathogenic microorganisms. A bottleneck of vaccine research is the lack of an ontology (consensus- based controlled vocabularies of terms and relations) to ensure consistency of literature curation and support automated reasoning.

"BioScholar: a Biomedical Knowledge Engineering framework based on the published l    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Studying the primary research literature is a universal, primary activity for biomedical scientists. It underlies scientists' understanding of their subject and strengthens their capability to plan, execute, and interpret experiments. This proposal is concerned with the maintenance and continued development of software that supports scientists in their scholarly work. Our goal is to develop a knowledge engineering platform (called `BioScholar') to permit a single graduate student or postdoctoral worker to design, build, curate, and maintain a Knowledge Base (KB) for the literature of interest to a specific laboratory. This continues a previous software development project that was funded by the National Library of Medicine (LM 07061). We will continue to maintain the software using modern software engineering tools and approaches, whilst making it fully interoperable with a widely used ontology engineering platform (Protege /OWL). We will also develop the systems' existing capabilities to assist scientists with management of bibliographic data (citation information and full-text PDF articles). We will further develop tools to allow researchers to annotate PDF files with highlights, simple comments and with structured data. We will then use this annotation framework to drive the process of constructing knowledge bases using Protege/OWL (a widely used ontology editor). We will then incorporate Information Extraction (IE) techniques from modern Natural Language Processing (NLP) to improve the efficiency of this curation process. The NLP methods we use are based on the Conditional Random Fields (CRF) model which is considered state-of-the-art amongst NLP researchers. Finally, the most research-oriented component of this proposal is the development of a new methodology for knowledge representation and reasoning in biomedicine based on experimental design, involving experimental controls, independent and dependent variables, statistical significance and correlation between variables. This representation will be (a) understandable to experimental scientists, (b) lightweight, (c) versatile, and (d) capable of supporting inference between experiments. During the course of this project, we will build a KB for the world-leading neuroendocrinology laboratory of Prof. Alan Watts at University Southern California. Prof. Watts' work is concerned with the study of catecholaminergic control of the stress response, drawing on research from a large number of different fields (anatomy, physiology, molecular biology, etc.). After developing this KB, we will test its validity using subjective methods (questionnaires and interviews), and objective experiments (`mock exams' to see if students' performance with test questions based on comprehension of the primary literature). We will release all findings and tools to the biomedical community as research papers and open-source software. Narrative This project will help biomedical scientists manage, understand and communicate the complex information they must learn from scientific papers in multiple biomedical disciplines. As a demonstration of this work, we will build a comprehensive summary of research underlying brain circuits involved in stress.

"Integrating Microarray and Proteomic Data by Ontology-based Annotation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       With the completion of the Human Genome Project, there is a need to translate genome-era discoveries into clinical utility. One difficulty in making bench-to-bedside translations with gene-expression and proteomic data is our current inability to relate these findings with each other and with clinical measurements. A translational researcher studying a particular biological process using microarrays or proteomics will want to gather as many relevant publicly-available data sets as possible, to compare findings. Translational investigators wanting to relate clinical or chemical data with multiple genomic or proteomic measurements will want to find and join related data sets. Unfortunately, finding and joining relevant data sets is particularly challenging today, as the useful annotations of this data are still represented only by unstructured free-text, limiting its secondary use. A question we have sought to answer is whether prior investments in biomedical ontologies can provide leverage in determining the context of genomic data in an automated manner, thereby enabling integration of gene expression and proteomic data and the secondary use of genomic data in multiple fields of research beyond those for which the data sets were originally targeted. The three specific aims to address this question are to (1) develop tools that comprehensively map contextual annotations to the largest biomedical ontology, the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS), built and supported by the National Library of Medicine, validate, and disseminate the mappings, (2) execute a four-pronged strategy to evaluate experiment-concept mappings, and (3) apply experiment-context mappings to find and integrate data within and across microarray and proteomics repositories. To keep these tools relevant to biomedical investigators, we have included three Driving Biological Projects (DBPs), in the domains of breast cancer, organ transplantation, and T-cell biology. To accomplish these DBPs, our tools and mappings will be used to find and join experimental data within and across microarray and proteomic repositories. Having DBPs to address will focus our development on a set of scalable tools that can access and analyze experimental data covering a large variety of diseases. Through our advisory committee of world-renowned NIH-funded investigators, we will ensure that our findings will have broad applicability and are useful to a wide variety of biomedical researchers.          n/a",Integrating Microarray and Proteomic Data by Ontology-based Annotation,8138486,R01LM009719,"['Address', 'Advisory Committees', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Growth', 'Head', 'Human Genome Project', 'Improve Access', 'International', 'Investments', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Molecular Biology', 'Nature', 'Online Systems', 'Ontology', 'Organ Transplantation', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Process', 'Proteomics', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specificity', 'System', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Transplantation', 'Unified Medical Language System', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'United States National Library of Medicine', 'Writing', 'base', 'bench to bedside', 'biomedical informatics', 'biomedical ontology', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'repository', 'research study', 'text searching', 'tool', 'translational medicine']",NLM,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2011,266112,-0.002256235363183897

"Statistical Model Building for High Dimensional Biomedical Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Typical of current large-scale biomedical data is the feature of small number of observed samples and the widely observed sample heterogeneity. Identifying differentially expressed genes related to the sample phenotye (e.g., cancer disease development) and predicting sample phenotype based on the gene expressions are some central research questions in the microarray data analysis. Most existing statistical methods have ignored sample heterogeneity and thus loss power.       This project proposes to develop novel statistical methods that explicitly address the small sample size and sampe heterogeneity issues, and can be applied very generally. The usefulness of these methods will be shown with the large-scale biomedical data originating from the lung and kidney transplant research projects. The transplant projects aimed to improve the molecular diagnosis and therapy of lung/kidney allograft rejection by identifying molecular biomarkers to predict the allograft rejection for critical early treatment and rapid, noninvasive, and economical testing.       The specific aims are 1) Develop novel statistical methods for differential gene expression detection that explicitly model sample heterogeneity. 2) Develop novel statistical methods for classifying high-dimensional biomedical data and incorporating sample heterogeneity. 3) Develop novel statistical methods for jointly analyzing a set of genes (e.g., genes in a pathway). 4) Use the developed models and methods to answer research questions relevant to public health in the lung and kidney transplant projects; and implement and validate the proposed methods in user-friendly and well-documented software, and distribute them to the scientific community at no charge.       It is very important to identify new biomarkers of allograft rejection in lung and kidney transplant recipients. The rapid and reliable detection and prediction of rejection in easily obtainable body fluids may allow the rapid advancement of clinical interventional trials.

"Ontology-Driven Methods for Knowledge Acquisition and Knowledge Discovery    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       A great challenge in the biomedical informatics domain is to develop computational methods that combine existing knowledge and experimental data to derive new knowledge regarding biological systems and disease mechanisms. Most knowledge regarding genes and proteins in biomedical literature is stored in the form of free text that is not suitable for computation, and the manual processes of encoding this body of knowledge into computable form cannot keep up with the rate of knowledge accumulation. The main thrust of the proposed research is to design novel statistical text-mining algorithms to acquire and represent knowledge regarding genes and proteins from free-text literature, and further to combine this acquired knowledge with experimental data to derive new knowledge. We will organize the proposed research to the following specific aims. Specific Aim 1. Develop ontology-guided semantic modeling algorithms for extracting biological concepts from free text, in which we will design hierarchical probabilistic topic models that are capable of representing biological concepts as a hierarchy and develop novel learning algorithms to infer biological concepts from free-text documents. Specific Aim 2. Integrate semantic modeling with BioNLP to extract textual evidence supporting protein-function annotations. We will develop information extraction algorithms that will combine the results of hierarchical semantic analysis and BioNLP to identify the text regions that will most likely provide evidence regarding the function of genes/proteins and map the extracted information to a controlled vocabulary. Specific Aim 3. Develop a framework to unify the procedures of knowledge reasoning and data mining for knowledge discovery. In this aim, we will reason using existing knowledge (represented in the form of an ontology) to reveal functional modules among the genes from the experimental data. We will then further develop algorithms that will reveal relationships between these gene modules by mining system-scaled experimental data. The overall framework will integrate functional reasoning and data mining in an iterative manner to refine the knowledge progressively and to derive rules such as: when genes involved in biological process X are perturbed, genes involved in biological process Y will respond. We will test the framework on the data from yeast-system biology studies and the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project to gain insights into the cellular systems and disease mechanisms of cancer cells.           In recent decades, biomedical sciences have achieved significant advances; most of the knowledge resulting from research is stored in the form of biomedical literature in the form free-text.

"Human-Centered Perceptual and Conceptual Classification of Biomedical Images    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Biomedical images are ever increasing in quantity and importance yet effective computing solutions for managing images and understanding their content are lacking. Image understanding is a key limiting factor in advancing these endeavors. Major challenges remain in understanding the capabilities of the human visual system with respect to biomedical imaging and in extracting and utilizing tacit knowledge of domain experts. To meet these challenges, we propose an innovative, multidisciplinary approach which combines methods of user centered design, visual perception and computer imaging research to interact with domain experts and to elicit and use their extrinsic and intrinsic knowledge. We will use a novel contextual design approach to inspection of dermatology images to discover relationships between perceptually- relevant visual content of images and users' conceptual understanding as expressed through natural language. Analysis of users' eye movements and verbal descriptions, together with mapping to domain medical ontologies, will allow us to integrate visual data with a user-specified language model to define perceptual categories and inform image classification. This is a fundamental and challenging data to knowledge problem that has not been solved. This study will provide proof of concept of the value of eliciting tacit knowledge from domain experts through multiple perceptually relevant modes in order to integrate data and knowledge models for better image understanding and may help enact a paradigm shift in how we conceptualize and develop biomedical information systems, in general.             Project Narrative Biomedical images are ever increasing in quantity yet their usefulness for research, medicine, and teaching is limited by the design of current computing systems. Discoveries and concrete advances made in this study will contribute to solutions for effective use of digital images-a problem that is central to research and application across science, technology, and medicine.

"Collaborative Development of Biomedical Ontologies and Terminologies    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The development of ontologies that define entities and the relationships among them has become essential for modern work in biomedicine. Ontologies help both humans and computers to manage the burgeoning data that are pervasive in biology and medicine. The need to annotate, retrieve, and integrate high-throughput data sets, to process natural language, and to build systems for decision support has set many communities of investigators to work building large ontologies. To date, these groups of ontology developers have been limited by the lack of methods and tools that facilitate distributed, collaborative engineering of large-scale ontologies and vocabularies. In this proposal, we outline three specific aims. First, we will explore basic computational methods that are essential for collaborative ontology engineering. We will investigate methods for representing diverse collaborative workflows, information about changes and concept history, trust, and provenance, and for recording decision making and design rationale. Empirical analysis of existing ontology-development projects will inform our construction of models for collaborative development workflows that will guide the processes of authoring, reviewing, and curating biomedical ontologies. Second, we will use the results from our first specific aim to build cProtigi, a set of robust, customizable, interactive tools to support distributed users in their collaborative work to build and edit terminologies and ontologies. Third, we will evaluate our work in the context of real-world, large-scale ontology-engineering projects, including the autism ontology of the National Database for Autism Research; the 11th revision of the WHO's International Classification of Diseases; the Ontology for Biomedical Investigations, under development by a wide range of NIH-supported researchers; and BiomedGT, under development by NCI. It is no longer feasible to imagine that investigators can create biomedical ontologies working independently. The collaborative methods that we will study and the tools that we will build will lead to expanded opportunities to support the diverse data- and knowledge-intensive activities that pervade BISTI, the CTSAs, the NCBCs, and myriad biomedical initiatives that require robust, scaleable ontologies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The knowledge-based nature of modern medicine requires the use of ontologies and terminologies to process and integrate data. Ontology development itself becomes a collaborative process, with members of the larger research community contributing to and commenting on emerging ontologies.

The proposed tool represents a novel approach for monitoring scientific progress in biology, which has become a formidable task. We will exploit recent advances in machine learning and database systems to develop a useful approximation to a personalized biological knowledge base f.i.i.e., single information resource that would include all the knowledge sources on which a biologist relies. More specifically, we propose a scheme for loosely integrating both structured information and unstructured text, and then querying the integrated information using easily-formulated similarity queries. The system will also learn from every episode in which a biologist seeks information. The research team on this project includes a computer scientist and two biologists.

"Scalable Learning with Ensemble Techniques and Parallel Computing    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The ability to conduct basic and applied biomedical research is becoming increasingly dependent on data produced by new and emerging technologies. This data has an unprecedented amount of detail and volume. Researchers are therefore dependent on computing and computational tools to be able to visualize, analyze, model, and interpret these large and complex sets of data. Tools for disease detection, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention are common goals of many, if not all, biomedical research programs. Sound analytical and statistical theory and methodology for class pre- diction and class discovery lay the foundation for building these tools, of which the machine learning techniques of classification (supervised learning) and clustering (unsupervised learning) are crucial. Our goal is to produce software for analysis and interpretation of large data sets using ensemble machine learning techniques and parallel computing technologies. Ensemble techniques are recent advances in machine learning theory and methodology leading to great improvements in accuracy and stability in data set analysis and interpretation. The results from a committee of primary machine learners (classifiers or clusterers) that have been trained on different instance or feature subsets are combined through techniques such as voting. The high prediction accuracy of classifier ensembles (such as boosting, bagging, and random forests) has generated much excitement in the statistics and machine learning communities. Recent research extends the ensemble methodology to clustering, where class information is unavailable, also yielding superior performance in terms of accuracy and stability. In theory, most ensemble techniques are inherently parallel. However, existing implementations are generally serial and assume the data set is memory resident. Therefore current software will not scale to the large data sets produced in today's biomedical research. We propose to take two approaches to scale ensemble techniques to large data sets: data partitioning approaches and parallel computing. The focus of Phase I will be to prototype scalable classifier ensembles using parallel architectures. We intend to: establish the parallel computing infrastructures; produce a preliminary architecture and software design; investigate a wide range of ensemble generation schemes using data partitioning strategies; and implement scalable bagging and random forests based on the preliminary design. The focus of Phase II will be to complete the software architecture and implement the scalable classifier ensembles and scalable clusterer ensembles within this framework. We intend to: complete research and development of classifier ensembles; extend the classification framework to clusterer ensembles; research and develop a unified interface for building ensembles with differing generation mechanisms and combination strategies; and evaluate the effectiveness of the software on simulated and real data. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The common goals to many, if not all, biomedical research programs are the development of tools for disease detection, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention. These programs often rely on new types of data that have an unprecedented amount of detail and volume.

"New Machine Learning Methods for Biomedical Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  In the past few years, we have witnessed a dramatic increase of the amount of data available to biomedical research. An example is the recent advances of high-throughput biotechnologies, making it possible to access genome-wide gene expressions. To address biomedical issues at molecular levels, extraction of the relevant information from massive data of complex structures is essential. This calls for advanced mechanisms for statistical prediction and inference, especially in genomic discovery and prediction, where statistical uncertainty involved in a discovery process is high. The proposed approach focuses on the development of mixture model-based and large margin approaches in semisupervised and unsupervised learning, motivated from biomedical studies in gene discovery and prediction. In particular, we propose to investigate how to improve accuracy and efficiency of mixture model-based and large margin learning systems in generalization. In addition, we will develop innovative methods taking the structure of sparseness and the grouping effect into account to battle the curse of dimensionality, and blend them with the new learning tools. A number of technical issues will be investigated, including: a) developing model selection criteria and performing automatic feature selection, especially when the number of features greatly exceeds that of samples; b) developing large margin approaches for multi-class learning, with most effort towards sparse as well as structured learning; c) implementing efficient computation for real-time applications, and d) analyzing two biological datasets for i) gene function discovery and prediction for E. coli, and ii) new class discovery and prediction for BOEC samples; e) developing public-domain software. Furthermore, computational strategies will be explored based on global optimization techniques, particularly convex programming and difference convex programming.           n/a",New Machine Learning Methods for Biomedical Data,7881671,R01GM081535,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Arts', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Research', 'Biometry', 'Biotechnology', 'Blood', 'Blood Cells', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Consult', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA-Protein Interaction', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Documentation', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Escherichia coli', 'Gene Cluster', 'Gene Expression', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Human', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Nonparametric Statistics', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Process', 'Property', 'Public Domains', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Selection Criteria', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'design', 'disorder subtype', 'gene discovery', 'gene function', 'genome sequencing', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'information classification', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'programs', 'protein protein interaction', 'research study', 'software development', 'statistics', 'tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2010,264640,0.005044196722783275
"Textpresso information retrieval and extraction system for biological literature    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We developed an information retrieval and extraction system that processes the full text of biological papers. The system, called Textpresso, separates text into sentences, labels words and phrases according to an ontology (an organized lexicon), and allows queries to be performed on a database of labeled sentences. The current ontology comprises approximately one hundred categories of terms, such as ""gene"", ""regulation"", ""human disease"", ""brain area"" etc., and also contains main Gene Ontology (GO) categories. Extraction of particular biological facts, such as gene-gene interactions, or the curation of GO cellular components, can be accelerated significantly by ontologies, with Textpresso automatically performing nearly as well as expert curators to identify sentences. Search engine for four literatures, C. elegans, Drosophila, Arabidopsis and Neuroscience have been established by us, and nine systems for other literatures have been developed by other groups around the world. The system will be further developed in many aspects. In collaboration with the respective model organism databases, we will set up literature search engine for zebrafish, rat and Dictyostelium and consider systems for important diseases such as cancer, Alzheimer's and AIDS. We will improve the quality of searchable full text by carrying super- and subscripts as well as special character information, and recognizing subsections of a paper. Website and system enhancement will include synonym searches, better website customization features (""myTextpresso""), browsing and searching a paper taxonomy, implementation of batch queries and notification of search result changes due to corpus changes. We will offer webservices for Textpresso and maintain a public subversion system for the software. Named entity recognition algorithms will be implemented to find new terms for the ontology from full text. We will work on the problem of high specificity of terms in the lexica, which reduces recall, and enable searches for GO annotations. Strategies for (semi-) automated literature curation include installing a paper triage system and first pass curation to identify where in a paper which relevant data types can be found. Automated curation tasks include producing connections between a paper and a biological entity such as gene. We will develop learning algorithms that discover new categories and lexica in text. We will improve our curation strategy of developing specialized curation categories that are used to retrieve specific data, and develop corresponding curator interfaces to automate the processing pipeline from full text to database. We will research and implement new, more semantically oriented ways of searching by combining latent semantic indexing with new similarity measures. Machine learning algorithms for classifying sentences and extracting information will be implemented using hidden Markov models. A new approach of finding categories and lexica using graph theory will be investigated. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Narrative Biomedical researchers need to read or skim many thousands of scientific articles each year, more than is humanly possible.

"National Center: Multi-Scale Study of Cellular Networks(RMI)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  A network of molecular interactions, involving many thousands of genes, their products, and other molecules, underlie cellular processes. Investigation of these interactions across a wide range of scales ranging from the formation/activation of transcriptional complexes, to the availability of a signaling pathway, all the way to macroscopic processes, such as cell adhesion, calls for a new level of sophistication in the design of genome- wide computational approaches. A homogeneous environment for the comprehensive mapping and analysis of molecular cellular interactions in would be a powerful resource for the biomedical research community. We propose the creation of a National Center for the Multiscale Analysis of Genomic and Cellular Networks (MAGNet). The Center will provide an integrative computational framework to organize molecular interactions in the cell into manageable context-dependent components and will develop interoperable computational models and tools that can leverage such a map of cellular interactions to elucidate important biological processes. Center activities will involve a significant, multidisciplinary effort of biological and computational sciences. Specific areas of expertise include natural language parsing (NLP), machine learning (ML), software systems and engineering, databases, computational structural biology, reverse engineering of genetic networks, biomedical literature datamining, and biomedical ontologies, among others. The Center will 1) construct an evidence integration framework to collect and fuse a variety of diverse cellular interaction clues based on their statistical relevance 2) assemble a comprehensive set of physics- and knowledge-based methodologies to fill this framework 3) provide a set of methodologies and filters, anchored in formal domain ontologies, to associated specific interactions to an organism, tissue, molecular, and cellular context. All relevant tools will be made accessible to the biomedical research community through a common, extensible, and interoperable software platform, geWorkbench. We will reach out to train and encourage researchers to use and/or develop new modules for, geWorkbench. An important element of the software platform will be the development of specific components that can exploit the evidence integration techniques developed by Core 9001 investigators to combine molecular interaction clues from Core 9002 algorithms and databases. Development will be both driven and tested by the biomedical community to ensure the usefulness of the tools and the usability of the graphical user interfaces to address biomedical problems in completely novel ways, to dissect the web of cellular interactions responsible for cellular processes and functions.         n/a",National Center: Multi-Scale Study of Cellular Networks(RMI),8110238,U54CA121852,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Science', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Genes', 'Genetic Engineering', 'Genomics', 'Internet', 'Investigation', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methodology', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Analysis', 'Ontology', 'Organism', 'Physics', 'Process', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Signal Pathway', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'base', 'biomedical ontology', 'computer framework', 'data mining', 'design', 'genome-wide', 'graphical user interface', 'knowledge base', 'multidisciplinary', 'natural language', 'novel', 'software systems', 'structural biology', 'tool', 'usability']",NCI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,U54,2010,29814,0.03305552398023924
"Development of a Research-Ready Pregnancy and Newborn Biobank in California    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Development of a Research-Ready Pregnancy and Newborn Biobank in California Population-based biobanks are a critical resource for identifying disease mechanisms and developing screening tests for biomarkers associated with certain disorders. The California Department of Public Health has been banking newborn specimens statewide since 1982 (N~14 million) and maternal prenatal specimens for a portion of the state since 2000 (N~1 million), creating one of the largest, if not the largest single biological specimen banks with linked data in the world. With the fast pace of new knowledge in genetics and laboratory methods, the demand for specimens and data from researchers around the world now far surpasses the Department's ability to fill them. The goal of this infrastructure development project is to create an efficient, high throughput, low cost newborn screening and prenatal/maternal screening specimen biobank and linked data base that could be used by large numbers of researchers around the world for a wide range of studies through the following aims: (1) establishment of highly efficient protocols and procurement and integration of automated systems for pulling and processing specimens; (2) development of an integrated specimen tracking system into the Department's existing web-based Screening Information System; (3) development of a computerized system to track application requests for specimens and data; and (4) development of a linked screening program-vital records database that is organized into a life course, client based system. These aims will be accomplished through expansion of the Department's award-winning Screening Integration System to include web-based tracking of specimens and research requests, and use of an innovative machine-learning record matching application for high-performance linkages. After the 2 year grant period is completed, the California Research Ready Biospecimen Bank will be able to provide researchers with valuable biological specimens in a timely, cost-effective manner, thereby enabling a dramatic expansion of epidemiological research nationwide. The continuity of the system will be ensured by codifying human subjects-sensitive policies and procedures into Departmental regulations and by charging researchers modest fees for specimens, data and other research services.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Development of a research-ready pregnancy and newborn biobank in California This proposal funds infrastructure development to create a research-ready, efficient, high- throughput, and low-cost prenatal and newborn biobank in California.

"Biomedical Language Processing Writ Large:  Scaling to all of PubMedCentral    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Recent developments in text mining research, and in scientific publication, have brought us to the moment when the long-standing potential of natural language processing technology to benefit biomedical researchers may finally be realized. Technological advances, recent results in computational linguistics, maturation of biomedical ontology, and the advent of resources such as PubMedCentral have set the stage for an attempt at an integrated computational analysis of a large proportion of the full text biomedical literature. Such an analysis has the potential to dramatically extend the way that biomedical researchers can effectively use the scientific literature, particularly in the analysis of genome-scale datasets, broadly accelerating and increasing the efficiency of scientific discovery. We hypothesize that it is now possible to extract a wide variety of ontologically-grounded entities and relationships by processing the entire PubMedCentral document collection accurately and with good coverage, to use this extracted information to produce new genres of scientifically valuable tools and analysis techniques, and to demonstrate its utility in the analysis of genome-scale data. The challenges that we plan to overcome range from fundamental linguistic issues (e.g. cross- document coreference resolution) to high-performance computing (e.g. scaling up integrated processing to include millions of complex documents), to fielding practical systems that can exploit enormous knowledge-bases to accelerate the analysis of very large molecular data sets.              Project narrative Enormous amounts of biomedical information are now available in the PubMedCentral database, but computers cannot work with it because it is in the form of human-language text and humans can't read it all due to its large volume.

"Informatics Infrastructure for vector-based neuroanatomical atlases    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The adage:  'all data is spatial' is especially pertinent in the field of neuroscience, since neuronal data must be indexed by the neuroanatomical location of phenomena or entities under study.  Brain atlases are very widely used as laboratory tools, being some of the most highly cited publications in science.  This proposal seeks to use brain atlases as a method for indexing data from the literature in a neuroinformatics system.  This data includes both textual and graphical information, ranging from highly detailed maps constructed from vector- based spatial primitives, histological photographs and drawings, to textual reports of experimental findings in the literature (which we will analyze on a large scale).  These data represent a significant scientific investment that are currently locked away in previously published journal articles (and the detailed data-sets and drawings from researchers that were used to write the articles).  A prototype that summarizes the last fifteen years' output of one of the world's most prominent neuroanatomy laboratories is immediately available.  This project will develop a collaborative environment to enable neuroscientists to use these valuable maps within the community as a whole by contributing data to a shared system with an open-source system (called 'NeuARt II') that permits querying, overlaying, viewing and annotating such data in an integrated manner.  We will also use Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to index neuroanatomical references in large numbers of journal articles to be accessible within our infrastructure.  As an initial text corpus, we over 110,000 documents taken from last 35 years of published information from the primary neuroanatomical literature.  We will construct a neuroanatomical interface that conceptually resembles the 'Google Maps' system, permitting users to use an intuitive spatial interface to browse large amounts of biomedical data in spatial register.  The proposed infrastructure will also provide new opportunities to compare and synthesize the anatomical components of neuroscience data multiple modalities (physiological, behavioral, clinical, genetic, molecular, etc.).PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Given the scope of the use of neuroanatomical maps from the rat and mouse in the study of neurobiological disease, we expect our research impact scientists working in almost all subfields of the subject.

"Ontology-based Information Network to Support Vaccine Research    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Since the introduction of Edward Jenner's smallpox vaccine in 1796, vaccines have proven invaluable for their ability to stimulate the immune system and to confer protection against pathogenic organisms. Progress in modern vaccine research has been accompanied by a dramatic increase in the number of vaccine-related papers in the published literature. It has become increasingly challenging to identify and annotate vaccine data from this large and diverse literature which no one scientist or team can fully master. Although vaccine databases exist that emphasize commercialized vaccines, no public central repository is available to store research data concerning commercial vaccines, vaccines in clinical trials, or vaccine candidates in early stages of development, in a fashion that render such data available for advanced analyses. To fill this need, we have developed VIOLIN (http://www.violinet.org), a web-based database system for annotation, storage, and analysis of published vaccine data. An ontology represents consensus-based controlled vocabularies of terms and relations, with associated definitions which are logically formulated in such a way as to promote automated reasoning. A bottleneck of vaccine research and further VIOLIN development is the lack of a vaccine ontology, which in turn makes a significant obstacle for vaccine data standardization, retrieval, integration, and advanced analysis and prediction. Our goal is to develop the community-based Vaccine Ontology (VO) and apply it to efficient vaccine literature mining and analysis of protective immune mechanisms. We will focus on two model pathogens: Escherichia coli and Brucella species. This project contains three specific aims: (1) develop a community-based Vaccine Ontology (VO), and apply it to establish a vaccine knowledgebase and to promote vaccine data integration and query through Semantic Web. The VO development will be achieved through collaboration with vaccine researchers, the Infectious Disease Ontology (IDO) Initiative, and the National Center for Biomedical Ontology (NCBO); (2) develop a VO-based natural language processing (NLP) system and apply it for more efficient retrieval of Brucella and E. coli vaccine information, automated annotation of journal articles with VO terms, and VO improvement. This task will be achieved by collaboration with the National Center for Integrative Biomedical Informatics (NCIBI). (3) analyze and predict vaccine targets and protective immune networks attributable to the interactions between host and vaccine. This will be achieved mainly by VO-based literature mining and a novel genome- and literature-based statistical methodology. This project will be implemented by a strong collaborative team and supported from a large user community. The Vaccine Ontology and its applications to literature mining and for studying protective immunity against Brucella spp. and E. coli will lay a strong foundation for further advanced informatics research on vaccines against infectious diseases in the post-genomics and information era.            Narrative: Vaccines stimulate the immune system and confer protection against pathogenic microorganisms. A bottleneck of vaccine research is the lack of an ontology (consensus- based controlled vocabularies of terms and relations) to ensure consistency of literature curation and support automated reasoning.

"BioScholar: a Biomedical Knowledge Engineering framework based on the published l    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Studying the primary research literature is a universal, primary activity for biomedical scientists. It underlies scientists' understanding of their subject and strengthens their capability to plan, execute, and interpret experiments. This proposal is concerned with the maintenance and continued development of software that supports scientists in their scholarly work. Our goal is to develop a knowledge engineering platform (called `BioScholar') to permit a single graduate student or postdoctoral worker to design, build, curate, and maintain a Knowledge Base (KB) for the literature of interest to a specific laboratory. This continues a previous software development project that was funded by the National Library of Medicine (LM 07061). We will continue to maintain the software using modern software engineering tools and approaches, whilst making it fully interoperable with a widely used ontology engineering platform (Protege /OWL). We will also develop the systems' existing capabilities to assist scientists with management of bibliographic data (citation information and full-text PDF articles). We will further develop tools to allow researchers to annotate PDF files with highlights, simple comments and with structured data. We will then use this annotation framework to drive the process of constructing knowledge bases using Protege/OWL (a widely used ontology editor). We will then incorporate Information Extraction (IE) techniques from modern Natural Language Processing (NLP) to improve the efficiency of this curation process. The NLP methods we use are based on the Conditional Random Fields (CRF) model which is considered state-of-the-art amongst NLP researchers. Finally, the most research-oriented component of this proposal is the development of a new methodology for knowledge representation and reasoning in biomedicine based on experimental design, involving experimental controls, independent and dependent variables, statistical significance and correlation between variables. This representation will be (a) understandable to experimental scientists, (b) lightweight, (c) versatile, and (d) capable of supporting inference between experiments. During the course of this project, we will build a KB for the world-leading neuroendocrinology laboratory of Prof. Alan Watts at University Southern California. Prof. Watts' work is concerned with the study of catecholaminergic control of the stress response, drawing on research from a large number of different fields (anatomy, physiology, molecular biology, etc.). After developing this KB, we will test its validity using subjective methods (questionnaires and interviews), and objective experiments (`mock exams' to see if students' performance with test questions based on comprehension of the primary literature). We will release all findings and tools to the biomedical community as research papers and open-source software. Narrative This project will help biomedical scientists manage, understand and communicate the complex information they must learn from scientific papers in multiple biomedical disciplines. As a demonstration of this work, we will build a comprehensive summary of research underlying brain circuits involved in stress.

A translational researcher studying a particular biological process using microarrays or proteomics will want to gather as many relevant publicly-available data sets as possible, to compare findings. Translational investigators wanting to relate clinical or chemical data with multiple genomic or proteomic measurements will want to find and join related data sets. Unfortunately, finding and joining relevant data sets is particularly challenging today, as the useful annotations of this data are still represented only by unstructured free-text, limiting its secondary use. A question we have sought to answer is whether prior investments in biomedical ontologies can provide leverage in determining the context of genomic data in an automated manner, thereby enabling integration of gene expression and proteomic data and the secondary use of genomic data in multiple fields of research beyond those for which the data sets were originally targeted. The three specific aims to address this question are to (1) develop tools that comprehensively map contextual annotations to the largest biomedical ontology, the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS), built and supported by the National Library of Medicine, validate, and disseminate the mappings, (2) execute a four-pronged strategy to evaluate experiment-concept mappings, and (3) apply experiment-context mappings to find and integrate data within and across microarray and proteomics repositories. To keep these tools relevant to biomedical investigators, we have included three Driving Biological Projects (DBPs), in the domains of breast cancer, organ transplantation, and T-cell biology. To accomplish these DBPs, our tools and mappings will be used to find and join experimental data within and across microarray and proteomic repositories. Having DBPs to address will focus our development on a set of scalable tools that can access and analyze experimental data covering a large variety of diseases. Through our advisory committee of world-renowned NIH-funded investigators, we will ensure that our findings will have broad applicability and are useful to a wide variety of biomedical researchers.          n/a",Integrating Microarray and Proteomic Data by Ontology-based Annotation,7929664,R01LM009719,"['Address', 'Advisory Committees', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Growth', 'Head', 'Human Genome Project', 'Improve Access', 'International', 'Investments', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Molecular Biology', 'Nature', 'Online Systems', 'Ontology', 'Organ Transplantation', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Process', 'Proteomics', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specificity', 'System', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Transplantation', 'Unified Medical Language System', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'United States National Library of Medicine', 'Writing', 'base', 'bench to bedside', 'biomedical informatics', 'biomedical ontology', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'repository', 'research study', 'text searching', 'tool', 'translational medicine']",NLM,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2010,277200,-0.002256235363183897
"Statistical Model Building for High Dimensional Biomedical Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Typical of current large-scale biomedical data is the feature of small number of observed samples and the widely observed sample heterogeneity. Identifying differentially expressed genes related to the sample phenotye (e.g., cancer disease development) and predicting sample phenotype based on the gene expressions are some central research questions in the microarray data analysis. Most existing statistical methods have ignored sample heterogeneity and thus loss power.       This project proposes to develop novel statistical methods that explicitly address the small sample size and sampe heterogeneity issues, and can be applied very generally. The usefulness of these methods will be shown with the large-scale biomedical data originating from the lung and kidney transplant research projects. The transplant projects aimed to improve the molecular diagnosis and therapy of lung/kidney allograft rejection by identifying molecular biomarkers to predict the allograft rejection for critical early treatment and rapid, noninvasive, and economical testing.       The specific aims are 1) Develop novel statistical methods for differential gene expression detection that explicitly model sample heterogeneity. 2) Develop novel statistical methods for classifying high-dimensional biomedical data and incorporating sample heterogeneity. 3) Develop novel statistical methods for jointly analyzing a set of genes (e.g., genes in a pathway). 4) Use the developed models and methods to answer research questions relevant to public health in the lung and kidney transplant projects; and implement and validate the proposed methods in user-friendly and well-documented software, and distribute them to the scientific community at no charge.       It is very important to identify new biomarkers of allograft rejection in lung and kidney transplant recipients. The rapid and reliable detection and prediction of rejection in easily obtainable body fluids may allow the rapid advancement of clinical interventional trials. We propose to study novel methods for analyzing the large-scale biomedical data to realize their full potential of molecular diagnosis and prognosis of transplant rejection prediction for critical early treatment.          n/a",Statistical Model Building for High Dimensional Biomedical Data,7858165,R01GM083345,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'Biological Markers', 'Body Fluids', 'Cations', 'Characteristics', 'Charge', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Early treatment', 'Effectiveness', 'Experimental Designs', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Graft Rejection', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Joints', 'Kidney Transplantation', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Literature', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Methods', 'Minnesota', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Diagnosis', 'Oncogene Activation', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Proposals', 'Resources', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Silicon Dioxide', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Transplantation', 'Universities', 'Ursidae Family', 'Work', 'allograft rejection', 'base', 'biobank', 'cancer microarray', 'cancer type', 'design', 'improved', 'interest', 'kidney allograft', 'method development', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'predictive modeling', 'simulation', 'software development', 'sound', 'theories', 'transplant database', 'user friendly software', 'user-friendly']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2010,253269,-0.05401569131129431
"Human-Centered Perceptual and Conceptual Classification of Biomedical Images    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Biomedical images are ever increasing in quantity and importance yet effective computing solutions for managing images and understanding their content are lacking. Image understanding is a key limiting factor in advancing these endeavors. Major challenges remain in understanding the capabilities of the human visual system with respect to biomedical imaging and in extracting and utilizing tacit knowledge of domain experts. To meet these challenges, we propose an innovative, multidisciplinary approach which combines methods of user centered design, visual perception and computer imaging research to interact with domain experts and to elicit and use their extrinsic and intrinsic knowledge. We will use a novel contextual design approach to inspection of dermatology images to discover relationships between perceptually- relevant visual content of images and users' conceptual understanding as expressed through natural language. Analysis of users' eye movements and verbal descriptions, together with mapping to domain medical ontologies, will allow us to integrate visual data with a user-specified language model to define perceptual categories and inform image classification. This is a fundamental and challenging data to knowledge problem that has not been solved. This study will provide proof of concept of the value of eliciting tacit knowledge from domain experts through multiple perceptually relevant modes in order to integrate data and knowledge models for better image understanding and may help enact a paradigm shift in how we conceptualize and develop biomedical information systems, in general.             Project Narrative Biomedical images are ever increasing in quantity yet their usefulness for research, medicine, and teaching is limited by the design of current computing systems. Discoveries and concrete advances made in this study will contribute to solutions for effective use of digital images-a problem that is central to research and application across science, technology, and medicine. Advancements in our understanding of the design of useful and usable information systems will benefit society at large and contribute to the public health.

"A Resource for Biomedical Ontologies and Knowledge Bases    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       For more than two decades, our laboratory has been studying technology to develop, manage, and use formal descriptions of biomedical concepts. The result of this work is Protege, a workbench that allows users to edit and apply controlled terminologies, ontologies, and knowledge bases to a wide range of information-management problems. To date, more than 50,000 people have registered as users of the system. Many diverse projects in biomedicine-supported by nearly every institute and center at NIH-have become critically dependent on this software and the knowledge-engineering principles that it supports. This P41 competing renewal application seeks to continue support for Protege, as a biomedical informatics resource that will benefit the system's entire user community.      We propose technology research and development to expand the capabilities of the Protege system to meet the current and anticipated needs of the user community. We will re-engineer Protege with a service-oriented architecture that can adapt to the requirements of new ontology languages, large ontology repositories, and cutting-edge ontology-management-services, such as reasoning, alignment, and evolution. We will create support for collaborative ontology development, in the context of both large, centralized projects and open, decentralized efforts. We also will develop advanced support for using ontologies in application software development and as integral parts of software systems.      As a biomedical informatics resource, we will expand our collaborative research projects with other Prot¿g¿ users. We will provide service to the Protege user community through enhanced technical support, user documentation, tutorials, and workshops.

"Collaborative Development of Biomedical Ontologies and Terminologies    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The development of ontologies that define entities and the relationships among them has become essential for modern work in biomedicine. Ontologies help both humans and computers to manage the burgeoning data that are pervasive in biology and medicine. The need to annotate, retrieve, and integrate high-throughput data sets, to process natural language, and to build systems for decision support has set many communities of investigators to work building large ontologies. To date, these groups of ontology developers have been limited by the lack of methods and tools that facilitate distributed, collaborative engineering of large-scale ontologies and vocabularies. In this proposal, we outline three specific aims. First, we will explore basic computational methods that are essential for collaborative ontology engineering. We will investigate methods for representing diverse collaborative workflows, information about changes and concept history, trust, and provenance, and for recording decision making and design rationale. Empirical analysis of existing ontology-development projects will inform our construction of models for collaborative development workflows that will guide the processes of authoring, reviewing, and curating biomedical ontologies. Second, we will use the results from our first specific aim to build cProtigi, a set of robust, customizable, interactive tools to support distributed users in their collaborative work to build and edit terminologies and ontologies. Third, we will evaluate our work in the context of real-world, large-scale ontology-engineering projects, including the autism ontology of the National Database for Autism Research; the 11th revision of the WHO's International Classification of Diseases; the Ontology for Biomedical Investigations, under development by a wide range of NIH-supported researchers; and BiomedGT, under development by NCI. It is no longer feasible to imagine that investigators can create biomedical ontologies working independently. The collaborative methods that we will study and the tools that we will build will lead to expanded opportunities to support the diverse data- and knowledge-intensive activities that pervade BISTI, the CTSAs, the NCBCs, and myriad biomedical initiatives that require robust, scaleable ontologies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The knowledge-based nature of modern medicine requires the use of ontologies and terminologies to process and integrate data. Ontology development itself becomes a collaborative process, with members of the larger research community contributing to and commenting on emerging ontologies. We plan to extend the Protigi ontology editor-the most widely used ontology editor today, with almost 100,000 registered users-to support collaborative development of ontologies and to evaluate the new tools by deploying them at the World Health Organization for the development of ICD-11 and in other settings.             n/a",Collaborative Development of Biomedical Ontologies and Terminologies,7774343,R01GM086587,"['Adopted', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Beds', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer Systems Development', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Generic Drugs', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Industry', 'Institutes', 'International Classification of Diseases', 'Internet', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Mainstreaming', 'Maintenance', 'Medicine', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modern Medicine', 'NCI Thesaurus', 'NIH Program Announcements', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Online Systems', 'Ontology', 'Outsourcing', 'Process', 'Program Development', 'Published Comment', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Scientist', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Trust', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'biomedical ontology', 'biomedical scientist', 'cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid', 'conflict resolution', 'design', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'forging', 'knowledge base', 'member', 'open source', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'response', 'tool', 'usability']",NIGMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2010,525262,0.0282367758359166
"Automated Integration of Biomedical Knowledge Today, ontologies are critical instruments for biomedical investigators, especially in those areas, such as cancer research, that require the command of a vast amount of information and a systemic approach to the design and interpretation of experiments. In fact, ontologies are proliferating in all areas of biomedical research, offering both challenges and opportunities. One of the principal challenges of this field stems from the fact that ontologies are developed in isolation, rendering it impossible to move, for instance, from genes to organisms, to diseases, to drugs. The National Center for Biomedical Ontology (NCBO) represents a fundamental endeavor in the collection, coordination and distribution of biomedical ontologies and offers an unparalleled opportunity to combine these biomedical ontologies into a single search space where genetic, anatomic, molecular and pharmacological information can be seamlessly explored and exploited as a holistic representation of biomedical knowledge. Unfortunately, ontology integration using standard means of manual curation is a labor intensive task, unable to scale up and keep up with the current growth rate of biomedical ontologies. We have developed a systematic framework for automated ontology engineering based on information theory, and we have successfully applied it to the analysis and engineering of Gene Ontology (GO), the development gene and protein databases, and the identification of peripheral biomarkers of disease progression and drug response. This project brings together a unique group of competences, ranging from ontology engineering, statistical signal processing, bioinformatics, cancer research, and clinical pharmacogenomics, to develop a principled method, grounded on the mathematics of information theory, to automatically combine and integrate biomedical ontologies and implement it as part of the NCBO architecture Ontologies are critical instruments for biomedical investigators especially in those areas, such as cancer research, that require a vast amount of information and a systemic approach to the design and interpretation of their experiments. In collaboration with the National Center for Biomedical Ontology (NCBO), this project will develop a principled method, grounded on the mathematics of information theory, to automatically combine biomedical ontologies. As a result, this project will integrate biomedical knowledge along dimensions that are today isolated and, in so doing, it will empower investigators with a new holistic understanding of disease, it will fast track the clinical  translation of biological discoveries, and it will change the approach to discovery, especially for those diseases that, like cancer, require a systemic view of their biological mechanisms.",Automated Integration of Biomedical Knowledge,7945368,R01HG004836,"['Anatomy', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomedical Research', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Communities', 'Competence', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Consultations', 'Controlled Vocabulary', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Engineered Gene', 'Engineering', 'Fostering', 'Future', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Information Theory', 'Internet', 'Java', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Mathematics', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Nature', 'Ontology', 'Organism', 'Peripheral', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Proliferating', 'Protein Databases', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Services', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Tissues', 'Translations', 'Validation', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'biomedical ontology', 'computer based Semantic Analysis', 'design', 'empowered', 'gene function', 'graphical user interface', 'information organization', 'instrument', 'interoperability', 'novel', 'open source', 'repository', 'research study', 'response', 'scale up', 'sound', 'statistics', 'stem']",NHGRI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2010,428079,0.04754803827101561
"Ontologies and Biomedical Language Processing    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We hypothesize that there are significant synergies between the applications of biomedical ontologies and of biomedical language processing (BLP) which can be used to improve the quality and scope of both activities. A growing body of work suggests such synergies might exist, but there has yet to be a systematic exploration of their potential. We propose to carry out a focused effort to explore both the potential for, and obstacles to, the mutual application of biomedical ontologies and biomedical language processing. To provide immediate biological relevance to our work, we propose to focus on the topics of autoimmune and pulmonary disease. We group our proposed explorations into three specific aims: (1) Create novel tools and approaches for the application and maintenance of biomedical ontologies, based on an assessment of the processes and tools used for the ontological annotation of textual corpora in the biomedical language processing community. Particularly, we will focus on the creation of new methods for effective search through large ontologies, compositional approaches to annotation, effective capture of the evidence underlying annotations, and the use of automated suggestions for manual confirmation. (2) Evaluate the utility of BLP tools and techniques when applied to terms and definitions of biomedical ontologies, both to enrich and interconnect orthogonal ontologies, and to provide quality assurance and quality control mechanisms. Particularly, we propose to develop and evaluate methods for connecting terms within and across ontologies, for assessing completeness of an ontology against the literature, and for implementing automatically executable measures of ontology quality. (3) Compare the differences between annotations produced by manual procedures and those produced by automated BLP methods for completeness and correctness. Based on the resulting data, produce guidelines for the optimal interplay between manual and automatic procedures for producing broad, accurate and useful knowledge-bases. Because ontologies are the central organizing tool of the model organism databases, improvements in their quality and in the ease and efficiency of their use will have a major effect on the model organism databases, speed the translational process generally, and create a potentially large public health impact.          n/a",Ontologies and Biomedical Language Processing,7928868,R01GM083649,"['Address', 'Area', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmune Process', 'Autoimmunity', 'Automated Annotation', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Computing', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Genes', 'Guidelines', 'Human', 'Immunology', 'Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Language', 'Linguistics', 'Literature', 'Lung diseases', 'Maintenance', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Metaphor', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Motivation', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Ontology', 'Peer Review', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Process Assessment', 'Production', 'Psyche structure', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Pulmonary Hypertension', 'Quality Control', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Role', 'Semantics', 'Speed', 'Suggestion', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Ursidae Family', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'biomedical ontology', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'design', 'experience', 'gene function', 'improved', 'information organization', 'innovation', 'knowledge base', 'language processing', 'model organisms databases', 'natural language', 'novel', 'quality assurance', 'tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R01,2010,605009,-0.0004377352432175009
"DEVELOPMENT OF DATA ONTOLOGIES FOR INTEGRATING MULTI-CENTER CARDIOVASCULAR STUDIE Cardiovascular disease (CVD) and its associated risk factors such as hypertension and dyslipidemia constitute a major public-health burden due to increased mortality and morbidity and rising health care costs. Massive epidemiological data are needed to detect the small effects of many individual genes and the environment on these traits. However, sample sizes needed to make powerful inferences may only be reached by integrating multiple epidemiological studies. Meaningful integration of information from multiple studies requires the development of data ontologies which make it possible to integrate information across studies in an optimum manner so as to maximize the information content and hence the statistical power for detecting small effect sizes. A second compounding problem of data integration is that software applications that manage such study data are typically non-interoperable, i.e. “silos” of data, and are incapable of being shared in a syntactically and semantically meaningful manner. Consequently, an infrastructure that integrates across studies in an interoperable manner is needed to ensure that epidemiological cardiovascular research remains a viable and major player in the biomedical informatics revolution which is currently underway. The cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid (caBIGTM) is addressing these problems in the cancer domain by developing software systems that are able to exchange information or that are syntactically interoperable by accessing metadata that is semantically annotated using controlled vocabularies. Our overarching goal is to develop ontologies for integrating cardiovascular epidemiological data from multiple studies. Specifically, we propose three Aims: First, develop cardiovascular data ontologies and vocabularies for each of three disparate multi-center epidemiological studies that facilitate data integration across the studies and data mining for various phenotypes. Second, adopt a technology infrastructure that leverages the cardiovascular data ontologies and vocabularies using Model Driven Architecture (MDA) and caBIGTM tools to facilitate the integration and widespread sharing of cardiovascular data sets. Third, facilitate seamless data sharing and promote widespread data dissemination among research communities cutting across clinical, translational and epidemiological domains, primarily through collaboration with the established CardioVascular Research Grid (CVRG). Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity which contributes substantially to rising health care costs and consequently constitutes a major public health burden. Therefore, understanding the genetic and environmental effects on these CVD traits is important. Massive epidemiological study data are needed to detect the small individual effects of genes and their interactions, and integration of multiple epidemiological studies are necessary for generating large sample sizes. Unfortunately, integrating information from multiple studies in a meaningful manner requires the development of data ontologies (language and grammar).

"National Center: Multiscale Analysis of Genomic and Cellular Networks (MAGNet) A network of molecular interactions, involving many thousands of genes, their products, and other molecules, underlie cellular processes. Investigation of these interactions across a wide range of scales ranging from the formation/activation of transcriptional complexes, to the availability of a signaling pathway, all the way to macroscopic processes, such as cell adhesion, calls for a new level of sophistication in the design of genome- wide computational approaches. A homogeneous environment for the comprehensive mapping and analysis of molecular cellular interactions in would be a powerful resource for the biomedical research community. We propose the creation of a National Center for the Multiscale Analysis of Genomic and Cellular Networks (MAGNet). The Center will provide an integrative computational framework to organize molecular interactions in the cell into manageable context-dependent components and will develop interoperable computational models and tools that can leverage such a map of cellular interactions to elucidate important biological processes. Center activities will involve a significant, multidisciplinary effort of biological and computational sciences. Specific areas of expertise include natural language parsing (NLP), machine learning (ML), software systems and engineering, databases, computational structural biology, reverse engineering of genetic networks, biomedical literature datamining, and biomedical ontologies, among others. The Center will 1) construct an evidence integration framework to collect and fuse a variety of diverse cellular interaction clues based on their statistical relevance 2) assemble a comprehensive set of physics- and knowledge-based methodologies to fill this framework 3) provide a set of methodologies and filters, anchored in formal domain ontologies, to associated specific interactions to an organism, tissue, molecular, and cellular context. All relevant tools will be made accessible to the biomedical research community through a common, extensible, and interoperable software platform, geWorkbench. We will reach out to train and encourage researchers to use and/or develop new modules for, geWorkbench. An important element of the software platform will be the development of specific components that can exploit the evidence integration techniques developed by Core 9001 investigators to combine molecular interaction clues from Core 9002 algorithms and databases. Development will be both driven and tested by the biomedical community to ensure the usefulness of the tools and the usability of the graphical user interfaces to address biomedical problems in completely novel ways, to dissect the web of cellular interactions responsible for cellular processes and functions.   n/a",National Center: Multiscale Analysis of Genomic and Cellular Networks (MAGNet),8012947,U54CA121852,[' '],NCI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,U54,2010,3757192,0.031304294046992344
"Towards the Building of a Comprehensive Searchable Biological Experiment Database    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The rapid growth of the biomedical literature and the expansion in disciplinary biomedical research, heralded by high-throughput genome sciences and technologies, have overwhelmed scientists who attempt to assimilate information necessary for their research. The widespread adoption of title/abstract word searches, such as highly desirable the National Library of Medicine's PubMed system, has provided the first major advance in the way bioscientists find relevant publications since the origin of Index Medicus in 1879 (Hunter and Cohen 2006). The importance of developing valid information retrieval systems for bioscientists has led to the development of information systems worldwide (e.g., Arrowsmith (Smalheiser and Swanson 1998), BioText (Hearst 2003), GeneWays (Friedman et al. 2001; Rzhetsky et al. 2004), iHOP (Hoffmann and Valencia 2005), and BioMedQA (Lee et al. 2006a), and annotated databases (e.g., SWISSPROT, OMIM (Hamosh et al. 2005) and BIND (Alfarano et al. 2005)).      However, most of information systems target only text information and fail to provide access to other important data such as images (e.g., figures). More than any other documentation, figures usually represent the ""evidence"" of discovery in the biomedical literature. Full-text biological articles nearly always incorporate figures/images that are the crucial content of the biomedical literature. Our examination of biological articles in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) revealed the occurrence of 5.2 images per article on average (Yu and Lee 2006a). Biologists need to access image data to validate research facts and to formulate or to test novel research hypotheses. It has been evaluated that textual statements reported in literature frequently are noisy (i.e., containing ""false facts"") (Krauthammer et al. 2002). Capturing images that are experimental ""evidence"" to support the textual ""fact"" will benefit bioscience information systems, databases, and bioscientists.      Unfortunately, this wealth of information remains virtually inaccessible without automatic systems to organize these images. We propose the development of advanced natural language processing (NLP) tools to semantically organize images. We hypothesize that text that associated with images semantically entails the image content and natural language processing techniques can be developed to accurately associate the text to their images. Furthermore, we hypothesize that images can be semantically organized by categories specified by standard biological ontology, and that natural language processing approaches can accurately assign the ontological categories to images.      Our specific aims are:      Aim 1: To develop and evaluate NLP techniques for identifying textual statements that correspond to images in full-text articles. We will develop different approaches for two types of the associations. We will first propose rule-based and statistical approaches to identify the associated text that appears in the full-text articles. We will then develop hybrid approaches to link sentences in abstracts to images in the body of the articles.      Aim 2: To develop and evaluate NLP techniques for automatic classification of experimental results into categories (e.g., Western-Blot, PCR verification, etc) specified in the experimental protocol Protocol-Online.      We will explore the use of dictionary-based, rule-based, image classification, and machine-learning approaches for accomplishing this aim.      Aim 3: To develop and evaluate NLP techniques for automatic assignment of Gene Ontology categories to experiments, which will provide a knowledge-based organization of experiments according to biological properties (e.g., catalytic activity). We will develop statistical and machine-learning approaches for accomplishing this aim.      We found that most of the images that appear in full-text biological articles are figure images (Yu and Lee 2006a) and we therefore focus on figure images only in this proposal. The deliverable of Specific Aim 1 will be an effective user-interface BioEx from which bioscientists can access images directly from sentences in the abstracts. BioEx has the promise of improvement over the traditional single-document-per-article format that has dominated bioscience publications since the first scientific article appeared in 1665 (Gross 2002). The deliverables of Specific Aim 2 and 3 will be open-source algorithms and tools that accurately map images to categories specified by the Gene Ontology and the Protocol Online. Those algorithms and tools will enhance bioscience information retrieval, information extraction, summarization, and question answering.          n/a",Towards the Building of a Comprehensive Searchable Biological Experiment Database,7534822,R21RR024933,"['Adoption', 'Advanced Development', 'Algorithms', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Research', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Dictionary', 'Documentation', 'Flowcharts', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Index Medicus', 'Information Retrieval', 'Information Retrieval Systems', 'Information Systems', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Online Mendelian Inheritance In Man', 'Ontology', 'Principal Investigator', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'PubMed', 'Publications', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Specific qualifier value', 'SwissProt', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'United States National Academy of Sciences', 'United States National Library of Medicine', 'Western Blotting', 'abstracting', 'base', 'knowledge base', 'novel', 'open source', 'programs', 'rapid growth', 'research study', 'tool']",NCRR,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN MILWAUKEE,R21,2009,179517,-0.01497029729871492
"Answering Information Needs in Workflow    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Needs for information arise continuously during the course of clinical practice, especially for physicians in training, e.g. when examining a patient or participating in rounds. In most of these situations, it is difficult or impossible for the clinician to immediately access appropriate information resources. Most needs are never adequately articulated or recorded, and consequently are forgotten by the end of the day. Moreover, when clinicians do recall information needs, they don't act on them, due to the significant limitations of current retrieval systems and the exigencies of clinical practice. The specific aims of the proposed project are: 1) to capture information needs in a convenient manner at the moment they occur using different modalities such as text input and voice capture on hand-held devices, 2) to translate high-level information needs into complex search strategies that adapt to user needs and are tuned to the capabilities of resources, and 3) to deliver relevant materials to the clinician in an accessible format and in a timely manner. The project will develop a central hub for addressing the information needs of medical students and residents, to be transmitted electronically as they occur in the field. A unique feature of the project is the use of natural language processing technology to identify context, goals and preferences in clinicians' questions. The major innovation is the generation of complex search strategies that exploit this contextual information, based on studies of human searching experts (reference librarians).              n/a",Answering Information Needs in Workflow,7918614,R01LM008799,"['Address', 'Biological Models', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Face', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Human', 'Information Resources', 'Knowledge', 'Librarians', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Errors', 'Medical Students', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Software Tools', 'System', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Textbooks', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Voice', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'forgetting', 'innovation', 'natural language', 'preference', 'speech processing', 'symposium']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R01,2009,185745,-0.006291635696380183

"New Machine Learning Methods for Biomedical Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  In the past few years, we have witnessed a dramatic increase of the amount of data available to biomedical research. An example is the recent advances of high-throughput biotechnologies, making it possible to access genome-wide gene expressions. To address biomedical issues at molecular levels, extraction of the relevant information from massive data of complex structures is essential. This calls for advanced mechanisms for statistical prediction and inference, especially in genomic discovery and prediction, where statistical uncertainty involved in a discovery process is high. The proposed approach focuses on the development of mixture model-based and large margin approaches in semisupervised and unsupervised learning, motivated from biomedical studies in gene discovery and prediction. In particular, we propose to investigate how to improve accuracy and efficiency of mixture model-based and large margin learning systems in generalization. In addition, we will develop innovative methods taking the structure of sparseness and the grouping effect into account to battle the curse of dimensionality, and blend them with the new learning tools. A number of technical issues will be investigated, including: a) developing model selection criteria and performing automatic feature selection, especially when the number of features greatly exceeds that of samples; b) developing large margin approaches for multi-class learning, with most effort towards sparse as well as structured learning; c) implementing efficient computation for real-time applications, and d) analyzing two biological datasets for i) gene function discovery and prediction for E. coli, and ii) new class discovery and prediction for BOEC samples; e) developing public-domain software.

"Textpresso: information retrieval and extraction system for biological literature    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We developed an information retrieval and extraction system that processes the full text of biological papers. The system, called Textpresso, separates text into sentences, labels words and phrases according to an ontology (an organized lexicon), and allows queries to be performed on a database of labeled sentences. The current ontology comprises approximately one hundred categories of terms, such as ""gene"", ""regulation"", ""human disease"", ""brain area"" etc., and also contains main Gene Ontology (GO) categories. Extraction of particular biological facts, such as gene-gene interactions, or the curation of GO cellular components, can be accelerated significantly by ontologies, with Textpresso automatically performing nearly as well as expert curators to identify sentences. Search engine for four literatures, C. elegans, Drosophila, Arabidopsis and Neuroscience have been established by us, and nine systems for other literatures have been developed by other groups around the world. The system will be further developed in many aspects. In collaboration with the respective model organism databases, we will set up literature search engine for zebrafish, rat and Dictyostelium and consider systems for important diseases such as cancer, Alzheimer's and AIDS. We will improve the quality of searchable full text by carrying super- and subscripts as well as special character information, and recognizing subsections of a paper. Website and system enhancement will include synonym searches, better website customization features (""myTextpresso""), browsing and searching a paper taxonomy, implementation of batch queries and notification of search result changes due to corpus changes. We will offer webservices for Textpresso and maintain a public subversion system for the software. Named entity recognition algorithms will be implemented to find new terms for the ontology from full text. We will work on the problem of high specificity of terms in the lexica, which reduces recall, and enable searches for GO annotations. Strategies for (semi-) automated literature curation include installing a paper triage system and first pass curation to identify where in a paper which relevant data types can be found. Automated curation tasks include producing connections between a paper and a biological entity such as gene. We will develop learning algorithms that discover new categories and lexica in text. We will improve our curation strategy of developing specialized curation categories that are used to retrieve specific data, and develop corresponding curator interfaces to automate the processing pipeline from full text to database. We will research and implement new, more semantically oriented ways of searching by combining latent semantic indexing with new similarity measures. Machine learning algorithms for classifying sentences and extracting information will be implemented using hidden Markov models. A new approach of finding categories and lexica using graph theory will be investigated.

The Center will provide an integrative computational framework to organize molecular interactions in the cell into manageable context-dependent components and will develop interoperable computational models and tools that can leverage such a map of cellular interactions to elucidate important biological processes. Center activities will involve a significant, multidisciplinary effort of biological and computational sciences. Specific areas of expertise include natural language parsing (NLP), machine learning (ML), software systems and engineering, databases, computational structural biology, reverse engineering of genetic networks, biomedical literature datamining, and biomedical ontologies, among others. The Center will 1) construct an evidence integration framework to collect and fuse a variety of diverse cellular interaction clues based on their statistical relevance 2) assemble a comprehensive set of physics- and knowledge-based methodologies to fill this framework 3) provide a set of methodologies and filters, anchored in formal domain ontologies, to associated specific interactions to an organism, tissue, molecular, and cellular context. All relevant tools will be made accessible to the biomedical research community through a common, extensible, and interoperable software platform, geWorkbench. We will reach out to train and encourage researchers to use and/or develop new modules for, geWorkbench. An important element of the software platform will be the development of specific components that can exploit the evidence integration techniques developed by Core 9001 investigators to combine molecular interaction clues from Core 9002 algorithms and databases. Development will be both driven and tested by the biomedical community to ensure the usefulness of the tools and the usability of the graphical user interfaces to address biomedical problems in completely novel ways, to dissect the web of cellular interactions responsible for cellular processes and functions.         n/a",National Center: Multi-Scale Study of Cellular Networks(RMI),7914681,U54CA121852,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Science', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Genes', 'Genetic Engineering', 'Genomics', 'Internet', 'Investigation', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methodology', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Analysis', 'Ontology', 'Organism', 'Physics', 'Process', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Signal Pathway', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'base', 'biomedical ontology', 'computer framework', 'data mining', 'design', 'genome-wide', 'graphical user interface', 'knowledge base', 'multidisciplinary', 'natural language', 'novel', 'software systems', 'structural biology', 'tool', 'usability']",NCI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,U54,2009,116802,0.03305552398023924
"Development of a Research-Ready Pregnancy and Newborn Biobank in California    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Development of a Research-Ready Pregnancy and Newborn Biobank in California Population-based biobanks are a critical resource for identifying disease mechanisms and developing screening tests for biomarkers associated with certain disorders. The California Department of Public Health has been banking newborn specimens statewide since 1982 (N~14 million) and maternal prenatal specimens for a portion of the state since 2000 (N~1 million), creating one of the largest, if not the largest single biological specimen banks with linked data in the world. With the fast pace of new knowledge in genetics and laboratory methods, the demand for specimens and data from researchers around the world now far surpasses the Department's ability to fill them. The goal of this infrastructure development project is to create an efficient, high throughput, low cost newborn screening and prenatal/maternal screening specimen biobank and linked data base that could be used by large numbers of researchers around the world for a wide range of studies through the following aims: (1) establishment of highly efficient protocols and procurement and integration of automated systems for pulling and processing specimens; (2) development of an integrated specimen tracking system into the Department's existing web-based Screening Information System; (3) development of a computerized system to track application requests for specimens and data; and (4) development of a linked screening program-vital records database that is organized into a life course, client based system. These aims will be accomplished through expansion of the Department's award-winning Screening Integration System to include web-based tracking of specimens and research requests, and use of an innovative machine-learning record matching application for high-performance linkages. After the 2 year grant period is completed, the California Research Ready Biospecimen Bank will be able to provide researchers with valuable biological specimens in a timely, cost-effective manner, thereby enabling a dramatic expansion of epidemiological research nationwide. The continuity of the system will be ensured by codifying human subjects-sensitive policies and procedures into Departmental regulations and by charging researchers modest fees for specimens, data and other research services.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Development of a research-ready pregnancy and newborn biobank in California This proposal funds infrastructure development to create a research-ready, efficient, high- throughput, and low-cost prenatal and newborn biobank in California.

"Biomedical Language Processing Writ Large:  Scaling to all of PubMedCentral    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Recent developments in text mining research, and in scientific publication, have brought us to the moment when the long-standing potential of natural language processing technology to benefit biomedical researchers may finally be realized. Technological advances, recent results in computational linguistics, maturation of biomedical ontology, and the advent of resources such as PubMedCentral have set the stage for an attempt at an integrated computational analysis of a large proportion of the full text biomedical literature. Such an analysis has the potential to dramatically extend the way that biomedical researchers can effectively use the scientific literature, particularly in the analysis of genome-scale datasets, broadly accelerating and increasing the efficiency of scientific discovery. We hypothesize that it is now possible to extract a wide variety of ontologically-grounded entities and relationships by processing the entire PubMedCentral document collection accurately and with good coverage, to use this extracted information to produce new genres of scientifically valuable tools and analysis techniques, and to demonstrate its utility in the analysis of genome-scale data. The challenges that we plan to overcome range from fundamental linguistic issues (e.g. cross- document coreference resolution) to high-performance computing (e.g. scaling up integrated processing to include millions of complex documents), to fielding practical systems that can exploit enormous knowledge-bases to accelerate the analysis of very large molecular data sets.              Project narrative Enormous amounts of biomedical information are now available in the PubMedCentral database, but computers cannot work with it because it is in the form of human-language text and humans can't read it all due to its large volume. The goal of this project is to harvest large amounts of that information automatically, making it available to humans in summarized form and to computers in computer-readable form.",Biomedical Language Processing Writ Large:  Scaling to all of PubMedCentral,7781934,R01LM009254,"['Biological', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Evaluation Research', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Harvest', 'Health', 'High Performance Computing', 'Human', 'Imagery', 'Journals', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Linguistics', 'Literature', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Process', 'Publications', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Staging', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Work', 'biomedical ontology', 'clinically relevant', 'information organization', 'knowledge base', 'language processing', 'scale up', 'text searching', 'tool']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R01,2009,505564,0.01149513067702911
"The CardioVascular Research Grid    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       We are proposing to establish the Cardiovascular Research Grid (CVRG). The CVRG will provide the national cardiovascular research community a collaborative environment for discovering, representing, federating, sharing and analyzing multi-scale cardiovascular data, thus enabling interdisciplinary research directed at identifying features in these data that are predictive of disease risk, treatment and outcome. In this proposal, we present a plan for development of the CVRG. Goals are: To develop the Cardiovascular Data Repository (CDR). The CDR will be a software package that can be downloaded and installed locally. It will provide the grid-enabled software components needed to manage transcriptional, proteomic, imaging and electrophysiological (referred to as ""multi-scale"") cardiovascular data.

"Informatics Infrastructure for vector-based neuroanatomical atlases    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The adage:  'all data is spatial' is especially pertinent in the field of neuroscience, since neuronal data must be indexed by the neuroanatomical location of phenomena or entities under study.  Brain atlases are very widely used as laboratory tools, being some of the most highly cited publications in science.  This proposal seeks to use brain atlases as a method for indexing data from the literature in a neuroinformatics system.  This data includes both textual and graphical information, ranging from highly detailed maps constructed from vector- based spatial primitives, histological photographs and drawings, to textual reports of experimental findings in the literature (which we will analyze on a large scale).  These data represent a significant scientific investment that are currently locked away in previously published journal articles (and the detailed data-sets and drawings from researchers that were used to write the articles).  A prototype that summarizes the last fifteen years' output of one of the world's most prominent neuroanatomy laboratories is immediately available.  This project will develop a collaborative environment to enable neuroscientists to use these valuable maps within the community as a whole by contributing data to a shared system with an open-source system (called 'NeuARt II') that permits querying, overlaying, viewing and annotating such data in an integrated manner.  We will also use Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to index neuroanatomical references in large numbers of journal articles to be accessible within our infrastructure.  As an initial text corpus, we over 110,000 documents taken from last 35 years of published information from the primary neuroanatomical literature.  We will construct a neuroanatomical interface that conceptually resembles the 'Google Maps' system, permitting users to use an intuitive spatial interface to browse large amounts of biomedical data in spatial register.  The proposed infrastructure will also provide new opportunities to compare and synthesize the anatomical components of neuroscience data multiple modalities (physiological, behavioral, clinical, genetic, molecular, etc.).PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Given the scope of the use of neuroanatomical maps from the rat and mouse in the study of neurobiological disease, we expect our research impact scientists working in almost all subfields of the subject.  Our collaborators who form the early adopters of this approach are neuroendocrinology researchers studying the mechanisms of stress and anxiety disorders which are estimated to affect 19.1 million people in the USA, costing $42 billion in health care costs per year (source:  Anxiety Disorders Association of America).

"Ontology-based Information Network to Support Vaccine Research    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Since the introduction of Edward Jenner's smallpox vaccine in 1796, vaccines have proven invaluable for their ability to stimulate the immune system and to confer protection against pathogenic organisms. Progress in modern vaccine research has been accompanied by a dramatic increase in the number of vaccine-related papers in the published literature. It has become increasingly challenging to identify and annotate vaccine data from this large and diverse literature which no one scientist or team can fully master. Although vaccine databases exist that emphasize commercialized vaccines, no public central repository is available to store research data concerning commercial vaccines, vaccines in clinical trials, or vaccine candidates in early stages of development, in a fashion that render such data available for advanced analyses. To fill this need, we have developed VIOLIN (http://www.violinet.org), a web-based database system for annotation, storage, and analysis of published vaccine data. An ontology represents consensus-based controlled vocabularies of terms and relations, with associated definitions which are logically formulated in such a way as to promote automated reasoning. A bottleneck of vaccine research and further VIOLIN development is the lack of a vaccine ontology, which in turn makes a significant obstacle for vaccine data standardization, retrieval, integration, and advanced analysis and prediction. Our goal is to develop the community-based Vaccine Ontology (VO) and apply it to efficient vaccine literature mining and analysis of protective immune mechanisms. We will focus on two model pathogens: Escherichia coli and Brucella species. This project contains three specific aims: (1) develop a community-based Vaccine Ontology (VO), and apply it to establish a vaccine knowledgebase and to promote vaccine data integration and query through Semantic Web. The VO development will be achieved through collaboration with vaccine researchers, the Infectious Disease Ontology (IDO) Initiative, and the National Center for Biomedical Ontology (NCBO); (2) develop a VO-based natural language processing (NLP) system and apply it for more efficient retrieval of Brucella and E. coli vaccine information, automated annotation of journal articles with VO terms, and VO improvement. This task will be achieved by collaboration with the National Center for Integrative Biomedical Informatics (NCIBI). (3) analyze and predict vaccine targets and protective immune networks attributable to the interactions between host and vaccine. This will be achieved mainly by VO-based literature mining and a novel genome- and literature-based statistical methodology. This project will be implemented by a strong collaborative team and supported from a large user community. The Vaccine Ontology and its applications to literature mining and for studying protective immunity against Brucella spp. and E. coli will lay a strong foundation for further advanced informatics research on vaccines against infectious diseases in the post-genomics and information era.            Narrative: Vaccines stimulate the immune system and confer protection against pathogenic microorganisms. A bottleneck of vaccine research is the lack of an ontology (consensus- based controlled vocabularies of terms and relations) to ensure consistency of literature curation and support automated reasoning.

"Visant-Predictome: A System for Integration, Mining Visualization and Analysis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent and continuing technological advances are producing large amounts of disparate data about cell structure, function and activity. This is driving the development of tools for storing, mining, analyzing, visualizing and integrating data. This proposal describes the VisANT system: a tool for visual data mining that operates on a local database which includes results from our lab, as well as automatically updated proteomics data from web accessible databases such as MIPS and BIND. In addition to accessing its own database, a name normalization table (i.e. a dictionary of identifiers), permits the system to seamlessly retrieve sequence, disease and other data from sources such as GenBank and OMIM. The visualization tool is able to reversibly group related sets of nodes, and display and duplicate their internal structure, providing an approach to hierarchical representation and modeling. We propose to build further on these unique features by including capabilities for mining and representing chemical reactions, orthologous networks, combinatorially regulated transcriptional networks, splice variants and functional hierarchies.

"BioScholar: a Biomedical Knowledge Engineering framework based on the published l    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Studying the primary research literature is a universal, primary activity for biomedical scientists. It underlies scientists' understanding of their subject and strengthens their capability to plan, execute, and interpret experiments. This proposal is concerned with the maintenance and continued development of software that supports scientists in their scholarly work. Our goal is to develop a knowledge engineering platform (called `BioScholar') to permit a single graduate student or postdoctoral worker to design, build, curate, and maintain a Knowledge Base (KB) for the literature of interest to a specific laboratory. This continues a previous software development project that was funded by the National Library of Medicine (LM 07061). We will continue to maintain the software using modern software engineering tools and approaches, whilst making it fully interoperable with a widely used ontology engineering platform (Protege /OWL). We will also develop the systems' existing capabilities to assist scientists with management of bibliographic data (citation information and full-text PDF articles). We will further develop tools to allow researchers to annotate PDF files with highlights, simple comments and with structured data. We will then use this annotation framework to drive the process of constructing knowledge bases using Protege/OWL (a widely used ontology editor). We will then incorporate Information Extraction (IE) techniques from modern Natural Language Processing (NLP) to improve the efficiency of this curation process. The NLP methods we use are based on the Conditional Random Fields (CRF) model which is considered state-of-the-art amongst NLP researchers. Finally, the most research-oriented component of this proposal is the development of a new methodology for knowledge representation and reasoning in biomedicine based on experimental design, involving experimental controls, independent and dependent variables, statistical significance and correlation between variables. This representation will be (a) understandable to experimental scientists, (b) lightweight, (c) versatile, and (d) capable of supporting inference between experiments. During the course of this project, we will build a KB for the world-leading neuroendocrinology laboratory of Prof. Alan Watts at University Southern California. Prof. Watts' work is concerned with the study of catecholaminergic control of the stress response, drawing on research from a large number of different fields (anatomy, physiology, molecular biology, etc.). After developing this KB, we will test its validity using subjective methods (questionnaires and interviews), and objective experiments (`mock exams' to see if students' performance with test questions based on comprehension of the primary literature). We will release all findings and tools to the biomedical community as research papers and open-source software. Narrative This project will help biomedical scientists manage, understand and communicate the complex information they must learn from scientific papers in multiple biomedical disciplines. As a demonstration of this work, we will build a comprehensive summary of research underlying brain circuits involved in stress.

"Integrating Microarray and Proteomic Data by Ontology-based Annotation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       With the completion of the Human Genome Project, there is a need to translate genome-era discoveries into clinical utility. One difficulty in making bench-to-bedside translations with gene-expression and proteomic data is our current inability to relate these findings with each other and with clinical measurements. A translational researcher studying a particular biological process using microarrays or proteomics will want to gather as many relevant publicly-available data sets as possible, to compare findings. Translational investigators wanting to relate clinical or chemical data with multiple genomic or proteomic measurements will want to find and join related data sets. Unfortunately, finding and joining relevant data sets is particularly challenging today, as the useful annotations of this data are still represented only by unstructured free-text, limiting its secondary use. A question we have sought to answer is whether prior investments in biomedical ontologies can provide leverage in determining the context of genomic data in an automated manner, thereby enabling integration of gene expression and proteomic data and the secondary use of genomic data in multiple fields of research beyond those for which the data sets were originally targeted. The three specific aims to address this question are to (1) develop tools that comprehensively map contextual annotations to the largest biomedical ontology, the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS), built and supported by the National Library of Medicine, validate, and disseminate the mappings, (2) execute a four-pronged strategy to evaluate experiment-concept mappings, and (3) apply experiment-context mappings to find and integrate data within and across microarray and proteomics repositories. To keep these tools relevant to biomedical investigators, we have included three Driving Biological Projects (DBPs), in the domains of breast cancer, organ transplantation, and T-cell biology. To accomplish these DBPs, our tools and mappings will be used to find and join experimental data within and across microarray and proteomic repositories. Having DBPs to address will focus our development on a set of scalable tools that can access and analyze experimental data covering a large variety of diseases. Through our advisory committee of world-renowned NIH-funded investigators, we will ensure that our findings will have broad applicability and are useful to a wide variety of biomedical researchers.          n/a",Integrating Microarray and Proteomic Data by Ontology-based Annotation,7693803,R01LM009719,"['Address', 'Advisory Committees', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Growth', 'Head', 'Human Genome Project', 'Improve Access', 'International', 'Investments', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Molecular Biology', 'Nature', 'Online Systems', 'Ontology', 'Organ Transplantation', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Process', 'Proteomics', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specificity', 'System', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Transplantation', 'Unified Medical Language System', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'United States National Library of Medicine', 'Writing', 'base', 'bench to bedside', 'biomedical informatics', 'biomedical ontology', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'repository', 'research study', 'text searching', 'tool', 'translational medicine']",NLM,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2009,280000,-0.002256235363183897
"Statistical Model Building for High Dimensional Biomedical Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Typical of current large-scale biomedical data is the feature of small number of observed samples and the widely observed sample heterogeneity. Identifying differentially expressed genes related to the sample phenotye (e.g., cancer disease development) and predicting sample phenotype based on the gene expressions are some central research questions in the microarray data analysis. Most existing statistical methods have ignored sample heterogeneity and thus loss power.       This project proposes to develop novel statistical methods that explicitly address the small sample size and sampe heterogeneity issues, and can be applied very generally. The usefulness of these methods will be shown with the large-scale biomedical data originating from the lung and kidney transplant research projects. The transplant projects aimed to improve the molecular diagnosis and therapy of lung/kidney allograft rejection by identifying molecular biomarkers to predict the allograft rejection for critical early treatment and rapid, noninvasive, and economical testing.       The specific aims are 1) Develop novel statistical methods for differential gene expression detection that explicitly model sample heterogeneity. 2) Develop novel statistical methods for classifying high-dimensional biomedical data and incorporating sample heterogeneity. 3) Develop novel statistical methods for jointly analyzing a set of genes (e.g., genes in a pathway). 4) Use the developed models and methods to answer research questions relevant to public health in the lung and kidney transplant projects; and implement and validate the proposed methods in user-friendly and well-documented software, and distribute them to the scientific community at no charge.       It is very important to identify new biomarkers of allograft rejection in lung and kidney transplant recipients. The rapid and reliable detection and prediction of rejection in easily obtainable body fluids may allow the rapid advancement of clinical interventional trials. We propose to study novel methods for analyzing the large-scale biomedical data to realize their full potential of molecular diagnosis and prognosis of transplant rejection prediction for critical early treatment.          n/a",Statistical Model Building for High Dimensional Biomedical Data,7666186,R01GM083345,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'Allografting', 'Biological Markers', 'Body Fluids', 'Cations', 'Characteristics', 'Charge', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Early treatment', 'Effectiveness', 'Experimental Designs', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Graft Rejection', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Joints', 'Kidney Transplantation', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Literature', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Methods', 'Minnesota', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Diagnosis', 'Oncogene Activation', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Proposals', 'Resources', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Silicon Dioxide', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Transplantation', 'Universities', 'Ursidae Family', 'Work', 'base', 'biobank', 'cancer microarray', 'cancer type', 'design', 'improved', 'interest', 'kidney allograft', 'method development', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'predictive modeling', 'simulation', 'software development', 'sound', 'theories', 'transplant database', 'user friendly software', 'user-friendly']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2009,256073,-0.05401569131129431
"Onto-BioThesaurus: ontological representation of gene/protein names for biomedica    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The long-term goal of our research is to develop resources and tools for knowledge retrieval management in the biomedical domain. As the pace of biomedical research accelerates, researchers become more and more dependent on computers to manage the explosive amount of biomedical information being published. The high quality of many databases is guaranteed by database curators who extract and synthesize information stored in literature or other databases. It is important to accurately recognize biomedical entity names in text and map the identified names to corresponding records in biomedical databases. Usually, a biomedical database provides a list of names either entered by curators or extracted from other databases. Those names could be used to retrieve records from databases or map names to database records by NLP systems. However, there are several characteristics associated with biomedical entity names, namely: synonymy (i.e., different names refer to the same database entry), ambiguity (i.e., one name is associated with different entries), and novelty (i.e., names or entities are not present in databases or knowledge bases) which make the task of retrieving database records using names and the task of associating names in text to database records very daunting. Additionally, biomedical entities can appear in text as short forms (SFs) abbreviated from their long forms (LFs). The prevalent use of SFs representing biomedical entities is another challenge faced by end users and NLP applications because of the high ambiguity of SFs.       Recently, ontology-based knowledge management is becoming increasingly popular since ontologies provide formal, machine-processable, and human-interpretable representations of the biomedical entities and their relations. We hypothesize that biomedical ontologies can be used to reduce the difficulty associated with retrieving records using names or mapping names in text to database records. Specific aims and the corresponding hypotheses are: i) develop onto-BioThesaurus by enriching BioThesaurus with gene/protein-related ontologies (Hypothesis: aligning gene/protein names to gene/protein-related ontologies can reduce the complexity associated with gene/protein names); ii) harvest synonyms for gene/protein classes and entities from online resources and text (Hypothesis: harvesting synonyms especially gene/protein SFs is critical since SFs are frequently used to represent gene/protein entities); iii) build a web user interface for gene/protein names and entries search and query through ontology-enabled onto-BioThesaurus (Hypothesis: enhancing BioThesaurus with gene/protein-related ontologies would enable us to build heuristic rules to enable machine reasoning); and iv) evaluate and distribute research methods/outcome (Hypothesis: evaluating and distributing research methods/outcome are critical to advance both basic and applied biomedical science.            The proposed research is critical for biomedical knowledge retrieval and management. It serves as one of the foundation for storing, retrieving, and extracting knowledge and information in the biomedical domain.

"A Resource for Biomedical Ontologies and Knowledge Bases    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       For more than two decades, our laboratory has been studying technology to develop, manage, and use formal descriptions of biomedical concepts. The result of this work is Protege, a workbench that allows users to edit and apply controlled terminologies, ontologies, and knowledge bases to a wide range of information-management problems.

"Automated Integration of Biomedical Knowledge Today, ontologies are critical instruments for biomedical investigators, especially in those areas, such as cancer research, that require the command of a vast amount of information and a systemic approach to the design and interpretation of experiments. In fact, ontologies are proliferating in all areas of biomedical research, offering both challenges and opportunities. One of the principal challenges of this field stems from the fact that ontologies are developed in isolation, rendering it impossible to move, for instance, from genes to organisms, to diseases, to drugs. The National Center for Biomedical Ontology (NCBO) represents a fundamental endeavor in the collection, coordination and distribution of biomedical ontologies and offers an unparalleled opportunity to combine these biomedical ontologies into a single search space where genetic, anatomic, molecular and pharmacological information can be seamlessly explored and exploited as a holistic representation of biomedical knowledge. Unfortunately, ontology integration using standard means of manual curation is a labor intensive task, unable to scale up and keep up with the current growth rate of biomedical ontologies. We have developed a systematic framework for automated ontology engineering based on information theory, and we have successfully applied it to the analysis and engineering of Gene Ontology (GO), the development gene and protein databases, and the identification of peripheral biomarkers of disease progression and drug response. This project brings together a unique group of competences, ranging from ontology engineering, statistical signal processing, bioinformatics, cancer research, and clinical pharmacogenomics, to develop a principled method, grounded on the mathematics of information theory, to automatically combine and integrate biomedical ontologies and implement it as part of the NCBO architecture Ontologies are critical instruments for biomedical investigators especially in those areas, such as cancer research, that require a vast amount of information and a systemic approach to the design and interpretation of their experiments. In collaboration with the National Center for Biomedical Ontology (NCBO), this project will develop a principled method, grounded on the mathematics of information theory, to automatically combine biomedical ontologies. As a result, this project will integrate biomedical knowledge along dimensions that are today isolated and, in so doing, it will empower investigators with a new holistic understanding of disease, it will fast track the clinical  translation of biological discoveries, and it will change the approach to discovery, especially for those diseases that, like cancer, require a systemic view of their biological mechanisms.",Automated Integration of Biomedical Knowledge,7558468,R01HG004836,"['Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomedical Research', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Competence', 'Complex', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Engineered Gene', 'Engineering', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Information Theory', 'Internet', 'Java', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Mathematics', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Ontology', 'Organism', 'Peripheral', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Proliferating', 'Protein Databases', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Services', 'Side', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Tissues', 'Translations', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'biomedical ontology', 'computer based Semantic Analysis', 'computerized data processing', 'design', 'empowered', 'graphical user interface', 'insight', 'instrument', 'open source', 'programs', 'repository', 'research study', 'response', 'scale up', 'statistics', 'stem']",NHGRI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2009,428078,0.04754803827101561
"Collaborative Development of Biomedical Ontologies and Terminologies    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The development of ontologies that define entities and the relationships among them has become essential for modern work in biomedicine. Ontologies help both humans and computers to manage the burgeoning data that are pervasive in biology and medicine. The need to annotate, retrieve, and integrate high-throughput data sets, to process natural language, and to build systems for decision support has set many communities of investigators to work building large ontologies. To date, these groups of ontology developers have been limited by the lack of methods and tools that facilitate distributed, collaborative engineering of large-scale ontologies and vocabularies. In this proposal, we outline three specific aims. First, we will explore basic computational methods that are essential for collaborative ontology engineering. We will investigate methods for representing diverse collaborative workflows, information about changes and concept history, trust, and provenance, and for recording decision making and design rationale. Empirical analysis of existing ontology-development projects will inform our construction of models for collaborative development workflows that will guide the processes of authoring, reviewing, and curating biomedical ontologies. Second, we will use the results from our first specific aim to build cProtigi, a set of robust, customizable, interactive tools to support distributed users in their collaborative work to build and edit terminologies and ontologies. Third, we will evaluate our work in the context of real-world, large-scale ontology-engineering projects, including the autism ontology of the National Database for Autism Research; the 11th revision of the WHO's International Classification of Diseases; the Ontology for Biomedical Investigations, under development by a wide range of NIH-supported researchers; and BiomedGT, under development by NCI. It is no longer feasible to imagine that investigators can create biomedical ontologies working independently. The collaborative methods that we will study and the tools that we will build will lead to expanded opportunities to support the diverse data- and knowledge-intensive activities that pervade BISTI, the CTSAs, the NCBCs, and myriad biomedical initiatives that require robust, scaleable ontologies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The knowledge-based nature of modern medicine requires the use of ontologies and terminologies to process and integrate data. Ontology development itself becomes a collaborative process, with members of the larger research community contributing to and commenting on emerging ontologies. We plan to extend the Protigi ontology editor-the most widely used ontology editor today, with almost 100,000 registered users-to support collaborative development of ontologies and to evaluate the new tools by deploying them at the World Health Organization for the development of ICD-11 and in other settings.             n/a",Collaborative Development of Biomedical Ontologies and Terminologies,7565504,R01GM086587,"['Adopted', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Beds', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer Systems Development', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Generic Drugs', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Industry', 'Institutes', 'International Classification of Diseases', 'Internet', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Mainstreaming', 'Maintenance', 'Medicine', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modern Medicine', 'NCI Thesaurus', 'NIH Program Announcements', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Online Systems', 'Ontology', 'Outsourcing', 'Process', 'Program Development', 'Published Comment', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Scientist', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Trust', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'biomedical ontology', 'biomedical scientist', 'cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid', 'design', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'forging', 'knowledge base', 'member', 'open source', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'response', 'tool', 'usability']",NIGMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2009,529858,0.0282367758359166
"Ontologies and Biomedical Language Processing    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We hypothesize that there are significant synergies between the applications of biomedical ontologies and of biomedical language processing (BLP) which can be used to improve the quality and scope of both activities. A growing body of work suggests such synergies might exist, but there has yet to be a systematic exploration of their potential. We propose to carry out a focused effort to explore both the potential for, and obstacles to, the mutual application of biomedical ontologies and biomedical language processing. To provide immediate biological relevance to our work, we propose to focus on the topics of autoimmune and pulmonary disease. We group our proposed explorations into three specific aims: (1) Create novel tools and approaches for the application and maintenance of biomedical ontologies, based on an assessment of the processes and tools used for the ontological annotation of textual corpora in the biomedical language processing community. Particularly, we will focus on the creation of new methods for effective search through large ontologies, compositional approaches to annotation, effective capture of the evidence underlying annotations, and the use of automated suggestions for manual confirmation. (2) Evaluate the utility of BLP tools and techniques when applied to terms and definitions of biomedical ontologies, both to enrich and interconnect orthogonal ontologies, and to provide quality assurance and quality control mechanisms. Particularly, we propose to develop and evaluate methods for connecting terms within and across ontologies, for assessing completeness of an ontology against the literature, and for implementing automatically executable measures of ontology quality. (3) Compare the differences between annotations produced by manual procedures and those produced by automated BLP methods for completeness and correctness. Based on the resulting data, produce guidelines for the optimal interplay between manual and automatic procedures for producing broad, accurate and useful knowledge-bases. Because ontologies are the central organizing tool of the model organism databases, improvements in their quality and in the ease and efficiency of their use will have a major effect on the model organism databases, speed the translational process generally, and create a potentially large public health impact.          n/a",Ontologies and Biomedical Language Processing,7684604,R01GM083649,"['Address', 'Area', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmune Process', 'Autoimmunity', 'Automated Annotation', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Computing', 'Body of uterus', 'Classification', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Genes', 'Guidelines', 'Human', 'Immunology', 'Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Language', 'Linguistics', 'Literature', 'Lung diseases', 'Maintenance', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Metaphor', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Motivation', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Ontology', 'Peer Review', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Process Assessment', 'Production', 'Psyche structure', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Pulmonary Hypertension', 'Quality Control', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Role', 'Semantics', 'Speed', 'Suggestion', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Ursidae Family', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'biomedical ontology', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'design', 'experience', 'gene function', 'improved', 'information organization', 'innovation', 'knowledge base', 'language processing', 'model organisms databases', 'natural language', 'novel', 'quality assurance', 'tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R01,2009,639134,-0.0004377352432175009
"National Center: Multi-Scale Study of Cellular Networks(RMI)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  A network of molecular interactions, involving many thousands of genes, their products, and other molecules, underlie cellular processes. Investigation of these interactions across a wide range of scales ranging from the formation/activation of transcriptional complexes, to the availability of a signaling pathway, all the way to macroscopic processes, such as cell adhesion, calls for a new level of sophistication in the design of genome- wide computational approaches. A homogeneous environment for the comprehensive mapping and analysis of molecular cellular interactions in would be a powerful resource for the biomedical research community. We propose the creation of a National Center for the Multiscale Analysis of Genomic and Cellular Networks (MAGNet). The Center will provide an integrative computational framework to organize molecular interactions in the cell into manageable context-dependent components and will develop interoperable computational models and tools that can leverage such a map of cellular interactions to elucidate important biological processes. Center activities will involve a significant, multidisciplinary effort of biological and computational sciences. Specific areas of expertise include natural language parsing (NLP), machine learning (ML), software systems and engineering, databases, computational structural biology, reverse engineering of genetic networks, biomedical literature datamining, and biomedical ontologies, among others. The Center will 1) construct an evidence integration framework to collect and fuse a variety of diverse cellular interaction clues based on their statistical relevance 2) assemble a comprehensive set of physics- and knowledge-based methodologies to fill this framework 3) provide a set of methodologies and filters, anchored in formal domain ontologies, to associated specific interactions to an organism, tissue, molecular, and cellular context. All relevant tools will be made accessible to the biomedical research community through a common, extensible, and interoperable software platform, geWorkbench. We will reach out to train and encourage researchers to use and/or develop new modules for, geWorkbench. An important element of the software platform will be the development of specific components that can exploit the evidence integration techniques developed by Core 9001 investigators to combine molecular interaction clues from Core 9002 algorithms and databases.

"DEVELOPMENT OF DATA ONTOLOGIES FOR INTEGRATING MULTI-CENTER CARDIOVASCULAR STUDIE Cardiovascular disease (CVD) and its associated risk factors such as hypertension and dyslipidemia constitute a major public-health burden due to increased mortality and morbidity and rising health care costs. Massive epidemiological data are needed to detect the small effects of many individual genes and the environment on these traits. However, sample sizes needed to make powerful inferences may only be reached by integrating multiple epidemiological studies. Meaningful integration of information from multiple studies requires the development of data ontologies which make it possible to integrate information across studies in an optimum manner so as to maximize the information content and hence the statistical power for detecting small effect sizes. A second compounding problem of data integration is that software applications that manage such study data are typically non-interoperable, i.e. “silos” of data, and are incapable of being shared in a syntactically and semantically meaningful manner. Consequently, an infrastructure that integrates across studies in an interoperable manner is needed to ensure that epidemiological cardiovascular research remains a viable and major player in the biomedical informatics revolution which is currently underway. The cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid (caBIGTM) is addressing these problems in the cancer domain by developing software systems that are able to exchange information or that are syntactically interoperable by accessing metadata that is semantically annotated using controlled vocabularies. Our overarching goal is to develop ontologies for integrating cardiovascular epidemiological data from multiple studies. Specifically, we propose three Aims: First, develop cardiovascular data ontologies and vocabularies for each of three disparate multi-center epidemiological studies that facilitate data integration across the studies and data mining for various phenotypes. Second, adopt a technology infrastructure that leverages the cardiovascular data ontologies and vocabularies using Model Driven Architecture (MDA) and caBIGTM tools to facilitate the integration and widespread sharing of cardiovascular data sets. Third, facilitate seamless data sharing and promote widespread data dissemination among research communities cutting across clinical, translational and epidemiological domains, primarily through collaboration with the established CardioVascular Research Grid (CVRG). Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity which contributes substantially to rising health care costs and consequently constitutes a major public health burden. Therefore, understanding the genetic and environmental effects on these CVD traits is important. Massive epidemiological study data are needed to detect the small individual effects of genes and their interactions, and integration of multiple epidemiological studies are necessary for generating large sample sizes. Unfortunately, integrating information from multiple studies in a meaningful manner requires the development of data ontologies (language and grammar).

"Towards the Building of a Comprehensive Searchable Biological Experiment Database    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The rapid growth of the biomedical literature and the expansion in disciplinary biomedical research, heralded by high-throughput genome sciences and technologies, have overwhelmed scientists who attempt to assimilate information necessary for their research. The widespread adoption of title/abstract word searches, such as highly desirable the National Library of Medicine's PubMed system, has provided the first major advance in the way bioscientists find relevant publications since the origin of Index Medicus in 1879 (Hunter and Cohen 2006). The importance of developing valid information retrieval systems for bioscientists has led to the development of information systems worldwide (e.g., Arrowsmith (Smalheiser and Swanson 1998), BioText (Hearst 2003), GeneWays (Friedman et al. 2001; Rzhetsky et al. 2004), iHOP (Hoffmann and Valencia 2005), and BioMedQA (Lee et al. 2006a), and annotated databases (e.g., SWISSPROT, OMIM (Hamosh et al. 2005) and BIND (Alfarano et al. 2005)).      However, most of information systems target only text information and fail to provide access to other important data such as images (e.g., figures). More than any other documentation, figures usually represent the ""evidence"" of discovery in the biomedical literature. Full-text biological articles nearly always incorporate figures/images that are the crucial content of the biomedical literature. Our examination of biological articles in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) revealed the occurrence of 5.2 images per article on average (Yu and Lee 2006a). Biologists need to access image data to validate research facts and to formulate or to test novel research hypotheses. It has been evaluated that textual statements reported in literature frequently are noisy (i.e., containing ""false facts"") (Krauthammer et al. 2002). Capturing images that are experimental ""evidence"" to support the textual ""fact"" will benefit bioscience information systems, databases, and bioscientists.      Unfortunately, this wealth of information remains virtually inaccessible without automatic systems to organize these images. We propose the development of advanced natural language processing (NLP) tools to semantically organize images. We hypothesize that text that associated with images semantically entails the image content and natural language processing techniques can be developed to accurately associate the text to their images. Furthermore, we hypothesize that images can be semantically organized by categories specified by standard biological ontology, and that natural language processing approaches can accurately assign the ontological categories to images.      Our specific aims are:      Aim 1: To develop and evaluate NLP techniques for identifying textual statements that correspond to images in full-text articles. We will develop different approaches for two types of the associations. We will first propose rule-based and statistical approaches to identify the associated text that appears in the full-text articles. We will then develop hybrid approaches to link sentences in abstracts to images in the body of the articles.      Aim 2: To develop and evaluate NLP techniques for automatic classification of experimental results into categories (e.g., Western-Blot, PCR verification, etc) specified in the experimental protocol Protocol-Online.      We will explore the use of dictionary-based, rule-based, image classification, and machine-learning approaches for accomplishing this aim.      Aim 3: To develop and evaluate NLP techniques for automatic assignment of Gene Ontology categories to experiments, which will provide a knowledge-based organization of experiments according to biological properties (e.g., catalytic activity). We will develop statistical and machine-learning approaches for accomplishing this aim.      We found that most of the images that appear in full-text biological articles are figure images (Yu and Lee 2006a) and we therefore focus on figure images only in this proposal. The deliverable of Specific Aim 1 will be an effective user-interface BioEx from which bioscientists can access images directly from sentences in the abstracts. BioEx has the promise of improvement over the traditional single-document-per-article format that has dominated bioscience publications since the first scientific article appeared in 1665 (Gross 2002). The deliverables of Specific Aim 2 and 3 will be open-source algorithms and tools that accurately map images to categories specified by the Gene Ontology and the Protocol Online. Those algorithms and tools will enhance bioscience information retrieval, information extraction, summarization, and question answering.          n/a",Towards the Building of a Comprehensive Searchable Biological Experiment Database,7314689,R21RR024933,"['Adoption', 'Advanced Development', 'Algorithms', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Research', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Dictionary', 'Documentation', 'Flowcharts', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Index Medicus', 'Information Retrieval', 'Information Retrieval Systems', 'Information Systems', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Online Mendelian Inheritance In Man', 'Ontology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Principal Investigator', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'PubMed', 'Publications', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'SwissProt', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Title', 'United States National Academy of Sciences', 'United States National Library of Medicine', 'Western Blotting', 'abstracting', 'base', 'knowledge base', 'novel', 'open source', 'programs', 'rapid growth', 'research study', 'tool']",NCRR,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN MILWAUKEE,R21,2008,230085,-0.01497029729871492
"Answering Information Needs in Workflow    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Needs for information arise continuously during the course of clinical practice, especially for physicians in training, e.g. when examining a patient or participating in rounds. In most of these situations, it is difficult or impossible for the clinician to immediately access appropriate information resources. Most needs are never adequately articulated or recorded, and consequently are forgotten by the end of the day. Moreover, when clinicians do recall information needs, they don't act on them, due to the significant limitations of current retrieval systems and the exigencies of clinical practice. The specific aims of the proposed project are: 1) to capture information needs in a convenient manner at the moment they occur using different modalities such as text input and voice capture on hand-held devices, 2) to translate high-level information needs into complex search strategies that adapt to user needs and are tuned to the capabilities of resources, and 3) to deliver relevant materials to the clinician in an accessible format and in a timely manner. The project will develop a central hub for addressing the information needs of medical students and residents, to be transmitted electronically as they occur in the field. A unique feature of the project is the use of natural language processing technology to identify context, goals and preferences in clinicians' questions. The major innovation is the generation of complex search strategies that exploit this contextual information, based on studies of human searching experts (reference librarians).              n/a",Answering Information Needs in Workflow,7675157,R01LM008799,"['Address', 'Biological Models', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Face', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Human', 'Information Resources', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Librarians', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Errors', 'Medical Students', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Software Tools', 'System', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Textbooks', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Voice', 'Work', 'base', 'day', 'forgetting', 'innovation', 'preference', 'speech processing', 'symposium']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R01,2008,354823,-0.006291635696380183
"Semantic and Machine Learning Methods for Mining Connections in the UMLS    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) is an invaluable resource for the biomedical community.   One of the intended uses of the UMLS Metathesaurus is to support the translation of terms from a source terminology into terms in a target terminology. It is evident from the research literature on the UMLS that users generally need to perform more broader types of ""translations"" that involve finding terms with closest meaning to source term (mapping), finding terms that are related to source term and can serve as proxy for various functions (e.g. information retrieval, knowledge discovery) or finding target terms that satisfy some structural or semantic constraint (e.g. information theoretic distance). The methods for finding such ""translations"" or connections between terms in Meta (other than the case of one-to-one synonymy) are not at all clear. Previous attempts to exploit such connections have depended on either manual selection of relevant connections, or problem-specific algorithms that use expert knowledge about the relative suitability of various inter-concept relationships. We believe that machine learning techniques offer automated, generalizable approaches that are appropriate for use with the UMLS, given the large set of potential connections and the need for a problem-independent approach. We hypothesize that learning strategies that exploit the relational features, scale free properties and probabilistic dependencies of connections in the UMLS will identify meaningful inter-term relationships and that a combined approach will perform better across different problem domains when compared to any of the approaches in isolation. We will evaluate the proposed learning algorithms with training connections from a variety of problem domains in biomedicine. We will disseminate the successful algorithms via the UMLS Knowledge Source API toolkit for mining and visualizing the connections. We believe that the UMLS provides a unique fertile ground to develop novel semantic relational mining methods and advance our understanding of mining large biomedical concept graphs.             n/a",Semantic and Machine Learning Methods for Mining Connections in the UMLS,7498449,R21LM009638,"['Algorithms', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependency', 'Disease', 'Graph', 'Healthcare', 'Information Retrieval', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Nature', 'Ontology', 'Organism', 'Pathway interactions', 'Property', 'Proxy', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Sampling', 'Semantics', 'Social Network', 'Solutions', 'Source', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Terminology', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Unified Medical Language System', 'Work', 'base', 'biomedical resource', 'concept', 'interest', 'metathesaurus', 'microbial alkaline proteinase inhibitor', 'novel', 'success']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R21,2008,153203,0.026871261375840883
"A Biomedical Natural Language Processing Resource DESCRIPTION:    The long-term aim of this project is to advance clinical care and biomedical research by establishing a natural language processing (NLP) resource for the biomedical community. A major bottleneck for development of automated tools for clinical applications and biomedical research is that most of the data and knowledge occur in the form of text, resulting in a lack of coded data. This NLP resource will make possible a host of automated applications by enabling high throughput access to coded biomedical knowledge and data. The foundation of this resource will be the MedLEE NLP system, which has been used operationally for almost a decade in healthcare settings for a broad range of applications that have proven to be valuable for clinical care. The NLP resource will also include BioMedLEE (a derivative of MedLEE), which encodes genotypic-phenotypic (GP) relations in the scientific literature. It currently focuses on GP relations associated with cancer and infectious diseases, and is being used to organize the extracted information to facilitate research, curation, and ontological development within model organism databases. This proposal will enable us to 1) disseminate our NLP resource to the community, 2) conduct technological research and development (R&D) to facilitate expansion and adaptation of the resource to new applications and specialties, 3) conduct R&D of tools that facilitate use of the extracted data and knowledge after coding, and 4) promote the resource, and provide service to users in the form of technical support, documentation, and tutorials. MedLEE and BioMedLEE are extendable systems that encompass the clinical and scientific communities. The dissemination of a proven NLP system that is applicable to the entire biomedical community provides an exceptional opportunity for multiple developers and researchers to work to unleash the true potential of NLP technology, increasing development of applications that aim to enhance scientific research and improve all levels of health. n/a",A Biomedical Natural Language Processing Resource,7429768,R01LM008635,"['Address', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Research', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Condition', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Educational workshop', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Health Status', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Imagery', 'Improve Access', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Errors', 'Medical Surveillance', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Numbers', 'Ontology', 'Organism', 'Output', 'Partner in relationship', 'Patient Care', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Process', 'Range', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Semantics', 'Services', 'Side', 'Source', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Terminology', 'Text', 'Universities', 'Work', 'biological research', 'biomedical resource', 'clinical application', 'concept', 'high throughput technology', 'improved', 'knowledge base', 'medical specialties', 'model organisms databases', 'open source', 'research and development', 'tool']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2008,534463,-0.009133652166027973

"ADAPTIVE PERSONALIZED INFORMATION MANAGEMENT FOR BIOLOGISTS    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We propose development of an adaptive, personalizable, information management tool, which can be configured and trained by an individual biologist to most effectively exploit the particular knowledge bases and document collections that are most useful for him or her. The proposed tool represents a novel approach for monitoring scientific progress in biology, which has become a formidable task. We will exploit recent advances in machine learning and database systems to develop a useful approximation to a personalized biological knowledge base f.i.i.e., single information resource that would include all the knowledge sources on which a biologist relies. More specifically, we propose a scheme for loosely integrating both structured information and unstructured text, and then querying the integrated information using easily-formulated similarity queries. The system will also learn from every episode in which a biologist seeks information. The research team on this project includes a computer scientist and two biologists.

"Scalable Learning with Ensemble Techniques and Parallel Computing    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The ability to conduct basic and applied biomedical research is becoming increasingly dependent on data produced by new and emerging technologies. This data has an unprecedented amount of detail and volume. Researchers are therefore dependent on computing and computational tools to be able to visualize, analyze, model, and interpret these large and complex sets of data. Tools for disease detection, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention are common goals of many, if not all, biomedical research programs. Sound analytical and statistical theory and methodology for class pre- diction and class discovery lay the foundation for building these tools, of which the machine learning techniques of classification (supervised learning) and clustering (unsupervised learning) are crucial. Our goal is to produce software for analysis and interpretation of large data sets using ensemble machine learning techniques and parallel computing technologies. Ensemble techniques are recent advances in machine learning theory and methodology leading to great improvements in accuracy and stability in data set analysis and interpretation. The results from a committee of primary machine learners (classifiers or clusterers) that have been trained on different instance or feature subsets are combined through techniques such as voting. The high prediction accuracy of classifier ensembles (such as boosting, bagging, and random forests) has generated much excitement in the statistics and machine learning communities. Recent research extends the ensemble methodology to clustering, where class information is unavailable, also yielding superior performance in terms of accuracy and stability. In theory, most ensemble techniques are inherently parallel. However, existing implementations are generally serial and assume the data set is memory resident. Therefore current software will not scale to the large data sets produced in today's biomedical research. We propose to take two approaches to scale ensemble techniques to large data sets: data partitioning approaches and parallel computing. The focus of Phase I will be to prototype scalable classifier ensembles using parallel architectures. We intend to: establish the parallel computing infrastructures; produce a preliminary architecture and software design; investigate a wide range of ensemble generation schemes using data partitioning strategies; and implement scalable bagging and random forests based on the preliminary design. The focus of Phase II will be to complete the software architecture and implement the scalable classifier ensembles and scalable clusterer ensembles within this framework. We intend to: complete research and development of classifier ensembles; extend the classification framework to clusterer ensembles; research and develop a unified interface for building ensembles with differing generation mechanisms and combination strategies; and evaluate the effectiveness of the software on simulated and real data. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The common goals to many, if not all, biomedical research programs are the development of tools for disease detection, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention.

"New Machine Learning Methods for Biomedical Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  In the past few years, we have witnessed a dramatic increase of the amount of data available to biomedical research. An example is the recent advances of high-throughput biotechnologies, making it possible to access genome-wide gene expressions. To address biomedical issues at molecular levels, extraction of the relevant information from massive data of complex structures is essential. This calls for advanced mechanisms for statistical prediction and inference, especially in genomic discovery and prediction, where statistical uncertainty involved in a discovery process is high. The proposed approach focuses on the development of mixture model-based and large margin approaches in semisupervised and unsupervised learning, motivated from biomedical studies in gene discovery and prediction. In particular, we propose to investigate how to improve accuracy and efficiency of mixture model-based and large margin learning systems in generalization. In addition, we will develop innovative methods taking the structure of sparseness and the grouping effect into account to battle the curse of dimensionality, and blend them with the new learning tools. A number of technical issues will be investigated, including: a) developing model selection criteria and performing automatic feature selection, especially when the number of features greatly exceeds that of samples; b) developing large margin approaches for multi-class learning, with most effort towards sparse as well as structured learning; c) implementing efficient computation for real-time applications, and d) analyzing two biological datasets for i) gene function discovery and prediction for E. coli, and ii) new class discovery and prediction for BOEC samples; e) developing public-domain software.

"Nation Center: Multi-Scale Study- Cellular Networks(RMI) A network of molecular interactions, involving many thousands of genes, their products, and other molecules, underlie cellular processes. Investigation of these interactions across a wide range of scales ranging from the formation/activation of transcriptional complexes, to the availability of a signaling pathway, all the way to macroscopic processes, such as cell adhesion, calls for a new level of sophistication in the design of genomewide computational approaches. A homogeneous environment for the comprehensive mapping and analysis of molecular cellular interactions in would be a powerful resource for the biomedical research community. We propose the creation of a National Center for the Multiscale Analysis of Genomic and Cellular Networks (MAGNet). The Center will provide an integrative computational framework to organize molecular interactions in the cell into manageable context-dependent components and will develop interoperable computational models and tools that can leverage such a map of cellular interactions to elucidate important biological processes. Center activities will involve a significant, multidisciplinary effort of biological and computational sciences. Specific areas of expertise include natural language parsing (NLP), machine learning (ML), software systems and engineering, databases, computational structural biology, reverse engineering of genetic networks, biomedical literature datamining, and biomedical ontologies, among others. The Center will 1) construct an evidence integration framework to collect and fuse a variety of diverse cellular interaction clues based on their statistical relevance 2) assemble a comprehensive set of physics- and knowledge-based methodologies to fill this framework 3) provide a set of methodologies and filters, anchored in formal domain ontologies, to associated specific interactions to an organism, tissue, molecular, and cellular context. All relevant tools will be made accessible to the biomedical research community through a common, extensible, and interoperable software platform, geWorkbench. We will reach out to train and encourage researchers to use and/or develop new modules for, geWorkbench. An important element of the software platform will be the development of specific components that can exploit the evidence integration techniques developed by Core 1 investigators to combine molecular interaction clues from Core 2 algorithms and databases.

"Neuroimaging Neuroinformatics Training Program    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal is in response to PAR-03-034 ""Neuroinformatics Institutional Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (K12)."" The overarching goal of this application is to provide an excellent postdoctoral training program in neuroimaging neuroinformatics that capitalizes on the many strengths of the existing neuroscientists, informatics and imaging resources that our combined resources represent. Our proposed Neuroimaging Neuroinformatics Training Program (NNTP) is based upon a number of important strategic alliances. The first cornerstone of this effort is the existing HBP grants held by Dr. Anders Dale (R01 NS39581: Cortical-Surface-Based Brain Imaging) and Dr. David Kennedy (R01 NS34189: Anatomic Morphologic Analysis of MR Brain Images). These efforts span a wealth of technological developments, research and clinical application areas in the rapidly developing area of quantitative morphometric image analysis. A second and vital cornerstone is our association with the Harvard-MIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology (HST) Biomedical Informatics Program. This existing pre- and post-graduate academic program, within a world class biomedical engineering department, is an ideal setting for the development of a coordinated training effort in Neuroinformatics. The established track record in training skilled scientists in areas of informatics will prove invaluable in this new initiative. The third cornerstone is the combined clinical research opportunities afforded by the Harvard-wide biomedical imaging resources. These include the MGH/MIT/HST Athinoula A. Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging, the Harvard Neuroimaging Center, the Surgical Planning Lab at Brigham and Women's Hospital, the Brain Morphology BIRN (Biomedical Informatics Research Network) and the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. Together, these active and vibrant programs provide for the best possible training opportunities in imaging science, computer science, clinical application areas, and cognitive neuroscience. A substantial and successful pool of internationally renowned mentors have agreed to participate in this program, and the combined resources provide the best possible exposure to all neuroimaging procedures and insure the capability to draw the highest caliber trainees. A plan for recruiting, selecting and monitoring trainees is proposed.

"Interactive Learning Modules for Writing Grant Proposals DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The overall objective of this application is to continue our challenge to empower faculty at institutions with high minority enrollment to develop and submit competitive research proposals. Building on our past experience, the competing renewal has three facets which will take place concurrently: 1) up-dating current modules (14) and the development, testing, and evaluation of two new internet course modules; 2) recruitment and training of participants through 5 workshops at remote sites and subsequent participation in the web-based course; 3) continuing evaluation of the training modules for the purpose of technological and content versions. Significant changes from the original program include moving the pre-course conference off-site to maximize the number of faculty participating from contiguous institutions and the introduction of machine language technology to aid in the editing and packaging of participants' grant writing efforts. At the conclusion of the initiative, each participant should be both motivated and empowered to submit a competitive proposal. Thus, our continuing partnership with NIGMS should improve the skills and abilities of researchers/grant writers at minority institutions, increase the number of minorities engaged in biomedical research, and strengthen minority institution's overall research environment. n/a",Interactive Learning Modules for Writing Grant Proposals,7459910,U13GM058252,"['Advisory Committees', 'Applications Grants', 'Biomedical Research', 'Computer Retrieval of Information on Scientific Projects Database', 'Computer software', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Educational workshop', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Faculty', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Grant Review Process', 'Institution', 'Internet', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentors', 'Minority', 'National Institute of General Medical Sciences', 'Numbers', 'Online Systems', 'Participant', 'Peer Review', 'Progress Reports', 'Purpose', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Proposals', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Site', 'Study Section', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'evaluation/testing', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'impression', 'improved', 'member', 'novel strategies', 'programs', 'skills', 'symposium', 'training project']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY,U13,2008,118789,-0.014385906912892148
"Visant-Predictome: A System for Integration, Mining Visualization and Analysis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent and continuing technological advances are producing large amounts of disparate data about cell structure, function and activity. This is driving the development of tools for storing, mining, analyzing, visualizing and integrating data. This proposal describes the VisANT system: a tool for visual data mining that operates on a local database which includes results from our lab, as well as automatically updated proteomics data from web accessible databases such as MIPS and BIND. In addition to accessing its own database, a name normalization table (i.e. a dictionary of identifiers), permits the system to seamlessly retrieve sequence, disease and other data from sources such as GenBank and OMIM. The visualization tool is able to reversibly group related sets of nodes, and display and duplicate their internal structure, providing an approach to hierarchical representation and modeling. We propose to build further on these unique features by including capabilities for mining and representing chemical reactions, orthologous networks, combinatorially regulated transcriptional networks, splice variants and functional hierarchies. Software is open source, and the system also allows users to exchange and integrate the networks that they discover with those of others.           n/a","Visant-Predictome: A System for Integration, Mining Visualization and Analysis",7457647,R01RR022971,"['Address', 'Archives', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bayesian Method', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Cell physiology', 'Cellular Structures', 'Chemicals', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Systems Development', 'Computer software', 'Condition', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Dependence', 'Dependency', 'Development', 'Dictionary', 'Disease', 'Educational workshop', 'Electronic Mail', 'Facility Construction Funding Category', 'Genbank', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Imagery', 'Information Systems', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Names', 'Network-based', 'Numbers', 'Online Mendelian Inheritance In Man', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Proteomics', 'RNA Splicing', 'Reaction', 'Reporting', 'Score', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Integration', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Tertiary Protein Structure', 'Update', 'Ursidae Family', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Weight', 'base', 'chemical reaction', 'data mining', 'improved', 'models and simulation', 'open source', 'outreach', 'protein protein interaction', 'software development', 'statistics', 'tool', 'tool development', 'web-accessible', 'wiki']",NCRR,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),R01,2008,437938,-0.010659285820576398
"BioScholar: a Biomedical Knowledge Engineering framework based on the published l    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Studying the primary research literature is a universal, primary activity for biomedical scientists. It underlies scientists' understanding of their subject and strengthens their capability to plan, execute, and interpret experiments. This proposal is concerned with the maintenance and continued development of software that supports scientists in their scholarly work. Our goal is to develop a knowledge engineering platform (called `BioScholar') to permit a single graduate student or postdoctoral worker to design, build, curate, and maintain a Knowledge Base (KB) for the literature of interest to a specific laboratory. This continues a previous software development project that was funded by the National Library of Medicine (LM 07061). We will continue to maintain the software using modern software engineering tools and approaches, whilst making it fully interoperable with a widely used ontology engineering platform (Protege /OWL). We will also develop the systems' existing capabilities to assist scientists with management of bibliographic data (citation information and full-text PDF articles). We will further develop tools to allow researchers to annotate PDF files with highlights, simple comments and with structured data. We will then use this annotation framework to drive the process of constructing knowledge bases using Protege/OWL (a widely used ontology editor). We will then incorporate Information Extraction (IE) techniques from modern Natural Language Processing (NLP) to improve the efficiency of this curation process. The NLP methods we use are based on the Conditional Random Fields (CRF) model which is considered state-of-the-art amongst NLP researchers. Finally, the most research-oriented component of this proposal is the development of a new methodology for knowledge representation and reasoning in biomedicine based on experimental design, involving experimental controls, independent and dependent variables, statistical significance and correlation between variables. This representation will be (a) understandable to experimental scientists, (b) lightweight, (c) versatile, and (d) capable of supporting inference between experiments. During the course of this project, we will build a KB for the world-leading neuroendocrinology laboratory of Prof. Alan Watts at University Southern California. Prof. Watts' work is concerned with the study of catecholaminergic control of the stress response, drawing on research from a large number of different fields (anatomy, physiology, molecular biology, etc.). After developing this KB, we will test its validity using subjective methods (questionnaires and interviews), and objective experiments (`mock exams' to see if students' performance with test questions based on comprehension of the primary literature). We will release all findings and tools to the biomedical community as research papers and open-source software. Narrative This project will help biomedical scientists manage, understand and communicate the complex information they must learn from scientific papers in multiple biomedical disciplines. As a demonstration of this work, we will build a comprehensive summary of research underlying brain circuits involved in stress. Stress and anxiety disorders are estimated to affect 19.1 million people in the USA, costing $42 billion in health costs per year (source: Anxiety Disorders Association of America).          n/a",BioScholar: a Biomedical Knowledge Engineering framework based on the published l,7426246,R01GM083871,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Americas', 'Anatomy', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Architecture', 'Arts', 'Biological Sciences', 'Brain', 'California', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Comprehension', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Depth', 'Development', 'Digital Libraries', 'Discipline', 'Electronics', 'Engineering', 'Experimental Designs', 'Facility Construction Funding Category', 'Funding', 'GDF15 gene', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health Care Costs', 'Individual', 'Information Retrieval', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge acquisition', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Logic', 'Maintenance', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Biology', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neuroendocrinology', 'Numbers', 'Ontology', 'PLAB Protein', 'Paper', 'Performance', 'Physiology', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Proxy', 'PubMed', 'Published Comment', 'Publishing', 'Questionnaires', 'Reading', 'Representations, Knowledge (Computer)', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Review Literature', 'Scientist', 'Software Engineering', 'Solutions', 'Source', 'Stress', 'Strigiformes', 'Structure', 'Students', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'United States National Library of Medicine', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'biological adaptation to stress', 'biomedical scientist', 'computer based Semantic Analysis', 'cost', 'design', 'design and construction', 'improved', 'information organization', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'repository', 'research study', 'software development', 'statistics', 'text searching', 'tool', 'tool development']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2008,266213,0.032321992195113385
"Integrating Microarray and Proteomic Data by Ontology-based Annotation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       With the completion of the Human Genome Project, there is a need to translate genome-era discoveries into clinical utility. One difficulty in making bench-to-bedside translations with gene-expression and proteomic data is our current inability to relate these findings with each other and with clinical measurements. A translational researcher studying a particular biological process using microarrays or proteomics will want to gather as many relevant publicly-available data sets as possible, to compare findings. Translational investigators wanting to relate clinical or chemical data with multiple genomic or proteomic measurements will want to find and join related data sets. Unfortunately, finding and joining relevant data sets is particularly challenging today, as the useful annotations of this data are still represented only by unstructured free-text, limiting its secondary use. A question we have sought to answer is whether prior investments in biomedical ontologies can provide leverage in determining the context of genomic data in an automated manner, thereby enabling integration of gene expression and proteomic data and the secondary use of genomic data in multiple fields of research beyond those for which the data sets were originally targeted. The three specific aims to address this question are to (1) develop tools that comprehensively map contextual annotations to the largest biomedical ontology, the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS), built and supported by the National Library of Medicine, validate, and disseminate the mappings, (2) execute a four-pronged strategy to evaluate experiment-concept mappings, and (3) apply experiment-context mappings to find and integrate data within and across microarray and proteomics repositories. To keep these tools relevant to biomedical investigators, we have included three Driving Biological Projects (DBPs), in the domains of breast cancer, organ transplantation, and T-cell biology. To accomplish these DBPs, our tools and mappings will be used to find and join experimental data within and across microarray and proteomic repositories. Having DBPs to address will focus our development on a set of scalable tools that can access and analyze experimental data covering a large variety of diseases. Through our advisory committee of world-renowned NIH-funded investigators, we will ensure that our findings will have broad applicability and are useful to a wide variety of biomedical researchers.          n/a",Integrating Microarray and Proteomic Data by Ontology-based Annotation,7467204,R01LM009719,"['Address', 'Advisory Committees', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Growth', 'Head', 'Human Genome Project', 'Improve Access', 'International', 'Investments', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Molecular Biology', 'Nature', 'Online Systems', 'Ontology', 'Organ Transplantation', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Process', 'Proteomics', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specificity', 'System', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Text', 'Time', 'Today', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Transplantation', 'Unified Medical Language System', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'United States National Library of Medicine', 'Writing', 'base', 'bench to bedside', 'biomedical informatics', 'concept', 'improved', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'repository', 'research study', 'text searching', 'tool', 'translational medicine']",NLM,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2008,280000,-0.002256235363183897
"Statistical Model Building for High Dimensional Biomedical Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Typical of current large-scale biomedical data is the feature of small number of observed samples and the widely observed sample heterogeneity. Identifying differentially expressed genes related to the sample phenotye (e.g., cancer disease development) and predicting sample phenotype based on the gene expressions are some central research questions in the microarray data analysis. Most existing statistical methods have ignored sample heterogeneity and thus loss power.       This project proposes to develop novel statistical methods that explicitly address the small sample size and sampe heterogeneity issues, and can be applied very generally. The usefulness of these methods will be shown with the large-scale biomedical data originating from the lung and kidney transplant research projects. The transplant projects aimed to improve the molecular diagnosis and therapy of lung/kidney allograft rejection by identifying molecular biomarkers to predict the allograft rejection for critical early treatment and rapid, noninvasive, and economical testing.       The specific aims are 1) Develop novel statistical methods for differential gene expression detection that explicitly model sample heterogeneity. 2) Develop novel statistical methods for classifying high-dimensional biomedical data and incorporating sample heterogeneity. 3) Develop novel statistical methods for jointly analyzing a set of genes (e.g., genes in a pathway). 4) Use the developed models and methods to answer research questions relevant to public health in the lung and kidney transplant projects; and implement and validate the proposed methods in user-friendly and well-documented software, and distribute them to the scientific community at no charge.       It is very important to identify new biomarkers of allograft rejection in lung and kidney transplant recipients. The rapid and reliable detection and prediction of rejection in easily obtainable body fluids may allow the rapid advancement of clinical interventional trials.

"Scalable Learning with Ensemble Techniques and Parallel Computing    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The ability to conduct basic and applied biomedical research is becoming increasingly dependent on data produced by new and emerging technologies. This data has an unprecedented amount of detail and volume. Researchers are therefore dependent on computing and computational tools to be able to visualize, analyze, model, and interpret these large and complex sets of data. Tools for disease detection, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention are common goals of many, if not all, biomedical research programs. Sound analytical and statistical theory and methodology for class pre- diction and class discovery lay the foundation for building these tools, of which the machine learning techniques of classification (supervised learning) and clustering (unsupervised learning) are crucial. Our goal is to produce software for analysis and interpretation of large data sets using ensemble machine learning techniques and parallel computing technologies. Ensemble techniques are recent advances in machine learning theory and methodology leading to great improvements in accuracy and stability in data set analysis and interpretation. The results from a committee of primary machine learners (classifiers or clusterers) that have been trained on different instance or feature subsets are combined through techniques such as voting. The high prediction accuracy of classifier ensembles (such as boosting, bagging, and random forests) has generated much excitement in the statistics and machine learning communities. Recent research extends the ensemble methodology to clustering, where class information is unavailable, also yielding superior performance in terms of accuracy and stability. In theory, most ensemble techniques are inherently parallel. However, existing implementations are generally serial and assume the data set is memory resident. Therefore current software will not scale to the large data sets produced in today's biomedical research. We propose to take two approaches to scale ensemble techniques to large data sets: data partitioning approaches and parallel computing. The focus of Phase I will be to prototype scalable classifier ensembles using parallel architectures. We intend to: establish the parallel computing infrastructures; produce a preliminary architecture and software design; investigate a wide range of ensemble generation schemes using data partitioning strategies; and implement scalable bagging and random forests based on the preliminary design. The focus of Phase II will be to complete the software architecture and implement the scalable classifier ensembles and scalable clusterer ensembles within this framework. We intend to: complete research and development of classifier ensembles; extend the classification framework to clusterer ensembles; research and develop a unified interface for building ensembles with differing generation mechanisms and combination strategies; and evaluate the effectiveness of the software on simulated and real data.

"Ontologies and Biomedical Language Processing    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We hypothesize that there are significant synergies between the applications of biomedical ontologies and of biomedical language processing (BLP) which can be used to improve the quality and scope of both activities. A growing body of work suggests such synergies might exist, but there has yet to be a systematic exploration of their potential. We propose to carry out a focused effort to explore both the potential for, and obstacles to, the mutual application of biomedical ontologies and biomedical language processing. To provide immediate biological relevance to our work, we propose to focus on the topics of autoimmune and pulmonary disease. We group our proposed explorations into three specific aims: (1) Create novel tools and approaches for the application and maintenance of biomedical ontologies, based on an assessment of the processes and tools used for the ontological annotation of textual corpora in the biomedical language processing community. Particularly, we will focus on the creation of new methods for effective search through large ontologies, compositional approaches to annotation, effective capture of the evidence underlying annotations, and the use of automated suggestions for manual confirmation. (2) Evaluate the utility of BLP tools and techniques when applied to terms and definitions of biomedical ontologies, both to enrich and interconnect orthogonal ontologies, and to provide quality assurance and quality control mechanisms. Particularly, we propose to develop and evaluate methods for connecting terms within and across ontologies, for assessing completeness of an ontology against the literature, and for implementing automatically executable measures of ontology quality. (3) Compare the differences between annotations produced by manual procedures and those produced by automated BLP methods for completeness and correctness. Based on the resulting data, produce guidelines for the optimal interplay between manual and automatic procedures for producing broad, accurate and useful knowledge-bases. Because ontologies are the central organizing tool of the model organism databases, improvements in their quality and in the ease and efficiency of their use will have a major effect on the model organism databases, speed the translational process generally, and create a potentially large public health impact.          n/a",Ontologies and Biomedical Language Processing,7502636,R01GM083649,"['Address', 'Area', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmune Process', 'Autoimmunity', 'Automated Annotation', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Computing', 'Body of uterus', 'Classification', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Genes', 'Guidelines', 'Human', 'Immunology', 'Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Language', 'Linguistics', 'Literature', 'Lung diseases', 'Maintenance', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Metaphor', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Motivation', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Numbers', 'Ontology', 'Peer Review', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Process Assessment', 'Production', 'Psyche structure', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Pulmonary Hypertension', 'Quality Control', 'Recording of previous events', 'Representations, Knowledge (Computer)', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Role', 'Semantics', 'Speed', 'Suggestion', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Ursidae Family', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'concept', 'cost', 'design', 'experience', 'gene function', 'improved', 'information organization', 'innovation', 'knowledge base', 'language processing', 'model organisms databases', 'novel', 'quality assurance', 'tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R01,2008,640921,-0.0004377352432175009
"National Center: Multi-Scale Study of Cellular Networks(RMI)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  A network of molecular interactions, involving many thousands of genes, their products, and other molecules, underlie cellular processes. Investigation of these interactions across a wide range of scales ranging from the formation/activation of transcriptional complexes, to the availability of a signaling pathway, all the way to macroscopic processes, such as cell adhesion, calls for a new level of sophistication in the design of genome- wide computational approaches. A homogeneous environment for the comprehensive mapping and analysis of molecular cellular interactions in would be a powerful resource for the biomedical research community. We propose the creation of a National Center for the Multiscale Analysis of Genomic and Cellular Networks (MAGNet). The Center will provide an integrative computational framework to organize molecular interactions in the cell into manageable context-dependent components and will develop interoperable computational models and tools that can leverage such a map of cellular interactions to elucidate important biological processes. Center activities will involve a significant, multidisciplinary effort of biological and computational sciences. Specific areas of expertise include natural language parsing (NLP), machine learning (ML), software systems and engineering, databases, computational structural biology, reverse engineering of genetic networks, biomedical literature datamining, and biomedical ontologies, among others. The Center will 1) construct an evidence integration framework to collect and fuse a variety of diverse cellular interaction clues based on their statistical relevance 2) assemble a comprehensive set of physics- and knowledge-based methodologies to fill this framework 3) provide a set of methodologies and filters, anchored in formal domain ontologies, to associated specific interactions to an organism, tissue, molecular, and cellular context. All relevant tools will be made accessible to the biomedical research community through a common, extensible, and interoperable software platform, geWorkbench. We will reach out to train and encourage researchers to use and/or develop new modules for, geWorkbench. An important element of the software platform will be the development of specific components that can exploit the evidence integration techniques developed by Core 9001 investigators to combine molecular interaction clues from Core 9002 algorithms and databases.

"Morphometry Biomedical Informatics Research Network    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Technological advances in imaging have revolutionized the biomedical investigation of illness. The tremendous potential that this methodology brings to advancing diagnostic and prognostic capabilities and in treatment of illnesses has as yet remained largely an unfulfilled promise. This potential has been limited by a number of technological impediments that could be in large part overcome by the availability of a federated imaging database and the attendant infrastructure. Specifically, the ability to conduct clinical imaging studies across multiple sites, to analyze imaging data with the most powerful software regardless of development site, and to test new hypotheses on large collections of subjects with well characterized image and clinical data would have a demonstrable and positive impact on progress in this field. The Morphometry BIRN (mBIRN), established in October 2001, has made substantial progress in the development of this national infrastructure to develop a data and computational network based on a federated data acquisition and database across seven sites in the service of facilitating multi-site neuroanatomic analysis. Standardized structural MRI image acquisition protocols have been developed and implemented that demonstrably reduce initial sources of inter-site variance. Data structure, transmission, storage and querying aspects of the federated database have been implemented. In this continuation of the mBIRN efforts, we propose three broad areas of work:   1) continuing structural MRI acquisition optimization, calibration and validation to include T2 and DTI; 2) translation of site specific state-of-the-art image analysis, visualization and machine learning technologies to work in the federated, multi-site BIRN environment; and 3) extension of data management and database query capabilities to include additional imaging modalities, clinical disorders and individualized human genetic covariates. These broad areas of work will come together in through key collaborations that will ensure utilization promotion by facilitating data entry into the federated database and creation of database incentive functionality. Our participating sites include MGH (PI), BWH, UCI, Duke, UCLA, UCSD, John Hopkins, and newly added Washington University and MIT. We have made a concerted effort to bridge the gap that can exist between biomedical and computational sciences by recruiting to our group leaders in both of these domains.

"Semantics and Services enabled Problem Solving Environment for Trypanosoma cruzi    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The study of complex biological systems increasingly depends on vast amounts of dynamic information from diverse sources. The scientific analysis of the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi (T.cruzi), the principal causative agent of human Chagas disease, is the driving biological application of this proposal. Approximately 18 million people, predominantly in Latin America, are infected with the T.cruzi parasite. As many as 40 percent of these are predicted eventually to suffer from Chagas disease, which is the leading cause of heart disease and sudden death in middle-aged adults in the region. Research on T. cruzi is therefore an important human disease related effort. It has reached a critical juncture with the quantities of experimental data being generated by labs around the world, due in large part to the publication of the T.cruzi genome in 2005. Although this research has the potential to improve human health significantly, the data being generated exist in independent heterogeneous databases with poor integration and accessibility. The scientific objectives of this research proposal are to develop and deploy a novel ontology-driven semantic problem-solving environment (PSE) for T.cruzi. This is in collaboration with the National Center for Biomedical Ontologies (NCBO) and will leverage its resources to achieve the objectives of this proposal as well as effectively to disseminate results to the broader life science community, including researchers in human pathogens. The PSE allows the dynamic integration of local and public data to answer biological questions at multiple levels of granularity. The PSE will utilize state-of- the-art semantic technologies for effective querying of multiple databases and, just as important, feature an intuitive and comprehensive set of interfaces for usability and easy adoption by biologists. Included in the multimodal datasets will be the genomic data and the associated bioinformatics predictions, functional information from metabolic pathways, experimental data from mass spectrometry and microarray experiments, and textual information from Pubmed. Researchers will be able to use and contribute to a rigorously curated T.cruzi knowledge base that will make it reusable and extensible. The resources developed as part of this proposal will be also useful to researchers in T.cruzi related kinetoplastids, Trypanosoma brucei and Leishmania major (among other pathogenic organisms), which use similar research protocols and face similar informatics challenges. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The scientific objective of this proposal is to develop and deploy a novel ontology-driven semantic problem-solving environment (PSE) for Trypanosoma cruzi, a parasite that infects approximately 18 million people, predominantly in Latin America.

Facilitating T.cruzi research through the PSE, with the aim of identifying vaccine, diagnostic, and therapeutic targets, is an important human disease related endeavor.          n/a",Semantics and Services enabled Problem Solving Environment for Trypanosoma cruzi,7428761,R01HL087795,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Model', 'Anti-Retroviral Agents', 'Architecture', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Arts', 'Automobile Driving', 'Beds', 'Behavior', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Sciences', 'Biomedical Computing', 'Biomedical Research', 'Body of uterus', 'Buffaloes', 'California', 'Caring', 'Chagas Disease', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Systems Development', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Controlled Vocabulary', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Doctor of Public Health', 'Drops', 'Drosophila genus', 'Educational Activities', 'Educational workshop', 'Electronics', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Face', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gene Mutation', 'Generations', 'Generic Drugs', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Geographic Locations', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'HIV Infections', 'Health', 'Heart Diseases', 'Homologous Gene', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Imagery', 'Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes', 'Immunology', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Informatics', 'Information Management', 'Information Resources', 'Information Services', 'Information Technology', 'International', 'Internet', 'Interruption', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Organism', 'Language', 'Latin America', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Leishmania major', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Medical Informatics', 'Medicine', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metadata', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mind', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Online Mendelian Inheritance In Man', 'Online Systems', 'Ontology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Oregon', 'Organism', 'Orthologous Gene', 'Outcome', 'Parasites', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Philosophy', 'Physiology', 'Prevention strategy', 'Principal Investigator', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Proteomics', 'Protocols documentation', 'PubMed', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Purpose', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Range', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Proposals', 'Resources', 'San Francisco', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Semantics', 'Services', 'Site', 'Software Tools', 'Solutions', 'Source', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Structure', 'Study models', 'Sudden Death', 'Sum', 'System', 'TAF8 gene', 'Talents', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Training', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Trypanosoma brucei brucei', 'Trypanosoma cruzi', 'USA Georgia', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'United States National Library of Medicine', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Vaccines', 'Vertical Disease Transmission', 'Victoria Austrailia', 'Virtual Library', 'Virus', 'Western Asia Georgia', 'Work', 'Zebrafish', 'abstracting', 'base', 'biocomputing', 'biomedical scientist', 'college', 'computer based Semantic Analysis', 'computer science', 'concept', 'data integration', 'design', 'desire', 'fundamental research', 'human disease', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovative technologies', 'knowledge base', 'member', 'metabolomics', 'middle age', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'outreach', 'pandemic disease', 'pathogen', 'prevent', 'programs', 'protein protein interaction', 'repository', 'research and development', 'research study', 'syntax', 'theories', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'usability']",NHLBI,WRIGHT STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2008,393930,-0.010417622626281327
"Answering Information Needs in Workflow    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Needs for information arise continuously during the course of clinical practice, especially for physicians in training, e.g. when examining a patient or participating in rounds. In most of these situations, it is difficult or impossible for the clinician to immediately access appropriate information resources. Most needs are never adequately articulated or recorded, and consequently are forgotten by the end of the day. Moreover, when clinicians do recall information needs, they don't act on them, due to the significant limitations of current retrieval systems and the exigencies of clinical practice. The specific aims of the proposed project are: 1) to capture information needs in a convenient manner at the moment they occur using different modalities such as text input and voice capture on hand-held devices, 2) to translate high-level information needs into complex search strategies that adapt to user needs and are tuned to the capabilities of resources, and 3) to deliver relevant materials to the clinician in an accessible format and in a timely manner. The project will develop a central hub for addressing the information needs of medical students and residents, to be transmitted electronically as they occur in the field. A unique feature of the project is the use of natural language processing technology to identify context, goals and preferences in clinicians' questions. The major innovation is the generation of complex search strategies that exploit this contextual information, based on studies of human searching experts (reference librarians).              n/a",Answering Information Needs in Workflow,7217497,R01LM008799,"['Address', 'Biological Models', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Face', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Human', 'Information Resources', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Librarians', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Errors', 'Medical Students', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Software Tools', 'System', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Textbooks', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Voice', 'Work', 'base', 'day', 'forgetting', 'innovation', 'preference', 'speech processing', 'symposium']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2007,361696,-0.006291635696380183
"Semantic and Machine Learning Methods for Mining Connections in the UMLS    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) is an invaluable resource for the biomedical community.   One of the intended uses of the UMLS Metathesaurus is to support the translation of terms from a source terminology into terms in a target terminology. It is evident from the research literature on the UMLS that users generally need to perform more broader types of ""translations"" that involve finding terms with closest meaning to source term (mapping), finding terms that are related to source term and can serve as proxy for various functions (e.g. information retrieval, knowledge discovery) or finding target terms that satisfy some structural or semantic constraint (e.g. information theoretic distance). The methods for finding such ""translations"" or connections between terms in Meta (other than the case of one-to-one synonymy) are not at all clear. Previous attempts to exploit such connections have depended on either manual selection of relevant connections, or problem-specific algorithms that use expert knowledge about the relative suitability of various inter-concept relationships. We believe that machine learning techniques offer automated, generalizable approaches that are appropriate for use with the UMLS, given the large set of potential connections and the need for a problem-independent approach. We hypothesize that learning strategies that exploit the relational features, scale free properties and probabilistic dependencies of connections in the UMLS will identify meaningful inter-term relationships and that a combined approach will perform better across different problem domains when compared to any of the approaches in isolation. We will evaluate the proposed learning algorithms with training connections from a variety of problem domains in biomedicine. We will disseminate the successful algorithms via the UMLS Knowledge Source API toolkit for mining and visualizing the connections. We believe that the UMLS provides a unique fertile ground to develop novel semantic relational mining methods and advance our understanding of mining large biomedical concept graphs.             n/a",Semantic and Machine Learning Methods for Mining Connections in the UMLS,7299922,R21LM009638,"['Algorithms', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependency', 'Disease', 'Graph', 'Healthcare', 'Information Retrieval', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Nature', 'Ontology', 'Organism', 'Pathway interactions', 'Property', 'Proxy', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Sampling', 'Semantics', 'Social Network', 'Solutions', 'Source', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Terminology', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Unified Medical Language System', 'Work', 'base', 'biomedical resource', 'concept', 'interest', 'metathesaurus', 'microbial alkaline proteinase inhibitor', 'novel', 'success']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R21,2007,181125,0.026871261375840883
"Technology Development for a MolBio Knowledge-Base Since the introduction of the Mycin system more than 25 years ago, it has widely been hypothesized that extensive, well-represented computer knowledge-bases will facilitate a wide variety of scientific and clinical tasks. Driven by growing knowledge-management challenges adsing from the proliferation of high- throughput instrumentation, recently created knowledge-bases in areas related to genomics and related aspects of contemporary biology, such as the Gene Ontology, EcoCyc and PharmGKB, have begun to become integrated into the laboratory practices of a growing number of molecular biologists. However, these successful molecular biology knowledge-bases (MBKBs) have two drawbacks which impede their more general application: each has been narrowed to a particular special purpose, either in its domain of applicability or in the scope of knowledge represented, and each of these knowledge-bases was constructed largely on the basis of enormous human effort. Given the current state of molecular biology data and recent iadvances in database integration and information extraction technology, we proposed to test the following hypothesis: Current computational technology and existing human-curated knowledge resources are sufficient to build an extensive, high-quality computational knowledge-base of molecular biology. To test this hypothesis we propose to first create tools which can (a) automatically link incommensurate knowledge sources using semantic linking, and (b) use natural language processing techniques to extract new information from NCBrs GeneRIFs and from the GO definitions fields; and second, to evaluate the results of these methods by carefully quantifying the degree to which the induced linkages and extracted assertions are complete, consistent and correct. Although we propose to construct a broad and rich knowledge-base in order to develop and test the adequacy of largely automated methods to leverage existing human-curated collections, we do not propose to build a comprehensive MBKB. n/a",Technology Development for a MolBio Knowledge-Base,7473405,R01LM008111,"['Address', 'Area', 'Biology', 'Class', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Evaluation', 'Facility Construction Funding Category', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Human', 'Indium', 'Informatics', 'Information Resources', 'Information Resources Management', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Base (Computer)', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Metric System', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Mus', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Numbers', 'Ontology', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Plug-in', 'Proteins', 'Purpose', 'Semantics', 'Source', 'SwissProt', 'System', 'Taxonomy', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'concept', 'data integration', 'gene function', 'heuristics', 'instrumentation', 'knowledge base', 'success', 'technology development', 'tool']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R01,2007,234058,0.02149732719966474
"A Biomedical Natural Language Processing Resource DESCRIPTION:    The long-term aim of this project is to advance clinical care and biomedical research by establishing a natural language processing (NLP) resource for the biomedical community. A major bottleneck for development of automated tools for clinical applications and biomedical research is that most of the data and knowledge occur in the form of text, resulting in a lack of coded data. This NLP resource will make possible a host of automated applications by enabling high throughput access to coded biomedical knowledge and data. The foundation of this resource will be the MedLEE NLP system, which has been used operationally for almost a decade in healthcare settings for a broad range of applications that have proven to be valuable for clinical care. The NLP resource will also include BioMedLEE (a derivative of MedLEE), which encodes genotypic-phenotypic (GP) relations in the scientific literature. It currently focuses on GP relations associated with cancer and infectious diseases, and is being used to organize the extracted information to facilitate research, curation, and ontological development within model organism databases. This proposal will enable us to 1) disseminate our NLP resource to the community, 2) conduct technological research and development (R&D) to facilitate expansion and adaptation of the resource to new applications and specialties, 3) conduct R&D of tools that facilitate use of the extracted data and knowledge after coding, and 4) promote the resource, and provide service to users in the form of technical support, documentation, and tutorials. MedLEE and BioMedLEE are extendable systems that encompass the clinical and scientific communities. The dissemination of a proven NLP system that is applicable to the entire biomedical community provides an exceptional opportunity for multiple developers and researchers to work to unleash the true potential of NLP technology, increasing development of applications that aim to enhance scientific research and improve all levels of health. n/a",A Biomedical Natural Language Processing Resource,7257857,R01LM008635,"['Address', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Research', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Condition', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Educational workshop', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Health Status', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Imagery', 'Improve Access', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Errors', 'Medical Surveillance', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Numbers', 'Ontology', 'Organism', 'Output', 'Partner in relationship', 'Patient Care', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Process', 'Range', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Semantics', 'Services', 'Side', 'Source', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Terminology', 'Text', 'Universities', 'Work', 'biological research', 'biomedical resource', 'clinical application', 'concept', 'high throughput technology', 'improved', 'knowledge base', 'medical specialties', 'model organisms databases', 'open source', 'research and development', 'tool']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2007,529014,-0.009133652166027973

"New Machine Learning Methods for Biomedical Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  In the past few years, we have witnessed a dramatic increase of the amount of data available to biomedical research. An example is the recent advances of high-throughput biotechnologies, making it possible to access genome-wide gene expressions. To address biomedical issues at molecular levels, extraction of the relevant information from massive data of complex structures is essential. This calls for advanced mechanisms for statistical prediction and inference, especially in genomic discovery and prediction, where statistical uncertainty involved in a discovery process is high. The proposed approach focuses on the development of mixture model-based and large margin approaches in semisupervised and unsupervised learning, motivated from biomedical studies in gene discovery and prediction. In particular, we propose to investigate how to improve accuracy and efficiency of mixture model-based and large margin learning systems in generalization. In addition, we will develop innovative methods taking the structure of sparseness and the grouping effect into account to battle the curse of dimensionality, and blend them with the new learning tools. A number of technical issues will be investigated, including: a) developing model selection criteria and performing automatic feature selection, especially when the number of features greatly exceeds that of samples; b) developing large margin approaches for multi-class learning, with most effort towards sparse as well as structured learning; c) implementing efficient computation for real-time applications, and d) analyzing two biological datasets for i) gene function discovery and prediction for E. coli, and ii) new class discovery and prediction for BOEC samples; e) developing public-domain software.

The overarching goal of this application is to provide an excellent postdoctoral training program in neuroimaging neuroinformatics that capitalizes on the many strengths of the existing neuroscientists, informatics and imaging resources that our combined resources represent. Our proposed Neuroimaging Neuroinformatics Training Program (NNTP) is based upon a number of important strategic alliances. The first cornerstone of this effort is the existing HBP grants held by Dr. Anders Dale (R01 NS39581: Cortical-Surface-Based Brain Imaging) and Dr. David Kennedy (R01 NS34189: Anatomic Morphologic Analysis of MR Brain Images). These efforts span a wealth of technological developments, research and clinical application areas in the rapidly developing area of quantitative morphometric image analysis. A second and vital cornerstone is our association with the Harvard-MIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology (HST) Biomedical Informatics Program. This existing pre- and post-graduate academic program, within a world class biomedical engineering department, is an ideal setting for the development of a coordinated training effort in Neuroinformatics. The established track record in training skilled scientists in areas of informatics will prove invaluable in this new initiative. The third cornerstone is the combined clinical research opportunities afforded by the Harvard-wide biomedical imaging resources. These include the MGH/MIT/HST Athinoula A. Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging, the Harvard Neuroimaging Center, the Surgical Planning Lab at Brigham and Women's Hospital, the Brain Morphology BIRN (Biomedical Informatics Research Network) and the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. Together, these active and vibrant programs provide for the best possible training opportunities in imaging science, computer science, clinical application areas, and cognitive neuroscience. A substantial and successful pool of internationally renowned mentors have agreed to participate in this program, and the combined resources provide the best possible exposure to all neuroimaging procedures and insure the capability to draw the highest caliber trainees. A plan for recruiting, selecting and monitoring trainees is proposed.

Building on our past experience, the competing renewal has three facets which will take place concurrently: 1) up-dating current modules (14) and the development, testing, and evaluation of two new internet course modules; 2) recruitment and training of participants through 5 workshops at remote sites and subsequent participation in the web-based course; 3) continuing evaluation of the training modules for the purpose of technological and content versions. Significant changes from the original program include moving the pre-course conference off-site to maximize the number of faculty participating from contiguous institutions and the introduction of machine language technology to aid in the editing and packaging of participants' grant writing efforts. At the conclusion of the initiative, each participant should be both motivated and empowered to submit a competitive proposal.

"Visant-Predictome: A System for Integration, Mining Visualization and Analysis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent and continuing technological advances are producing large amounts of disparate data about cell structure, function and activity. This is driving the development of tools for storing, mining, analyzing, visualizing and integrating data. This proposal describes the VisANT system: a tool for visual data mining that operates on a local database which includes results from our lab, as well as automatically updated proteomics data from web accessible databases such as MIPS and BIND. In addition to accessing its own database, a name normalization table (i.e. a dictionary of identifiers), permits the system to seamlessly retrieve sequence, disease and other data from sources such as GenBank and OMIM. The visualization tool is able to reversibly group related sets of nodes, and display and duplicate their internal structure, providing an approach to hierarchical representation and modeling. We propose to build further on these unique features by including capabilities for mining and representing chemical reactions, orthologous networks, combinatorially regulated transcriptional networks, splice variants and functional hierarchies. Software is open source, and the system also allows users to exchange and integrate the networks that they discover with those of others.           n/a","Visant-Predictome: A System for Integration, Mining Visualization and Analysis",7287965,R01RR022971,"['Address', 'Archives', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bayesian Method', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Cell physiology', 'Cellular Structures', 'Chemicals', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Systems Development', 'Computer software', 'Condition', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Dependence', 'Dependency', 'Development', 'Dictionary', 'Disease', 'Educational workshop', 'Electronic Mail', 'Facility Construction Funding Category', 'Genbank', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Imagery', 'Information Systems', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Names', 'Network-based', 'Numbers', 'Online Mendelian Inheritance In Man', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Proteomics', 'RNA Splicing', 'Reaction', 'Reporting', 'Score', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Integration', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Tertiary Protein Structure', 'Update', 'Ursidae Family', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Weight', 'base', 'chemical reaction', 'data mining', 'improved', 'models and simulation', 'open source', 'outreach', 'protein protein interaction', 'software development', 'statistics', 'tool', 'tool development', 'web-accessible', 'wiki']",NCRR,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),R01,2007,446875,-0.010659285820576398
"A Resource for Biomedical Ontologies and Knowledge Bases    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       For more than two decades, our laboratory has been studying technology to develop, manage, and use formal descriptions of biomedical concepts. The result of this work is Protege, a workbench that allows users to edit and apply controlled terminologies, ontologies, and knowledge bases to a wide range of information-management problems. To date, more than 50,000 people have registered as users of the system.

"Ontologies and Biomedical Language Processing    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We hypothesize that there are significant synergies between the applications of biomedical ontologies and of biomedical language processing (BLP) which can be used to improve the quality and scope of both activities. A growing body of work suggests such synergies might exist, but there has yet to be a systematic exploration of their potential. We propose to carry out a focused effort to explore both the potential for, and obstacles to, the mutual application of biomedical ontologies and biomedical language processing. To provide immediate biological relevance to our work, we propose to focus on the topics of autoimmune and pulmonary disease. We group our proposed explorations into three specific aims: (1) Create novel tools and approaches for the application and maintenance of biomedical ontologies, based on an assessment of the processes and tools used for the ontological annotation of textual corpora in the biomedical language processing community. Particularly, we will focus on the creation of new methods for effective search through large ontologies, compositional approaches to annotation, effective capture of the evidence underlying annotations, and the use of automated suggestions for manual confirmation. (2) Evaluate the utility of BLP tools and techniques when applied to terms and definitions of biomedical ontologies, both to enrich and interconnect orthogonal ontologies, and to provide quality assurance and quality control mechanisms. Particularly, we propose to develop and evaluate methods for connecting terms within and across ontologies, for assessing completeness of an ontology against the literature, and for implementing automatically executable measures of ontology quality. (3) Compare the differences between annotations produced by manual procedures and those produced by automated BLP methods for completeness and correctness. Based on the resulting data, produce guidelines for the optimal interplay between manual and automatic procedures for producing broad, accurate and useful knowledge-bases. Because ontologies are the central organizing tool of the model organism databases, improvements in their quality and in the ease and efficiency of their use will have a major effect on the model organism databases, speed the translational process generally, and create a potentially large public health impact.          n/a",Ontologies and Biomedical Language Processing,7364235,R01GM083649,"['Address', 'Area', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmune Process', 'Autoimmunity', 'Automated Annotation', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Computing', 'Body of uterus', 'Classification', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Genes', 'Guidelines', 'Human', 'Immunology', 'Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Language', 'Linguistics', 'Literature', 'Lung diseases', 'Maintenance', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Metaphor', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Motivation', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Numbers', 'Ontology', 'Peer Review', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Process Assessment', 'Production', 'Psyche structure', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Pulmonary Hypertension', 'Quality Control', 'Recording of previous events', 'Representations, Knowledge (Computer)', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Role', 'Semantics', 'Speed', 'Suggestion', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Ursidae Family', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'concept', 'cost', 'design', 'experience', 'gene function', 'improved', 'information organization', 'innovation', 'knowledge base', 'language processing', 'model organisms databases', 'novel', 'quality assurance', 'tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R01,2007,631600,-0.0004377352432175009
"National Center: Multi-Scale Study of Cellular Networks(RMI)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  A network of molecular interactions, involving many thousands of genes, their products, and other molecules, underlie cellular processes. Investigation of these interactions across a wide range of scales ranging from the formation/activation of transcriptional complexes, to the availability of a signaling pathway, all the way to macroscopic processes, such as cell adhesion, calls for a new level of sophistication in the design of genome- wide computational approaches. A homogeneous environment for the comprehensive mapping and analysis of molecular cellular interactions in would be a powerful resource for the biomedical research community. We propose the creation of a National Center for the Multiscale Analysis of Genomic and Cellular Networks (MAGNet). The Center will provide an integrative computational framework to organize molecular interactions in the cell into manageable context-dependent components and will develop interoperable computational models and tools that can leverage such a map of cellular interactions to elucidate important biological processes. Center activities will involve a significant, multidisciplinary effort of biological and computational sciences. Specific areas of expertise include natural language parsing (NLP), machine learning (ML), software systems and engineering, databases, computational structural biology, reverse engineering of genetic networks, biomedical literature datamining, and biomedical ontologies, among others. The Center will 1) construct an evidence integration framework to collect and fuse a variety of diverse cellular interaction clues based on their statistical relevance 2) assemble a comprehensive set of physics- and knowledge-based methodologies to fill this framework 3) provide a set of methodologies and filters, anchored in formal domain ontologies, to associated specific interactions to an organism, tissue, molecular, and cellular context. All relevant tools will be made accessible to the biomedical research community through a common, extensible, and interoperable software platform, geWorkbench. We will reach out to train and encourage researchers to use and/or develop new modules for, geWorkbench. An important element of the software platform will be the development of specific components that can exploit the evidence integration techniques developed by Core 9001 investigators to combine molecular interaction clues from Core 9002 algorithms and databases. Development will be both driven and tested by the biomedical community to ensure the usefulness of the tools and the usability of the graphical user interfaces to address biomedical problems in completely novel ways, to dissect the web of cellular interactions responsible for cellular processes and functions.         n/a",National Center: Multi-Scale Study of Cellular Networks(RMI),7286779,U54CA121852,[' '],NCI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,U54,2007,3638557,0.03305552398023924
"Morphometry Biomedical Informatics Research Network    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Technological advances in imaging have revolutionized the biomedical investigation of illness. The tremendous potential that this methodology brings to advancing diagnostic and prognostic capabilities and in treatment of illnesses has as yet remained largely an unfulfilled promise. This potential has been limited by a number of technological impediments that could be in large part overcome by the availability of a federated imaging database and the attendant infrastructure. Specifically, the ability to conduct clinical imaging studies across multiple sites, to analyze imaging data with the most powerful software regardless of development site, and to test new hypotheses on large collections of subjects with well characterized image and clinical data would have a demonstrable and positive impact on progress in this field. The Morphometry BIRN (mBIRN), established in October 2001, has made substantial progress in the development of this national infrastructure to develop a data and computational network based on a federated data acquisition and database across seven sites in the service of facilitating multi-site neuroanatomic analysis. Standardized structural MRI image acquisition protocols have been developed and implemented that demonstrably reduce initial sources of inter-site variance. Data structure, transmission, storage and querying aspects of the federated database have been implemented. In this continuation of the mBIRN efforts, we propose three broad areas of work:   1) continuing structural MRI acquisition optimization, calibration and validation to include T2 and DTI; 2) translation of site specific state-of-the-art image analysis, visualization and machine learning technologies to work in the federated, multi-site BIRN environment; and 3) extension of data management and database query capabilities to include additional imaging modalities, clinical disorders and individualized human genetic covariates. These broad areas of work will come together in through key collaborations that will ensure utilization promotion by facilitating data entry into the federated database and creation of database incentive functionality. Our participating sites include MGH (PI), BWH, UCI, Duke, UCLA, UCSD, John Hopkins, and newly added Washington University and MIT. We have made a concerted effort to bridge the gap that can exist between biomedical and computational sciences by recruiting to our group leaders in both of these domains. Our efforts will be coordinated with those of the entire BIRN consortium in order to insure that acquisition and database functionality, and application-based disorder queries are interoperable across sites and designed to advance the capabilities to further knowledge and understanding of health and disease.         n/a",Morphometry Biomedical Informatics Research Network,7253351,U24RR021382,[' '],NCRR,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSP,U24,2007,5123449,-0.000697994820661271

"A Biomedical Natural Language Processing Resource DESCRIPTION:    The long-term aim of this project is to advance clinical care and biomedical research by establishing a natural language processing (NLP) resource for the biomedical community. A major bottleneck for development of automated tools for clinical applications and biomedical research is that most of the data and knowledge occur in the form of text, resulting in a lack of coded data. This NLP resource will make possible a host of automated applications by enabling high throughput access to coded biomedical knowledge and data. The foundation of this resource will be the MedLEE NLP system, which has been used operationally for almost a decade in healthcare settings for a broad range of applications that have proven to be valuable for clinical care. The NLP resource will also include BioMedLEE (a derivative of MedLEE), which encodes genotypic-phenotypic (GP) relations in the scientific literature. It currently focuses on GP relations associated with cancer and infectious diseases, and is being used to organize the extracted information to facilitate research, curation, and ontological development within model organism databases. This proposal will enable us to 1) disseminate our NLP resource to the community, 2) conduct technological research and development (R&D) to facilitate expansion and adaptation of the resource to new applications and specialties, 3) conduct R&D of tools that facilitate use of the extracted data and knowledge after coding, and 4) promote the resource, and provide service to users in the form of technical support, documentation, and tutorials. MedLEE and BioMedLEE are extendable systems that encompass the clinical and scientific communities.

"Technology Development for a MolBio Knowledge-Base   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Since the introduction of the Mycin system more than 25 years ago, it has widely been hypothesized that extensive, well-represented computer knowledge-bases will facilitate a wide variety of scientific and clinical tasks. Driven by growing knowledge-management challenges arising from the proliferation of high throughput instrumentation, recently created knowledge-bases in areas related to genomics and related aspects of contemporary biology, such as the Gene Ontology, EcoCyc and PharmGKB, have begun to become integrated into the laboratory practices of a growing number of molecular biologists. However, these successful molecular biology knowledge-bases (MBKBs) have two drawbacks which impede their more general application: each has been narrowed to a particular special purpose, either in its domain of applicability or in the scope of knowledge represented, and each of these knowledge-bases was constructed largely on the basis of enormous human effort. Given the current state of molecular biology data and recent advances in database integration and information extraction technology, we proposed to test the following hypothesis: Current computational technology and existing human-curated knowledge resources are sufficient to build an extensive, high-quality computational knowledge-base of molecular biology. To test this hypothesis we propose to first create tools which can (a) automatically link incommensurate knowledge sources using semantic linking, and (b) use natural language processing techniques to extract new information from NCBrs GeneRIFs and from the GO definitions fields; and second, to evaluate the results of these methods by carefully quantifying the degree to which the induced linkages and extracted assertions are complete, consistent and correct. Although we propose to construct a broad and rich knowledge-base in order to develop and test the adequacy of largely automated methods to leverage existing human-curated collections, we do not propose to build a comprehensive MBKB.            n/a",Technology Development for a MolBio Knowledge-Base,7123058,R01LM008111,"['artificial intelligence', 'bioinformatics', 'biomedical automation', 'computational biology', 'computer program /software', 'functional /structural genomics', 'information retrieval', 'molecular biology information system', 'technology /technique development']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R01,2006,611872,0.021945247783972718
"Nurse Practitioner Access to Genetics Health Literature    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This training proposal describes a research plan which tests the application of a computer science solution to a clinical problem encountered by nurse practitioners (NPs). As our understanding of genetics health increases, NPs will need to provide care and create health promotion regimens mindful of each client's genetic profile. Access to the rapidly developing genetics health literature is critical for this practice model, but may be difficult, because existing search methods lead to many irrelevant results, and may retrieve the proper result only when precise keywords are used. The NP searching for information that would guide her practice may be forced to make a decision with less than complete or current information. This proposal outlines three studies, which investigate how the semantic web concepts of linking related ideas and terms can improve NPs' access to the genetics health literature. Study 1 explores NPs' genetics health information needs. Study 2 tests the applicability of existing ontologies (terminologies coupled with machine-readable statements about the meanings and relationships of the terms) to nursing. Study 3 tests a prototype intelligent agent employing ontology to retrieve literature relevant to NPs' genetics health information needs.         n/a",Nurse Practitioner Access to Genetics Health Literature,7122136,F37LM008636,"['artificial intelligence', 'clinical research', 'genetics', 'human subject', 'informatics', 'information retrieval', 'nurse practitioners', 'patient care management', 'predoctoral investigator', 'publications', 'semantics', 'young adult human (21-34)']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN MADISON,F37,2006,39750,0.003178744866283544
"Computer System for Functional Analysis of Genomic Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In two previous stages of this project, both funded by the National Institute of General Medical Sciences and carried out successfully, we developed GeneWays, a completely automated system that efficiently distills information about molecular interactions from an astronomical number of full-text biomedical articles. The next logical stage of the project is to carry this system from the computational laboratory into a practical, useful, and even indispensable tool that researchers can use to solve complex problems currently posed in experimental medicine and biology. The central hypothesis of our work on GeneWays has been that our computational tools will generate biological predictions of a quality sufficiently high that the biomedical community will invest in serious experimental validation. Specifically, we propose the following. 1. We will improve significantly the precision and recall of the GeneWays system. 2. We will develop and implement a probabilistic belief-network formalism?a belief-graph relative of the Bayesian network formalism that allows us to place and update beliefs on both the vertices and the edges of the graph for probabilistic reasoning over the large collection of facts in the GeneWays database. We will develop and implement a coordinated collection of methods for computing and updating beliefs on individual nodes and edges of the belief graph. 3. We will develop and implement a mathematical framework for incorporating pathway information into a genetic- linkage analysis formalism in such a way that each piece of pathway knowledge includes a specified degree of confidence. 4. We will process an enormous collection of texts, such as open-access biomedical journals, PubMed abstracts, and the GeneWays corpus, and thus will build a comprehensive GeneHighWays database. We will make the GeneHighWays database easily and freely accessible to academic researchers through a web interface. We will evaluate the new version of the GeneWays system and the GeneHighWays database for the quality of data, performance of the mathematical methods, and quality of the interface.           n/a",Computer System for Functional Analysis of Genomic Data,7148274,R01GM061372,"['Internet', 'artificial intelligence', 'automated data processing', 'biological signal transduction', 'biomedical automation', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'functional /structural genomics', 'high throughput technology', 'intermolecular interaction', 'method development', 'molecular biology information system', 'statistics /biometry']",NIGMS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2006,303688,0.030568146260653125
"CREATION AND APPLICATION OF A DIABETES KNOWLEDGE BASE CREATION AND APPLICATION OF A DIABETES KNOWLEDGE BASE   The applicant is an Instructor in Pediatrics at Harvard Medical School and an associate in bioinformatics and pediatric endocrinology at Children's Hospital, Boston. The applicant completed an NLM-funded fellowship in informatics and received a Masters Degree in Medical Informatics from MIT. Since completing his fellowship less than two years ago, he has first-authored six publications, co-authored eight publications, senior authored two publications, and co-authored a book on microarray analysis. The applicant plans to pursue a career in basic research in diabetes genomics and bioinformatics, with a joint appointment in both an academic pediatric endocrinology department and a medical informatics program. The mentor is Dr. Isaac Kohane, director of the Children's Hospital Informatics Program with a staff of 20 including 10 faculty and extensive computational resources, funded through several NIH grants.       The past 10 years have led to a variety of measurements tools in molecular biology that are near comprehensive in nature. For example, RNA expression detection microarrays can provide systematic quantitative information on the expression of over 40,000 unique RNAs within cells. Yet microarrays are just one of at least 30 large-scale measurement or experimental modalities available to investigators in molecular biology. We see scientific value in being able to integrate multiple large-scale data sets from all biological modalities to address biomedical questions that could otherwise not be answered. We recognize that the full agenda of working out the details for all possible inferential processes between all near-comprehensive modalities is too large. The goal of this project is to serve as a model automated system for gathering data related to particular experimental characteristic and perform inferential operators on these data. For this application, we are focusing on a pragmatic subset. Specifically, we propose intersecting near comprehensive data sets by phenotype, and intersecting lists of significant and related genes within these data sets in an automated manner.      The central hypothesis for this application is that integrating large-scale data sets across measurement  modalities is a synergistic process to create new knowledge and testable hypothesis in the area of diabetes, and inferential processes involving intersection across genes can be automated. n/a",CREATION AND APPLICATION OF A DIABETES KNOWLEDGE BASE,7007706,K22LM008261,"['RNA interference', 'adipocytes', 'artificial intelligence', 'automated data processing', 'cell differentiation', 'clinical research', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'diabetes mellitus genetics', 'human data', 'information systems', 'insulin sensitivity /resistance', 'noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus', 'obesity', 'phenotype', 'quantitative trait loci', 'vocabulary', 'weight gain']",NLM,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K22,2006,153843,0.0071509900416768715
"Automated Knowledge Extraction for Biomedical Literature DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     It is becoming increasingly difficult for biologists to keep pace with information being published within their own fields, let alone biology as a whole. The ability to rapidly access specific and current biomedical information as well as to quickly gain an overview of current knowledge in a given field is becoming more difficult while at the same time more important. Traditional methods of keeping up with advances are therefore becoming inadequate.      Here we propose to continue to develop our Medstract Project to apply recent advances in the computational analysis of text to organize and structure the biological literature. The Medstract project will reduce the time required for biomedical researchers to find information of interest and should facilitate the development of new research insights.  This project is the result of a unique collaboration between a computational linguistics lab at Brandeis University and a molecular biology lab at Tufts University School of Medicine. Previously we have developed an extensive set of tools for analyzing and processing biomedical text. We have used these tools to develop databases of biomedical acronyms, inhibitors, regulators, and interactors from Medline abstracts and have made these available on the web. These resources are currently used by hundreds of investigators every day. In addition we have generated and made available gold standard markup files for several biological terms and relations for use as testing standards by other groups developing knowledge extraction engines for the biomedical domain.      Here we propose to extend and enhance our current Medstract databases as well to generate new databases using the tools that we have developed. New databases will include protein modifications, domains and motifs, and tissue and cellular localization information. In addition, we will use the bio-relation databases as the foundation for constructing a system allowing point-to-point regulatory pathway identification. We will enhance the robustness of these databases by utilizing algorithms that we have developed for rerendering the semantic ontologies for the biomedical lexicon.  Furthermore, by applying coreference resolution algorithms to the text, we will improve precision and recall of knowledge extraction for populating the database n/a",Automated Knowledge Extraction for Biomedical Literature,7069599,R01LM006649,"['Internet', 'abstracting', 'artificial intelligence', 'computer assisted instruction', 'computer assisted sequence analysis', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'educational resource design /development', 'informatics', 'information retrieval', 'information system analysis', 'information systems', 'molecular biology information system', 'nucleic acid sequence', 'protein sequence', 'publications', 'semantics', 'syntax', 'vocabulary development for information system']",NLM,BRANDEIS UNIVERSITY,R01,2006,398762,0.05224868500622495
"Answering Information Needs in Workflow    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Needs for information arise continuously during the course of clinical practice, especially for physicians in training, e.g. when examining a patient or participating in rounds. In most of these situations, it is difficult or impossible for the clinician to immediately access appropriate information resources. Most needs are never adequately articulated or recorded, and consequently are forgotten by the end of the day. Moreover, when clinicians do recall information needs, they don't act on them, due to the significant limitations of current retrieval systems and the exigencies of clinical practice. The specific aims of the proposed project are: 1) to capture information needs in a convenient manner at the moment they occur using different modalities such as text input and voice capture on hand-held devices, 2) to translate high-level information needs into complex search strategies that adapt to user needs and are tuned to the capabilities of resources, and 3) to deliver relevant materials to the clinician in an accessible format and in a timely manner. The project will develop a central hub for addressing the information needs of medical students and residents, to be transmitted electronically as they occur in the field. A unique feature of the project is the use of natural language processing technology to identify context, goals and preferences in clinicians' questions. The major innovation is the generation of complex search strategies that exploit this contextual information, based on studies of human searching experts (reference librarians).              n/a",Answering Information Needs in Workflow,7101997,R01LM008799,"['clinical research', 'human', 'language', 'memory disorders', 'model', 'physicians', 'training', 'voice']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2006,372499,-0.006291635696380183
"Neuroimaging Neuroinformatics Training Program    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal is in response to PAR-03-034 ""Neuroinformatics Institutional Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (K12)."" The overarching goal of this application is to provide an excellent postdoctoral training program in neuroimaging neuroinformatics that capitalizes on the many strengths of the existing neuroscientists, informatics and imaging resources that our combined resources represent. Our proposed Neuroimaging Neuroinformatics Training Program (NNTP) is based upon a number of important strategic alliances. The first cornerstone of this effort is the existing HBP grants held by Dr. Anders Dale (R01 NS39581: Cortical-Surface-Based Brain Imaging) and Dr. David Kennedy (R01 NS34189: Anatomic Morphologic Analysis of MR Brain Images). These efforts span a wealth of technological developments, research and clinical application areas in the rapidly developing area of quantitative morphometric image analysis. A second and vital cornerstone is our association with the Harvard-MIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology (HST) Biomedical Informatics Program. This existing pre- and post-graduate academic program, within a world class biomedical engineering department, is an ideal setting for the development of a coordinated training effort in Neuroinformatics. The established track record in training skilled scientists in areas of informatics will prove invaluable in this new initiative. The third cornerstone is the combined clinical research opportunities afforded by the Harvard-wide biomedical imaging resources. These include the MGH/MIT/HST Athinoula A. Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging, the Harvard Neuroimaging Center, the Surgical Planning Lab at Brigham and Women's Hospital, the Brain Morphology BIRN (Biomedical Informatics Research Network) and the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. Together, these active and vibrant programs provide for the best possible training opportunities in imaging science, computer science, clinical application areas, and cognitive neuroscience. A substantial and successful pool of internationally renowned mentors have agreed to participate in this program, and the combined resources provide the best possible exposure to all neuroimaging procedures and insure the capability to draw the highest caliber trainees. A plan for recruiting, selecting and monitoring trainees is proposed. This program will be an asset to the Neuroinformatics initiatives of the Human Brain Project by helping to prepare future scientists with advanced neuroinformatics skills         n/a",Neuroimaging Neuroinformatics Training Program,7056141,K12MH069281,"['bioimaging /biomedical imaging', 'bioinformatics', 'brain imaging /visualization /scanning', 'brain morphology', 'career', 'image processing', 'morphometry', 'neuroimaging', 'neurosciences', 'training']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K12,2006,439784,-0.008953082987963112
"The RPI Exploratory Center for Cheminformatics (RMI) The purpose of this Exploratory Center for Cheminformatics Research (ECCR) P20 planning grant is to develop a mechanism for bringing together and stimulating collaborative pilot projects among a constantly-evolving nucleus of experts in Cheminformatics-related fields ranging from methods of encoding and capturing molecular information, to machine learning and data mining techniques, to predictive model development, validation, interpretation and utilization. In addition to these research efforts, the Center will bring together a set of domain specialists and application scientists who will serve as both data generators and end users of the knowledge provided by the molecular property models and modeling methods developed during the course of the grant. This group will also test the new Cheminformatics software that will constitute a tangible, deliverable product from this work. Ten application project modules that exemplify possible interactions between various groups and areas of expertise within the Center are presented as part of this proposal. The unifying vision behind the proposed Center is that much of what is done in each of the subdisciplines represented here can be expressed in a Cheminformatics context: The many diverse project areas can be grouped into one or more overlapping categories: ""Data Generators"" (those who use either theoretical or experimental methods for creating or extracting knowledge), ""Machine Learning and Datamining"" groups (who perform model validation, feature selection, pattern recognition, generation of potentials of mean force and knowledge-based potential work), as well as ""Property-Prediction"" groups (who perform chemically-aware model building, molecular property descriptor generation, Quantitative Structure-Property Relationship modeling, validation, and interpretation), and ""Application"" groups who utilize the information made available using the new tools and methods that are developed as part of the Center. It is our strong belief that these areas of expertise can be brought together within this Planning Grant proposal to generate something larger than the sum of the parts. The Exploratory Center will seed new interdisciplinary projects and train graduate students in these areas.

"RESEARCH DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA-- RELIABILITY AND VALIDITY DESCRIPTION: (adapted from the applicant?s abstract): Temporomandibular disorders (TMD) are common problems in the general population. The Research Diagnostic Criteria (RDC) for TMD were developed to establish specific operationalized examination procedures and diagnostic criteria for 8 Axis I biomedical diagnoses of TMD, as well as Axis II biobehavioral assessment procedures. Procedural reliability testing has been established for the RDC Axis I examination items, but full acceptance of the RDC requires confirmation of the temporal stability, validity, generalizability and clinical utility of the examination items, biomedical diagnoses, biobehavioral assessments, and general protocol. In order to accomplish these overall goals, a multi-center project is proposed that will first reassess at the University of Minnesota the reliability of 6 examiners (2 examiners each from 3 participating universities) to collect clinical Axis I examination data using the RDC operational definitions. In a second step, reliable blinded examiners will collect clinical examination data and formulate RDC diagnoses, which will be compared to criterion diagnoses made by an expert imaging. New clinical exam items will also be assessed. Subject to expert consensus, they will be added to yield a final exam protocol that will include all current RDC examination items as well as the new items. With this new protocol, the 6 examiners will continue examining normal and TMD subjects at their respective centers in order to test the temporal stability and diagnostic validity of the new and existing examination items, patient history items, and TMJ imaging by plain film and MRI. Discriminant analyses and decision tree analyses will be used to determine the best diagnostic algorithms for rendering RDC diagnoses. Masticatory muscle biopsies and TMJ synovial fluid will be collected from subjects at the University of Minnesota to evaluate biological markers for their role as potential mediators underlying the biomedical diagnoses. Simultaneously, Axis II biobehavioral assessment procedures will be tested for temporal reliability, compared with other accepted self-report instruments for concurrent validity, and, at two centers, evaluated for criterion validity against highly structured psychiatric interviews. The clinical and health services utility of adding Axis II biobehavioral assessments, imaging and biopsy results to Axis I clinical examination findings will be appraised. Advancement in our understanding of the prevalence, etiologies, natural progression, and treatment of TMD is dependent on having reliable and valid diagnostic criteria for these disorders. n/a",RESEARCH DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA-- RELIABILITY AND VALIDITY,7072754,U01DE013331,"['biomarker', 'biopsy', 'clinical research', 'diagnosis design /evaluation', 'diagnosis quality /standard', 'enzyme linked immunosorbent assay', 'facial muscles', 'gas chromatography mass spectrometry', 'human subject', 'inflammation', 'interview', 'magnetic resonance imaging', 'mastication', 'musculoskeletal disorder diagnosis', 'oral facial pain', 'pain threshold', 'psychobiology', 'questionnaires', 'radioimmunoassay', 'sign /symptom', 'statistics /biometry', 'synovial fluid', 'temporomandibular joint syndrome', 'tissue /cell culture']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA TWIN CITIES,U01,2006,371497,0.0068783396327240995

"Nation Center: Multi-Scale Study- Cellular Networks(RMI)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  A network of molecular interactions, involving many thousands of genes, their products, and other molecules, underlie cellular processes. Investigation of these interactions across a wide range of scales ranging from the formation/activation of transcriptional complexes, to the availability of a signaling pathway, all the way to macroscopic processes, such as cell adhesion, calls for a new level of sophistication in the design of genome- wide computational approaches. A homogeneous environment for the comprehensive mapping and analysis of molecular cellular interactions in would be a powerful resource for the biomedical research community. We propose the creation of a National Center for the Multiscale Analysis of Genomic and Cellular Networks (MAGNet). The Center will provide an integrative computational framework to organize molecular interactions in the cell into manageable context-dependent components and will develop interoperable computational models and tools that can leverage such a map of cellular interactions to elucidate important biological processes. Center activities will involve a significant, multidisciplinary effort of biological and computational sciences. Specific areas of expertise include natural language parsing (NLP), machine learning (ML), software systems and engineering, databases, computational structural biology, reverse engineering of genetic networks, biomedical literature datamining, and biomedical ontologies, among others. The Center will 1) construct an evidence integration framework to collect and fuse a variety of diverse cellular interaction clues based on their statistical relevance 2) assemble a comprehensive set of physics- and knowledge-based methodologies to fill this framework 3) provide a set of methodologies and filters, anchored in formal domain ontologies, to associated specific interactions to an organism, tissue, molecular, and cellular context. All relevant tools will be made accessible to the biomedical research community through a common, extensible, and interoperable software platform, geWorkbench. We will reach out to train and encourage researchers to use and/or develop new modules for, geWorkbench. An important element of the software platform will be the development of specific components that can exploit the evidence integration techniques developed by Core 9001 investigators to combine molecular interaction clues from Core 9002 algorithms and databases. Development will be both driven and tested by the biomedical community to ensure the usefulness of the tools and the usability of the graphical user interfaces to address biomedical problems in completely novel ways, to dissect the web of cellular interactions responsible for cellular processes and functions.         n/a",Nation Center: Multi-Scale Study- Cellular Networks(RMI),7126050,U54CA121852,"['NIH Roadmap Initiative tag', 'bioinformatics', 'cell biology', 'computational biology', 'cooperative study', 'genome']",NCI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,U54,2006,3747227,0.032037535592949126
"Morphometry Biomedical Informatics Research Network    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Technological advances in imaging have revolutionized the biomedical investigation of illness. The tremendous potential that this methodology brings to advancing diagnostic and prognostic capabilities and in treatment of illnesses has as yet remained largely an unfulfilled promise. This potential has been limited by a number of technological impediments that could be in large part overcome by the availability of a federated imaging database and the attendant infrastructure. Specifically, the ability to conduct clinical imaging studies across multiple sites, to analyze imaging data with the most powerful software regardless of development site, and to test new hypotheses on large collections of subjects with well characterized image and clinical data would have a demonstrable and positive impact on progress in this field. The Morphometry BIRN (mBIRN), established in October 2001, has made substantial progress in the development of this national infrastructure to develop a data and computational network based on a federated data acquisition and database across seven sites in the service of facilitating multi-site neuroanatomic analysis. Standardized structural MRI image acquisition protocols have been developed and implemented that demonstrably reduce initial sources of inter-site variance. Data structure, transmission, storage and querying aspects of the federated database have been implemented. In this continuation of the mBIRN efforts, we propose three broad areas of work:   1) continuing structural MRI acquisition optimization, calibration and validation to include T2 and DTI; 2) translation of site specific state-of-the-art image analysis, visualization and machine learning technologies to work in the federated, multi-site BIRN environment; and 3) extension of data management and database query capabilities to include additional imaging modalities, clinical disorders and individualized human genetic covariates. These broad areas of work will come together in through key collaborations that will ensure utilization promotion by facilitating data entry into the federated database and creation of database incentive functionality. Our participating sites include MGH (PI), BWH, UCI, Duke, UCLA, UCSD, John Hopkins, and newly added Washington University and MIT. We have made a concerted effort to bridge the gap that can exist between biomedical and computational sciences by recruiting to our group leaders in both of these domains. Our efforts will be coordinated with those of the entire BIRN consortium in order to insure that acquisition and database functionality, and application-based disorder queries are interoperable across sites and designed to advance the capabilities to further knowledge and understanding of health and disease.         n/a",Morphometry Biomedical Informatics Research Network,7078667,U24RR021382,"['bioimaging /biomedical imaging', 'bioinformatics', 'clinical research', 'computational biology', 'computer data analysis', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'cooperative study', 'data management', 'human subject', 'imaging /visualization /scanning', 'information systems', 'magnetic resonance imaging', 'method development', 'molecular biology information system', 'morphometry', 'neurogenetics', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychology']",NCRR,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,U24,2006,5010926,-0.000697994820661271

Curated databases are expensive to create and maintain; do not estimate confidence of assertions; and do not allow for divergence of opinions. Information extraction (IE) methods can be used to partially overcome these limitations by automatically extracting certain types of information from biomedical text.       In most genres of scientific publication, the most important results in a paper are illustrated in non-textual forms, such as images and graphs. The broad thesis underlying our proposed research is that one can provide better access to the information in online scientific publications by extracting information jointly from figure images and their accompanying captions. With the exception of certain previous work by the Murphy group, previous biomedical IE systems have not attempted to extract information from image data, only text.      This proposal addresses these issues in the specific context of fluorescence microscope images depicting the subcellular localization of proteins. This goal is consonant with a major focus of current biomedical research: the identification of expressed genes and the description of the proteins they encode. Motivated by recent large-scale projects which major focus of current biomedical research is the identification of expressed genes and the description (or annotation) of the proteins they encode, the Murphy group has developed automated systems for recognizing subcellular structures in 2D and 3D images. Automated image analysis techniques have also been applied to images harvested from online biomedical journal articles. This system will be extended to create a robust, comprehensive toolset for extracting, verifying and querying biologically relevant information from the text and images found in online journals. Based on this toolkit, a set of tools will be developed for aiding researchers to identify and locate information found in online journals. Upon completion of the proposed training, the candidate will be well placed to take a leadership position in machine learning applications to the range of experimental methods used in biomedical research.               n/a",Understanding Figures & Captions for Location Proteomics,7033080,K25DA017357,"['bioengineering /biomedical engineering', 'bioinformatics', 'computational biology', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'fluorescence microscopy', 'gene expression', 'image processing', 'online computer', 'protein localization', 'proteomics', 'publications', 'training']",NIDA,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,K25,2006,133459,0.0410085697254484
"A Biomedical Natural Language Processing Resource DESCRIPTION:    The long-term aim of this project is to advance clinical care and biomedical research by establishing a natural language processing (NLP) resource for the biomedical community. A major bottleneck for development of automated tools for clinical applications and biomedical research is that most of the data and knowledge occur in the form of text, resulting in a lack of coded data. This NLP resource will make possible a host of automated applications by enabling high throughput access to coded biomedical knowledge and data. The foundation of this resource will be the MedLEE NLP system, which has been used operationally for almost a decade in healthcare settings for a broad range of applications that have proven to be valuable for clinical care. The NLP resource will also include BioMedLEE (a derivative of MedLEE), which encodes genotypic-phenotypic (GP) relations in the scientific literature. It currently focuses on GP relations associated with cancer and infectious diseases, and is being used to organize the extracted information to facilitate research, curation, and ontological development within model organism databases. This proposal will enable us to 1) disseminate our NLP resource to the community, 2) conduct technological research and development (R&D) to facilitate expansion and adaptation of the resource to new applications and specialties, 3) conduct R&D of tools that facilitate use of the extracted data and knowledge after coding, and 4) promote the resource, and provide service to users in the form of technical support, documentation, and tutorials. MedLEE and BioMedLEE are extendable systems that encompass the clinical and scientific communities. The dissemination of a proven NLP system that is applicable to the entire biomedical community provides an exceptional opportunity for multiple developers and researchers to work to unleash the true potential of NLP technology, increasing development of applications that aim to enhance scientific research and improve all levels of health. n/a",A Biomedical Natural Language Processing Resource,6899974,R01LM008635,"['artificial intelligence', 'automated medical record system', 'bioinformatics', 'biomedical automation', 'biomedical resource', 'clinical research', 'computer assisted patient care', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'data management', 'health science research', 'high throughput technology', 'human data']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2005,515359,-0.009133652166027973
"Technology Development for a MolBio Knowledge-Base   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Since the introduction of the Mycin system more than 25 years ago, it has widely been hypothesized that extensive, well-represented computer knowledge-bases will facilitate a wide variety of scientific and clinical tasks. Driven by growing knowledge-management challenges arising from the proliferation of high throughput instrumentation, recently created knowledge-bases in areas related to genomics and related aspects of contemporary biology, such as the Gene Ontology, EcoCyc and PharmGKB, have begun to become integrated into the laboratory practices of a growing number of molecular biologists. However, these successful molecular biology knowledge-bases (MBKBs) have two drawbacks which impede their more general application: each has been narrowed to a particular special purpose, either in its domain of applicability or in the scope of knowledge represented, and each of these knowledge-bases was constructed largely on the basis of enormous human effort. Given the current state of molecular biology data and recent advances in database integration and information extraction technology, we proposed to test the following hypothesis: Current computational technology and existing human-curated knowledge resources are sufficient to build an extensive, high-quality computational knowledge-base of molecular biology. To test this hypothesis we propose to first create tools which can (a) automatically link incommensurate knowledge sources using semantic linking, and (b) use natural language processing techniques to extract new information from NCBrs GeneRIFs and from the GO definitions fields; and second, to evaluate the results of these methods by carefully quantifying the degree to which the induced linkages and extracted assertions are complete, consistent and correct. Although we propose to construct a broad and rich knowledge-base in order to develop and test the adequacy of largely automated methods to leverage existing human-curated collections, we do not propose to build a comprehensive MBKB.            n/a",Technology Development for a MolBio Knowledge-Base,6953701,R01LM008111,"['artificial intelligence', 'bioinformatics', 'biomedical automation', 'computational biology', 'computer program /software', 'functional /structural genomics', 'information retrieval', 'molecular biology information system', 'technology /technique development']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R01,2005,613495,0.021945247783972718
"BioMediator: Biologic Data Integration& Analysis System DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    The broad long-term objectives of this proposal are to collaborate with a group of biology researchers with real world needs to develop and distribute a general-purpose system (BioMediator) to permit integration and analysis of diverse types of biologic data. BioMediator will combine information from a variety of different public and private sources (e.g. experimental data) to help answer biologic questions. BioMediator builds on the foundations laid by the currently funded GeneSeek data integration system. The GeneSeek system was originally developed to query only public domain data sources (both structured and semi-structured) to assist in the curation of the GeneClinics genetic testing knowledge base. The specific aims leading to the development of the BioMediator system are: 1) Interface to additional public domain biological data sources (e.g. pathway databases, function databases). 2) Incorporate access to private databases of experimental results (e.g. proteomics and expression array data). 3) Extend model to include analytic tools operating across distributed biological data sources (e.g. across a set of both proteomic and expression array data). 4) Evolve centralized BioMediator system into a model peer to peer data sharing and analysis system. 5) Distribute and maintain BioMediator production software as a resource for the biological community. The health relatedness of the project is that biologists seeking to understand the molecular basis of human health and disease are struggling with large and increasing volumes of diverse data (mutation, expression array, proteomic) that need to be brought together (integrated) and analyzed in order to develop and test hypotheses about disease mechanisms and normal physiology. The research design is to develop BioMediator by combining and leverage recent developments in a) the domain of open source analytic tools for biologic data and b) ongoing theoretical and applied research by members of the current GeneSeek research team on both general purpose and biologic data integration systems. The methods are:  a) to use an iterative rapid prototyping software development model evaluated in a real-world test bed and b) to expand the existing GeneSeek research team (with expertise in informatics, computer science, and software development) to include biological expertise (four biologists forming a biology working group) and biostatistics expertise. The goal is to ensure the BioMediator system 1) meets the needs of a group of end users acquiring, integrating and analyzing diverse biologic data sets, 2) does so in a scaleable and expandable manner drawing on the latest theoretical developments in data analysis and integration. n/a",BioMediator: Biologic Data Integration& Analysis System,6946761,R01HG002288,"['artificial intelligence', 'bioengineering /biomedical engineering', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'data collection methodology /evaluation', 'information retrieval', 'molecular biology information system']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2005,100000,0.007489556355775515
"Visual Data Extraction and Conversion Programming Tool  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In recent decades, biomedical researchers are facing a new challenge that grows exponentially. The challenge is how to handle the large volume of biological data automatically generated by various whole-cell study methods such as genomics, microarrays, and proteomics. These new methods provide enormous opportunities for rapid advances in biomedical research and medicine because they allow scientists to study living beings in a global scale with greater speed. However, analyzing the data generated by these new methods can be a daunting task and often requires the development of specialized data extraction and conversion computer programs. Because only a few scientists are well trained both in life sciences and computer science, there exists a bottleneck between the great research opportunities these volume data can provide us, and the actual advances scientists can achieve from using them.   In this project, we propose to develop an auto-programming tool for biomedical scientists to help them handle the large amount of data in their research. This tool will observe the visual extraction and conversion of sample data by users via a graphical user interlace, i.e., through the point, click and drag operations familiar to most computer users. After that, it will be able to automatically generate computer programs that can carry out the same data extraction and conversion tasks for its users, on any new data. That is to say, by seeing a few examples of a user's data extraction and conversion needs, this tool can automatically turn that into computer solutions. Using this tool will be easy and will not require any sophisticated computer science training because it does the programming job for its users automatically.   This tool can have the broadest applicability in all biomedical research areas where textual format data are generated and processed with computational technologies. Therefore, this tool will provide great enabling power to biomedical scientists to help them make rapid advances in biomedical research and medicine.   n/a",Visual Data Extraction and Conversion Programming Tool,6929696,R33GM066400,"['artificial intelligence', 'automated data processing', 'biomedical resource', 'computer data analysis', 'computer human interaction', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'data management', 'information retrieval']",NIGMS,IOWA STATE UNIVERSITY,R33,2005,206378,0.02381792574360014
"Information Integration of Heterogeneous Data Sources    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this proposal is to develop an information integration architecture and associated tools to support rapid integration of data and knowledge from distributed heterogeneous data sources. The architecture aims to play a significant role in extracting coherent knowledge bases for biomedical research and improving the accuracy, completeness and quality of the extracted knowledge. Towards achieving these goals, the proposed scalable architecture includes new innovative generalized integration algorithms and tools for the generation of mediators to capture the functional behavior of data sources, semantic representation of data sources to support automated generation of integration agents, and optimization of integrated data queries. The information integration architecture keeps pace with the evolving Internet-based XML electronic data interchange, semantic web services, and web services discovery standards. Thus, leveraging the Internet technologies and standards for the purpose of providing lasting state-of-the-art solutions for information integration. In addition, the proposed architecture is inherently scalable in terms of the number of data sources that can be integrated, the number of users of the integrated system, and the range of biomedical problems that can be tackled. During phase I of the project, prototypes of the proposed integration algorithms and tools will be developed as proofs of concept and to form the foundation for evaluation and pilot testing of the proposed integration mechanisms, using private and public data sources, in terms of scalability and integration capabilities.         n/a",Information Integration of Heterogeneous Data Sources,6881960,R43RR018667,"['artificial intelligence', 'computer data analysis', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'data collection methodology /evaluation', 'information retrieval', 'information system analysis', 'information systems', 'mathematics']",NCRR,"INFOTECH SOFT, INC.",R43,2005,260661,0.021035345689459268
"Nurse Practitioner Access to Genetics Health Literature    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This training proposal describes a research plan which tests the application of a computer science solution to a clinical problem encountered by nurse practitioners (NPs). As our understanding of genetics health increases, NPs will need to provide care and create health promotion regimens mindful of each client's genetic profile. Access to the rapidly developing genetics health literature is critical for this practice model, but may be difficult, because existing search methods lead to many irrelevant results, and may retrieve the proper result only when precise keywords are used. The NP searching for information that would guide her practice may be forced to make a decision with less than complete or current information. This proposal outlines three studies, which investigate how the semantic web concepts of linking related ideas and terms can improve NPs' access to the genetics health literature. Study 1 explores NPs' genetics health information needs. Study 2 tests the applicability of existing ontologies (terminologies coupled with machine-readable statements about the meanings and relationships of the terms) to nursing. Study 3 tests a prototype intelligent agent employing ontology to retrieve literature relevant to NPs' genetics health information needs.         n/a",Nurse Practitioner Access to Genetics Health Literature,6955060,F37LM008636,"['artificial intelligence', 'clinical research', 'genetics', 'human subject', 'informatics', 'information retrieval', 'nurse practitioners', 'patient care management', 'predoctoral investigator', 'publications', 'semantics', 'young adult human (21-34)']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN MADISON,F37,2005,39150,0.003178744866283544
"Linking Information, Families and Technology (LIFT) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): KIT Solutions, a private firm specializing in developing intelligent, Knowledge-based Information Technology (KIT) solutions for the field of health and human services will partner with the University of Pittsburgh, Office of Child Development (OCD) to develop a Web-based, interactive software application of a Family Support Management Information System (FS MIS) for nationwide dissemination. This innovation is called Linking Information, Families and Technology (LIFT).  Family support centers, like other human service programs and agencies across the country, are being required to implement best practices and document the impact of their services to funders, policy makers, and the community. However, most family centers do not have a state-of-the-art web-based information system available to them that integrates best practice, expert knowledge, and daily management functions. The proposed LIFT system will address these critical needs and has great potential for nationwide commercial distribution. The combination of KIT'S proven record of developing knowledge based information technology and OCD's over 20 years of research and practice in family support services will greatly enhances the chance of success for this business venture. In Phase I of the project, we will produce prototype software demonstrating the benefit, usability, and feasibility of a web-based, interactive, intelligent system for use by family support centers across the nation. The extent of which LIFT enables family center staff to build skill, capacity, access information and expert knowledge, to enhance their work will be the focus of this phase. In Phase II, we will fully develop the prototype LIFT to a commercial grade web application for nationwide dissemination and further validate the commercial potential and impact of LIFT, using a quasiexperimental design, which will involve a large number of users across multiple sites. In Phase III, we will seek private funding for marketing the system to the national market. We intend to use the Microsoft.Net Platform and follow XML web service concepts to develop the proposed innovation.

"Multi-Agent Collaboration for AMD Subtype Classification  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the most common cause of blindness in developed countries and as such represents a very significant public health problem a number of specific genes, and the discovery, characterization, and eventual therapeutic control of these genes represent major goals of the vision research community. Although the strategies for gene discovery have become very powerful in recent years, there remains a major obstacle to the discovery of genes that underlie common, late-onset diseases like AMD. That obstacle is that clinicians cannot reliably sort patients with different molecular subtypes of late-onset disease into sufficiently homogeneous groups. The purpose of this project is to use the power of multi-agent systems computer technology in a novel way to aid clinicians in the collaborative development of a robust classification system based upon the ophthalmoscopic features of AMD. The result of this project will contribute to an NIH's Innovations in Biomedical Information and Science and Technology Program goal of speeding the progress of biomedical research through the development tools for electronic collaboration that will have impact on broader areas of biomedical research.   We hypothesize that a multi-agent approach to this problem will result in a classification system with greater reproducibility and discriminative power than a system developed by clinicians without such computer assistance. The availability of populations of AMD patients with lower molecular complexity will significantly increase the power of statistical techniques for AMD gene discovery. In addition to this immediate and specific benefit, the strategies we will develop during this project for objectively interfacing medical experts with each other as well as with computers will have applications in the search for other late-onset disease genes as well as in the development of multi-center and multidisciplinary clinical trials of new therapeutic approaches. The proposed system, the Intelligent Distributed Ontology Consensus system (IDOCS) goes beyond conventional groupware by addressing drawbacks to direct, synchronous interaction by providing an autonomously coordinated, asynchronous interaction and collaboration platform among clinicians through their representative intelligent agents.

"CREATION AND APPLICATION OF A DIABETES KNOWLEDGE BASE CREATION AND APPLICATION OF A DIABETES KNOWLEDGE BASE   The applicant is an Instructor in Pediatrics at Harvard Medical School and an associate in bioinformatics and pediatric endocrinology at Children's Hospital, Boston. The applicant completed an NLM-funded fellowship in informatics and received a Masters Degree in Medical Informatics from MIT. Since completing his fellowship less than two years ago, he has first-authored six publications, co-authored eight publications, senior authored two publications, and co-authored a book on microarray analysis. The applicant plans to pursue a career in basic research in diabetes genomics and bioinformatics, with a joint appointment in both an academic pediatric endocrinology department and a medical informatics program. The mentor is Dr. Isaac Kohane, director of the Children's Hospital Informatics Program with a staff of 20 including 10 faculty and extensive computational resources, funded through several NIH grants.       The past 10 years have led to a variety of measurements tools in molecular biology that are near comprehensive in nature. For example, RNA expression detection microarrays can provide systematic quantitative information on the expression of over 40,000 unique RNAs within cells. Yet microarrays are just one of at least 30 large-scale measurement or experimental modalities available to investigators in molecular biology. We see scientific value in being able to integrate multiple large-scale data sets from all biological modalities to address biomedical questions that could otherwise not be answered. We recognize that the full agenda of working out the details for all possible inferential processes between all near-comprehensive modalities is too large. The goal of this project is to serve as a model automated system for gathering data related to particular experimental characteristic and perform inferential operators on these data. For this application, we are focusing on a pragmatic subset. Specifically, we propose intersecting near comprehensive data sets by phenotype, and intersecting lists of significant and related genes within these data sets in an automated manner.      The central hypothesis for this application is that integrating large-scale data sets across measurement  modalities is a synergistic process to create new knowledge and testable hypothesis in the area of diabetes, and inferential processes involving intersection across genes can be automated. n/a",CREATION AND APPLICATION OF A DIABETES KNOWLEDGE BASE,7125331,K22LM008261,"['RNA interference', 'adipocytes', 'artificial intelligence', 'automated data processing', 'cell differentiation', 'clinical research', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'diabetes mellitus genetics', 'human data', 'information systems', 'insulin sensitivity /resistance', 'noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus', 'obesity', 'phenotype', 'quantitative trait loci', 'vocabulary', 'weight gain']",NLM,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K22,2005,152083,0.0071509900416768715
"Automated Knowledge Extraction for Biomedical Literature DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     It is becoming increasingly difficult for biologists to keep pace with information being published within their own fields, let alone biology as a whole. The ability to rapidly access specific and current biomedical information as well as to quickly gain an overview of current knowledge in a given field is becoming more difficult while at the same time more important. Traditional methods of keeping up with advances are therefore becoming inadequate.      Here we propose to continue to develop our Medstract Project to apply recent advances in the computational analysis of text to organize and structure the biological literature. The Medstract project will reduce the time required for biomedical researchers to find information of interest and should facilitate the development of new research insights.  This project is the result of a unique collaboration between a computational linguistics lab at Brandeis University and a molecular biology lab at Tufts University School of Medicine. Previously we have developed an extensive set of tools for analyzing and processing biomedical text. We have used these tools to develop databases of biomedical acronyms, inhibitors, regulators, and interactors from Medline abstracts and have made these available on the web. These resources are currently used by hundreds of investigators every day. In addition we have generated and made available gold standard markup files for several biological terms and relations for use as testing standards by other groups developing knowledge extraction engines for the biomedical domain.      Here we propose to extend and enhance our current Medstract databases as well to generate new databases using the tools that we have developed. New databases will include protein modifications, domains and motifs, and tissue and cellular localization information. In addition, we will use the bio-relation databases as the foundation for constructing a system allowing point-to-point regulatory pathway identification. We will enhance the robustness of these databases by utilizing algorithms that we have developed for rerendering the semantic ontologies for the biomedical lexicon.

"Computational Approaches to Disease Causes and Treatment DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The State University of New York at Buffalo has assembled a multi-disciplinary team of investigators to plan and establish a National Program of Excellence in Biomedical Computing. The overall theme of the center is ""Novel Data Mining Algorithms for Applications in Genomics"" with a focus on the development of novel techniques for storing, managing, analyzing, modeling and visualizing multi-dimensional data sets. We intend to provide the expertise and infrastructure that will merge the research activities of computational and biomedical scientists. The focus of the proposed research is the study of common diseases, such as cancer, multiple sclerosis and coronary artery disease in which the underlying causes are multi-factorial. In this new paradigm, we will use advanced computational techniques and approaches to convert raw genomic data into knowledge that will advance the understanding of these common diseases and potentially identify new modalities of treatment. The Center will play a critical role in fostering multidisciplinary collaborations between faculty from the Departments of Computer Science and Engineering, Biology, Chemistry, Pharmaceutical Science and various departments in the School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences. By co-locating biomedical and computer scientists, common understanding of research approaches will result in the development of computational tools that will meet the real-life needs of the biomedical researchers to help advance their projects. The Center will provide a broad range of educational and training activities for individuals who wish to pursue a career focusing on computational biology and bioinformatics. The focus of the education program will be the interdisciplinary training of computer science and engineering students who wish to pursue research in functional genomics and other biomedical areas, and the cross training of biomedically oriented students in topics with more of a computing orientation. We have identified three development projects that provide unique scientific opportunities to integrate the expertise of mathematicians, statisticians, and computer scientists with medical scientists, and to investigate novel computational approaches. These computational related projects are: 1. Data integration and data mining of clinical data and genomic data to advance clinical and epidemiological genetics as well as drug effect studies; 2. Pharmacodynamic analysis of drug-responsive gene expression changes; and 3. Chemi-genetic approaches to mapping regulatory pathways. These research projects will be supported by three core resources: genomics core, computational core, and clinical core. The common nature of these applications is that they all generate multidimensional data sets with numerical, functional or symbolic attributes. The management, retrieval and visualization of these data sets and analyses is likely to prove to be a rate limiting factor for new biomedical discoveries and the development of techniques for the effective analyses of genomic datasets is a critical step for the medical applications of bioinformatics. n/a",Computational Approaches to Disease Causes and Treatment,6931476,P20GM067650,"['animal tissue', 'artificial intelligence', 'bioinformatics', 'computational biology', 'computer data analysis', 'computer human interaction', 'computer simulation', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'data management', 'disease /disorder etiology', 'epidemiology', 'functional /structural genomics', 'gene expression', 'human subject', 'interdisciplinary collaboration', 'mathematical model', 'pharmacokinetics', 'science education', 'statistics /biometry', 'technology /technique development', 'therapy', 'training']",NIGMS,STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK AT BUFFALO,P20,2005,392500,-0.003631744501696905
"Extracting Semantic Knowledge from Clinical Data Sources DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Electronic medical record systems (EMR) contain a wealth of clinical data that is invaluable for biomedical research, but because there are no satisfactory methods to build coherent specialized knowledge bases, which represent the information in free text medical records, data mining and clinical discovery are held back. Medical Reporting Solutions, Inc. has developed advanced technology, which we propose to extend, refine, and test for constructing specialized semantic knowledge bases. These knowledge bases will encode the clinical information in medical reports, and enable automated natural language processing systems for extracting clinical knowledge.      Our research and development uses methods in corpus linguistics and sentential logic to represent the knowledge in free-text medical reports in an efficient, codeable manner. We have created tools to map sentences in a medical domain to unique codeable propositions. Our method for creating knowledge ontologies makes it easy for biomedical researchers to get semantic information at the appropriate level of detail. The knowledge base and mapping tables allow us to analyze medical reports in near real-time. One knowledge base, under development, is derived from hundreds of thousands of reports in the radiology domain, and we intend to analyze other medical domains using the methods we have pioneered.      Our phase one project plan includes further improving our knowledge editing tools, substantially enlarging our semantic knowledge base to cover over 60-70% of the radiology domain, and extensively test our knowledge representation schema against actual radiology reports. We plan to make the knowledge base freely accessible to the biomedical research community, while providing commercial services to codify free text reports found in EMRs. n/a",Extracting Semantic Knowledge from Clinical Data Sources,6988908,R43LM008974,"['automated medical record system', 'clinical research', 'computer data analysis', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'human data', 'informatics', 'information retrieval']",NLM,"LOGICAL SEMANTICS, INC.",R43,2005,100000,-0.0033481705184690096
"The RPI Exploratory Center for Cheminformatics(RMI) The purpose of this Exploratory Center for Cheminformatics Research (ECCR) P20 planning grant is to develop a mechanism for bringing together and stimulating collaborative pilot projects among a constantly-evolving nucleus of experts in Cheminformatics-related fields ranging from methods of encoding and capturing molecular information, to machine learning and data mining techniques, to predictive model development, validation, interpretation and utilization. In addition to these research efforts, the Center will bring together a set of domain specialists and application scientists who will serve as both data generators and end users of the knowledge provided by the molecular property models and modeling methods developed during the course of the grant. This group will also test the new Cheminformatics software that will constitute a tangible, deliverable product from this work. Ten application project modules that exemplify possible interactions between various groups and areas of expertise within the Center are presented as part of this proposal. The unifying vision behind the proposed Center is that much of what is done in each of the subdisciplines represented here can be expressed in a Cheminformatics context: The many diverse project areas can be grouped into one or more overlapping categories: ""Data Generators"" (those who use either theoretical or experimental methods for creating or extracting knowledge), ""Machine Learning and Datamining"" groups (who perform model validation, feature selection, pattern recognition, generation of potentials of mean force and knowledge-based potential work), as well as ""Property-Prediction"" groups (who perform chemically-aware model building, molecular property descriptor generation, Quantitative Structure-Property Relationship modeling, validation, and interpretation), and ""Application"" groups who utilize the information made available using the new tools and methods that are developed as part of the Center. It is our strong belief that these areas of expertise can be brought together within this Planning Grant proposal to generate something larger than the sum of the parts. The Exploratory Center will seed new interdisciplinary projects and train graduate students in these areas.

"Neuroimaging Neuroinformatics Training Program    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal is in response to PAR-03-034 ""Neuroinformatics Institutional Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (K12)."" The overarching goal of this application is to provide an excellent postdoctoral training program in neuroimaging neuroinformatics that capitalizes on the many strengths of the existing neuroscientists, informatics and imaging resources that our combined resources represent. Our proposed Neuroimaging Neuroinformatics Training Program (NNTP) is based upon a number of important strategic alliances. The first cornerstone of this effort is the existing HBP grants held by Dr. Anders Dale (R01 NS39581: Cortical-Surface-Based Brain Imaging) and Dr. David Kennedy (R01 NS34189: Anatomic Morphologic Analysis of MR Brain Images). These efforts span a wealth of technological developments, research and clinical application areas in the rapidly developing area of quantitative morphometric image analysis. A second and vital cornerstone is our association with the Harvard-MIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology (HST) Biomedical Informatics Program. This existing pre- and post-graduate academic program, within a world class biomedical engineering department, is an ideal setting for the development of a coordinated training effort in Neuroinformatics. The established track record in training skilled scientists in areas of informatics will prove invaluable in this new initiative. The third cornerstone is the combined clinical research opportunities afforded by the Harvard-wide biomedical imaging resources. These include the MGH/MIT/HST Athinoula A. Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging, the Harvard Neuroimaging Center, the Surgical Planning Lab at Brigham and Women's Hospital, the Brain Morphology BIRN (Biomedical Informatics Research Network) and the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. Together, these active and vibrant programs provide for the best possible training opportunities in imaging science, computer science, clinical application areas, and cognitive neuroscience. A substantial and successful pool of internationally renowned mentors have agreed to participate in this program, and the combined resources provide the best possible exposure to all neuroimaging procedures and insure the capability to draw the highest caliber trainees. A plan for recruiting, selecting and monitoring trainees is proposed.

"RESEARCH DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA-- RELIABILITY AND VALIDITY DESCRIPTION: (adapted from the applicant?s abstract): Temporomandibular disorders (TMD) are common problems in the general population. The Research Diagnostic Criteria (RDC) for TMD were developed to establish specific operationalized examination procedures and diagnostic criteria for 8 Axis I biomedical diagnoses of TMD, as well as Axis II biobehavioral assessment procedures. Procedural reliability testing has been established for the RDC Axis I examination items, but full acceptance of the RDC requires confirmation of the temporal stability, validity, generalizability and clinical utility of the examination items, biomedical diagnoses, biobehavioral assessments, and general protocol. In order to accomplish these overall goals, a multi-center project is proposed that will first reassess at the University of Minnesota the reliability of 6 examiners (2 examiners each from 3 participating universities) to collect clinical Axis I examination data using the RDC operational definitions. In a second step, reliable blinded examiners will collect clinical examination data and formulate RDC diagnoses, which will be compared to criterion diagnoses made by an expert imaging. New clinical exam items will also be assessed. Subject to expert consensus, they will be added to yield a final exam protocol that will include all current RDC examination items as well as the new items. With this new protocol, the 6 examiners will continue examining normal and TMD subjects at their respective centers in order to test the temporal stability and diagnostic validity of the new and existing examination items, patient history items, and TMJ imaging by plain film and MRI. Discriminant analyses and decision tree analyses will be used to determine the best diagnostic algorithms for rendering RDC diagnoses. Masticatory muscle biopsies and TMJ synovial fluid will be collected from subjects at the University of Minnesota to evaluate biological markers for their role as potential mediators underlying the biomedical diagnoses. Simultaneously, Axis II biobehavioral assessment procedures will be tested for temporal reliability, compared with other accepted self-report instruments for concurrent validity, and, at two centers, evaluated for criterion validity against highly structured psychiatric interviews. The clinical and health services utility of adding Axis II biobehavioral assessments, imaging and biopsy results to Axis I clinical examination findings will be appraised. Advancement in our understanding of the prevalence, etiologies, natural progression, and treatment of TMD is dependent on having reliable and valid diagnostic criteria for these disorders. n/a",RESEARCH DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA-- RELIABILITY AND VALIDITY,6901098,U01DE013331,"['biomarker', 'biopsy', 'clinical research', 'diagnosis design /evaluation', 'diagnosis quality /standard', 'enzyme linked immunosorbent assay', 'facial muscles', 'gas chromatography mass spectrometry', 'human subject', 'inflammation', 'interview', 'magnetic resonance imaging', 'mastication', 'musculoskeletal disorder diagnosis', 'oral facial pain', 'pain threshold', 'psychobiology', 'questionnaires', 'radioimmunoassay', 'sign /symptom', 'statistics /biometry', 'synovial fluid', 'temporomandibular joint syndrome', 'tissue /cell culture']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA TWIN CITIES,U01,2005,1520994,0.0068783396327240995
"Nation Center: Multi-Scale Study- Cellular Networks(RMI)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  A network of molecular interactions, involving many thousands of genes, their products, and other molecules, underlie cellular processes. Investigation of these interactions across a wide range of scales ranging from the formation/activation of transcriptional complexes, to the availability of a signaling pathway, all the way to macroscopic processes, such as cell adhesion, calls for a new level of sophistication in the design of genome- wide computational approaches. A homogeneous environment for the comprehensive mapping and analysis of molecular cellular interactions in would be a powerful resource for the biomedical research community. We propose the creation of a National Center for the Multiscale Analysis of Genomic and Cellular Networks (MAGNet). The Center will provide an integrative computational framework to organize molecular interactions in the cell into manageable context-dependent components and will develop interoperable computational models and tools that can leverage such a map of cellular interactions to elucidate important biological processes. Center activities will involve a significant, multidisciplinary effort of biological and computational sciences. Specific areas of expertise include natural language parsing (NLP), machine learning (ML), software systems and engineering, databases, computational structural biology, reverse engineering of genetic networks, biomedical literature datamining, and biomedical ontologies, among others. The Center will 1) construct an evidence integration framework to collect and fuse a variety of diverse cellular interaction clues based on their statistical relevance 2) assemble a comprehensive set of physics- and knowledge-based methodologies to fill this framework 3) provide a set of methodologies and filters, anchored in formal domain ontologies, to associated specific interactions to an organism, tissue, molecular, and cellular context. All relevant tools will be made accessible to the biomedical research community through a common, extensible, and interoperable software platform, geWorkbench. We will reach out to train and encourage researchers to use and/or develop new modules for, geWorkbench. An important element of the software platform will be the development of specific components that can exploit the evidence integration techniques developed by Core 9001 investigators to combine molecular interaction clues from Core 9002 algorithms and databases. Development will be both driven and tested by the biomedical community to ensure the usefulness of the tools and the usability of the graphical user interfaces to address biomedical problems in completely novel ways, to dissect the web of cellular interactions responsible for cellular processes and functions.         n/a",Nation Center: Multi-Scale Study- Cellular Networks(RMI),7012104,U54CA121852,"['bioinformatics', 'cell biology', 'computational biology', 'cooperative study', 'genome']",NCI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,U54,2005,3758967,0.032037535592949126
"Morphometry Biomedical Informatics Research Network    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Technological advances in imaging have revolutionized the biomedical investigation of illness. The tremendous potential that this methodology brings to advancing diagnostic and prognostic capabilities and in treatment of illnesses has as yet remained largely an unfulfilled promise. This potential has been limited by a number of technological impediments that could be in large part overcome by the availability of a federated imaging database and the attendant infrastructure. Specifically, the ability to conduct clinical imaging studies across multiple sites, to analyze imaging data with the most powerful software regardless of development site, and to test new hypotheses on large collections of subjects with well characterized image and clinical data would have a demonstrable and positive impact on progress in this field. The Morphometry BIRN (mBIRN), established in October 2001, has made substantial progress in the development of this national infrastructure to develop a data and computational network based on a federated data acquisition and database across seven sites in the service of facilitating multi-site neuroanatomic analysis. Standardized structural MRI image acquisition protocols have been developed and implemented that demonstrably reduce initial sources of inter-site variance. Data structure, transmission, storage and querying aspects of the federated database have been implemented. In this continuation of the mBIRN efforts, we propose three broad areas of work:   1) continuing structural MRI acquisition optimization, calibration and validation to include T2 and DTI; 2) translation of site specific state-of-the-art image analysis, visualization and machine learning technologies to work in the federated, multi-site BIRN environment; and 3) extension of data management and database query capabilities to include additional imaging modalities, clinical disorders and individualized human genetic covariates. These broad areas of work will come together in through key collaborations that will ensure utilization promotion by facilitating data entry into the federated database and creation of database incentive functionality. Our participating sites include MGH (PI), BWH, UCI, Duke, UCLA, UCSD, John Hopkins, and newly added Washington University and MIT. We have made a concerted effort to bridge the gap that can exist between biomedical and computational sciences by recruiting to our group leaders in both of these domains. Our efforts will be coordinated with those of the entire BIRN consortium in order to insure that acquisition and database functionality, and application-based disorder queries are interoperable across sites and designed to advance the capabilities to further knowledge and understanding of health and disease.         n/a",Morphometry Biomedical Informatics Research Network,6952714,U24RR021382,"['bioimaging /biomedical imaging', 'bioinformatics', 'clinical research', 'computational biology', 'computer data analysis', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'cooperative study', 'data management', 'human subject', 'imaging /visualization /scanning', 'information systems', 'magnetic resonance imaging', 'method development', 'molecular biology information system', 'morphometry', 'neurogenetics', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychology']",NCRR,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,U24,2005,5013536,-0.000697994820661271
"Understanding Figures & Captions for Location Proteomics    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     This proposal is for mentored training in the molecular biosciences of an established computer scientist. The training plan includes basic and advanced course work in modern biology, interactions with biological research groups, attendance at seminars and conferences, and laboratory training. Mentoring on the culture and practices of biomedical research will be provided by the sponsor. The training institution has a longstanding tradition of interdisciplinary research and specific expertise in cutting edge proteomics methods. The candidate will be fully committed to a combination of training and research. The research plan is based on the critical need to organize and summarize the knowledge in the vast biomedical literature. Curated databases are expensive to create and maintain; do not estimate confidence of assertions; and do not allow for divergence of opinions. Information extraction (IE) methods can be used to partially overcome these limitations by automatically extracting certain types of information from biomedical text.       In most genres of scientific publication, the most important results in a paper are illustrated in non-textual forms, such as images and graphs. The broad thesis underlying our proposed research is that one can provide better access to the information in online scientific publications by extracting information jointly from figure images and their accompanying captions. With the exception of certain previous work by the Murphy group, previous biomedical IE systems have not attempted to extract information from image data, only text.      This proposal addresses these issues in the specific context of fluorescence microscope images depicting the subcellular localization of proteins. This goal is consonant with a major focus of current biomedical research: the identification of expressed genes and the description of the proteins they encode. Motivated by recent large-scale projects which major focus of current biomedical research is the identification of expressed genes and the description (or annotation) of the proteins they encode, the Murphy group has developed automated systems for recognizing subcellular structures in 2D and 3D images. Automated image analysis techniques have also been applied to images harvested from online biomedical journal articles. This system will be extended to create a robust, comprehensive toolset for extracting, verifying and querying biologically relevant information from the text and images found in online journals. Based on this toolkit, a set of tools will be developed for aiding researchers to identify and locate information found in online journals. Upon completion of the proposed training, the candidate will be well placed to take a leadership position in machine learning applications to the range of experimental methods used in biomedical research.               n/a",Understanding Figures & Captions for Location Proteomics,6865478,K25DA017357,"['bioengineering /biomedical engineering', 'bioinformatics', 'computational biology', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'fluorescence microscopy', 'gene expression', 'image processing', 'online computer', 'protein localization', 'proteomics', 'publications', 'training']",NIDA,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,K25,2005,162750,0.0410085697254484
"Technology Development for a MolBio Knowledge-Base   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Since the introduction of the Mycin system more than 25 years ago, it has widely been hypothesized that extensive, well-represented computer knowledge-bases will facilitate a wide variety of scientific and clinical tasks. Driven by growing knowledge-management challenges arising from the proliferation of high throughput instrumentation, recently created knowledge-bases in areas related to genomics and related aspects of contemporary biology, such as the Gene Ontology, EcoCyc and PharmGKB, have begun to become integrated into the laboratory practices of a growing number of molecular biologists. However, these successful molecular biology knowledge-bases (MBKBs) have two drawbacks which impede their more general application: each has been narrowed to a particular special purpose, either in its domain of applicability or in the scope of knowledge represented, and each of these knowledge-bases was constructed largely on the basis of enormous human effort. Given the current state of molecular biology data and recent advances in database integration and information extraction technology, we proposed to test the following hypothesis: Current computational technology and existing human-curated knowledge resources are sufficient to build an extensive, high-quality computational knowledge-base of molecular biology. To test this hypothesis we propose to first create tools which can (a) automatically link incommensurate knowledge sources using semantic linking, and (b) use natural language processing techniques to extract new information from NCBrs GeneRIFs and from the GO definitions fields; and second, to evaluate the results of these methods by carefully quantifying the degree to which the induced linkages and extracted assertions are complete, consistent and correct. Although we propose to construct a broad and rich knowledge-base in order to develop and test the adequacy of largely automated methods to leverage existing human-curated collections, we do not propose to build a comprehensive MBKB.            n/a",Technology Development for a MolBio Knowledge-Base,6822280,R01LM008111,"['artificial intelligence', 'bioinformatics', 'biomedical automation', 'computational biology', 'computer program /software', 'functional /structural genomics', 'information retrieval', 'molecular biology information system', 'technology /technique development']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R01,2004,577307,0.021945247783972718
"BioMediator: Biologic Data Integration& Analysis System DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    The broad long-term objectives of this proposal are to collaborate with a group of biology researchers with real world needs to develop and distribute a general-purpose system (BioMediator) to permit integration and analysis of diverse types of biologic data. BioMediator will combine information from a variety of different public and private sources (e.g. experimental data) to help answer biologic questions. BioMediator builds on the foundations laid by the currently funded GeneSeek data integration system. The GeneSeek system was originally developed to query only public domain data sources (both structured and semi-structured) to assist in the curation of the GeneClinics genetic testing knowledge base. The specific aims leading to the development of the BioMediator system are: 1) Interface to additional public domain biological data sources (e.g. pathway databases, function databases). 2) Incorporate access to private databases of experimental results (e.g. proteomics and expression array data). 3) Extend model to include analytic tools operating across distributed biological data sources (e.g. across a set of both proteomic and expression array data). 4) Evolve centralized BioMediator system into a model peer to peer data sharing and analysis system. 5) Distribute and maintain BioMediator production software as a resource for the biological community. The health relatedness of the project is that biologists seeking to understand the molecular basis of human health and disease are struggling with large and increasing volumes of diverse data (mutation, expression array, proteomic) that need to be brought together (integrated) and analyzed in order to develop and test hypotheses about disease mechanisms and normal physiology. The research design is to develop BioMediator by combining and leverage recent developments in a) the domain of open source analytic tools for biologic data and b) ongoing theoretical and applied research by members of the current GeneSeek research team on both general purpose and biologic data integration systems. The methods are:  a) to use an iterative rapid prototyping software development model evaluated in a real-world test bed and b) to expand the existing GeneSeek research team (with expertise in informatics, computer science, and software development) to include biological expertise (four biologists forming a biology working group) and biostatistics expertise. The goal is to ensure the BioMediator system 1) meets the needs of a group of end users acquiring, integrating and analyzing diverse biologic data sets, 2) does so in a scaleable and expandable manner drawing on the latest theoretical developments in data analysis and integration. n/a",BioMediator: Biologic Data Integration& Analysis System,6805962,R01HG002288,"['artificial intelligence', 'bioengineering /biomedical engineering', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'data collection methodology /evaluation', 'information retrieval', 'molecular biology information system']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2004,100000,0.007489556355775515
"Nurse Practitioner Access to Genetics Health Literature    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This training proposal describes a research plan which tests the application of a computer science solution to a clinical problem encountered by nurse practitioners (NPs). As our understanding of genetics health increases, NPs will need to provide care and create health promotion regimens mindful of each client's genetic profile. Access to the rapidly developing genetics health literature is critical for this practice model, but may be difficult, because existing search methods lead to many irrelevant results, and may retrieve the proper result only when precise keywords are used. The NP searching for information that would guide her practice may be forced to make a decision with less than complete or current information. This proposal outlines three studies, which investigate how the semantic web concepts of linking related ideas and terms can improve NPs' access to the genetics health literature. Study 1 explores NPs' genetics health information needs. Study 2 tests the applicability of existing ontologies (terminologies coupled with machine-readable statements about the meanings and relationships of the terms) to nursing. Study 3 tests a prototype intelligent agent employing ontology to retrieve literature relevant to NPs' genetics health information needs.         n/a",Nurse Practitioner Access to Genetics Health Literature,6837265,F37LM008636,"['artificial intelligence', 'clinical research', 'genetics', 'human subject', 'informatics', 'information retrieval', 'nurse practitioners', 'patient care management', 'predoctoral investigator', 'publications', 'semantics', 'young adult human (21-34)']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN MADISON,F37,2004,38596,0.003178744866283544
"Visual Data Extraction and Conversion Programming Tool  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In recent decades, biomedical researchers are facing a new challenge that grows exponentially. The challenge is how to handle the large volume of biological data automatically generated by various whole-cell study methods such as genomics, microarrays, and proteomics. These new methods provide enormous opportunities for rapid advances in biomedical research and medicine because they allow scientists to study living beings in a global scale with greater speed. However, analyzing the data generated by these new methods can be a daunting task and often requires the development of specialized data extraction and conversion computer programs. Because only a few scientists are well trained both in life sciences and computer science, there exists a bottleneck between the great research opportunities these volume data can provide us, and the actual advances scientists can achieve from using them.   In this project, we propose to develop an auto-programming tool for biomedical scientists to help them handle the large amount of data in their research. This tool will observe the visual extraction and conversion of sample data by users via a graphical user interlace, i.e., through the point, click and drag operations familiar to most computer users. After that, it will be able to automatically generate computer programs that can carry out the same data extraction and conversion tasks for its users, on any new data. That is to say, by seeing a few examples of a user's data extraction and conversion needs, this tool can automatically turn that into computer solutions. Using this tool will be easy and will not require any sophisticated computer science training because it does the programming job for its users automatically.   This tool can have the broadest applicability in all biomedical research areas where textual format data are generated and processed with computational technologies. Therefore, this tool will provide great enabling power to biomedical scientists to help them make rapid advances in biomedical research and medicine.   n/a",Visual Data Extraction and Conversion Programming Tool,6783420,R33GM066400,"['artificial intelligence', 'automated data processing', 'biomedical resource', 'computer data analysis', 'computer human interaction', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'data management', 'information retrieval']",NIGMS,IOWA STATE UNIVERSITY,R33,2004,200515,0.02381792574360014
"Multi-Agent Collaboration for AMD Subtype Classification  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the most common cause of blindness in developed countries and as such represents a very significant public health problem a number of specific genes, and the discovery, characterization, and eventual therapeutic control of these genes represent major goals of the vision research community. Although the strategies for gene discovery have become very powerful in recent years, there remains a major obstacle to the discovery of genes that underlie common, late-onset diseases like AMD. That obstacle is that clinicians cannot reliably sort patients with different molecular subtypes of late-onset disease into sufficiently homogeneous groups. The purpose of this project is to use the power of multi-agent systems computer technology in a novel way to aid clinicians in the collaborative development of a robust classification system based upon the ophthalmoscopic features of AMD. The result of this project will contribute to an NIH's Innovations in Biomedical Information and Science and Technology Program goal of speeding the progress of biomedical research through the development tools for electronic collaboration that will have impact on broader areas of biomedical research.   We hypothesize that a multi-agent approach to this problem will result in a classification system with greater reproducibility and discriminative power than a system developed by clinicians without such computer assistance. The availability of populations of AMD patients with lower molecular complexity will significantly increase the power of statistical techniques for AMD gene discovery. In addition to this immediate and specific benefit, the strategies we will develop during this project for objectively interfacing medical experts with each other as well as with computers will have applications in the search for other late-onset disease genes as well as in the development of multi-center and multidisciplinary clinical trials of new therapeutic approaches. The proposed system, the Intelligent Distributed Ontology Consensus system (IDOCS) goes beyond conventional groupware by addressing drawbacks to direct, synchronous interaction by providing an autonomously coordinated, asynchronous interaction and collaboration platform among clinicians through their representative intelligent agents.

"Automated Knowledge Extraction for Biomedical Literature DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     It is becoming increasingly difficult for biologists to keep pace with information being published within their own fields, let alone biology as a whole. The ability to rapidly access specific and current biomedical information as well as to quickly gain an overview of current knowledge in a given field is becoming more difficult while at the same time more important. Traditional methods of keeping up with advances are therefore becoming inadequate.      Here we propose to continue to develop our Medstract Project to apply recent advances in the computational analysis of text to organize and structure the biological literature. The Medstract project will reduce the time required for biomedical researchers to find information of interest and should facilitate the development of new research insights.  This project is the result of a unique collaboration between a computational linguistics lab at Brandeis University and a molecular biology lab at Tufts University School of Medicine. Previously we have developed an extensive set of tools for analyzing and processing biomedical text. We have used these tools to develop databases of biomedical acronyms, inhibitors, regulators, and interactors from Medline abstracts and have made these available on the web. These resources are currently used by hundreds of investigators every day. In addition we have generated and made available gold standard markup files for several biological terms and relations for use as testing standards by other groups developing knowledge extraction engines for the biomedical domain.      Here we propose to extend and enhance our current Medstract databases as well to generate new databases using the tools that we have developed. New databases will include protein modifications, domains and motifs, and tissue and cellular localization information. In addition, we will use the bio-relation databases as the foundation for constructing a system allowing point-to-point regulatory pathway identification. We will enhance the robustness of these databases by utilizing algorithms that we have developed for rerendering the semantic ontologies for the biomedical lexicon.

"Computational Approaches to Disease Causes and Treatment DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The State University of New York at Buffalo has assembled a multi-disciplinary team of investigators to plan and establish a National Program of Excellence in Biomedical Computing. The overall theme of the center is ""Novel Data Mining Algorithms for Applications in Genomics"" with a focus on the development of novel techniques for storing, managing, analyzing, modeling and visualizing multi-dimensional data sets. We intend to provide the expertise and infrastructure that will merge the research activities of computational and biomedical scientists. The focus of the proposed research is the study of common diseases, such as cancer, multiple sclerosis and coronary artery disease in which the underlying causes are multi-factorial. In this new paradigm, we will use advanced computational techniques and approaches to convert raw genomic data into knowledge that will advance the understanding of these common diseases and potentially identify new modalities of treatment. The Center will play a critical role in fostering multidisciplinary collaborations between faculty from the Departments of Computer Science and Engineering, Biology, Chemistry, Pharmaceutical Science and various departments in the School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences. By co-locating biomedical and computer scientists, common understanding of research approaches will result in the development of computational tools that will meet the real-life needs of the biomedical researchers to help advance their projects. The Center will provide a broad range of educational and training activities for individuals who wish to pursue a career focusing on computational biology and bioinformatics. The focus of the education program will be the interdisciplinary training of computer science and engineering students who wish to pursue research in functional genomics and other biomedical areas, and the cross training of biomedically oriented students in topics with more of a computing orientation. We have identified three development projects that provide unique scientific opportunities to integrate the expertise of mathematicians, statisticians, and computer scientists with medical scientists, and to investigate novel computational approaches. These computational related projects are: 1. Data integration and data mining of clinical data and genomic data to advance clinical and epidemiological genetics as well as drug effect studies; 2. Pharmacodynamic analysis of drug-responsive gene expression changes; and 3. Chemi-genetic approaches to mapping regulatory pathways. These research projects will be supported by three core resources: genomics core, computational core, and clinical core. The common nature of these applications is that they all generate multidimensional data sets with numerical, functional or symbolic attributes. The management, retrieval and visualization of these data sets and analyses is likely to prove to be a rate limiting factor for new biomedical discoveries and the development of techniques for the effective analyses of genomic datasets is a critical step for the medical applications of bioinformatics. n/a",Computational Approaches to Disease Causes and Treatment,6787778,P20GM067650,"['animal tissue', 'artificial intelligence', 'bioinformatics', 'computational biology', 'computer data analysis', 'computer human interaction', 'computer simulation', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'data management', 'disease /disorder etiology', 'epidemiology', 'functional /structural genomics', 'gene expression', 'human subject', 'interdisciplinary collaboration', 'mathematical model', 'pharmacokinetics', 'science education', 'statistics /biometry', 'technology /technique development', 'therapy', 'training']",NIGMS,STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK AT BUFFALO,P20,2004,392500,-0.003631744501696905

"RESEARCH DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA-- RELIABILITY AND VALIDITY DESCRIPTION: (adapted from the applicant?s abstract): Temporomandibular disorders (TMD) are common problems in the general population. The Research Diagnostic Criteria (RDC) for TMD were developed to establish specific operationalized examination procedures and diagnostic criteria for 8 Axis I biomedical diagnoses of TMD, as well as Axis II biobehavioral assessment procedures. Procedural reliability testing has been established for the RDC Axis I examination items, but full acceptance of the RDC requires confirmation of the temporal stability, validity, generalizability and clinical utility of the examination items, biomedical diagnoses, biobehavioral assessments, and general protocol. In order to accomplish these overall goals, a multi-center project is proposed that will first reassess at the University of Minnesota the reliability of 6 examiners (2 examiners each from 3 participating universities) to collect clinical Axis I examination data using the RDC operational definitions. In a second step, reliable blinded examiners will collect clinical examination data and formulate RDC diagnoses, which will be compared to criterion diagnoses made by an expert imaging. New clinical exam items will also be assessed. Subject to expert consensus, they will be added to yield a final exam protocol that will include all current RDC examination items as well as the new items. With this new protocol, the 6 examiners will continue examining normal and TMD subjects at their respective centers in order to test the temporal stability and diagnostic validity of the new and existing examination items, patient history items, and TMJ imaging by plain film and MRI. Discriminant analyses and decision tree analyses will be used to determine the best diagnostic algorithms for rendering RDC diagnoses. Masticatory muscle biopsies and TMJ synovial fluid will be collected from subjects at the University of Minnesota to evaluate biological markers for their role as potential mediators underlying the biomedical diagnoses. Simultaneously, Axis II biobehavioral assessment procedures will be tested for temporal reliability, compared with other accepted self-report instruments for concurrent validity, and, at two centers, evaluated for criterion validity against highly structured psychiatric interviews. The clinical and health services utility of adding Axis II biobehavioral assessments, imaging and biopsy results to Axis I clinical examination findings will be appraised. Advancement in our understanding of the prevalence, etiologies, natural progression, and treatment of TMD is dependent on having reliable and valid diagnostic criteria for these disorders. n/a",RESEARCH DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA-- RELIABILITY AND VALIDITY,6773915,U01DE013331,"['biomarker', 'biopsy', 'clinical research', 'diagnosis design /evaluation', 'diagnosis quality /standard', 'enzyme linked immunosorbent assay', 'facial muscles', 'gas chromatography mass spectrometry', 'human subject', 'inflammation', 'interview', 'magnetic resonance imaging', 'mastication', 'musculoskeletal disorder diagnosis', 'oral facial pain', 'pain threshold', 'psychobiology', 'questionnaires', 'radioimmunoassay', 'sign /symptom', 'statistics /biometry', 'synovial fluid', 'temporomandibular joint syndrome', 'tissue /cell culture']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA TWIN CITIES,U01,2004,1637046,0.0068783396327240995
"Access to distributed de-identified imaging data DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    The widespread adoption of picture archiving and communications systems (PACS) in radiology and the implementation and deployment of the DICOM communication standard represent an opportunity to link multiple PACS at multiple sites into a distributed data warehouse of great potential utility for investigators in oncology research and epidemiology. Where the federal HIPAA privacy regulations have largely been seen as an emerging impediment to oncology research from the creation, management and use of cancer registries to large-scale retrospective studies addressing rarer forms of neoplasia, in fact the digital nature of PACS-based imaging data lends itself to automated de-identification that could transform multiple distributed clinical information systems into a readily accessible treasure trove of research data that falls within the ""safe harbor"" provisions of HIPAA's privacy regulations. Our firm has developed a platform, originally intended for clinical use, to securely link multiple PACS and RIS from multiple vendors beneath a web interface giving users transparent access to a ""virtual archive"" spanning an arbitrary number of institutions. In this Phase I SBIR application, we propose to explore the feasibility of extending our system to grant researchers access to large volumes of dynamically de-identified imaging data while surmounting each of the major criticisms of the viability of such data for research purposes. We propose developing an open web-services architecture that will enable straightforward integration with any other information system and propose a design that adheres to existing industry standards while laying the groundwork for compliance with future standards and informatics initiatives. This study will also involve examining the regulation of re-identification through the use of threshold cryptography, as well as the feasibility of a probabilistic sampling search engine intended to prevent unauthorized identification of patients through multiple intersecting queries on narrowing criteria, while still permitting researchers to choose the appropriate resolving power of the engine to suit a particular investigation. These studies will include benchmarking the performance of these dynamic processes, quantifying the load they place on live clinical information systems, and optimizing the design to minimize such impact. Should feasibility be demonstrated, Phase II would involve a proof-of-concept demonstration across multiple academic medical institutions as well as steps to prepare for commercialization including indexing studies based on structured reporting and natural language processing, content-based information retrieval, refinement and usability testing of the web interfaces, and extension of the system to permit IRB-approved research on individually-identifiable data. Commercialization is expected as subscription service not unlike current bioinformatics databases, granting investigators access to a large-scale, globally distributed data warehouse comprised of participating PACS-enabled medical centers. n/a",Access to distributed de-identified imaging data,6777517,R43EB000608,"['archives', 'clinical research', 'computer data analysis', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'confidentiality', 'data management', 'health care policy', 'health related legal', 'human data', 'imaging /visualization /scanning', 'information systems']",NIBIB,"HX TECHNOLOGIES, INC.",R43,2004,149200,0.0009650608535154143
"Morphometry Biomedical Informatics Research Network    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Technological advances in imaging have revolutionized the biomedical investigation of illness. The tremendous potential that this methodology brings to advancing diagnostic and prognostic capabilities and in treatment of illnesses has as yet remained largely an unfulfilled promise. This potential has been limited by a number of technological impediments that could be in large part overcome by the availability of a federated imaging database and the attendant infrastructure. Specifically, the ability to conduct clinical imaging studies across multiple sites, to analyze imaging data with the most powerful software regardless of development site, and to test new hypotheses on large collections of subjects with well characterized image and clinical data would have a demonstrable and positive impact on progress in this field. The Morphometry BIRN (mBIRN), established in October 2001, has made substantial progress in the development of this national infrastructure to develop a data and computational network based on a federated data acquisition and database across seven sites in the service of facilitating multi-site neuroanatomic analysis. Standardized structural MRI image acquisition protocols have been developed and implemented that demonstrably reduce initial sources of inter-site variance. Data structure, transmission, storage and querying aspects of the federated database have been implemented. In this continuation of the mBIRN efforts, we propose three broad areas of work:   1) continuing structural MRI acquisition optimization, calibration and validation to include T2 and DTI; 2) translation of site specific state-of-the-art image analysis, visualization and machine learning technologies to work in the federated, multi-site BIRN environment; and 3) extension of data management and database query capabilities to include additional imaging modalities, clinical disorders and individualized human genetic covariates. These broad areas of work will come together in through key collaborations that will ensure utilization promotion by facilitating data entry into the federated database and creation of database incentive functionality. Our participating sites include MGH (PI), BWH, UCI, Duke, UCLA, UCSD, John Hopkins, and newly added Washington University and MIT. We have made a concerted effort to bridge the gap that can exist between biomedical and computational sciences by recruiting to our group leaders in both of these domains. Our efforts will be coordinated with those of the entire BIRN consortium in order to insure that acquisition and database functionality, and application-based disorder queries are interoperable across sites and designed to advance the capabilities to further knowledge and understanding of health and disease.         n/a",Morphometry Biomedical Informatics Research Network,6909355,U24RR021382,"['bioimaging /biomedical imaging', 'bioinformatics', 'clinical research', 'computational biology', 'computer data analysis', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'cooperative study', 'data management', 'human subject', 'imaging /visualization /scanning', 'information systems', 'magnetic resonance imaging', 'method development', 'molecular biology information system', 'morphometry', 'neurogenetics', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychology']",NCRR,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,U24,2004,3821536,-0.000697994820661271
"Understanding Figures & Captions for Location Proteomics    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     This proposal is for mentored training in the molecular biosciences of an established computer scientist. The training plan includes basic and advanced course work in modern biology, interactions with biological research groups, attendance at seminars and conferences, and laboratory training. Mentoring on the culture and practices of biomedical research will be provided by the sponsor. The training institution has a longstanding tradition of interdisciplinary research and specific expertise in cutting edge proteomics methods. The candidate will be fully committed to a combination of training and research. The research plan is based on the critical need to organize and summarize the knowledge in the vast biomedical literature. Curated databases are expensive to create and maintain; do not estimate confidence of assertions; and do not allow for divergence of opinions. Information extraction (IE) methods can be used to partially overcome these limitations by automatically extracting certain types of information from biomedical text.       In most genres of scientific publication, the most important results in a paper are illustrated in non-textual forms, such as images and graphs. The broad thesis underlying our proposed research is that one can provide better access to the information in online scientific publications by extracting information jointly from figure images and their accompanying captions. With the exception of certain previous work by the Murphy group, previous biomedical IE systems have not attempted to extract information from image data, only text.      This proposal addresses these issues in the specific context of fluorescence microscope images depicting the subcellular localization of proteins. This goal is consonant with a major focus of current biomedical research: the identification of expressed genes and the description of the proteins they encode. Motivated by recent large-scale projects which major focus of current biomedical research is the identification of expressed genes and the description (or annotation) of the proteins they encode, the Murphy group has developed automated systems for recognizing subcellular structures in 2D and 3D images. Automated image analysis techniques have also been applied to images harvested from online biomedical journal articles. This system will be extended to create a robust, comprehensive toolset for extracting, verifying and querying biologically relevant information from the text and images found in online journals. Based on this toolkit, a set of tools will be developed for aiding researchers to identify and locate information found in online journals. Upon completion of the proposed training, the candidate will be well placed to take a leadership position in machine learning applications to the range of experimental methods used in biomedical research.               n/a",Understanding Figures & Captions for Location Proteomics,6709988,K25DA017357,"['bioengineering /biomedical engineering', 'bioinformatics', 'computational biology', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'fluorescence microscopy', 'gene expression', 'image processing', 'online computer', 'protein localization', 'proteomics', 'publications', 'training']",NIDA,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,K25,2004,161668,0.0410085697254484
"BioMediator: Biologic Data Integration & Analysis System DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    The broad long-term objectives of this proposal are to collaborate with a group of biology researchers with real world needs to develop and distribute a general-purpose system (BioMediator) to permit integration and analysis of diverse types of biologic data. BioMediator will combine information from a variety of different public and private sources (e.g. experimental data) to help answer biologic questions. BioMediator builds on the foundations laid by the currently funded GeneSeek data integration system. The GeneSeek system was originally developed to query only public domain data sources (both structured and semi-structured) to assist in the curation of the GeneClinics genetic testing knowledge base. The specific aims leading to the development of the BioMediator system are: 1) Interface to additional public domain biological data sources (e.g. pathway databases, function databases). 2) Incorporate access to private databases of experimental results (e.g. proteomics and expression array data). 3) Extend model to include analytic tools operating across distributed biological data sources (e.g. across a set of both proteomic and expression array data). 4) Evolve centralized BioMediator system into a model peer to peer data sharing and analysis system. 5) Distribute and maintain BioMediator production software as a resource for the biological community. The health relatedness of the project is that biologists seeking to understand the molecular basis of human health and disease are struggling with large and increasing volumes of diverse data (mutation, expression array, proteomic) that need to be brought together (integrated) and analyzed in order to develop and test hypotheses about disease mechanisms and normal physiology. The research design is to develop BioMediator by combining and leverage recent developments in a) the domain of open source analytic tools for biologic data and b) ongoing theoretical and applied research by members of the current GeneSeek research team on both general purpose and biologic data integration systems. The methods are:  a) to use an iterative rapid prototyping software development model evaluated in a real-world test bed and b) to expand the existing GeneSeek research team (with expertise in informatics, computer science, and software development) to include biological expertise (four biologists forming a biology working group) and biostatistics expertise. The goal is to ensure the BioMediator system 1) meets the needs of a group of end users acquiring, integrating and analyzing diverse biologic data sets, 2) does so in a scaleable and expandable manner drawing on the latest theoretical developments in data analysis and integration. n/a",BioMediator: Biologic Data Integration & Analysis System,6681249,R01HG002288,"['artificial intelligence', ' bioengineering /biomedical engineering', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' data collection methodology /evaluation', ' information retrieval', ' molecular biology information system']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2003,100000,0.007489556355775515
"Visual Data Extraction and Conversion Programming Tool  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In recent decades, biomedical researchers are facing a new challenge that grows exponentially. The challenge is how to handle the large volume of biological data automatically generated by various whole-cell study methods such as genomics, microarrays, and proteomics. These new methods provide enormous opportunities for rapid advances in biomedical research and medicine because they allow scientists to study living beings in a global scale with greater speed. However, analyzing the data generated by these new methods can be a daunting task and often requires the development of specialized data extraction and conversion computer programs. Because only a few scientists are well trained both in life sciences and computer science, there exists a bottleneck between the great research opportunities these volume data can provide us, and the actual advances scientists can achieve from using them.   In this project, we propose to develop an auto-programming tool for biomedical scientists to help them handle the large amount of data in their research. This tool will observe the visual extraction and conversion of sample data by users via a graphical user interlace, i.e., through the point, click and drag operations familiar to most computer users. After that, it will be able to automatically generate computer programs that can carry out the same data extraction and conversion tasks for its users, on any new data. That is to say, by seeing a few examples of a user's data extraction and conversion needs, this tool can automatically turn that into computer solutions. Using this tool will be easy and will not require any sophisticated computer science training because it does the programming job for its users automatically.   This tool can have the broadest applicability in all biomedical research areas where textual format data are generated and processed with computational technologies. Therefore, this tool will provide great enabling power to biomedical scientists to help them make rapid advances in biomedical research and medicine.   n/a",Visual Data Extraction and Conversion Programming Tool,6658916,R33GM066400,"['artificial intelligence', ' automated data processing', ' biomedical resource', ' computer data analysis', ' computer human interaction', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' data management', ' information retrieval']",NIGMS,IOWA STATE UNIVERSITY,R33,2003,200824,0.02381792574360014
"AUTOMATED KNOWLEDGE EXTRACTION FOR BIOMEDICAL LITERATURE It is becoming increasingly difficult for biologists to keep pace with           information being published within their own fields, let alone biology           as a whole. The ability to rapidly access specific and current                   biomedical information as well as to quickly gain an overview of current         knowledge in a given field is becoming more difficult while at the same          time more important. Traditional methods of keeping up with advances are         therefore becoming inadequate.                                                                                                                                    This project will involve a unique collaboration between a computational         linguist at Brandeis University and two biologists at Tufts University           School of Medicine. We propose to make use of recent advances in the             computational analysis of text to organize and summarize the biological          literature. Building on our previous language technology research at             Brandeis, we propose to integrate the domain knowledge of the National           Library of Medicine's Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) with                Brandeis' semantic lexicon, CoreLex, toward the development of                   normalized structured representations of the semantic content of                 abstracts in the Medline database. These data structures, called lexical         webs, accelerate the availability of information in a richly hyperlinked         index that facilitates rapid navigation and information access.                  Automated analysis of biological abstracts will be combined with                 information derived from sequence databases to provide an up-to-date and         comprehensive database of information regarding known genes and                  proteins. The results of this analysis will be used to construct a web           accessible database organized on a gene-by-gene basis.                                                                                                            Other unique aspects of this database will be the visualization of               motifs and features extracted from Medline abstracts through the                 generation of annotated structure-function maps of proteins and genes,           and the construction of gene-specific semantic indexes to the relevant           biological literature.

"Multi-Agent Collaboration for AMD Subtype Classification  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the most common cause of blindness in developed countries and as such represents a very significant public health problem a number of specific genes, and the discovery, characterization, and eventual therapeutic control of these genes represent major goals of the vision research community. Although the strategies for gene discovery have become very powerful in recent years, there remains a major obstacle to the discovery of genes that underlie common, late-onset diseases like AMD. That obstacle is that clinicians cannot reliably sort patients with different molecular subtypes of late-onset disease into sufficiently homogeneous groups. The purpose of this project is to use the power of multi-agent systems computer technology in a novel way to aid clinicians in the collaborative development of a robust classification system based upon the ophthalmoscopic features of AMD. The result of this project will contribute to an NIH's Innovations in Biomedical Information and Science and Technology Program goal of speeding the progress of biomedical research through the development tools for electronic collaboration that will have impact on broader areas of biomedical research.   We hypothesize that a multi-agent approach to this problem will result in a classification system with greater reproducibility and discriminative power than a system developed by clinicians without such computer assistance. The availability of populations of AMD patients with lower molecular complexity will significantly increase the power of statistical techniques for AMD gene discovery. In addition to this immediate and specific benefit, the strategies we will develop during this project for objectively interfacing medical experts with each other as well as with computers will have applications in the search for other late-onset disease genes as well as in the development of multi-center and multidisciplinary clinical trials of new therapeutic approaches. The proposed system, the Intelligent Distributed Ontology Consensus system (IDOCS) goes beyond conventional groupware by addressing drawbacks to direct, synchronous interaction by providing an autonomously coordinated, asynchronous interaction and collaboration platform among clinicians through their representative intelligent agents.

We intend to provide the expertise and infrastructure that will merge the research activities of computational and biomedical scientists. The focus of the proposed research is the study of common diseases, such as cancer, multiple sclerosis and coronary artery disease in which the underlying causes are multi-factorial. In this new paradigm, we will use advanced computational techniques and approaches to convert raw genomic data into knowledge that will advance the understanding of these common diseases and potentially identify new modalities of treatment. The Center will play a critical role in fostering multidisciplinary collaborations between faculty from the Departments of Computer Science and Engineering, Biology, Chemistry, Pharmaceutical Science and various departments in the School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences. By co-locating biomedical and computer scientists, common understanding of research approaches will result in the development of computational tools that will meet the real-life needs of the biomedical researchers to help advance their projects. The Center will provide a broad range of educational and training activities for individuals who wish to pursue a career focusing on computational biology and bioinformatics. The focus of the education program will be the interdisciplinary training of computer science and engineering students who wish to pursue research in functional genomics and other biomedical areas, and the cross training of biomedically oriented students in topics with more of a computing orientation. We have identified three development projects that provide unique scientific opportunities to integrate the expertise of mathematicians, statisticians, and computer scientists with medical scientists, and to investigate novel computational approaches. These computational related projects are: 1. Data integration and data mining of clinical data and genomic data to advance clinical and epidemiological genetics as well as drug effect studies; 2. Pharmacodynamic analysis of drug-responsive gene expression changes; and 3. Chemi-genetic approaches to mapping regulatory pathways. These research projects will be supported by three core resources: genomics core, computational core, and clinical core. The common nature of these applications is that they all generate multidimensional data sets with numerical, functional or symbolic attributes. The management, retrieval and visualization of these data sets and analyses is likely to prove to be a rate limiting factor for new biomedical discoveries and the development of techniques for the effective analyses of genomic datasets is a critical step for the medical applications of bioinformatics. n/a",Computational Approaches to Disease Causes and Treatment,6690235,P20GM067650,"['animal tissue', ' artificial intelligence', ' computer data analysis', ' computer human interaction', ' computer simulation', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' data management', ' disease /disorder etiology', ' epidemiology', ' functional /structural genomics', ' gene expression', ' human subject', ' informatics', ' interdisciplinary collaboration', ' mathematical model', ' pharmacokinetics', ' science education', ' statistics /biometry', ' technology /technique development', ' therapy', ' training']",NIGMS,STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK AT BUFFALO,P20,2003,392500,-0.003631744501696905

"RESEARCH DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA-- RELIABILITY AND VALIDITY DESCRIPTION: (adapted from the applicant?s abstract): Temporomandibular disorders (TMD) are common problems in the general population. The Research Diagnostic Criteria (RDC) for TMD were developed to establish specific operationalized examination procedures and diagnostic criteria for 8 Axis I biomedical diagnoses of TMD, as well as Axis II biobehavioral assessment procedures. Procedural reliability testing has been established for the RDC Axis I examination items, but full acceptance of the RDC requires confirmation of the temporal stability, validity, generalizability and clinical utility of the examination items, biomedical diagnoses, biobehavioral assessments, and general protocol. In order to accomplish these overall goals, a multi-center project is proposed that will first reassess at the University of Minnesota the reliability of 6 examiners (2 examiners each from 3 participating universities) to collect clinical Axis I examination data using the RDC operational definitions. In a second step, reliable blinded examiners will collect clinical examination data and formulate RDC diagnoses, which will be compared to criterion diagnoses made by an expert imaging. New clinical exam items will also be assessed. Subject to expert consensus, they will be added to yield a final exam protocol that will include all current RDC examination items as well as the new items. With this new protocol, the 6 examiners will continue examining normal and TMD subjects at their respective centers in order to test the temporal stability and diagnostic validity of the new and existing examination items, patient history items, and TMJ imaging by plain film and MRI. Discriminant analyses and decision tree analyses will be used to determine the best diagnostic algorithms for rendering RDC diagnoses. Masticatory muscle biopsies and TMJ synovial fluid will be collected from subjects at the University of Minnesota to evaluate biological markers for their role as potential mediators underlying the biomedical diagnoses. Simultaneously, Axis II biobehavioral assessment procedures will be tested for temporal reliability, compared with other accepted self-report instruments for concurrent validity, and, at two centers, evaluated for criterion validity against highly structured psychiatric interviews. The clinical and health services utility of adding Axis II biobehavioral assessments, imaging and biopsy results to Axis I clinical examination findings will be appraised. Advancement in our understanding of the prevalence, etiologies, natural progression, and treatment of TMD is dependent on having reliable and valid diagnostic criteria for these disorders. n/a",RESEARCH DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA-- RELIABILITY AND VALIDITY,6640921,U01DE013331,"['biomarker', ' biopsy', ' clinical research', ' diagnosis design /evaluation', ' diagnosis quality /standard', ' enzyme linked immunosorbent assay', ' facial muscles', ' gas chromatography mass spectrometry', ' human subject', ' inflammation', ' interview', ' magnetic resonance imaging', ' mastication', ' musculoskeletal disorder diagnosis', ' oral facial pain', ' pain threshold', ' psychobiology', ' questionnaires', ' radioimmunoassay', ' sign /symptom', ' statistics /biometry', ' synovial fluid', ' temporomandibular joint syndrome', ' tissue /cell culture']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA TWIN CITIES,U01,2003,1388868,0.0068783396327240995

"Access to distributed de-identified imaging data DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    The widespread adoption of picture archiving and communications systems (PACS) in radiology and the implementation and deployment of the DICOM communication standard represent an opportunity to link multiple PACS at multiple sites into a distributed data warehouse of great potential utility for investigators in oncology research and epidemiology. Where the federal HIPAA privacy regulations have largely been seen as an emerging impediment to oncology research from the creation, management and use of cancer registries to large-scale retrospective studies addressing rarer forms of neoplasia, in fact the digital nature of PACS-based imaging data lends itself to automated de-identification that could transform multiple distributed clinical information systems into a readily accessible treasure trove of research data that falls within the ""safe harbor"" provisions of HIPAA's privacy regulations. Our firm has developed a platform, originally intended for clinical use, to securely link multiple PACS and RIS from multiple vendors beneath a web interface giving users transparent access to a ""virtual archive"" spanning an arbitrary number of institutions. In this Phase I SBIR application, we propose to explore the feasibility of extending our system to grant researchers access to large volumes of dynamically de-identified imaging data while surmounting each of the major criticisms of the viability of such data for research purposes. We propose developing an open web-services architecture that will enable straightforward integration with any other information system and propose a design that adheres to existing industry standards while laying the groundwork for compliance with future standards and informatics initiatives. This study will also involve examining the regulation of re-identification through the use of threshold cryptography, as well as the feasibility of a probabilistic sampling search engine intended to prevent unauthorized identification of patients through multiple intersecting queries on narrowing criteria, while still permitting researchers to choose the appropriate resolving power of the engine to suit a particular investigation. These studies will include benchmarking the performance of these dynamic processes, quantifying the load they place on live clinical information systems, and optimizing the design to minimize such impact. Should feasibility be demonstrated, Phase II would involve a proof-of-concept demonstration across multiple academic medical institutions as well as steps to prepare for commercialization including indexing studies based on structured reporting and natural language processing, content-based information retrieval, refinement and usability testing of the web interfaces, and extension of the system to permit IRB-approved research on individually-identifiable data. Commercialization is expected as subscription service not unlike current bioinformatics databases, granting investigators access to a large-scale, globally distributed data warehouse comprised of participating PACS-enabled medical centers. n/a",Access to distributed de-identified imaging data,6694270,R43EB000608,"['archives', ' clinical research', ' computer data analysis', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' data management', ' health care policy', ' health related legal', ' human data', ' imaging /visualization /scanning', ' information systems']",NIBIB,"HX TECHNOLOGIES, INC.",R43,2003,250800,0.0009650608535154143
"DISCOVERING AND APPLYING KNOWLEDGE IN CLINICAL DATABASES A real-time clinical repository contains a wealth of detailed information useful for clinical care, research, and administration.  In their raw form, however, the data are difficult to use there is too much volume, too much detail, missing values, and inaccuracies. Clinicians, researchers, and administrators require higher level interpretations that address their questions. For example, a clinician may need to know whether a patient is at sufficient risk for having active tuberculosis to warrant respiratory isolation. The answer to the question may be spread around the clinical repository in chest radiographs, laboratory tests, medication histories, vital signs, and physician's notes. Translating from these raw data to the interpretation (at risk or not) is a difficult and laborious task. The hypothesis of this proposal is that data mining techniques can be applied to a real-time clinical repository to discover knowledge and generate accurate clinical interpretations, and that these interpretations can be automated. The project differs from earlier machine learning studies in its emphasis on a real clinical repository and the use of natural language processing to supply coded clinical data. The specific aims are: (l) Select clinical domains--Several clinical domains with interesting, non-trivial clinical problems will be selected. Problems for which a gold standard answer can or has been assembled for a retrospective cohort will be chosen. (2) Prepare raw clinical data for mining--The raw data from a clinical repository will be transformed into a structure that facilitates data mining. The data will be flattened, pivoted, summarized, and mapped as needed for the domains. Narrative data will be coded using the MedLEE natural language processor. The preparation process will be automated. (3) Use data mining algorithms to discover knowledge- Several data mining algorithms will be applied to the selected clinical domains. Algorithms will include decision tree generation, rule discovery, neural networks, nearest neighbor, logistic regression, and composite algorithms (for variable reduction). The algorithms will be trained on a training set for each domain, and their predictive accuracy will be measured and compared to each other and to expert-written rules. The performance of human experts writing rules using manual data mining visualization techniques (which does not require an explicit training set) will also be measured. (4) Study the dependence of data mining on the training set--The performance of data mining algorithms depends on the data used the train them. The sensitivity of the algorithms to noise (inaccurate data), missing data, and training set size will be measured. (5) Use the discovered knowledge to generate real-time interpretations-- The output of the algorithms (decision tree, rules, neural network equation, or logistic regression equation, but not nearest neighbor) along with the necessary data preparation steps will be encoded in Arden Syntax Medical Logic Modules. They will be run against the clinical repository to verify that the interpretation can be automated in real time. (6) Disseminate the methods and results--The methods and results will be disseminated via publications and a Web site, and tools will be made available.  n/a",DISCOVERING AND APPLYING KNOWLEDGE IN CLINICAL DATABASES,6538211,R01LM006910,"['Internet', ' artificial intelligence', ' clinical research', ' computer assisted medical decision making', ' computer assisted patient care', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' data collection methodology /evaluation', ' health care facility information system', ' human data', ' information dissemination', ' information system analysis', ' vocabulary development for information system']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2002,403006,-0.0055764400539336225
"GENESEEK: DATA INTEGRATION SYSTEM FOR GENETIC DATABASES The broad long-term objectives of this proposal are to create and evaluate an infrastructure (GeneSeek) to permit searching across heterogeneous source databases (genomic and citation databases) for relevant information needed for curation of an existing database of clinical knowledge (GeneClinics).  The Specific Aims are: 1) to use a novel, general purpose knowledge representation language to capture the schema of an existing database of clinical knowledge (GeneClinics genetic testing database), 2) to build a shared schema for mediating cross database queries, by extending the schema of GeneClinics and incorporating pertinent schema elements from other structured and semi-structured information sources, 3) to create and test interfaces to the targeted genetic information sources (databases and other structured information) from the shared query mediation schema, 4) to adapt the existing Tukwila data integration system to implement cross database query planning, query execution, and query result aggregation in the context of our shared query mediation schema and the multiple structured (genetic) information sources to create the GeneSeek data integration system, 5) to evaluate the performance of the Tukwila based GeneSeek data integration system and the shared data schema for precision and recall in finding relevant information for curation of a clinical database (GeneClinics genetic testing database). The broad health relatedness of the project is that data integration tools are needed to help clinicians apply the ever- growing body of medical information to patient care.  The tools are needed by curators of databases of medical knowledge as well as by the care providers themselves.  Nowhere is the growth in information more apparent than in the Human Genome project thus the choice of genetics as a domain to test this data integration system.  The specific genetics database whose curation the GeneSeek system will be evaluated against the GeneClinics database.  If successful these data integration systems could be more broadly applied to other domains in biomedicine.  The research design is to apply recent developments in data integration from the artificial intelligence and database areas of computer science to a real world clinical genetics data integration problem to evaluate the applicability of this system to biomedical information retrieval tasks.  The methods are to expand an existing collaboration between the current GeneClinics content and informatics teams and investigators in the Department of Computer science to: 1) enhance the Tukwila data integration architecture and its related CARIN knowledge representation language, and 2) to use these tools and the existing GeneClinics data model to implement and evaluate this data integration system in the specific domain of medical genetics.  n/a",GENESEEK: DATA INTEGRATION SYSTEM FOR GENETIC DATABASES,6526728,R01HG002288,"['artificial intelligence', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' data collection methodology /evaluation', ' experimental designs', ' information retrieval', ' molecular biology information system', ' vocabulary development for information system']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2002,372289,0.014933797647891059
"Visual Data Extraction and Conversion Programming Tool  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In recent decades, biomedical researchers are facing a new challenge that grows exponentially. The challenge is how to handle the large volume of biological data automatically generated by various whole-cell study methods such as genomics, microarrays, and proteomics. These new methods provide enormous opportunities for rapid advances in biomedical research and medicine because they allow scientists to study living beings in a global scale with greater speed. However, analyzing the data generated by these new methods can be a daunting task and often requires the development of specialized data extraction and conversion computer programs. Because only a few scientists are well trained both in life sciences and computer science, there exists a bottleneck between the great research opportunities these volume data can provide us, and the actual advances scientists can achieve from using them.   In this project, we propose to develop an auto-programming tool for biomedical scientists to help them handle the large amount of data in their research. This tool will observe the visual extraction and conversion of sample data by users via a graphical user interlace, i.e., through the point, click and drag operations familiar to most computer users. After that, it will be able to automatically generate computer programs that can carry out the same data extraction and conversion tasks for its users, on any new data. That is to say, by seeing a few examples of a user's data extraction and conversion needs, this tool can automatically turn that into computer solutions. Using this tool will be easy and will not require any sophisticated computer science training because it does the programming job for its users automatically.   This tool can have the broadest applicability in all biomedical research areas where textual format data are generated and processed with computational technologies. Therefore, this tool will provide great enabling power to biomedical scientists to help them make rapid advances in biomedical research and medicine.   n/a",Visual Data Extraction and Conversion Programming Tool,6549345,R21GM066400,"['artificial intelligence', ' automated data processing', ' biomedical resource', ' computer data analysis', ' computer human interaction', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' data management', ' information retrieval']",NIGMS,IOWA STATE UNIVERSITY,R21,2002,99510,0.02381792574360014
"Applying Usability to A Knowledge Based System A cancer genetics-tracking database will be redesigned using usability engineering techniques to improve the functionality and usability of the current system. This is important because it will lead to a system that is easier to use and learn, will decrease the chance of errors, and will increase productivity, and user satisfaction. The current state of informatics offers the potential for the creation of tools to assist in the reduction of medical errors. The redesign of this tracking database will be completed through a three-phase process. The first phase will use the results of a usability analysis to redesign and prototype the cancer genetics-tracking database. In the second phase, usability studies will then be conducted to ensure that the system is functional, easy to use, easy to learn, and meets the goals of the users. The usability studies will include heuristic evaluations, keystroke level models, talk-aloud methods, and cognitive walkthrough techniques. The system will be modified based upon the results of these studies. Research will be compiled on the advantages and disadvantages of ICD coding Vs. SNOMED followed by the selection of the most useful system for coding medical information. In the third phase the final redesign will be compared to the old system using a within-subject design to determine if the redesign decreases the error rate, increases productivity, and user satisfaction. This will be followed-up with a survey to determine the perceived usability of the redesigned application. Throughout the redesign process, specific usability guidelines will be developed for designing healthcare software that is computational and knowledge- based in nature.  n/a",Applying Usability to A Knowledge Based System,6538226,F38LM007188,"['artificial intelligence', ' cancer information system', ' cancer registry /resource', ' computer assisted medical decision making', ' computer human interaction', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' family genetics', ' human data', ' neoplasm /cancer genetics']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,F38,2002,66954,-0.015577144763574656

Subject to expert consensus, they will be added to yield a final exam protocol that will include all current RDC examination items as well as the new items. With this new protocol, the 6 examiners will continue examining normal and TMD subjects at their respective centers in order to test the temporal stability and diagnostic validity of the new and existing examination items, patient history items, and TMJ imaging by plain film and MRI. Discriminant analyses and decision tree analyses will be used to determine the best diagnostic algorithms for rendering RDC diagnoses. Masticatory muscle biopsies and TMJ synovial fluid will be collected from subjects at the University of Minnesota to evaluate biological markers for their role as potential mediators underlying the biomedical diagnoses. Simultaneously, Axis II biobehavioral assessment procedures will be tested for temporal reliability, compared with other accepted self-report instruments for concurrent validity, and, at two centers, evaluated for criterion validity against highly structured psychiatric interviews. The clinical and health services utility of adding Axis II biobehavioral assessments, imaging and biopsy results to Axis I clinical examination findings will be appraised. Advancement in our understanding of the prevalence, etiologies, natural progression, and treatment of TMD is dependent on having reliable and valid diagnostic criteria for these disorders. n/a",RESEARCH DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA-- RELIABILITY AND VALIDITY,6516567,U01DE013331,"['biomarker', ' biopsy', ' clinical research', ' diagnosis design /evaluation', ' diagnosis quality /standard', ' enzyme linked immunosorbent assay', ' facial muscles', ' gas chromatography mass spectrometry', ' human subject', ' inflammation', ' interview', ' magnetic resonance imaging', ' mastication', ' musculoskeletal disorder diagnosis', ' oral facial pain', ' pain threshold', ' psychobiology', ' questionnaires', ' radioimmunoassay', ' sign /symptom', ' statistics /biometry', ' synovial fluid', ' temporomandibular joint syndrome', ' tissue /cell culture']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA TWIN CITIES,U01,2002,1325497,0.0068783396327240995
"LANDMARK BASED METHODS FOR BIOMETRIC ANALYSIS OF SHAPE   DESCRIPTION (Adapted from Applicant's Abstract): Morphometric tools developed        under this grant combine techniques from geometry, computer vision, statistics,      and biomathematics in powerful new strategies for analysis of data about size        and shape. This fourth funding period is directed to three extensions of the         established core methodology, along with continued dissemination. Aim 1.             Thin-plate spline interpolant aids the scientist's eye in detecting                  localization of interesting shape differences. Over the present funding period       the applicants reported having developed an algebraic/statistical formalization      of this tactic, the method of creases. Aim 1 of the renewal is to standardize        the parameterization of this feature, to provide protocols for significance          tests, and to produce ""a grammar of grids"" for uniting multiple creases into         coherent summaries of empirical deformations. Aim 2. The standard Procrustes         methods for discrete point landmarks have been extended for data sets of             outlines. Aim 2 of the renewal is to further extend these tools for realistic        data sets that combine discrete point landmarks and curves or surfaces               arbitrarily. The applicants proposed to formalize statistical spaces for such        structures and extend them to anticipate the emerging resource of neural tract       directional data (directions without curves). Aim 3. The best current                strategies for formal statistical inferences about shape exploit permutation         tests of Procrustes distance or its modifications. Under new Aim 3, the              applicants proposed to combine this approach with spline-based high-pass or          low-pass filters and extend it further to support studies of correlations of         shape with other measurement sets, including other aspects of shape. Finally,        as it has been for the past twelve years, Aim 4 is to continue bringing all          these methodological developments to the attention of many different biomedical      communities, by primary scientific papers, essays on methodology per se,             videotapes, and software and documentation free over the Internet. The work          proposed is expected to extend to the medical imaging community's most               sophisticated data resources, carefully labeled images and volumes, a                state-of-the-art biometric toolkit for analysis and visualization carefully          tuned to the special needs of such data.                                                                                                                                  n/a",LANDMARK BASED METHODS FOR BIOMETRIC ANALYSIS OF SHAPE,6525584,R01GM037251,"['bioimaging /biomedical imaging', ' cardiovascular system', ' computer data analysis', ' computer program /software', ' computer simulation', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' craniofacial', ' human data', ' image processing', ' mathematical model', ' morphology', ' neuroanatomy', ' statistics /biometry']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2002,128860,-0.003946163549010695
"DISCOVERING AND APPLYING KNOWLEDGE IN CLINICAL DATABASES A real-time clinical repository contains a wealth of detailed information useful for clinical care, research, and administration.  In their raw form, however, the data are difficult to use there is too much volume, too much detail, missing values, and inaccuracies. Clinicians, researchers, and administrators require higher level interpretations that address their questions. For example, a clinician may need to know whether a patient is at sufficient risk for having active tuberculosis to warrant respiratory isolation. The answer to the question may be spread around the clinical repository in chest radiographs, laboratory tests, medication histories, vital signs, and physician's notes. Translating from these raw data to the interpretation (at risk or not) is a difficult and laborious task. The hypothesis of this proposal is that data mining techniques can be applied to a real-time clinical repository to discover knowledge and generate accurate clinical interpretations, and that these interpretations can be automated. The project differs from earlier machine learning studies in its emphasis on a real clinical repository and the use of natural language processing to supply coded clinical data. The specific aims are: (l) Select clinical domains--Several clinical domains with interesting, non-trivial clinical problems will be selected. Problems for which a gold standard answer can or has been assembled for a retrospective cohort will be chosen. (2) Prepare raw clinical data for mining--The raw data from a clinical repository will be transformed into a structure that facilitates data mining. The data will be flattened, pivoted, summarized, and mapped as needed for the domains. Narrative data will be coded using the MedLEE natural language processor. The preparation process will be automated. (3) Use data mining algorithms to discover knowledge- Several data mining algorithms will be applied to the selected clinical domains. Algorithms will include decision tree generation, rule discovery, neural networks, nearest neighbor, logistic regression, and composite algorithms (for variable reduction). The algorithms will be trained on a training set for each domain, and their predictive accuracy will be measured and compared to each other and to expert-written rules. The performance of human experts writing rules using manual data mining visualization techniques (which does not require an explicit training set) will also be measured. (4) Study the dependence of data mining on the training set--The performance of data mining algorithms depends on the data used the train them. The sensitivity of the algorithms to noise (inaccurate data), missing data, and training set size will be measured. (5) Use the discovered knowledge to generate real-time interpretations-- The output of the algorithms (decision tree, rules, neural network equation, or logistic regression equation, but not nearest neighbor) along with the necessary data preparation steps will be encoded in Arden Syntax Medical Logic Modules. They will be run against the clinical repository to verify that the interpretation can be automated in real time. (6) Disseminate the methods and results--The methods and results will be disseminated via publications and a Web site, and tools will be made available.  n/a",DISCOVERING AND APPLYING KNOWLEDGE IN CLINICAL DATABASES,6391286,R01LM006910,"['Internet', ' artificial intelligence', ' clinical research', ' computer assisted medical decision making', ' computer assisted patient care', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' data collection methodology /evaluation', ' health care facility information system', ' human data', ' information dissemination', ' information system analysis', ' vocabulary development for information system']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2001,396315,-0.0055764400539336225
"DATA MINING AND MODEL BUILDING IN MEDICAL INFORMATICS Our long-term goal is to assist biomedical scientists by extracting and          codifying new knowledge from large biomedical databases routinely by             computer. As large collections of data become more readily accessibly,           the opportunities for discovering new information increase. We propose           here to work toward this goal by extending our prior research on machine         learning in two important directions: (1) codification of disparate              pieces of knowledge into a coherent model (model building), and (2)              discovery of new information in medical databases (data mining).                                                                                                  Machine learning programs find classification rules (or decision trees           or networks) that separate members of a target class from other                  individuals. They have emphasized predictive accuracy, with some                 attention to tradeoffs between accuracy and cost of errors or between            accuracy and simplicity. We propose a framework in which these, and              other, tradeoffs are explicit and the criteria by which tradeoffs are            made are available for modification. We also include semantic                    considerations among the criteria to control the internal coherence of           models.                                                                                                                                                           ""Data mining"" is a recently-coined term for using computers to explore           large databases, with a goal of discovering new relationships but                usually with no specific target defined at the outset. In addition to            accuracy, simplicity, coherence, and cost, a program that purports to            discover new relationships must be able to assess novelty. We propose to         measure the extent to which proposed relationships are novel by                  comparing them against existing knowledge in the domain of discourse,            and to look for unusual rules (and other relations) that would be very           interesting if true.                                                                                                                                              The computer program we are primarily building on, RL, is a knowledge-           based learning program that learns classification rules from a                   collection of data. RL has been demonstrated to be flexible enough to            allow guidance from prior knowledge, and powerful enough to learn                publishable information for scientists working in several different              domains. Both parts of the research will requires extending the RL               system in new ways detailed in the research plan, which are consistent           with the overall design philosophy of the present system. We will                primarily work with data already collected on pneumonia patients with            with which we have considerable.

"GENESEEK: DATA INTEGRATION SYSTEM FOR GENETIC DATABASES The broad long-term objectives of this proposal are to create and evaluate an infrastructure (GeneSeek) to permit searching across heterogeneous source databases (genomic and citation databases) for relevant information needed for curation of an existing database of clinical knowledge (GeneClinics).  The Specific Aims are: 1) to use a novel, general purpose knowledge representation language to capture the schema of an existing database of clinical knowledge (GeneClinics genetic testing database), 2) to build a shared schema for mediating cross database queries, by extending the schema of GeneClinics and incorporating pertinent schema elements from other structured and semi-structured information sources, 3) to create and test interfaces to the targeted genetic information sources (databases and other structured information) from the shared query mediation schema, 4) to adapt the existing Tukwila data integration system to implement cross database query planning, query execution, and query result aggregation in the context of our shared query mediation schema and the multiple structured (genetic) information sources to create the GeneSeek data integration system, 5) to evaluate the performance of the Tukwila based GeneSeek data integration system and the shared data schema for precision and recall in finding relevant information for curation of a clinical database (GeneClinics genetic testing database). The broad health relatedness of the project is that data integration tools are needed to help clinicians apply the ever- growing body of medical information to patient care.  The tools are needed by curators of databases of medical knowledge as well as by the care providers themselves.  Nowhere is the growth in information more apparent than in the Human Genome project thus the choice of genetics as a domain to test this data integration system.  The specific genetics database whose curation the GeneSeek system will be evaluated against the GeneClinics database.  If successful these data integration systems could be more broadly applied to other domains in biomedicine.  The research design is to apply recent developments in data integration from the artificial intelligence and database areas of computer science to a real world clinical genetics data integration problem to evaluate the applicability of this system to biomedical information retrieval tasks.  The methods are to expand an existing collaboration between the current GeneClinics content and informatics teams and investigators in the Department of Computer science to: 1) enhance the Tukwila data integration architecture and its related CARIN knowledge representation language, and 2) to use these tools and the existing GeneClinics data model to implement and evaluate this data integration system in the specific domain of medical genetics.  n/a",GENESEEK: DATA INTEGRATION SYSTEM FOR GENETIC DATABASES,6388359,R01HG002288,"['artificial intelligence', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' data collection methodology /evaluation', ' experimental designs', ' information retrieval', ' molecular biology information system', ' vocabulary development for information system']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2001,362594,0.014933797647891059
"Applying Usability to A Knowledge Based System A cancer genetics-tracking database will be redesigned using usability engineering techniques to improve the functionality and usability of the current system. This is important because it will lead to a system that is easier to use and learn, will decrease the chance of errors, and will increase productivity, and user satisfaction. The current state of informatics offers the potential for the creation of tools to assist in the reduction of medical errors. The redesign of this tracking database will be completed through a three-phase process. The first phase will use the results of a usability analysis to redesign and prototype the cancer genetics-tracking database. In the second phase, usability studies will then be conducted to ensure that the system is functional, easy to use, easy to learn, and meets the goals of the users. The usability studies will include heuristic evaluations, keystroke level models, talk-aloud methods, and cognitive walkthrough techniques. The system will be modified based upon the results of these studies. Research will be compiled on the advantages and disadvantages of ICD coding Vs. SNOMED followed by the selection of the most useful system for coding medical information. In the third phase the final redesign will be compared to the old system using a within-subject design to determine if the redesign decreases the error rate, increases productivity, and user satisfaction. This will be followed-up with a survey to determine the perceived usability of the redesigned application. Throughout the redesign process, specific usability guidelines will be developed for designing healthcare software that is computational and knowledge- based in nature.  n/a",Applying Usability to A Knowledge Based System,6340157,F38LM007188,"['artificial intelligence', ' cancer information system', ' cancer registry /resource', ' computer assisted medical decision making', ' computer human interaction', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' family genetics', ' human data', ' neoplasm /cancer genetics']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,F38,2001,68753,-0.015577144763574656
"AUTOMATED KNOWLEDGE EXTRACTION FOR BIOMEDICAL LITERATURE It is becoming increasingly difficult for biologists to keep pace with           information being published within their own fields, let alone biology           as a whole. The ability to rapidly access specific and current                   biomedical information as well as to quickly gain an overview of current         knowledge in a given field is becoming more difficult while at the same          time more important. Traditional methods of keeping up with advances are         therefore becoming inadequate.                                                                                                                                    This project will involve a unique collaboration between a computational         linguist at Brandeis University and two biologists at Tufts University           School of Medicine. We propose to make use of recent advances in the             computational analysis of text to organize and summarize the biological          literature. Building on our previous language technology research at             Brandeis, we propose to integrate the domain knowledge of the National           Library of Medicine's Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) with                Brandeis' semantic lexicon, CoreLex, toward the development of                   normalized structured representations of the semantic content of                 abstracts in the Medline database. These data structures, called lexical         webs, accelerate the availability of information in a richly hyperlinked         index that facilitates rapid navigation and information access.                  Automated analysis of biological abstracts will be combined with                 information derived from sequence databases to provide an up-to-date and         comprehensive database of information regarding known genes and                  proteins. The results of this analysis will be used to construct a web           accessible database organized on a gene-by-gene basis.                                                                                                            Other unique aspects of this database will be the visualization of               motifs and features extracted from Medline abstracts through the                 generation of annotated structure-function maps of proteins and genes,           and the construction of gene-specific semantic indexes to the relevant           biological literature. This system, called MedStract, will reduce the            time required for biomedical researchers to find information of interest         and should facilitate the development of new research insights.                   n/a",AUTOMATED KNOWLEDGE EXTRACTION FOR BIOMEDICAL LITERATURE,6363593,R01LM006649,"['Internet', ' abstracting', ' artificial intelligence', ' computer assisted sequence analysis', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' informatics', ' information retrieval', ' information system analysis', ' molecular biology information system', ' nucleic acid sequence', ' protein sequence', ' semantics', ' syntax', ' vocabulary development for information system']",NLM,BRANDEIS UNIVERSITY,R01,2001,306158,0.021797365259794487

"RESEARCH DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA-- RELIABILITY AND VALIDITY DESCRIPTION: (adapted from the applicant?s abstract): Temporomandibular disorders (TMD) are common problems in the general population. The Research Diagnostic Criteria (RDC) for TMD were developed to establish specific operationalized examination procedures and diagnostic criteria for 8 Axis I biomedical diagnoses of TMD, as well as Axis II biobehavioral assessment procedures. Procedural reliability testing has been established for the RDC Axis I examination items, but full acceptance of the RDC requires confirmation of the temporal stability, validity, generalizability and clinical utility of the examination items, biomedical diagnoses, biobehavioral assessments, and general protocol. In order to accomplish these overall goals, a multi-center project is proposed that will first reassess at the University of Minnesota the reliability of 6 examiners (2 examiners each from 3 participating universities) to collect clinical Axis I examination data using the RDC operational definitions. In a second step, reliable blinded examiners will collect clinical examination data and formulate RDC diagnoses, which will be compared to criterion diagnoses made by an expert imaging. New clinical exam items will also be assessed. Subject to expert consensus, they will be added to yield a final exam protocol that will include all current RDC examination items as well as the new items. With this new protocol, the 6 examiners will continue examining normal and TMD subjects at their respective centers in order to test the temporal stability and diagnostic validity of the new and existing examination items, patient history items, and TMJ imaging by plain film and MRI. Discriminant analyses and decision tree analyses will be used to determine the best diagnostic algorithms for rendering RDC diagnoses. Masticatory muscle biopsies and TMJ synovial fluid will be collected from subjects at the University of Minnesota to evaluate biological markers for their role as potential mediators underlying the biomedical diagnoses. Simultaneously, Axis II biobehavioral assessment procedures will be tested for temporal reliability, compared with other accepted self-report instruments for concurrent validity, and, at two centers, evaluated for criterion validity against highly structured psychiatric interviews.

"LANDMARK BASED METHODS FOR BIOMETRIC ANALYSIS OF SHAPE   DESCRIPTION (Adapted from Applicant's Abstract): Morphometric tools developed        under this grant combine techniques from geometry, computer vision, statistics,      and biomathematics in powerful new strategies for analysis of data about size        and shape. This fourth funding period is directed to three extensions of the         established core methodology, along with continued dissemination. Aim 1.             Thin-plate spline interpolant aids the scientist's eye in detecting                  localization of interesting shape differences. Over the present funding period       the applicants reported having developed an algebraic/statistical formalization      of this tactic, the method of creases. Aim 1 of the renewal is to standardize        the parameterization of this feature, to provide protocols for significance          tests, and to produce ""a grammar of grids"" for uniting multiple creases into         coherent summaries of empirical deformations. Aim 2. The standard Procrustes         methods for discrete point landmarks have been extended for data sets of             outlines. Aim 2 of the renewal is to further extend these tools for realistic        data sets that combine discrete point landmarks and curves or surfaces               arbitrarily. The applicants proposed to formalize statistical spaces for such        structures and extend them to anticipate the emerging resource of neural tract       directional data (directions without curves). Aim 3. The best current                strategies for formal statistical inferences about shape exploit permutation         tests of Procrustes distance or its modifications. Under new Aim 3, the              applicants proposed to combine this approach with spline-based high-pass or          low-pass filters and extend it further to support studies of correlations of         shape with other measurement sets, including other aspects of shape. Finally,        as it has been for the past twelve years, Aim 4 is to continue bringing all          these methodological developments to the attention of many different biomedical      communities, by primary scientific papers, essays on methodology per se,             videotapes, and software and documentation free over the Internet. The work          proposed is expected to extend to the medical imaging community's most               sophisticated data resources, carefully labeled images and volumes, a                state-of-the-art biometric toolkit for analysis and visualization carefully          tuned to the special needs of such data.                                                                                                                                  n/a",LANDMARK BASED METHODS FOR BIOMETRIC ANALYSIS OF SHAPE,6385653,R01GM037251,"['bioimaging /biomedical imaging', ' cardiovascular system', ' computer data analysis', ' computer program /software', ' computer simulation', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' craniofacial', ' human data', ' image processing', ' mathematical model', ' morphology', ' neuroanatomy', ' statistics /biometry']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2001,127154,-0.003946163549010695
"DISCOVERING AND APPLYING KNOWLEDGE IN CLINICAL DATABASES A real-time clinical repository contains a wealth of detailed information useful for clinical care, research, and administration.  In their raw form, however, the data are difficult to use there is too much volume, too much detail, missing values, and inaccuracies. Clinicians, researchers, and administrators require higher level interpretations that address their questions. For example, a clinician may need to know whether a patient is at sufficient risk for having active tuberculosis to warrant respiratory isolation. The answer to the question may be spread around the clinical repository in chest radiographs, laboratory tests, medication histories, vital signs, and physician's notes. Translating from these raw data to the interpretation (at risk or not) is a difficult and laborious task. The hypothesis of this proposal is that data mining techniques can be applied to a real-time clinical repository to discover knowledge and generate accurate clinical interpretations, and that these interpretations can be automated. The project differs from earlier machine learning studies in its emphasis on a real clinical repository and the use of natural language processing to supply coded clinical data. The specific aims are: (l) Select clinical domains--Several clinical domains with interesting, non-trivial clinical problems will be selected. Problems for which a gold standard answer can or has been assembled for a retrospective cohort will be chosen. (2) Prepare raw clinical data for mining--The raw data from a clinical repository will be transformed into a structure that facilitates data mining. The data will be flattened, pivoted, summarized, and mapped as needed for the domains. Narrative data will be coded using the MedLEE natural language processor. The preparation process will be automated. (3) Use data mining algorithms to discover knowledge- Several data mining algorithms will be applied to the selected clinical domains. Algorithms will include decision tree generation, rule discovery, neural networks, nearest neighbor, logistic regression, and composite algorithms (for variable reduction). The algorithms will be trained on a training set for each domain, and their predictive accuracy will be measured and compared to each other and to expert-written rules. The performance of human experts writing rules using manual data mining visualization techniques (which does not require an explicit training set) will also be measured. (4) Study the dependence of data mining on the training set--The performance of data mining algorithms depends on the data used the train them. The sensitivity of the algorithms to noise (inaccurate data), missing data, and training set size will be measured. (5) Use the discovered knowledge to generate real-time interpretations-- The output of the algorithms (decision tree, rules, neural network equation, or logistic regression equation, but not nearest neighbor) along with the necessary data preparation steps will be encoded in Arden Syntax Medical Logic Modules. They will be run against the clinical repository to verify that the interpretation can be automated in real time. (6) Disseminate the methods and results--The methods and results will be disseminated via publications and a Web site, and tools will be made available.  n/a",DISCOVERING AND APPLYING KNOWLEDGE IN CLINICAL DATABASES,6031325,R01LM006910,"['Internet', ' artificial intelligence', ' clinical research', ' computer assisted medical decision making', ' computer assisted patient care', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' data collection methodology /evaluation', ' health care facility information system', ' human data', ' information dissemination', ' information system analysis', ' vocabulary development for information system']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2000,433383,-0.0055764400539336225
"DATA MINING AND MODEL BUILDING IN MEDICAL INFORMATICS Our long-term goal is to assist biomedical scientists by extracting and          codifying new knowledge from large biomedical databases routinely by             computer. As large collections of data become more readily accessibly,           the opportunities for discovering new information increase. We propose           here to work toward this goal by extending our prior research on machine         learning in two important directions: (1) codification of disparate              pieces of knowledge into a coherent model (model building), and (2)              discovery of new information in medical databases (data mining).                                                                                                  Machine learning programs find classification rules (or decision trees           or networks) that separate members of a target class from other                  individuals. They have emphasized predictive accuracy, with some                 attention to tradeoffs between accuracy and cost of errors or between            accuracy and simplicity. We propose a framework in which these, and              other, tradeoffs are explicit and the criteria by which tradeoffs are            made are available for modification. We also include semantic                    considerations among the criteria to control the internal coherence of           models.                                                                                                                                                           ""Data mining"" is a recently-coined term for using computers to explore           large databases, with a goal of discovering new relationships but                usually with no specific target defined at the outset. In addition to            accuracy, simplicity, coherence, and cost, a program that purports to            discover new relationships must be able to assess novelty. We propose to         measure the extent to which proposed relationships are novel by                  comparing them against existing knowledge in the domain of discourse,            and to look for unusual rules (and other relations) that would be very           interesting if true.                                                                                                                                              The computer program we are primarily building on, RL, is a knowledge-           based learning program that learns classification rules from a                   collection of data. RL has been demonstrated to be flexible enough to            allow guidance from prior knowledge, and powerful enough to learn                publishable information for scientists working in several different              domains. Both parts of the research will requires extending the RL               system in new ways detailed in the research plan, which are consistent           with the overall design philosophy of the present system. We will                primarily work with data already collected on pneumonia patients with            with which we have considerable. We will test the generality of the              criteria used to evaluate models and discoveries with a Baynesian Net            learning.

"GENESEEK: DATA INTEGRATION SYSTEM FOR GENETIC DATABASES The broad long-term objectives of this proposal are to create and evaluate an infrastructure (GeneSeek) to permit searching across heterogeneous source databases (genomic and citation databases) for relevant information needed for curation of an existing database of clinical knowledge (GeneClinics).  The Specific Aims are: 1) to use a novel, general purpose knowledge representation language to capture the schema of an existing database of clinical knowledge (GeneClinics genetic testing database), 2) to build a shared schema for mediating cross database queries, by extending the schema of GeneClinics and incorporating pertinent schema elements from other structured and semi-structured information sources, 3) to create and test interfaces to the targeted genetic information sources (databases and other structured information) from the shared query mediation schema, 4) to adapt the existing Tukwila data integration system to implement cross database query planning, query execution, and query result aggregation in the context of our shared query mediation schema and the multiple structured (genetic) information sources to create the GeneSeek data integration system, 5) to evaluate the performance of the Tukwila based GeneSeek data integration system and the shared data schema for precision and recall in finding relevant information for curation of a clinical database (GeneClinics genetic testing database). The broad health relatedness of the project is that data integration tools are needed to help clinicians apply the ever- growing body of medical information to patient care.  The tools are needed by curators of databases of medical knowledge as well as by the care providers themselves.  Nowhere is the growth in information more apparent than in the Human Genome project thus the choice of genetics as a domain to test this data integration system.  The specific genetics database whose curation the GeneSeek system will be evaluated against the GeneClinics database.  If successful these data integration systems could be more broadly applied to other domains in biomedicine.  The research design is to apply recent developments in data integration from the artificial intelligence and database areas of computer science to a real world clinical genetics data integration problem to evaluate the applicability of this system to biomedical information retrieval tasks.  The methods are to expand an existing collaboration between the current GeneClinics content and informatics teams and investigators in the Department of Computer science to: 1) enhance the Tukwila data integration architecture and its related CARIN knowledge representation language, and 2) to use these tools and the existing GeneClinics data model to implement and evaluate this data integration system in the specific domain of medical genetics.  n/a",GENESEEK: DATA INTEGRATION SYSTEM FOR GENETIC DATABASES,6031661,R01HG002288,"['artificial intelligence', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' data collection methodology /evaluation', ' experimental designs', ' information retrieval', ' molecular biology information system', ' vocabulary development for information system']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2000,354198,0.014933797647891059

"COMMUNITY DEPOSIT AND REVIEW OF BIOCHEMICAL DATABASES DESCRIPTION:  Computing with biochemical reactions is increasingly important     in studying genomes, assessing toxicity, and developing therapeutics.  There     are several important information sources, but their data are rudimentary        and often inaccurate.  Incorporation of biochemical information into             databases is extremely slow compared to that of sequence and structural          information, and will lag further as large-scale surveys of gene expression      and other reactions accelerate over the next few years.  Mechanisms for          review exist, but are manual, paper-dependent, and can be delayed for a year     or more.                                                                                                                                                          As curators and coordinators of biochemical information sources, the             applicants share a number of problems in the collection and review of            information.  Moreover, they are mutually dependent for the means to do so:      compound information is critical in checking reaction data, reaction             information is needed to spot errors in compound information, and the            automatic verification algorithms for either are closely related and need        both.  The applicants, therefore, propose to build a curatorial exchange for     the deposit and review of biochemical information by the scientific              community.  The applicants' goal is to demonstrate a system that will            encourage the mandating of deposit while ensuring that the information is of     the highest quality.                                                                                                                                              The role of the exchange is to receive deposits, check and classify their        biochemical information automatically, forward them to panels of human           reviewers for vetting, and publish the information by release to the             participating data sources--all over the World-Wide Web. It will track the       origin and status of deposits and reviews, serve computations for the            relevant pattern matching and simulation, and maintain an archival copy of       data.  The databases remain independent, and separately provide additional       information.

"KNOWLEDGE BASED TEMPORAL ABSTRACTION OF CLINICAL DATA Abstractions of time-stamped clinical data are useful for planning               therapy, for monitoring therapy, and for creating high-level summaries of        time-oriented clinical databases.  Temporal abstractions also support            explanations by an intelligent patient-record system and can be used for         representation of the goals and intentions of clinical guidelines and            protocols.                                                                                                                                                        We propose to reengineer and expand the scope of the RESUME system, a            prototype computer program that implements the knowledge-based temporal-         abstraction method, a conceptual and computational framework that we have        developed for abstraction of time-stamped clinical data into clinically          meaningful interval-based concepts. RESUME has been evaluated with highly        encouraging results in several clinical areas. We will address the               practical and theoretical issues of representation, acquisition,                 maintenance, and reuse of temporal-abstraction knowledge. Our specific           aims are defined by a four-step research plan:                                                                                                                    1. We will define formally the knowledge requirements for five                   computational modules (mechanisms) we employ, thus facilitating the              acquisition, maintenance, reuse, and sharing of the required knowledge.                                                                                           2. We will enhance, expand, and redesign five computational temporal-            abstraction mechanisms:                                                          (a) Automatic formation of meaningful contexts for interpretation of             clinical data.

(c) Temporal inference (e.g., the join of certain interval-based clinical        abstractions into longer ones).

"TOOLS TO SUPPORT COMPUTER BASED CLINICAL GUIDELINES DESCRIPTION (Adapted from the applicant's abstract):                                                                                                              The proposed research will build, refine, and test in operational use, a set     of software tools designed to help support, maintain, and iteratively            revalidate computer-based clinical guidelines as they evolve over time.  The     project will focus on the domain of childhood immunization, and will build       upon IMM/Serve, a childhood immunization forecasting program that takes as       input a child's immunization history, and produces recommendations as to         which vaccinations are due and which vaccinations should be scheduled next.      The effort required to modify and validate such a program as the clinical        field evolves over time is a challenging task.  It will be extremely             important to have a robust set of tools to assist in this process.  Partial      prototype versions of certain of these tools already exist.                                                                                                       1.  The project will refine and extend computer-based tools for immunization     knowledge maintenance.  These tools will include:  a) IMM/Def, a program         which automatically generates the rule-based logic for the most complex          portion (""kernel"") of IMM/Serve's knowledge, and b) IMM/Test, a program          which automatically generates a set of test cases to help test the kernel        logic.  The project will also develop an organized set of strategies for         immunization test case generation, and implement those strategies in the         refined version of IMM/Test.                                                                                                                                      2.  The project will build a Web site to support immunization knowledge          maintenance.                                                                                                                                                      3.  The project will keep a detailed record of all modifications and             customization of the knowledge, and will represent all the variations of the     knowledge using a standardized format such as GLIF, the Guideline                Interchange Format being developed as a standard for exchanging guidelines       between sites.                                                                                                                                                    4.  The project will link IMM/Serve to a database designed to hold               IMM/Serve's analysis of a set of cases, so that the resulting package can be     used as a tool to perform compliance assessment.                                                                                                                  5.

"AUTOMATED KNOWLEDGE EXTRACTION FOR BIOMEDICAL LITERATURE It is becoming increasingly difficult for biologists to keep pace with           information being published within their own fields, let alone biology           as a whole. The ability to rapidly access specific and current                   biomedical information as well as to quickly gain an overview of current         knowledge in a given field is becoming more difficult while at the same          time more important. Traditional methods of keeping up with advances are         therefore becoming inadequate.                                                                                                                                    This project will involve a unique collaboration between a computational         linguist at Brandeis University and two biologists at Tufts University           School of Medicine. We propose to make use of recent advances in the             computational analysis of text to organize and summarize the biological          literature. Building on our previous language technology research at             Brandeis, we propose to integrate the domain knowledge of the National           Library of Medicine's Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) with                Brandeis' semantic lexicon, CoreLex, toward the development of                   normalized structured representations of the semantic content of                 abstracts in the Medline database. These data structures, called lexical         webs, accelerate the availability of information in a richly hyperlinked         index that facilitates rapid navigation and information access.                  Automated analysis of biological abstracts will be combined with                 information derived from sequence databases to provide an up-to-date and         comprehensive database of information regarding known genes and                  proteins. The results of this analysis will be used to construct a web           accessible database organized on a gene-by-gene basis.                                                                                                            Other unique aspects of this database will be the visualization of               motifs and features extracted from Medline abstracts through the                 generation of annotated structure-function maps of proteins and genes,           and the construction of gene-specific semantic indexes to the relevant           biological literature. This system, called MedStract, will reduce the            time required for biomedical researchers to find information of interest         and should facilitate the development of new research insights.                   n/a",AUTOMATED KNOWLEDGE EXTRACTION FOR BIOMEDICAL LITERATURE,6165092,R01LM006649,"['Internet', ' abstracting', ' artificial intelligence', ' computer assisted sequence analysis', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' informatics', ' information retrieval', ' information system analysis', ' molecular biology information system', ' nucleic acid sequence', ' protein sequence', ' semantics', ' syntax', ' vocabulary development for information system']",NLM,BRANDEIS UNIVERSITY,R01,2000,297119,0.021797365259794487
"LANDMARK BASED METHODS FOR BIOMETRIC ANALYSIS OF SHAPE   DESCRIPTION (Adapted from Applicant's Abstract): Morphometric tools developed        under this grant combine techniques from geometry, computer vision, statistics,      and biomathematics in powerful new strategies for analysis of data about size        and shape. This fourth funding period is directed to three extensions of the         established core methodology, along with continued dissemination. Aim 1.             Thin-plate spline interpolant aids the scientist's eye in detecting                  localization of interesting shape differences. Over the present funding period       the applicants reported having developed an algebraic/statistical formalization      of this tactic, the method of creases. Aim 1 of the renewal is to standardize        the parameterization of this feature, to provide protocols for significance          tests, and to produce ""a grammar of grids"" for uniting multiple creases into         coherent summaries of empirical deformations. Aim 2. The standard Procrustes         methods for discrete point landmarks have been extended for data sets of             outlines. Aim 2 of the renewal is to further extend these tools for realistic        data sets that combine discrete point landmarks and curves or surfaces               arbitrarily. The applicants proposed to formalize statistical spaces for such        structures and extend them to anticipate the emerging resource of neural tract       directional data (directions without curves). Aim 3. The best current                strategies for formal statistical inferences about shape exploit permutation         tests of Procrustes distance or its modifications. Under new Aim 3, the              applicants proposed to combine this approach with spline-based high-pass or          low-pass filters and extend it further to support studies of correlations of         shape with other measurement sets, including other aspects of shape. Finally,        as it has been for the past twelve years, Aim 4 is to continue bringing all          these methodological developments to the attention of many different biomedical      communities, by primary scientific papers, essays on methodology per se,             videotapes, and software and documentation free over the Internet. The work          proposed is expected to extend to the medical imaging community's most               sophisticated data resources, carefully labeled images and volumes, a                state-of-the-art biometric toolkit for analysis and visualization carefully          tuned to the special needs of such data.                                                                                                                                  n/a",LANDMARK BASED METHODS FOR BIOMETRIC ANALYSIS OF SHAPE,6180399,R01GM037251,"['bioimaging /biomedical imaging', ' cardiovascular system', ' computer data analysis', ' computer program /software', ' computer simulation', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' craniofacial', ' human data', ' image processing', ' mathematical model', ' morphology', ' neuroanatomy', ' statistics /biometry']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2000,150497,-0.003946163549010695
"Deep learning for population genetics Project Summary The revolution in genome sequencing technologies over the past 15 years has created an explosion of population genomic data but has left in its wake a gap in our ability to make sense of data at this scale. In particular, whereas population genetics as a field has been traditionally data-limited, the massive volume of current sequencing means that previously unanswerable questions may now be within reach. To capitalize on this flood of information we need new methods and modes of analysis.  In the past 5 years the world of machine learning has been revolutionized by the rise of deep neural networks. These so-called deep learning methods offer incredible flexibility as well as astounding improvements in performance for a wide array of machine learning tasks, including computer vision, speech recognition, and natural language processing. This proposal aims to harness the great potential of deep learning for population genetic inference.  In recent years our group has made great strides in using supervised machine learning for population genomic analysis (reviewed in Schrider and Kern 2018). However, this work has focused primarily on using more traditional machine learning methods such as random forests. As we argue in this proposal, DNA sequence data are particularly well suited for modern deep learning techniques, and we demonstrate that the application of these methods can rapidly lead to state-of-the-art performance in very difficult population genetic tasks such as estimating rates of recombination. The power of these methods for handling genetic data stems in part from their ability to automatically learn to extract as much useful information as possible from an alignment of DNA sequences in order to solve the task at hand, rather than relying on one or more predefined summary statistics which are generally problem-specific and may omit information present in the raw data.  In this proposal we lay out a systematic approach for both empowering the field with these tools and understanding their shortcomings. In particular, we propose to design deep neural networks for solving population genetic problems, and incorporate successful networks into user-friendly software tools that will be shared with the community. We will also investigate a variety of methods for estimating the uncertainty of predictions produced by deep learning methods; this area is understudied in machine learning but of great importance to biological researchers who require an accurate measure of the degree of uncertainty surrounding an estimate. Finally, we will explore the impact of training data misspecification—wherein the data used to train a machine learning method differ systematically from the data to which it will be applied in practice. We will devise techniques to mitigate the impact of such misspecification in order to ensure that our tools will be robust to the complications inherent in analyzing real genomic data sets. Together, these advances have the potential to transform the methodological landscape of population genetic inference. Project Narrative Deep learning has revolutionized such disparate fields as computer vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition. In this proposal we aim to harness the great potential of deep learning for population genetic inference. We will design, implement, and apply novel deep learning methods and provide open source software for others to both use and build upon, thereby producing valuable tools for the genetics researchers at large.",Deep learning for population genetics,9976348,R01HG010774,"['Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Development', 'Ensure', 'Floods', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Recombination', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Natural Selections', 'Nature', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Population Explosions', 'Population Genetics', 'Process', 'Program Development', 'Publishing', 'Research Personnel', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Software Tools', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Trees', 'Uncertainty', 'Ursidae Family', 'Work', 'base', 'computational chemistry', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'empowered', 'flexibility', 'genetic information', 'genome sequencing', 'genomic data', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'learning classifier', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'network architecture', 'neural network', 'neural network architecture', 'next generation', 'novel', 'open source', 'random forest', 'recurrent neural network', 'research and development', 'speech recognition', 'statistics', 'stem', 'success', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'tool development', 'user friendly software']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF OREGON,R01,2020,529154,-0.018052074768288705
"Transfer learning to improve the re-usability of computable biomedical knowledge Candidate: With my multidisciplinary background in Artificial Intelligence (PhD), Public Health Informatics (MS), Epidemiology and Health Statistics (MS), and Preventive Medicine (Bachelor of Medicine), my career goal is to become an independent investigator working at the intersection of Artificial Intelligence and Biomedicine, with a particular emphasis initially in machine learning and public health. Training plan: My K99/R00 training plan emphasizes machine learning, deep learning and scientific communication skills (presentation, writing articles, and grant applications), which will complement my current strengths in artificial intelligence, statistics, medicine and public health. I have a very strong mentoring team. My mentors, Drs. Michael Becich (primary), Gregory Cooper, Heng Huang, and Michael Wagner, all of whom are experienced with research and professional career development. Research plan: The research goal of my proposed K99/R00 grant is to increase the re-use of computable biomedical knowledge, which is knowledge represented in computer-interpretable formalisms such as Bayesian networks and neural networks. I refer to such representations as models. Although models can be re-used in toto in another setting, there may be loss of performance or, even more problematically, fundamental mismatches between the data required by the model and the data available in the new setting making their re-use impossible. The field of transfer learning develops algorithms for transferring knowledge from one setting to another. Transfer learning, a sub-area of machine learning, explicitly distinguishes between a source setting, which has the model that we would like to re-use, and a target setting, which has data insufficient for deriving a model from data and therefore needs to re-use a model from a source setting. I propose to develop and evaluate several Bayesian Network Transfer Learning (BN- TL) algorithms and a Convolutional Neural Network Transfer Learning algorithm. My specific research aims are to: (1) further develop and evaluate BN-TL for sharing computable knowledge across healthcare settings; (2) develop and evaluate BN-TL for updating computable knowledge over time; and (3) develop and evaluate a deep transfer learning algorithm that combines knowledge in heterogeneous scenarios. I will do this research on models that are used to automatically detect cases of infectious disease such as influenza. Impact: The proposed research takes advantage of large datasets that I previously developed; therefore I expect to quickly have results with immediate implications for how case detection models are shared from a region that is initially experiencing an epidemic to another location that wishes to have optimal case-detection capability as early as possible. More generally, it will bring insight into machine learning enhanced biomedical knowledge sharing and updating. This training grant will prepare me to work independently and lead efforts to develop computational solutions to meet biomedical needs in future R01 projects. Transfer learning to improve the re-usability of computable biomedical knowledge Narrative Re-using computable biomedical knowledge in the form of a mathematical model in a new setting is challenging because the new setting may not have data needed as inputs to the model. This project will develop and evaluate transfer learning algorithms, which are computer programs that adapt a model to a new setting by removing and adding local variables to it. The developed methods for re-using models are expected to benefit the public’s health by: (1) improving case detection during epidemics by enabling re-use of automatic case detectors developed in the earliest affected regions with other regions, and, more generally, (2) increasing the impact of NIH’s investment in machine learning by enabling machine-learned models to be used in more institutions and locations.",Transfer learning to improve the re-usability of computable biomedical knowledge,9952803,K99LM013383,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Bayesian Method', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Bayesian Network', 'Big Data', 'Clinical', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communication', 'Complement', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heterogeneity', 'Influenza', 'Institution', 'Investigation', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical center', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Parainfluenza', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Preventive Medicine', 'Process', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Semantics', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Twin Multiple Birth', 'Unified Medical Language System', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Utah', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'computer program', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'detector', 'experience', 'health care settings', 'improved', 'insight', 'large datasets', 'learning algorithm', 'mathematical model', 'multidisciplinary', 'neural network', 'skills', 'statistics', 'usability']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,K99,2020,92359,0.014541551082934468
"Crowd-Assisted Deep Learning (CrADLe) Digital Curation to Translate Big Data into Precision Medicine PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The NIH and other agencies are funding high-throughput genomics (‘omics) experiments that deposit digital samples of data into the public domain at breakneck speeds. This high-quality data measures the ‘omics of diseases, drugs, cell lines, model organisms, etc. across the complete gamut of experimental factors and conditions. The importance of these digital samples of data is further illustrated in linked peer-reviewed publications that demonstrate its scientific value. However, meta-data for digital samples is recorded as free text without biocuration necessary for in-depth downstream scientific inquiry.  Deep learning is revolutionary machine intelligence paradigm that allows for an algorithm to program itself thereby removing the need to explicitly specify rules or logic. Whereas physicians / scientists once needed to first understand a problem to program computers to solve it, deep learning algorithms optimally tune themselves to solve problems. Given enough example data to train on, deep learning machine intelligence outperform humans on a variety of tasks. Today, deep learning is state-of-the-art performance for image classification, and, most importantly for this proposal, for natural language processing.  This proposal is about engineering Crowd Assisted Deep Learning (CrADLe) machine intelligence to rapidly scale the digital curation of public digital samples. We will first use our NIH BD2K-funded Search Tag Analyze Resource for Gene Expression Omnibus (STARGEO.org) to crowd-source human annotation of open digital samples. We will then develop and train deep learning algorithms for STARGEO digital curation based on learning the associated free text meta-data each digital sample. Given the ongoing deluge of biomedical data in the public domain, CrADLe may perhaps be the only way to scale the digital curation towards a precision medicine ideal.  Finally, we will demonstrate the biological utility to leverage CrADLe for digital curation with two large- scale and independent molecular datasets in: 1) The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and 2) The Accelerating Medicines Partnership-Alzheimer’s Disease (AMP-AD). We posit that CrADLe digital curation of open samples will augment these two distinct disease projects with a host big data to fuel the discovery of potential biomarker and gene targets. Therefore, successful funding and completion of this work may greatly reduce the burden of disease on patients by enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of digital curation for biomedical big data. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal is about engineering Crowd Assisted Deep Learning (CrADLe) machine intelligence to rapidly scale the digital curation of public digital samples and directly translating this ‘omics data into useful biological inference. We will first use our NIH BD2K-funded Search Tag Analyze Resource for Gene Expression Omnibus (STARGEO.org) to crowd-source human annotation of open digital samples on which we will develop and train deep learning algorithms for STARGEO digital curation of free-text sample-level metadata.

"Center for Machine Learning in Urology PROJECT SUMMARY We propose to establish an Exploratory Center for Interdisciplinary Research in Benign Urology at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) and the University of Pennsylvania (Penn), the central mission of which is to apply machine learning to improve the understanding of the pathophysiology, diagnosis, risk stratification, and prediction of treatment responses of benign urological disease among children and adults. The proposed CHOP/Penn Center for Machine Learning in Urology (CMLU) addresses critical structural and scientific barriers that impede the development of new treatments and the effective application of existing treatments for benign urologic disease across the lifespan. Structurally, urologic research occurs in silos, with little interaction among investigators that study different diseases or different populations (e.g. pediatric and adult). Scientifically, analysis of imaging and other types complex data is limited by inter-observer variability, and incomplete utilization of available information. This proposal overcomes these barriers by applying cutting-edge approaches in machine learning to analyze CT images that are routinely obtained for evaluation of individuals with kidney stone disease. Central to the CHOP/Penn CMLU is the partnership of urologists and experts in machine learning, which will bring a new approach to generating knowledge that advances research and clinical care. In addition, the CMLU will expand the urologic research community by providing a research platform and standalone machine learning executables that could be applied to other datasets. The Center’s mission will be achieved through the following Aims, with progress assessed through systematic evaluation: Aim 1. To expand the research base investigating benign urological disease. We will establish a community with the research base, particularly with the KURe, UroEpi programs, other P20 Centers, and O’Brien Centers. We will build this community by providing mini-coaching clinics to facilitate application of machine learning to individual projects, developing an educational hub for synchronous and asynchronous engagement with the research base, and making freely available all source codes and standalone executables for all machine learning tools. Aim 2. To improve prediction of ureteral stone passage using machine learning of CT images. The CMLU has developed deep learning methods that segment and automate measurement of urinary stones and adjacent renal anatomy. In the Research Project, we will compare these methods to existing segmentation methods and the current gold standard of manual measurement. We will then extract informative features from thousands of CT scans to predict the probability of spontaneous passage of ureteral stones for children and adults evaluated in the CHOP and Penn healthcare systems. Aim 3. To foster collaboration in benign urological disease research across levels of training and centers through an Educational Enrichment Program. We will amplify interactions across institutions and engage investigators locally and nationally by providing summer research internships, and interinstitutional exchange program, and an annual research symposium. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed CHOP/Penn O’Brien Center for Machine Learning in Urology addresses critical structural and scientific barriers that impede development of new treatments and the effective application of existing treatments for benign urologic disease across the lifespan. This application overcomes these barriers by applying cutting- edge approaches in machine learning to analyze complex imaging data for individuals with kidney stone disease.The Center’s strategic vision of using machine learning to generate knowledge that improves diagnosis, risk stratification strategies, and prediction of outcomes among children and adults will be achieved through the implementation of a Educational Enrichment Program and a Research Project.",Center for Machine Learning in Urology,10133362,P20DK127488,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Benign', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Educational Status', 'Evaluation', 'Fostering', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Internships', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Investigation', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Calculi', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Patient Care', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pennsylvania', 'Philadelphia', 'Population', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Probability', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Risk stratification', 'Site', 'Source Code', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Techniques', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Urinary Calculi', 'Urologic Diseases', 'Urologist', 'Urology', 'Vision', 'Visit', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'clinical care', 'complex data ', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'experience', 'feature selection', 'human error', 'improved', 'interdisciplinary collaboration', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'novel strategies', 'outcome prediction', 'peer', 'programs', 'routine imaging', 'senior faculty', 'skills', 'summer research', 'symposium', 'tool', 'urologic', 'web page']",NIDDK,CHILDREN'S HOSP OF PHILADELPHIA,P20,2020,358890,-0.03753689946155335
"Integrative data science approaches for rare disease discovery in health records ABSTRACT: There are nearly 7,000 diseases that have a prevalence of only one in 2,000 individuals or less. Yet, such rare diseases are estimated to collectively affect over 300 million people worldwide, representing a significant healthcare concern. Although rare diseases have predominantly genetic origins, nearly half of them do not manifest symptoms until adulthood and frequently confound discovery and diagnosis. Even in the case of early onset disorders, the sheer number of possible diagnoses can often overwhelm clinicians. As a result, rare diseases are often diagnosed with delay, misdiagnosed or even remain undiagnosed, not only disrupting patient lives but also hindering progress on our understanding of such diseases. Data science methods that mine large-scale retrospective health record data for phenotypic information will aid in timely and accurate diagnoses of rare diseases, especially when combined with additional data types, thus, having significant real- world impact. This proposal will integrate electronic health record (EHR) data sets with publicly available vocabularies and ontologies, and genomic data for the improved identification and characterization of patients with rare diseases, using approaches from machine learning, natural language processing (NLP) and basic bioinformatics. The work has three specific aims and will be carried out in two phases. During the mentored phase, the principal investigator (PI) will develop data-driven methods to extract standardized concepts related to rare diseases from clinical notes and infer the occurrence of each disease (Aim 1). He will also develop data science approaches to compare and contrast longitudinal patterns associated with patients' journeys through the healthcare system when seeking a diagnosis for a rare disease, and aid in clinical decision-making by leveraging these patterns (Aim 2). During the independent phase (Aim 3), computational methods will be developed for the integrated modeling and analysis of genotypic (from Aim 3) and phenotypic information (from Aims 1 and 2). Cohorts to be sequenced will cover diseases for which causal genes or disease definitions are unclear (discovery), as well as those for which these are well known (validation). This work will be carried out under the mentorship of four faculty members with complementary expertise in biomedical informatics, data science, NLP, and rare disease genomics at the University of Washington, the largest medical system in the Pacific Northwest (four million EHRs), world-renowned researchers in medical genetics, and a robust data science environment. In addition, under the direction of the mentoring team, the PI will complete advanced coursework, receive training in translational bioinformatics and clinical research informatics, submit manuscripts, and seek an independent research position. This proposal will yield preliminary results for subsequent studies on data-driven phenotyping and enable the realization of the PI's career goals by providing him with the necessary training to build on his machine learning and basic bioinformatics expertise to transition into an independent investigator in biomedical data science. PROJECT NARRATIVE Rare genetic diseases are estimated to affect the lives of 25 to 30 million Americans and their families, and present a significant economic burden on the healthcare system. Currently, our knowledge of the broad spectrum of the 7,000 observed rare diseases is limited to a few well-studied ones, hindering our ability to make correct and timely diagnoses. The objective of this study is to improve the identification of patients with rare diseases in healthcare systems by developing data science approaches that automatically recognize rare disease-related patterns in patient health records and correlate them with genomic data, thus, aiding in diagnosis and discovery.",Integrative data science approaches for rare disease discovery in health records,9884791,K99LM012992,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'American', 'Award', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Bioinformatics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Research', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostics Research', 'Disease', 'Economic Burden', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuscripts', 'Markov Chains', 'Medical', 'Medical Genetics', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Natural Language Processing pipeline', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Pacific Northwest', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Principal Investigator', 'Rare Diseases', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Standardization', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Vocabulary', 'Washington', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'biomedical data science', 'biomedical informatics', 'career', 'causal variant', 'clinical data warehouse', 'clinical decision-making', 'cohort', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'disease phenotype', 'early onset disorder', 'exome sequencing', 'gene discovery', 'genomic data', 'health care delivery', 'health data', 'health record', 'improved', 'member', 'multimodal data', 'novel', 'open source', 'patient health information', 'phenotypic data', 'prototype', 'psychologic', 'rare condition', 'rare genetic disorder', 'recruit', 'skills', 'software development', 'support tools', 'tool', 'trait']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,K99,2020,92070,-0.02970367092338439
"Advanced End-to-End Relation Extraction with Deep Neural Networks ABSTRACT Relations linking various biomedical entities constitute a crucial resource that enables biomedical data science applications and knowledge discovery. Relational information spans the translational science spectrum going from biology (e.g., protein–protein interactions) to translational bioinformatics (e.g., gene–disease associations), and eventually to clinical care (e.g., drug–drug interactions). Scientists report newly discovered relations in nat- ural language through peer-reviewed literature and physicians may communicate them in clinical notes. More recently, patients are also reporting side-effects and adverse events on social media. With exponential growth in textual data, advances in biomedical natural language processing (BioNLP) methods are gaining prominence for biomedical relation extraction (BRE) from text. Most current efforts in BRE follow a pipeline approach containing named entity recognition (NER), entity normalization (EN), and relation classiﬁcation (RC) as subtasks. They typically suffer from error snowballing — errors in a component of the pipeline leading to more downstream errors — resulting in lower performance of the overall BRE system. This situation has lead to evaluation of different BRE substaks conducted in isolation. In this proposal we make a strong case for strictly end-to-end evaluations where relations are to be produced from raw text. We propose novel deep neural network architectures that model BRE in an end-to-end fashion and directly identify relations and corresponding entity spans in a single pass. We also extend our architectures to n-ary and cross-sentence settings where more than two entities may need to be linked even as the relation is expressed across multiple sentences. We also propose to create two new gold standard BRE datasets, one for drug–disease treatment relations and another ﬁrst of a kind dataset for combination drug therapies. Our main hypothesis is that our end-to-end extraction models will yield supe- rior performance when compared with traditional pipelines. We test this through (1). intrinsic evaluations based on standard performance measures with several gold standard datasets and (2). extrinsic application oriented assessments of relations extracted with use-cases in information retrieval, question answering, and knowledge base completion. All software and data developed as part of this project will be made available for public use and we hope this will foster rigorous end-to-end benchmarking of BRE systems. NARRATIVE Relations connecting biomedical entities are at the heart of biomedical research given they encapsulate mech- anisms of disease etiology, progression, and treatment. As most such relations are ﬁrst disclosed in textual narratives (scientiﬁc literature or clinical notes), methods to extract and represent them in a structured format are essential to facilitate applications such as hypotheses generation, question answering, and information retrieval. The high level objective of this project is to develop and evaluate novel end-to-end supervised machine learning methods for biomedical relation extraction using latest advances in deep neural networks.",Advanced End-to-End Relation Extraction with Deep Neural Networks,10052028,R01LM013240,"['Adverse event', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Benchmarking', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Combination Drug Therapy', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Disease', 'Distant', 'Drug Interactions', 'Encapsulated', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Hand', 'Heart', 'Information Retrieval', 'Information Sciences', 'Intramural Research', 'Joints', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Label', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Performance', 'Periodicity', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Review Literature', 'Scientist', 'Semantics', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Trees', 'base', 'biomedical data science', 'clinical care', 'deep neural network', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'machine learning method', 'natural language', 'neural network', 'neural network architecture', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'off-label use', 'protein protein interaction', 'relating to nervous system', 'side effect', 'social media', 'supervised learning', 'syntax']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY,R01,2020,358691,0.004199023341843036
"xARA: ARA through Explainable AI In response to the NIH FOA OTA-19009 “Biomedical Translator: Development” we propose to build an Autonomous Relay Agent (ARA) that can characterize and rate the quality of information returned from multiple multiscale heterogeneous knowledge providers (KPs). Biomedical researchers develop a trust relationship with a knowledge provider (KP) through frequent and continued use. Over time a familiarity develops that drives their understanding and insight on 1) how to structure and invoke more effective queries, 2) the quality of the results they may expect in response to different query parameters and feature values, and 3) how to assess the relevancy of a specific query’s results. Although this information retrieval paradigm has served the research community moderately well in the past it is not scalable and the number, scope and complexity of KPs is increasing at a dramatic pace (1,613 molecular biology databases reported as of Jan. 2019). Within this ever changing information landscape, a biomedical researcher now has two choices -- either continue using the few KPs they have learned to trust but remain limited in the actionable information they will receive, or invest the time and accept the risk of using a range of new information resources with little or no familiarity and thus uncertain effectiveness. If researchers are to benefit from the vast array of NIH and industry sponsored information assets now available and expanding new information retrieval and quality assessment technologies will be required. We propose to build an Explanatory Autonomous Relay Agent (xARA) that can characterize query results by rating the quality of information returned from multi-scale heterogeneous KPs. The xARA will utilize multiple information retrieval and explainable Artificial Intelligence (xAI) strategies to perform queries across multiple heterogeneous KPs and rank their results by quality and relevancy while also identifying and explaining any inconsistencies among databases for the same query response. To deliver on this promise, we will utilize case-based reasoning and language models trained with biomedical data (i.e., BioBERT and custom annotation embeddings through Reactome and UniProt) permitting a new level of query profiling and assessment. Our strategies will permit 1) information gaps to be filled by testing alternative query patterns that produce different surface syntax yet possess semantically related and actionable concepts, 2) inconsistencies to be identified for a given query feature value, and 3) the identification and elimination or merging of semantically redundant query results via similarity metrics enriched by case-based reasoning strategies employed in the explainable AI (xAI) community to identify machine learning model behavior and performance. The xARA capabilities proposed herein will be based on strategies developed in Dr. Weber’s lab for information retrieval where the desire for greater transparency when reasoning over experimental data is our primary aim. Our multi-institutional team is comprised of senior researchers and software engineers formally trained and experienced in the computer and data sciences, cheminformatics, bioinformatics, molecular biology, and biochemistry. Inherent risks in querying heterogeneous KPs include the presence of inconsistent labeling of the same biomedical concept within unique KP data structures. Manual engineering may be necessary to overcome such hurdles, but will not be a significant challenge for the initial prototype, since only two well documented KPs are being evaluated. Another noteworthy risk is that the quality of word embeddings generated from UniProt and Reactome may not be sufficient, requiring further textual analysis of biomedical text like PubMed, which is feasible within the timeframe of our project plan. n/a",xARA: ARA through Explainable AI,10057158,OT2TR003448,"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Biochemistry', 'Bioinformatics', 'Communities', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Engineering', 'Familiarity', 'Industry', 'Information Resources', 'Information Retrieval', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Language', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Biology', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Provider', 'PubMed', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Semantics', 'Software Engineering', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Technology Assessment', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trust', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'base', 'case-based', 'cheminformatics', 'computer science', 'experience', 'insight', 'prototype', 'response', 'structured data', 'syntax']",NCATS,TUFTS MEDICAL CENTER,OT2,2020,795873,0.03480892360778274
"Knowledge-Based Biomedical Data Science Knowledge-based biomedical data science  In the previous funding period, we designed and constructed breakthrough methods for creating a semantically coherent and logically consistent knowledge-base by automatically transforming and integrating many biomedical databases, and by directly extracting information from the literature. Building on decades of work in biomedical ontology development, and exploiting the architectures supporting the Semantic Web, we have demonstrated methods that allow effective querying spanning any combination of data sources in purely biological terms, without the queries having to reflect anything about the structure or distribution of information among any of the sources. These methods are also capable of representing apparently conflicting information in a logically consistent manner, and tracking the provenance of all assertions in the knowledge-base. Perhaps the most important feature of these methods is that they scale to potentially include nearly all knowledge of molecular biology.  We now hypothesize that using these technologies we can build knowledge-bases with broad enough coverage to overcome the “brittleness” problems that stymied previous approaches to symbolic artificial intelligence, and then create novel computational methods which leverage that knowledge to provide critical new tools for the interpretation and analysis of biomedical data. To test this hypothesis, we propose to address the following specific aims:  1. Identify representative and significant analytical needs in knowledge-based data science, and  refine and extend our knowledge-base to address those needs in three distinct domains: clinical  pharmacology, cardiovascular disease and rare genetic disease.  2. Develop novel and implement existing symbolic, statistical, network-based, machine learning  and hybrid approaches to goal-driven inference from very large knowledge-bases. Create a goal-  directed framework for selecting and combining these inference methods to address particular  analytical problems.  3. Overcome barriers to broad external adoption of developed methods by analyzing their  computational complexity, optimizing performance of knowledge-based querying and inference,  developing simplified, biology-focused query languages, lightweight packaging of knowledge  resources and systems, and addressing issues of licensing and data redistribution.

"Anatomy Directly from Imagery: General-purpose, Scalable, and Open-source Machine Learning Approaches Project Summary The form (or shape) and function relationship of anatomical structures is a central theme in biology where abnor- mal shape changes are closely tied to pathological functions. Morphometrics has been an indispensable quan- titative tool in medical and biological sciences to study anatomical forms for more than 100 years. Recently, the increased availability of high-resolution in-vivo images of anatomy has led to the development of a new generation of morphometric approaches, called statistical shape modeling (SSM), that take advantage of modern computa- tional techniques to model anatomical shapes and their variability within populations with unprecedented detail. SSM stands to revolutionize morphometric analysis, but its widespread adoption is hindered by a number of sig- niﬁcant challenges, including the complexity of the approaches and their increased computational requirements, relative to traditional morphometrics. Arguably, however, the most important roadblock to more widespread adop- tion is the lack of user-friendly and scalable software tools for a variety of anatomical surfaces that can be readily incorporated into biomedical research labs. The goal of this proposal is thus to address these challenges in the context of a ﬂexible and general SSM approach termed particle-based shape modeling (PSM), which automat- ically constructs optimal statistical landmark-based shape models of ensembles of anatomical shapes without relying on any speciﬁc surface parameterization. The proposed research will provide an automated, general- purpose, and scalable computational solution for constructing shape models of general anatomy. In Aim 1, we will build computational and machine learning algorithms to model anatomies with complex surface topologies (e.g., surface openings and shared boundaries) and highly variable anatomical populations. In Aim 2, we will introduce an end-to-end machine learning approach to extract statistical shape representation directly from im- ages, requiring no parameter tuning, image pre-processing, or user assistance. In Aim 3, we will provide intuitive graphical user interfaces and visualization tools to incorporate user-deﬁned modeling preferences and promote the visual interpretation of shape models. We will also make use of recent advances in cloud computing to enable researchers with limited computational resources and/or large cohorts to build and execute custom SSM work- ﬂows using remote scalable computational resources. Algorithmic developments will be thoroughly evaluated and validated using existing, fully funded, large-scale, and constantly growing databases of CT and MRI images lo- cated on-site. Furthermore, we will develop and disseminate standard workﬂows and domain-speciﬁc use cases for complex anatomies to promote reproducibility. Efforts to develop the proposed technology are aligned with the mission of the National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS), and its third strategic goal: to bridge biology and quantitative science for better global health through supporting the development of and access to computational research tools for biomedical research. Our long-term goal is to increase the clinical utility and widespread adoption of SSM, and the proposed research will establish the groundwork for achieving this goal. Project Narrative This project will develop general-purpose, scalable, and open-source statistical shape modeling (SSM) tools, which will present unique capabilities for automated anatomy modeling with less user input. The proposed tech- nology will introduce a number of signiﬁcant improvements to current SSM approaches and tools, including the support for challenging modeling problems, inferring shapes directly from images (and hence bypassing the seg- mentation step), parallel optimizations for speed, and new user interfaces that will be much easier and scalable than the current tools. The proposed technology will constitute an indispensable resource for the biomedical and clinical communities that will enable new avenues for biomedical research and clinical investigations, provide new ways to answer biologically related questions, allow new types of questions to be asked, and open the door for the integration of SSM with clinical care.","Anatomy Directly from Imagery: General-purpose, Scalable, and Open-source Machine Learning Approaches",9969467,R01AR076120,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomic Models', 'Anatomic Surface', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biological Sciences', 'Biological Testing', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Brain', 'Bypass', 'Cardiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cloud Computing', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Complex Analysis', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Models', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Felis catus', 'Funding', 'Generations', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Ice', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Injury', 'Intuition', 'Laboratory Research', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mathematical Computing', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Modification', 'Morphogenesis', 'National Institute of General Medical Sciences', 'Occupations', 'Online Systems', 'Organism', 'Orthopedics', 'Pathologic', 'Population', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Software Engineering', 'Software Tools', 'Specialist', 'Speed', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Visualization software', 'Work', 'algorithm development', 'base', 'biomedical resource', 'clinical care', 'clinical investigation', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'computing resources', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'global health', 'graphical user interface', 'image archival system', 'image processing', 'imaging Segmentation', 'in vivo imaging', 'innovation', 'large datasets', 'machine learning algorithm', 'model development', 'multidisciplinary', 'open source', 'particle', 'preference', 'software development', 'tool', 'usability', 'user-friendly']",NIAMS,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R01,2020,614363,0.0001809378371674875
"Abiotic-Biotic Interfaces for Ophthalmology Symposium ABSTRACT This proposal seeks funding to support a symposium, Abiotic-Biotic Interfaces for Ophthalmology (ABI), which will bring together recognized world experts in clinical, research, vision science, engineering, industrial and pharmaceutical communities as well as junior investigators (i.e., young faculty and those in training) to discuss the current state of ABI, ranging from bioelectronic implantable and wearable devices, to nanoscale scaffolds for stem cell and gene therapies. Given the multidisciplinary nature of this field, it is essential to bring together researchers and clinicians with varying levels of expertise across many domains related to ABI to advance the progress of this novel field, identify challenges of advancement, and develop a strategic action plan to overcome these challenges. The timing to have such a symposium to further the application of implantable and/or wearable bioengineered systems in ophthalmology is now as we focus on precision and personalized medicine and leverage the revolution in deep learning artificial intelligence algorithms. Through symposium talks, sessions, and discussions we will cover the fundamentals and also identify innovative and cutting-edge strategies and methodologies to accelerate the rate of major discoveries and development of novel therapeutics. The specific aims of this symposium are: Specific Aim 1. To bring together both established and junior investigators representing a broad range of disciplines to discuss cutting edge research in this novel field, catalyze the development of cross-disciplinary and translational approaches to advance abiotic-biotic interfaces for ophthalmology, and identify gaps in knowledge and barriers to advancement. We will identify research questions and develop an agenda to guide future research that is consistent with the objectives and interests of NEI. Specific Aim 2. Develop a junior investigator program to motivate a diverse group of students and junior investigators to pursue research careers in vision science and ophthalmologic therapeutic development, who will ultimately submit grant proposals to NEI solicitations and contribute to the scientific literature. Specific Aim 3. Develop a strategic action plan to set priorities for future studies that will encourage inter-agency collaborations (e.g., NEI, NSF, DARPA, etc.). This is critical because often certain engineering tasks are best suited to be supported by NSF or DARPA whereas the biological testing of the engineered systems lends itself to funding from NEI. Hence such inter-agency or cross-agency efforts can help leverage the funding to develop sophisticated abiotic-biotic systems NARRATIVE This meeting is the first on this topic dedicated to the broad use of implantable and/or wearable bioelectronics for ophthalmological applications. It is anticipated that the strategic action plan will significantly impact the field by greatly accelerating the translation of basic science and engineering research findings to stimulate the development of novel treatments and improve clinical practice. Key topics include visual restoration, drug and gene delivery, and sensing intraocular pressure.

"In-silico prediction of protein-peptide interactions. IN-SILICO PREDICTION OF PROTEIN-PEPTIDE INTERACTIONS Automated docking methods are used extensively for gaining a mechanistic understanding of the molecular interactions underpinning cellular processes. While these tools work well for small molecules they perform poorly for peptides and cannot handle Intrinsically Disordered Proteins (IDPs) which play very important roles in these processes. The goal of this project is the development of an efficient and practical peptide docking software, useful for designing therapeutic peptides and gaining insight into IDPs binding ordered proteins. The proposed software supports biomedical applications ranging from investigating chemical pathways to designing and optimizing therapeutic molecules for diseases such as cancer and metabolic disorders. Under the previous award we developed and released a new method for docking fully-flexible peptides with up to 20 standard amino acids: AutoDock CrankPep (ADCP). We showed that it outperforms current state-of-the-art docking methods. For the next award, we propose to: 1) further develop ADCP to support docking IPDs with up to 70 amino acids and improve support for therapeutic peptides containing modified amino acids and complex macrocycles; 2) develop peptide-specific scoring functions to increase docking success rates and methods for predicting the free energy of binding of peptides. This will be done by exploiting the latest advances in statistical potentials for docking, as well as applying machine-learning techniques; 3) test and validate the software on our datasets, community benchmarks, and through our collaborations with outstanding biologists working on biomedical applications spanning from designing drugs for thrombosis and influenza, to modeling IDPs interacting with globular proteins; and 4) document the software and release it under an open source license on a regular basis along with datasets we compile and update on regularly. The proposed research will occur in the context of collaborations with experimental biologists working on highly relevant biomedical projects and providing experimental feedback and validation. In addition, this project will benefit from various collaborations with experts in the fields of computational biology, applied mathematics and artificial intelligence. This docking software tool will be developed by applying best practices in software engineering and be implemented as a modular, extensible, component-based software framework for peptide docking. This docking engine will be part of the widely used AutoDock software suite. The ability to model complexes formed by proteins and fully-flexible peptides or IDPs is in high demand and will greatly extend the range of peptide-based therapeutic approaches for which automated docking can be successfully applied. It will also support gaining insights into interactions of IDPs with proteins. As such, it will impact the research of many medicinal chemists and biologist and extend the use of computational tools to a wider community of scientists, thereby supporting the advancement of biomedical research. Automated docking is a workhorse for rational drug design, however, applying these methods to peptides has remained challenging, thus impeding the designing of therapeutic peptides and the study of Intrinsically Disordered Proteins (IDP) binding to their ordered partners. During the prior funding period, we made substantial progress toward peptide docking, resulting in a new docking engine: AutoDock CrankPep, which outperforms state-of-the-art docking methods for linear and cyclic peptides with up to 20 standard amino acids. We propose to further develop AutoDock CrankPep to support docking of therapeutic peptides with modified amino acids as well as IDPs with up to 70 amino acids, creating a practical docking tool for peptides that will impact the research of many computational and medicinal chemists and biologist, contribute to our understanding of biological processes, and significantly advance biomedical research.",In-silico prediction of protein-peptide interactions.,10116950,R01GM096888,"['Amino Acids', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automobile Driving', 'Award', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biological', 'Biological Availability', 'Biological Process', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer software', 'Cyclic Peptides', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Documentation', 'Drug Design', 'Educational workshop', 'Feedback', 'Free Energy', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Half-Life', 'Influenza', 'Insulin', 'Libraries', 'Licensing', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mathematics', 'Mediating', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Mutate', 'Pathway interactions', 'Peptides', 'Performance', 'Peripheral', 'Permeability', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Process', 'Production', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Renaissance', 'Research', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Signal Pathway', 'Software Engineering', 'Software Framework', 'Software Tools', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Study models', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Thrombosis', 'Toxic effect', 'Training', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'combinatorial', 'computerized tools', 'computing resources', 'design', 'flexibility', 'globular protein', 'graphical user interface', 'improved', 'improved functioning', 'in silico', 'insight', 'interest', 'interoperability', 'novel', 'open source', 'peptide drug', 'predictive tools', 'programs', 'protein protein interaction', 'receptor', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'success', 'symposium', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'translational study', 'virtual screening']",NIGMS,SCRIPPS RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2020,399375,-0.0480989593299336
"SimTK: An Ecosystem for Data and Model Sharing in the Biomechanics Community Physics-based simulations provide a powerful framework for understanding biological form and function. They harmonize heterogeneous experimental data with real-world physical constraints, helping researchers understand biological systems as they engineer novel drugs, new diagnostics, medical devices, and surgical interventions. The rise in new sensors and simulation tools is generating an increasing amount of data, but this data is often inaccessible, preventing reuse and limiting scientific progress. In 2005, we launched SimTK, a website to develop and share biosimulation tools, models, and data, to address these issues. SimTK now supports 62,000+ researchers globally and 950+ projects. Members use it to meet their grants’ data sharing responsibilities; experiment with new ways of collaborating; and build communities around their datasets and tools. However, challenges remain: many researchers still do not share their digital assets due to the time needed to prepare, document, and maintain those assets, and since SimTK hosts a growing number of diverse digital assets, the site now also faces the challenge of making these assets discoverable and reusable. Thus, we propose a plan to extend SimTK and implement new solutions to promote scientific data sharing and reuse. First, we will maintain the reliable, user-friendly foundation upon which SimTK is built, continuing to provide the excellent support our members expect and supporting the site’s existing features for sharing and building communities. Second, we will implement methods to establish a culture of model and data sharing in the biomechanics community. We will encourage researchers to adopt new habits, making sharing part of their workflow, by enabling the software and systems they use to automatically upload models and data to SimTK via an application programming interface (API) and by recruiting leading researchers in the community to serve as beta testers and role models. Third, we will create tools to easily replicate and extend biomechanics simulations. Containers and cloud computing services allow researchers to capture and share a snapshot of their computing environment, enabling unprecedented fidelity in sharing. We will integrate these technologies into SimTK and provide custom, easy-to-use interfaces to replicate and extend simulation studies. Lastly, we will develop a metadata standard for models and data for the biomechanics community, increasing reusability and discoverability of the rich set of resources shared on SimTK. We will use the new standard on SimTK and fill in the metadata fields automatically using natural language processing and machine learning, minimizing the burden and inaccuracies of manual metadata entry. We will evaluate our success in achieving these aims by tracking the number of assets shared and the frequency they are used as a springboard to new research. These changes will accelerate biomechanics research and provide new tools to increase the reusability and impact of shared resources. By lowering barriers to data sharing in the biosimulation community, SimTK will continue to serve as a model for how to create national infrastructure for scientific subdisciplines. SimTK is a vibrant hub for the development and sharing of simulation software, data, and models of biological structures and processes. SimTK-based resources are being used to design medical devices and drugs, to generate new diagnostics, to create surgical interventions, and to provide insights into biology. The proposed enhancements to SimTK will accelerate progress in the field by lowering barriers to and standardizing data and model sharing, thus 1) increasing the quantity and also, importantly, the quality of resources that researchers share and 2) enabling others to reproduce and build on the wealth of past biomechanics research studies.",SimTK: An Ecosystem for Data and Model Sharing in the Biomechanics Community,9847973,R01GM124443,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Biomechanics', 'Biophysics', 'Cloud Computing', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Consumption', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Files', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Documentation', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Explosion', 'Face', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Habits', 'Infrastructure', 'Letters', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Device', 'Medical Device Designs', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physics', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Sharing', 'Resources', 'Security', 'Services', 'Site', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Update', 'Work', 'application programming interface', 'base', 'biological systems', 'biomechanical model', 'community building', 'complex biological systems', 'data access', 'data cleaning', 'data ecosystem', 'data reuse', 'data sharing', 'data standards', 'digital', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'insight', 'member', 'new technology', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel therapeutics', 'prevent', 'recruit', 'research study', 'response', 'role model', 'sensor', 'simulation', 'simulation software', 'software systems', 'success', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'web site']",NIGMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,489919,0.017339988568460953
"Leveraging Twitter to Monitor Nicotine and Tobacco Cancer Communication Patterns in Twitter data have revolutionized understanding of public health events such as influenza outbreaks. While researchers have begun to examine messaging related to substance use on Twitter, this project will strengthen the use of Twitter as an infoveillance tool to more rigorously examine nicotine, tobacco, and cancer- related communication. Twitter is particularly suited to this work because its users are commonly adolescents, young adults, and racial and ethnic minorities, all of whom are at increased risk for nicotine and tobacco product (NTP) use and related health consequences. Additionally, due to the openness of the platform, searches are replicable and transparent, enabling large-scale systematic research. Therefore, our multidisciplinary team of experts in diverse relevant fields—including public health, behavioral science, computational linguistics, computer science, biomedical informatics, and information privacy and security—will build upon our previous research to develop and validate structured algorithms providing automated surveillance of Twitter’s multifaceted and continuously evolving information related to NTPs. First, we will qualitatively assess a stratified random sample of relevant NTP-related tweets for specific coded variables, such as the message’s primary sentiment and other key information of potential value (e.g., whether a message involves buying/selling, policy/law, and cancer-related communication). Tweets will be obtained directly from Twitter using software we developed that leverages a comprehensive list of Twitter-optimized search strings related to NTPs. Second, we will statistically determine what message characteristics (e.g., the presence of certain words, punctuation, and/or structures) are most strongly associated with each of the coded variables for each search string. Using this information, we will create specialized Machine Learning (ML) algorithms based on state-of-the-art methods from Natural Language Processing (NLP) to automatically assess and categorize future Twitter data. Third, we will use this information to provide automatic assessment of current and future streaming data. Time series analyses using seasonal Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Averages (ARIMA) will determine if there are significant changes over time in volume of messaging related to each specific coded variables of interest. Trends will be examined at the daily, weekly, and monthly level, because each of these levels is potentially valuable for intervention. To maximize the translational value of this project, we will partner with public health department stakeholders who are experts in streamlining dissemination of actionable trends data. In summary, this project will substantially advance our understanding of representations of NTPs on social media—as well as our ability to conduct automated surveillance and analysis of this content. This project will result in important and concrete deliverables, including open-source algorithms for future researchers and processes to quickly disseminate actionable data for tailoring community- level interventions. For this project, we gathered a team of public health researchers and computer scientists to leverage the power of Twitter as a novel surveillance tool to better understand communication about nicotine and tobacco products (NTPs) and related messages about cancer and cancer prevention. We will gather a random sample of Twitter messages (“tweets”) related to NTPs and examine them in depth and use this information to create specialized computer algorithms that can automatically categorize future Twitter data. Then, we will examine changes over time related to attitudes towards and interest in NTPs, as well as cancer-related discussion around various NTPs, which will dramatically improve our ability to better understand Twitter as a tool for this type of surveillance.",Leveraging Twitter to Monitor Nicotine and Tobacco Cancer Communication,10111658,R01CA225773,"['Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Algorithms', 'Attitude', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Cancer Control', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Cigarette', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Linguistics', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'County', 'Data', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Electronic cigarette', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Event', 'Food', 'Football game', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Individual', 'Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype', 'Intervention', 'Laws', 'Linguistics', 'Literature', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Marketing', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nicotine', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Policies', 'Privacy', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Public Opinion', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Security', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco use', 'Twitter', 'Work', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'cancer prevention', 'computer program', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'data standards', 'data streams', 'ethnic minority population', 'geographic difference', 'hookah', 'improved', 'influenza outbreak', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'nicotine use', 'novel', 'open source', 'phrases', 'prospective', 'racial minority', 'social', 'social media', 'software development', 'statistics', 'time use', 'tobacco products', 'tool', 'trend', 'vaping', 'young adult']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF ARKANSAS AT FAYETTEVILLE,R01,2020,491992,-0.02486230488399517
"Scientific Questions: A New Target for Biomedical NLP Project Summary  Natural language processing (NLP) technology is now widespread (e.g. Google Translate) and has several important applications in biomedical research. We propose a new target for NLP: extraction of scientific questions stated in publications. A system that automatically captures and organizes scientific questions from across the biomedical literature could have a wide range of significant impacts, as attested to in our diverse collection of support letters from researchers, journal editors, educators and scientific foundations. Prior work focused on making binary (or probabilistic) assessments of whether a text is hedged or uncertain, with the goal of downgrading such statements in information extraction tasks—not computationally capturing what the uncertainty is about. In contrast, we propose an ambitious plan to identify, represent, integrate and reason about the content of scientific questions, and to demonstrate how this approach can be used to address two important new use cases in biomedical research: contextualizing experimental results and enhancing literature awareness. Contextualizing results is the task of linking elements of genome-scale results to open questions across all of biomedical research. Literature awareness is the ability to understand important characteristics of large, dynamic collections of research publications as a whole. We propose to produce rich computational representations of the dynamic evolution of research questions, and to prototype textual and visual interfaces to help students and researchers explore and develop a detailed understanding of key open scientific questions in any area of biomedical research. Project Narrative The scientific literature is full of statements of important unsolved questions. By using artificial intelligence systems to identify and categorize these questions, the proposed work would help other researchers discover when their findings might address an important question in another scientific area. This work would also make it easier for students, journal editors, conference organizers and others understand where science is headed by tracking the evolution of scientific questions.",Scientific Questions: A New Target for Biomedical NLP,10069773,R01LM013400,"['Address', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Awareness', 'Biomedical Research', 'Characteristics', 'Collection', 'Computerized Patient Records', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Evolution', 'Expert Systems', 'Foundations', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Information Retrieval', 'Journals', 'Letters', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Ontology', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Proteomics', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Semantics', 'Services', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Students', 'System', 'Taxonomy', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Uncertainty', 'Update', 'Visual', 'Work', 'design', 'dynamical evolution', 'experimental study', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'graduate student', 'high throughput screening', 'innovation', 'journal article', 'news', 'novel', 'pharmacovigilance', 'prototype', 'symposium', 'text searching', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'trend']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R01,2020,462393,0.00462405408951014
"A deep learning platform to evaluate the reliability of scientific claims by citation analysis. The opioid epidemic in the United States has been traced to a 1980 letter reporting in the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine that synthetic opioids are not addictive. A belated citation analysis led the journal to append this letter with a warning this letter has been “heavily and uncritically cited” as evidence that addiction is rare with opioid therapy.” This epidemic is but one example of how unreliable and uncritically cited scientific claims can affect public health, as studies from industry report that a substantial part of biomedical reports cannot be independently verified. Yet, there is no publicly available resource or indicator to determine how reliable a scientific claim is without becoming an expert on the subject or retaining one. The total citation count, the commonly used measure, is inherently a poor proxy for research quality because confirming and refuting citations are counted as equal, while the prestige of the journal is not a guarantee that a claim published there is true. The lack of indicators for the veracity of reported claims costs the public, businesses, and governments, billions of dollars per year. We have developed a prototype that automatically classifies statements citing a scientific claim into three classes: those that provide supporting or contradicting evidence, or merely mention the claim. This unique capability enables scite users to analyze the reliability of scientific claims at an unprecedented scale and speed, helping them to make better-informed decisions. The prototype has attracted potential customers among top biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, research institutions, academia, and academic publishers. We propose to conduct research that will refine scite into an MVP by optimizing prototype efficiency and accuracy until they reach feasible milestones, and will refine the product-market fit in our beachhead market, academic publishing, whose influence on the integrity and reliability of research is difficult to overestimate. We propose to develop a platform that can be used to evaluate the reliability of scientific claims. Our deep learning model, combined with a network of experts, automatically classifies citations as supporting, contradicting, or mentioning, allowing users to easily assess the veracity of scientific articles and consequently researchers. By introducing a system that can identify how a research article has been cited, not just how many times, we can assess research better than traditional analytical approaches, thus helping to improve public health by identifying and promoting reliable research and by increasing the return on public and private investment in research.",A deep learning platform to evaluate the reliability of scientific claims by citation analysis.,10136941,R44DA050155,"['Academia', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Architecture', 'Biotechnology', 'Businesses', 'Classification', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Epidemic', 'Government', 'Human', 'Industry', 'Institution', 'Investments', 'Journals', 'Letters', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Marketing', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'New England', 'Performance', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Privatization', 'Program Description', 'Proxy', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Readiness', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Sales', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Speed', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Vision', 'Visual system structure', 'addiction', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'dashboard', 'deep learning', 'design', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'learning classifier', 'literature citation', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid therapy', 'product development', 'programs', 'prototype', 'synthetic opioid', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NIDA,"SCITE, INC.",R44,2020,746725,-0.055558746185608646
"Image-guided Biocuration of Disease Pathways From Scientific Literature Realization of precision medicine ideas requires an unprecedented rapid pace of translation of biomedical discoveries into clinical practice. However, while many non-canonical disease pathways and uncommon drug actions, which are of vital importance for understanding individual patient-specific disease pathways, are accumulated in the literature, most are not organized in databases. Currently, such knowledge is curated manually or semi-automatically in a very limited scope. Meanwhile, the volume of biomedical information in PubMed (currently 28 million publications) keeps growing by more than a million articles per year, which demands more efficient and effective biocuration approaches.  To address this challenge, a novel biocuration method for automatic extraction of disease pathways from figures and text of biomedical articles will be developed.  Specific Aim 1: To develop focused benchmark sets of articles to assess the performance of the biocuration pipeline.  Specific Aim 2: To develop a method for extraction of components of disease pathways from articles’ figures based on deep-learning techniques.  Specific Aim 3: To develop a method for reconstruction of disease-specific pathways through enrichment and through graph neural network (GNN) approaches.  Specific Aim 4: To conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the pipeline.  The overarching goal of this project is to develop a computer-based automatic biocuration ecosystem for rapid transformation of free-text biomedical literature into a machine-processable format for medical applications.  The overall impact of the proposed project will be to significantly improve health outcomes in individualized patient cases by efficiently bringing the latest biomedical discoveries into a precision medicine setting.

"Arkansas Bioinformatics Consortium Project Summary/Abstract The Arkansas Research Alliance proposes to hold five annual workshops on the subject of bioinformatics. The purpose is to bring six major Arkansas institutions into closer collaboration. Those institutions are: University of Arkansas-Fayetteville; Arkansas State University; University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences; University of Arkansas at Little Rock; University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff; and the National Center for Toxicological Research. The workshops will focus on capabilities at each of the six in sciences related to bioinformatics including artificial intelligence, big data, machine learning, food and agriculture, high speed computing, and visualization capabilities. As this work progresses, educational coordination and student encouragement will be important components. Principals from all six institutions are collaborating to accomplish the workshop goals. Project Narrative The FDA ability to protect the public health is directly related to its ability to access and utilize the latest scientific data. Increased proficiency in collecting, presenting, validating, understanding, and drawing quantitative inference from the massive volume of new scientific results is necessary for success in that effort. The complexity involved requires continued development of new tools available and being developed within the realm of information technology, and the workshops proposed here will address this need. Specific Aims  • Thoroughly understand the resources in Arkansas available for furthering the capabilities in  bioinformatics and its associated needs, e.g., access to high speed computing capability and use  of computational tools. • Develop a set of plans to harness and grow those capabilities, especially those that are relevant  to the needs of NCTR and FDA. • Stimulate interest and capability across Arkansas in bioinformatics to produce a larger cadre of  expertise as these plans are implemented. • Enlist NCTR’s help in directing the effort toward seeking local, national and international data  that can be more effectively analyzed to produce results needed by FDA and others, e.g.,  reviewing decades of genomic/treatment data on myeloma patients at the University of  Arkansas for Medical Sciences. • Develop ways in which the Arkansas capabilities can be combined into a coordinated, synergistic  force larger than the sum of its parts. • Encourage students and faculty in the development of new models and techniques to be used in  bioinformatics and related fields. • Improve inter-institutional communication, including developing standardized bioinformatics  curricula and more universal course acceptance.",Arkansas Bioinformatics Consortium,9961522,R13FD006690,[' '],FDA,ARKANSAS RESEARCH ALLIANCE,R13,2020,15000,-0.02670718442148048

"BECKON - Block Estimate Chain: creating Knowledge ON demand & protecting privacy 7. Project Summary/Abstract With the wide adoption of electronic health record systems, cross-institutional genomic medicine predictive modeling is becoming increasingly important, and have the potential to enable generalizable models to accelerate research and facilitate quality improvement initiatives. For example, understanding whether a particular variable has clinical significance depends on a variety of factors, one important one being statistically significant associations between the variant and clinical phenotypes. Multivariate models that predict predisposition to disease or outcomes after receiving certain therapeutic agents can help propel genomic medicine into mainstream clinical care. However, most existing privacy-preserving machine learning methods that have been used to build predictive models given clinical data are based on centralized architecture, which presents security and robustness vulnerabilities such as single-point-of-failure. In this proposal, we will develop novel methods for decentralized privacy-preserving genomic medicine predictive modeling, which can advance comparative effectiveness research, biomedical discovery, and patient-care. Our first aim is to develop a predictive modeling framework on private Blockchain networks. This aim relies on the Blockchain technology and consensus protocols, as well as the online and batch machine learning algorithms, to provide an open-source Blockchain-based privacy-preserving predictive modeling library for further Blockchain-related studies and applications. We will characterize settings in which Blockchain technology offers advances over current technologies. The second aim is to develop a Blockchain-based privacy-preserving genomic medicine modeling architecture for real-world clinical data research networks. These aims are devoted to the mission of the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) to develop biomedical technologies with application domain of genomics and healthcare. The NIH Pathway to Independence Award provides a great opportunity for the applicant to complement his computer science background with biomedical knowledge, and specialized training in machine learning and knowledge-based systems. It will also allow him to investigate new techniques to advance genomic and healthcare privacy protection. The success of the proposed project will help his long-term career goal of obtaining a faculty position at a biomedical informatics program at a major US research university and conduct independently funded research in the field of decentralized privacy-preserving computation. 8. Project Narrative The proposed research will develop practical methods to support privacy-preserving genomic and healthcare predictive modeling, and build innovations based on Blockchain technology for secure and robust machine learning training processes. The development of such privacy technology may increase public trust in research and quality improvement.

"Nathan Shock Center of Excellence in Basic Biology of Aging OVERALL PROJECT SUMMARY This application is for renewal of the Nathan Shock Center of Excellence in the Basic Biology of Aging at the University of Washington and affiliated institutions. This Center has over the past 25 years provided key resources in support of investigators who study the biology of aging. This application continues a theme that emphasizes outreach and service to the broadest community of investigators in the gerosciences. Of proximal relevance is the characterization of aging-related phenotypes of longevity and healthspan. As our Center services must be easily accessible to outside users, our Longevity and Healthspan Core (Core E) focuses on invertebrate assays, many of them novel. Two other Resources Cores focus on the high dimensional assessments that are closely related to aging phenotypes: Protein Phenotypes of Aging (Core C) and Metabolite Phenotypes of Aging (Core D). Sophisticated computational and bioinformatic tools for data analysis and optimal insight are provided by the Artificial Intelligence and Bioinformatics Core F. Each of these four Resource Cores is led by highly respected experts in that field, including Michael MacCoss and Judit Villen (Core C), Daniel Promislow (Core D), Matt Kaeberlein and Maitreya Dunham (Core E) and Su-In Lee (Core F). Each will push the envelope of appropriate technologies, developing new state-of-the art approaches for assessments that are the most applicable to gerontology and making them accessible to the national aging community. The Research Development Core (Core B) will continue to support pilot and junior faculty studies, with a firm focus on outreach of service to the national geroscience constituency. The Administrative and Program Enrichment Core (Core A) supports administrative management, an external advisory panel, courses, and data sharing and dissemination. Core A’s program of seminars and symposia will continue a focus on sponsorship and organization of national courses, meetings and pre-meetings, as well as workshops in the fields allied to our Resource Core Services. In coordination with other Nathan Shock Centers, we will support a new Geropathology Research initiative.

"THE XNAT IMAGING INFORMATICS PLATFORM PROJECT SUMMARY This proposal aims to continue the development of XNAT. XNAT is an imaging informatics platform designed to facilitate common management and productivity tasks for imaging and associated data. We will develop the next generation of XNAT technology to support the ongoing evolution of imaging research. Development will focus on modernizing and expanding the current system. In Aim 1, we will implement new web application infrastructure that includes a new archive file management system, a new event bus to manage cross-service orchestration and a new Javascript library to simplify user interface development. We will also implement new core services, including a Docker Container service, a dynamic scripting engine, and a global XNAT federation. In Aim 2, we will implement two innovative new capabilities that build on the services developed in Aim 1. The XNAT Publisher framework will streamline the process of data sharing by automating the creation and curation of data releases following best practices for data publication and stewardship. The XNAT Machine Learning framework will streamline the development and use of machine learning applications by integrating XNAT with the TensorFlow machine learning environment and implementing provenance and other monitoring features to help avoid the pitfalls that often plague machine learning efforts. For both Aim 1 and 2, all capabilities will be developed and evaluated in the context of real world scientific programs that are actively using the XNAT platform. In Aim 3, we will provide extensive support to the XNAT community, including training workshops, online documentation, discussion forums, and . These activities will be targeted at both XNAT users and developers. RELEVANCE Medical imaging is one of the key methods used by biomedical researchers to study human biology in health and disease. The imaging informatics platform described in this application will enable biomedical researchers to capture, analyze, and share imaging and related data. These capabilities address key bottlenecks in the pathway to discovering cures to complex diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, cancer, and heart disease.",THE XNAT IMAGING INFORMATICS PLATFORM,10002330,R01EB009352,"['Address', 'Administrator', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Architecture', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Automation', 'Biomedical Research', 'Brain', 'Cardiology', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Documentation', 'Educational workshop', 'Ensure', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heart Diseases', 'Human', 'Human Biology', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Infrastructure', 'Instruction', 'Internet', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Neurosciences', 'Newsletter', 'Optics', 'Paper', 'Pathway interactions', 'Peer Review', 'Persons', 'Plague', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Security', 'Services', 'System', 'Technology', 'TensorFlow', 'Training', 'Validation', 'base', 'biomedical resource', 'computer framework', 'computing resources', 'data curation', 'data sharing', 'design', 'distributed data', 'educational atmosphere', 'hackathon', 'imaging informatics', 'imaging program', 'improved', 'informatics tool', 'innovation', 'next generation', 'online tutorial', 'open source', 'outreach program', 'pre-clinical', 'programs', 'skills', 'symposium', 'tool', 'virtual', 'web app']",NIBIB,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,653481,-0.004649271000496915
"Boston University CCCR OVERALL ABSTRACT The Boston University CCCR will serve as a central resource for clinical research focused mostly on the most common musculoskeletal disorders, osteoarthritis and gout and will also provide research resources for investigator based research in scleroderma, spondyloarthritis, musculoskeletal pain and osteoporosis. Center grant funding has supported 30-35 papers annually in peer reviewed journals, most in the leading arthritis journals and some in leading general medical journals. This center has trained many of the leading clinical researchers in rheumatology throughout the US and internationally, and many of these former trainees have active collaborations with the center. We will include a broad research community and a core group of faculty in this CCCR. The research community's ready access to core faculty and to the sophisticated research methods and assistance they provide will enhance the clinical and translational research of the community and will increase collaborative opportunities for the core faculty and the community. The CCCR updates BU's historical focus on epidemiologic methods to include new approaches to causal inference and adds new methods in machine learning and mobile health. The Research and Evaluation Support Core Unit (RESCU) is the focal point of this CCCR. A key feature is the weekly research (RESCU meetings in which ongoing and proposed research projects are critically evaluated. This feature ensures frequent interactions between clinician researchers, epidemiologists and biostatisticians who are the core members of the CCCR. The RESCU core unit has provided critical support for other Center grants related to rheumatic and arthritic disorders at Boston University, three current R01/U01's; five current NIH K awards (one K24, 3 K23's, one K01), an R03, an NIH trial planning grant (U34), and multiple ACR RRF awards. The overall goal of this center is to carry out and disseminate high-level clinical research informed both by state of the art clinical research methods and by clinical and biological scientific discoveries.

"Graphical Processing Units and a Large-Memory Compute Node for Applications in Genomics, Neuroscience, and Structural Biology Project Summary  Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL) is a private, not-for-profit institution dedicated to research and education in biology, with leading research programs in genomics, neuroscience, quantitative biology, plant biology, and cancer. Many activities at CSHL depend critically on high-performance computing resources, but at present, investigators have limited access to Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) and large-memory compute nodes. This deficiency is beginning to hamper a wide variety of biomedical research activities, particularly in the key areas of genomics, neuroscience and structural biology, where such specialty hardware is becoming essential for many important computational analyses. Here, we propose to acquire four state-of-the-art GPU nodes, each equipped with eight Nvidia Tesla V100, SXM2, 32GB GPUs, two 20-core 2.5 GHz Intel Xeon-Gold 6248 (Cascade Lake) processors, and 768 GB of RAM. A second-generation Nvidia NVLink will provide for 300 GB/s inter-GPU communication. In addition, we propose to acquire one large-memory node with 3 TB of RAM and four 20-core 2.5 GHz Intel Xeon-Gold 6248 (Cascade Lake) processors, as well as a top-of-rack 10 Gb Ethernet switch to interconnect the servers with each other and with our existing computer cluster. These new resources will enable a wide variety of innovative research across fields, with direct implications for human health. In genomics, applications will include RNA-seq read mapping; alignment, base-calling, and genome assembly for long-read sequence data; clustering of single cell RNA-seq data; analysis of transposable elements; deep-learning methods for prediction of the fitness consequences of mutations; and deep-learning methods for interpreting high-throughput mutagenesis experiments. In neuroscience, they will include analysis of multi-neuron activity recordings; analysis of mouse brain images; and artificial neural network models of the human olfactory system, of audio features, and of behavior as a function of changing motivations. In structural biology, they will include image processing and 3D reconstruction from cryo-electron microscopy data. These new compute nodes will have a primary impact on the research programs of nine major users from the CSHL faculty with substantial NIH funding. They will also impact three minor users. The new GPU and large-memory nodes will be fully integrated with a soon-to-be-upgraded high-performance computer cluster and managed by the experienced Information Technology group at CSHL, with oversight from a committee of seven faculty members and two IT staff members. Altogether, these new computational resources will substantially enhance the overall computational infrastructure at CSHL. Project Narrative  Many areas of modern biomedical research depend critically on state-of-the-art computing resources. Here we propose to acquire two types of specialty computer hardware: four Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) nodes and a large-memory compute node, both of which will be fully integrated with an existing and soon-to-be-upgraded high-performance computer cluster. These resources will meet a wide variety of computing needs across research areas at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, particularly in the growing areas of genomics, neuroscience, and structural biology.","Graphical Processing Units and a Large-Memory Compute Node for Applications in Genomics, Neuroscience, and Structural Biology",9939826,S10OD028632,"['3-Dimensional', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Brain imaging', 'Communication', 'Computer Analysis', 'Cryoelectron Microscopy', 'DNA Transposable Elements', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Education', 'Faculty', 'Funding', 'Generations', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Gold', 'Health', 'High Performance Computing', 'Human', 'Information Technology', 'Institution', 'Laboratories', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Memory', 'Minor', 'Motivation', 'Mus', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutation', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Olfactory Pathways', 'Plants', 'Privatization', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'computer cluster', 'computer infrastructure', 'computing resources', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'fitness', 'high end computer', 'image processing', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'medical specialties', 'member', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'structural biology', 'transcriptome sequencing']",OD,COLD SPRING HARBOR LABORATORY,S10,2020,436882,-0.017689010284119327
"Developing novel technologies that ensure privacy and security in biomedical data science research Data science holds the promise of enabling new pathways to discovery and can improve the understanding, prevention and treatment of complex disorders such as cancer, diabetes, substance abuse, etc., which are significantly on the rise. The promise of data science can be fully realized only when collected data can be collaboratively shared and analyzed. However, the widespread increases in healthcare data breaches due to inappropriate access as well as the increasing number of novel privacy attacks restrict institutions from sharing data. Indeed, in some cases, the results of the analysis can themselves lead to significant privacy harm. The success of the data commons depends on ensuring the maximal access to data, subject to all of the patient privacy requirements including those mandated by legislation, and all of the constraints of the organization collecting the data itself. While there are existing solutions that can solve parts of the problem, there are significant challenges in truly incorporating these into comprehensive working solutions that are usable by the biomedical research community, and new challenges brought on by modern techniques such as deep learning. The long-term goal of this research is to develop technologies that can holistically enable data sharing while respecting privacy and security considerations and to ensure that they are implemented in existing platforms that have widespread acceptance in the research community. Towards this, the objective of this project is to develop complementary solutions for risk inference, distributed learning, and access control that can enable different modalities of data sharing. The problems studied are general in nature and will evolve depending on research successes and new impediments that arise. The proposed program of research is significant since lack of access to biomedical data can lead to fragmentation of care, resulting in higher economic and social costs, and is a significant impediment to biomedical research. The project will result in open-source, freely available software tools that will be integrated into widely used data collection, cohort identification, and distributed analytics platforms. There are several ongoing collaborations that will serve as initial pilot customers to provide use cases, identify the requirements, evaluate results, and in general validate the developed solutions. Project Narrative Statement of Relevance to Public Health Being able to ensure privacy and security while enabling data sharing and analysis is critical to pave the way forward for public health research and improve our understanding of diseases. The proposed work will address the challenges that impede the use of data across all of the different modalities of data sharing. The integration into existing platforms will ensure that the developed models, tools, and solutions directly impact the research community and improve public health interventions.",Developing novel technologies that ensure privacy and security in biomedical data science research,9851602,R35GM134927,"['Address', 'Biomedical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Commons', 'Data Science', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Economics', 'Ensure', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Institution', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Nature', 'Pathway interactions', 'Prevention', 'Privacy', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Security', 'Software Tools', 'Statutes and Laws', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Work', 'biomedical data science', 'care fragmentation', 'cohort', 'cost', 'data sharing', 'deep learning', 'improved', 'new technology', 'novel', 'open source', 'patient privacy', 'programs', 'public health intervention', 'public health research', 'social', 'success', 'tool']",NIGMS,RUTGERS THE STATE UNIV OF NJ NEWARK,R35,2020,382108,0.012002924201523478
"Preparing the Next Generation of Biostatisticians in the Era of Data and Translational Sciences PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT In the era of newly emerging computational tools for data science, biostatisticians need to play a fundamental role in health sciences research. There is an urgent need to encourage US Citizens and Permanent Residents to pursue graduate training in biostatistics. The design, conduct, and analysis of clinical trials and observational studies; the setting of regulatory policy; and the conception of laboratory experiments have been shaped by the fundamental contributions of biostatisticians for decades. Advances in genomics, medical imaging technologies, and computational biology; the increasing emphasis on precision and evidence-based medicine; and the widespread adoption of electronic health records; demand the skills of biostatisticians trained to collaborate effectively in a multidisciplinary environment and to develop statistical and machine learning methods to address the challenges presented by this data-rich revolutionary era of health sciences research. The proposed summer program which includes world-renowned clinical scientists and biostatisticians from two local universities, will provide an immense opportunity for student participants to learn basic yet modern statistical methods that are critical to uncovering new insights from such big and complex biomedical data and also illustrate the potential pitfalls of confounding and bias that may arise when analyzing biomedical data. A unique feature of the proposed training program is thus to expose the participants to not only basic statistical methods but also to the topics of computer science and bioinformatics which will be invaluable in creating the multidisciplinary teams required to tackle the complex research questions that often requires multipronged approaches. The proposed six-week training program will be structured around the NIH's Translation Science Spectrum and will introduce participants to opportunities in biostatistics through the lens of the science advanced by the contributions of biostatisticians. Following an initial set of weeks on basic training of biostatistical methods, the program will culminate in a data hack-a-thon style competition in which participants will employ the statistical and scientific knowledge gained during the program to produce the most innovative, statistically-sound, scientifically-relevant and effectively-communicated response to a set of research questions. The proposed research education program will enroll up to 20 such participants from across the nation and, through lectures, field trips, and opportunities to analyze data from real health sciences, inspire them to pursue graduate training. The program will draw upon considerable past collaborations and complementary resources of two local world-renowned universities to provide participants with an unparalleled view of the field, including award-winning instructors, internationally known methodological and clinical researchers, and a local area rich in opportunities to showcase careers in biostatistics. Special efforts will be made to enroll participants from underrepresented groups. Participants will be followed after completion, and the numbers attending graduate school in statistics and pursuing biostatistics careers will be documented. PROJECT NARRATIVE Biostatisticians are indispensible contributors to health sciences research. The demand for professionals with advanced training in biostatistics is high and will continue to increase, especially with the expanding challenges posed by big biomedical data. This six week summer research education program, a joint effort of North Carolina State University and Duke University, will enroll up to 20 US citizen/permanent resident participants from across the nation in the summers of 2020-2022 and expose them to the opportunities presented by careers in biostatistics and encourage them to seek graduate training in the field.",Preparing the Next Generation of Biostatisticians in the Era of Data and Translational Sciences,9888421,R25HL147228,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biomedical Research', 'Biometry', 'Biostatistical Methods', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Conceptions', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Exposure to', 'Faculty', 'Future', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health Sciences', 'Health system', 'Imaging technology', 'Institution', 'International', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical center', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Names', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'North Carolina', 'Observational Study', 'Participant', 'Play', 'Policies', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Principal Investigator', 'Program Effectiveness', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Statistical Methods', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Talents', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'Underrepresented Groups', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'analytical method', 'big biomedical data', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical trial analysis', 'cohort', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'data resource', 'design', 'education research', 'experience', 'field trip', 'graduate student', 'health science research', 'innovation', 'insight', 'instructor', 'interest', 'investigator training', 'laboratory experiment', 'lectures', 'lens', 'machine learning method', 'multidisciplinary', 'next generation', 'programs', 'public health research', 'recruit', 'response', 'skills', 'sound', 'statistical and machine learning', 'statistics', 'summer institute', 'summer program', 'summer research', 'tool', 'undergraduate student']",NHLBI,NORTH CAROLINA STATE UNIVERSITY RALEIGH,R25,2020,249789,-0.03193645072889063
"Center for Modeling Complex Interactions Biomedical problems are innately complex, and their solutions require input from many fields. Many centers focus on a single disease or organ system. By contrast, the Center for Modeling Complex Interactions focuses on an approach that can address many biomedical problems: team-based, interdisciplinary research centered around modeling. Our goal is to support and facilitate biomedical discovery by integrating modeling into interdisciplinary research. Modeling improves research at all stages—hypothesis formulation, experimental design, analysis, and interpretation. It provides a unifying language by which exchange of ideas can highlight commonalities and uncover unforeseen connections between problems. Formalization of ideas into this unifying language also improves rigor and reproducibility. We define modeling broadly to include everything from deterministic and stochastic mathematical approaches, to physical and computational models of three- dimensional objects, to agent-based and machine learning approaches where exact solutions are not possible. We seek to support modelers by increasing their numbers, and by giving them opportunities to play on interdisciplinary teams. We seek to support empiricists by giving them access to relevant modeling expertise, and by creating a community and a culture to facilitate interdisciplinary research. In Phase I, the Center for Modeling Complex Interactions created the intellectual, cultural, and physical environment to promote team- based, interdisciplinary research. In Phase II, we will build on that foundation by maintaining a strong interdisciplinary culture to foster collaboration among people who might otherwise never connect, and by adding additional faculty to expand our modeling expertise. We have four Aims: 1) Support faculty to carry out model-based, interdisciplinary biomedical research and increase their competitiveness for external funding. Research in the Center is carried out in the context of Working Groups—zero-barrier, interdisciplinary, goal- focused teams that meet regularly to get work done. Supported research includes three Research Projects, Pilot Projects, Modeling Access Grants, and ad hoc teams. Our comprehensive plan for proposal preparation improves grantsmanship, and our staff assists with submission and grant management. 2) Increase University of Idaho’s faculty participation in biomedical research. We will add six new faculty as a commitment to this Phase II COBRE and attract broader participation from across the University. 3) Extend the reach of the Modeling Core into new areas of modeling to capitalize on emerging opportunities. The Modeling Core accelerates interdisciplinary research by placing Core Fellows at the hub of the research community. We have added new Core Initiatives in machine learning and geospatial modeling to stimulate research in these areas with high potential for future growth. 4) Establish a path to long-term sustainability under the umbrella of the Institute for Modeling Collaboration & Innovation. The major hurdle for sustainability is to maintain a robust Modeling Core. We have developed a business plan that calls for us to diversify our funding sources to include institutional, state, and private support to supplement federal grants. Human health is determined by interactions of complex biological systems at multiple scales, from the ecological to the biophysical; these are layered with spatial and temporal variation. To decipher these systems requires predictive modeling, coupled with strong empirical work, to be guided by and to feed the models.

"N3C & All of Us Research Program Collaborative Project Project Summary/Abstract The COVID-19 pandemic presents unprecedented clinical and public health challenges. Though institutions collect large amounts of clinical data about COVID-19 cases, these datasets individually might not be diverse enough to draw population level conclusions. Also, statistical, machine learning, and causal analyses are most successful with large-scale data beyond what is available in any given organization. To tackle this problem, NCATS introduced the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C), an open science, community-based initiative to share patient level data for analysis. The initiative requires participating institutions to share information about their COVID-19 patients in a standard-driven way, including demographics, vital signs, diagnoses, laboratory results, medications, and other treatments. The data from multiple institutions will be merged and consolidated, and access will be provided to investigators through a centralized analytical platform. The COVID-19 data sharing collaboration with the N3C initiative offers a mechanism to initiate collaborations with other NIH sponsored data sharing programs, such as the All of Us Research Program (AoURP). This administrative supplement will support efforts to clean and standardize data at VCU, and to transfer it to the N3C data repository. The supplement will also assist in introducing new services at the Wright Center to support our investigators to use the N3C resources. It will also enable collaboration with the AoURP by establishing a pipeline to collect and transmit consented patients' EHR data and by building on existing community outreach pathways to recruit additional participants for the AoURP. The project will be overseen by the PI/Executive Committee and supervised by the Director of Research Informatics. Procedures and services developed at our local CTSA hub will be shared and disseminated to the CTSA network. Project Narrative NIH/NCATS has been working on the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C), which aims to build a centralized national data resource to be used by the research community to study the COVID-19 pandemic and identify potential treatments as the pandemic continues to evolve. The COVID-19 data sharing collaboration with the N3C initiative also offers a mechanism to initiate collaborations with the All of Us Research Program (AoURP).

"Meta-analysis in human brain mapping This is the competing renewal of R01MH074457-13, which sustains the BrainMap Project (www.brainmap.org). The overall goal of the BrainMap Project is to provide the human neuroimaging community with curated data sets, metadata, computational tools, and related resources that enable coordinate-based meta-analyses (CBMA), meta-analytic connectivity modeling (MACM), meta-data informed interpretation (“decoding”) of imaging results, and meta-analytic priors for mining (including machine learning) primary (per-subject) neuroimaging data. To date, the BrainMap Project has designed and populated two coordinate-based databases: 1) a task-activation repository (TA DB); and, 2) a voxel-based morphometry repository (VBM DB). The TA DB contains >17,200 experiments, collectively representing > 78,000 subjects and > 110 task- activation paradigms. The VBM DB contains > 3,100 experiments, collectively representing > 81,000 subjects with > 80 psychiatric, neurologic and developmental disorders with ICD-10 coding. The BrainMap Project has created, optimized and validated an integrated pipeline of multi-platform (Javascript), open-access tools to curate (Scribe), filter and retrieve (Sleuth), analyze (GingerALE), visualize (Mango) and interpret analysis output (BrainMap meta-data plugins for Mango). Several network-modeling approaches have been applied to BrainMap data -- MACM, independent components analysis (ICA), graph theory modeling (GTM), author-topic modeling (ATM), structural equation modeling (SEM), and connectivity-based parcellation (CBP) – but none are yet pipeline components. Utilization of these CBMA resources is substantial: BrainMap software, data and meta-data have been used in > 825 peer-reviewed publications. Of these, > 350 were published within the current funding period (April 2015-March 2019; brainmap.org/pubs). In this competing renewal, four tool- development aims are proposed, each of which extends this high-impact research resource. Aim 1. Database Expansion. BrainMap data repositories will be expanded. Aim 2. Meta-analytic Network Modeling. Network modeling will be added to the BrainMap pipeline. Aim 3. Large-Scale Simulations, Comparisons and Validations.

BrainMap data, meta-data, pipeline tools, and templates created by whole-database modeling (e.g., ICA and ATM network masks) are shared at BrainMap.org. Of all new data entries, more than half are contributed by BrainMap users, i.e., community data sharing via BrainMap.org. For community-coded entries, the BrainMap team provides curation and quality control. Comprehensive database images (database dumps) are available to tool developers through Collaborative Use Agreements.

"DOCKET: accelerating knowledge extraction from biomedical data sets Component type: This Knowledge Provider project will continue and significantly extend work done by the Translator Consortium Blue Team, focusing on deriving knowledge from real-world data through complex analytic workflows, integrated to the Translator Knowledge Graph, and served via tools like Big GIM and the Translator Standard API. The problem: We aim to solve the “first mile” problem of translational research: how to integrate the multitude of dynamic small-to-large data sets that have been produced by the research and clinical communities, but that are in different locations, processed in different ways, and in a variety of formats that may not be mutually interoperable. Integrating these data sets requires significant manual work downloading, reformatting, parsing, indexing and analyzing each data set in turn. The technical and ethical challenges of accessing diverse collections of big data, efficiently selecting information relevant to different users’ interests, and extracting the underlying knowledge are problems that remain unsolved. Here, we propose to leverage lessons distilled from our previous and ongoing big data analysis projects to develop a highly automated tool for removing these bottlenecks, enabling researchers to analyze and integrate many valuable data sets with ease and efficiency, and making the data FAIR [1]. Plan: (AIM 1) We will analyze and extract knowledge from rich real-world biomedical data sets (listed in the Resources page) in the domains of wellness, cancer, and large-scale clinical records. (AIM 2) We will formalize methods from Aim 1 to develop DOCKET, a novel tool for onboarding and integrating data from multiple domains. (AIM 3) We will work with other teams to adapt DOCKET to additional knowledge domains. ■ The DOCKET tool will offer 3 modules: (1) DOCKET Overview: Analysis of, and knowledge extraction from, an individual data set. (2) DOCKET Compare: Comparing versions of the same data set to compute confidence values, and comparing different data sets to find commonalities. (3) DOCKET Integrate: Deriving knowledge through integrating different data sets. ■ Researchers will be able to parameterize these functions, resolve inconsistencies, and derive knowledge through the command line, Jupyter notebooks, or other interfaces as specified by Translator Standards. ■ The outcome will be a collection of nodes and edges, richly annotated with context, provenance and confidence levels, ready for incorporation into the Translator Knowledge Graph (TKG). ■ All analyses and derived knowledge will be stored in standardized formats, enabling querying through the Reasoner Std API and ingestion into downstream AI assisted machine learning. ■ Example questions this will allow us to address include: (Wellness) Which clinical analytes, metabolites, proteins, microbiome taxa, etc. are significantly correlated, and which changing analytes predict transition to which disease? [2,3] (Cancer) Which gene mutations in any of X pathways are associated with sensitivity or resistance to any of Y drugs, in cell lines from Z tumor types? (All data sets) Which data set entities are similar to this one? Are there significant clusters? What distinguishes between the clusters? What significant correlations of attributes can be observed? How can this set of entities be expanded by adding similar ones? How do these N versions of this data set differ, and how stable is each knowledge edge as the data set changes over time? Collaboration strengths: Our team has extensive experience with biomedical and domainagnostic data analytics, integrating multiple relevant data types: omics, clinical measurements and electronic health records (EHRs). We have participated in large collaborative consortia and have subject matter experts willing to advise on proper data interpretation. Our application synergizes with those of other Translator teams (see Letters of Collaboration). Challenges: Data can come in a bewildering diversity of formats. Our solution will be modular, will address the most common formats first, and will leverage established technologies like DataFrames and importers (like pandas.io) where possible. Mapping nodes and edge types onto standard ontologies is crucial for knowledge integration; we will collaborate with the Standards component to maximize success. n/a",DOCKET: accelerating knowledge extraction from biomedical data sets,10057127,OT2TR003443,"['Address', 'Big Data', 'Cell Line', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ethics', 'FAIR principles', 'Gene Mutation', 'Individual', 'Ingestion', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Extraction', 'Letters', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Provider', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Standardization', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Translational Research', 'Work', 'experience', 'indexing', 'interest', 'interoperability', 'knowledge graph', 'knowledge integration', 'large datasets', 'microbiome', 'novel', 'success', 'tool', 'tumor']",NCATS,INSTITUTE FOR SYSTEMS BIOLOGY,OT2,2020,609068,-0.011267585591585673

All Alliance universities and affiliates have provided substantial resources and contributed to the planning, development and leadership of the consortium. With access to ~7 million people, NJ ACTS serves as a ‘natural laboratory’ for translational and clinical research. With a state population of ~9 million, New Jersey ranks 11th in the US, 1st in population density and higher than average in racial and ethnic diversity. Surprisingly, NJ has no CTSA Hub to coordinate translational and clinical research. Our CTSA Hub focuses on two overarching themes: the heterogeneity of disease pathogenesis and response to treatment, and the value of linking large clinical databases with interventional clinical investigations to identify cause-and-effect and predict therapeutic responses. NJ ACTS will provide: innovative approaches to link information from large databases and electronic health records to inform clinical trial design, execution and analysis; and novel platforms for biomarker discovery using fluorescence in situ hybridization and machine learning to identify unique neural signatures of chronic illness. NJ ACTS will access a large health system with significant member diversity; a rich legacy of community engagement and community-based research platforms; and proven approaches to enhance workforce development in clinical research. With a substantial investment in streamlining research administration and IRB practices at Rutgers and with the inception of NJ ACTS, there exists an unparalleled opportunity for logarithmic growth in clinical research in New Jersey. To build our capacity for participant and clinical interactions as a CTSA Hub, the newly established Trial Accelerator and Recruitment Office will coordinate feasibility assessment, implementation, recruitment, and evaluation of clinical studies. Additionally, our organization of five clinical research units into a cohesive network provides extraordinary expertise in strategic locations to enhance participant recruitment from diverse communities with a particular focus on: children; the elderly; those with serious mental illness or substance abuse issues; low-income individuals served by Medicaid; those with HIV/AIDS; and people of all ages who are minorities, underserved, and victims of health and environmental disparities. With a history of collaboration, partners and affiliates share unique skills, expertise, training and mentoring capabilities that will be greatly amplified within the infrastructure of a CTSA Hub. Princeton and NJIT, without medical schools or hospital affiliates, seeks collaboration with Rutgers to provide clinical research platforms; Rutgers seeks the PU and NJIT expertise in novel informatics platforms, expertise in natural language and ontology, machine learning and cognitive neurosciences.

"Unifying Templates, Ontologies and Tools to Achieve Effective Annotation of Bioassay Protocols Project Summary Biological assays are the foundation for developing chemical probes and drugs, but new Big Data approaches – which have revolutionized other areas of biomedical science – have not yet advanced this early step of biomedical research: analysis of assay data. The obstacle is that scientists specify their assays through text descriptions written in scientific English, which need to be translated into standardized annotations readable by computers. This lack of standardized and machine-readable assay descriptions is a major impediment to manage, find, aggregate, compare, re-use, and learn from the ever-growing corpus of assays (e.g., >1.2 million in PubChem). Thus, there is a critical need for better annotation and curation tools for drug discovery assays. However, the process to go from a simple text protocol to highly detailed machine-readable semantic annotations is not trivial. Multiple tools and technologies are required: ontologies or the structured controlled vocabularies; templates that map specific vocabularies to properties that are to be captured; and software tools to actually apply these ontologies to a given text. Currently, each of these exists in isolation; yet, a bottleneck in any one tool or technology, or a gap between the different pieces, disrupts the overall process, resulting in poor or no annotation of the datasets. Here we propose a project to combine and integrate these three technologies (which are also the core competencies of the three groups collaborating on this proposal). We will deliver a novel, comprehensive, user-friendly data annotation and curation system that is highly interconnected, encompassing the full cycle, and real-world practice, of required tasks and decisions, by all parties within the `bioassay annotation ecosystem' (researchers performing curation, dedicated curators, IT specialists, ontology owners, and librarians/repositories). The alliance between academic and commercial collaborators, who already work together, will greatly benefit the project and minimize execution risk. Our specific aims are to: (1) Develop a bioassay-specific template editor and templates by adopting the Stanford (Center for Expanded Data Annotation and Retrieval, CEDAR) data model to the machine learning-based curation tool BioAssay Express, to exploit the broad functionality of its data structures, tools and interfaces; (2) Define and create an ontology update process and tool (`OntoloBridge') to support rapid feedback between curators/users and ontology experts and enable semi-automated incorporation of suggestions for updates to existing published ontologies; (3) Develop new tools to export annotated data into public repositories such as PubChem; and (4) Evaluate our solution across diverse audiences (pharma, academia, repositories). The system will improve bioassay curation efficiency, quality, and effectiveness, enabling scientists to generate standardized annotations for their experiments to make these data FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable). We envision this suite of tools will encourage annotation earlier in the data lifecycle while still supporting annotation at later stages (e.g., submission to repositories or to journals). Project Narrative Biological assays are the foundation for developing drugs, but new Big Data approaches – which have revolu- tionized other areas of biomedical science – have not yet advanced this early step of biomedical research: analysis of assay data. The obstacle is that assays are written in scientific English, which need to be translated into standardized descriptions readable by computers. This lack of machine-readable annotations is a major impediment to manage, find, compare, re-use, and learn from the millions of assays. This project will develop a formal process and integrated tools to support the complete cycle of tasks and decisions required for bioassay annotation, enabling expedited (and more cost-effective) drug discovery.","Unifying Templates, Ontologies and Tools to Achieve Effective Annotation of Bioassay Protocols",9979969,U01LM012630,"['Academia', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Area', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'Biological Assay', 'Biomedical Research', 'Chemicals', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Competence', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Controlled Vocabulary', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Ecosystem', 'Effectiveness', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Estrogen receptor positive', 'Exercise', 'FAIR principles', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Hour', 'Journals', 'Learning', 'Librarians', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Metadata', 'Ontology', 'Output', 'Participant', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Polishes', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'PubChem', 'Publishing', 'Readability', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrieval', 'Risk', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Semantics', 'Site', 'Software Engineering', 'Software Tools', 'Specialist', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Suggestion', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Tweens', 'Update', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'base', 'cost effective', 'data modeling', 'data standards', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'drug mechanism', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'improved functioning', 'in vivo', 'informatics training', 'novel', 'ontology development', 'open source', 'practical application', 'predictive modeling', 'public repository', 'repository', 'structured data', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,U01,2020,511367,-0.011741894514910712

"The University of Iowa Clinical and Translational Science Award ABSTRACT The Institute for Clinical and Translational Science (ICTS) at the University of Iowa (UI) was established by the Board of Regents to realize three objectives – first, to lead the development of translational science at the UI; second, to advance translational science as a distinct academic discipline; and third, to disseminate capacities in translational science across the State of Iowa. This mandate enabled us to tackle large problems affecting translational science that required institutional solutions, such as transforming regulatory processes for human subjects research, developing an informatics infrastructure for integrating electronic medical record and other health care data, establishing bi-directional relationships with community organizations, and revitalizing the pipeline of well trained clinical and translational researchers. Iowa is a rural state, which brings special health care needs and challenges. We have used these rural considerations as a catalyst for driving our approach to clinical and translational research pushing our teams to develop strategies to engage rural populations of all ages and backgrounds and to create new approaches that overcome the geographic barriers in a rural state. We are capitalizing on our established community practice networks of family physicians, clinics, school nurses and pharmacists. We utilize e Health/ e Learning platforms in novel ways and will test the efficacy of these new methods of engagement. As we move research “Beyond Our Borders,” we have created methods to capture real-time, real-life data from the home and to correlate this environmentally specific, comprehensive data to human performance. The ICTS is engaging with other CTSA hubs and national CTR systems to empirically test different approaches and to develop the evidence base of proven strategies for accelerating translation that can be more broadly disseminated. Though distance and rurality drive our approaches, the strategies that we develop are simply new and potentially better ways to generate broad representation and improved participation by patients, healthcare teams and academicians. Through our local, state and national partnerships, UI and the ICTS are poised to move clinical and translational discovery rapidly into healthcare practice in a variety of clinical settings. PROJECT NARRATIVE The mission of the University of Iowa Institute for Clinical and Translational Science (ICTS) is to accelerate translational science through programs to develop the translational workforce, promote the engagement of community members and other stakeholders, to promote research integration across the lifespan, and to catalyze innovative clinical and translational research. The ongoing development of collaborative data-based infrastructure and services is a central tenant to achieving this mission. The goals of this proposal are: for Iowa to join the N3C partnership, contributing data in an effective method that evolves and improves over time, to enable Iowa researchers to leverage the N3C data resource in their research and to leverage the N3C framework for other areas of research in the future.",The University of Iowa Clinical and Translational Science Award,10201104,UL1TR002537,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automobile Driving', 'Award', 'COVID-19', 'Caring', 'Center for Translational Science Activities', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Clinical and Translational Science Awards', 'Clinics and Hospitals', 'Communities', 'Community Practice', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'E-learning', 'Emergency Situation', 'Family Physicians', 'Future', 'Genomics', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Human Subject Research', 'Image', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Iowa', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical Care Team', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Patient Participation', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacists', 'Phenotype', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Rural', 'Rural Health', 'Rural Population', 'School Nursing', 'Services', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transfer Agreement', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'catalyst', 'clinical decision support', 'cohort', 'collaborative approach', 'community organizations', 'coronavirus disease', 'data acquisition', 'data enclave', 'data exchange', 'data resource', 'data sharing', 'data warehouse', 'efficacy testing', 'evidence base', 'health management', 'improved', 'informatics infrastructure', 'innovation', 'interest', 'member', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'pandemic disease', 'phenotypic data', 'programs', 'rurality', 'social determinants', 'support tools', 'translational scientist']",NCATS,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,UL1,2020,98933,-0.013079108045773285
"Carolina Population Center PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The Carolina Population Center requests infrastructure support that will advance population dynamics research at CPC by increasing research impact, innovation, and productivity, supporting the development of junior scientists, and reducing the administrative burden on scientists. Infrastructure support will advance science in three primary research areas: Sexuality, Reproduction, Fertility, and Families; Population, Health, and the Environment; and Inequality, Mobility, Disparities, and Well-Being. Much of the research at CPC draws on large publicly available longitudinal data sets that our faculty have designed and collected, including the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health, the China Health and Nutrition Survey, newer surveys associated with the Transfer Project, and the Study of the Tsunami Aftermath and Recovery, all of which will continue to be important in work related to our primary research areas over the next five years. These projects embody several themes that have guided research at CPC since the Center's inception. These themes, which will continue to shape our work, are the importance of life course processes and longitudinal data, multi-level processes and measurement of context, interventions and natural experiments as means of learning about causal processes, and the relevance of sociodemographic variables such as age, gender, race- ethnicity, and socioeconomic status for disparities in health and well-being. By embedding these themes, our projects provide data that enable us to address barriers that otherwise impede progress in the population sciences generally, and in our primary research areas in particular. We request support for three cores which in combination will provide an institutional infrastructure that will push populations dynamics research forward by empowering CPC faculty to tackle challenging questions using state of the art measurement techniques and methods. The Administrative Core plans activities that maintain a stimulating intellectual community, streamlines administrative processes so that scientists can focus on research, coordinates activities of the Cores so that services are offered efficiently, and communicates information about research and data more broadly. The Development Core supports early stage investigators and other faculty with exciting new ideas through multiple mechanisms: workshops, access to technical expertise in measurement, and seed grants. The Research Services Core enables scientists to address complex and important population research issues by providing access to state-of-the-art research tools and professional support for programming, survey development, and analysis. NARRATIVE This project will provide infrastructure support for a cutting edge program of research on population dynamics at the Carolina Population Center.

"Novel Statistical Inference for Biomedical Big Data Project Summary This project develops novel statistical inference procedures for biomedical big data (BBD), including data from diverse omics platforms, various medical imaging technologies and electronic health records. Statistical inference, i.e., assess- ing uncertainty, statistical signiﬁcance and conﬁdence, is a key step in computational pipelines that aim to discover new disease mechanisms and develop effective treatments using BBD. However, the development of statistical inference procedures for BBD has lagged behind technological advances. In fact, while point estimation and variable selection procedures for BBD have matured over the past two decades, existing inference procedures are either limited to simple methods for marginal inference and/or lack the ability to integrate biomedical data across multiple studies and plat- forms. This paucity is, in large part, due to the challenges of statistical inference in high-dimensional models, where the number of features is considerably larger than the number of subjects in the study. Motivated by our team's extensive and complementary expertise in analyzing multi-omics data from heterogenous studies, including the TOPMed project on which multiple team members currently collaborate, the current proposal aims to address these challenges. The ﬁrst aim of the project develops a novel inference procedure for conditional parameters in high-dimensional models based on dimension reduction, which facilitates seamless integration of external biological information, as well as biomedical data across multiple studies and platforms. To expand the application of this method to very high-dimensional models that arise in BBD applications, the second aim develops a data-adaptive screening procedure for selecting an optimal subset of relevant variables. The third aim develops a novel inference procedure for high-dimensional mixed linear models. This method expands the application domain of high-dimensional inference procedures to studies with longitu- dinal data and repeated measures, which arise commonly in biomedical applications. The fourth aim develops a novel data-driven procedure for controlling the false discovery rate (FDR), which facilitates the integration of evidence from multiple BBD sources, while minimizing the false negative rate (FNR) for optimal discovery. Upon evaluation using ex- tensive simulation experiments and application to multi-omics data from the TOPMed project, the last aim implements the proposed methods into easy-to-use open-source software tools leveraging the R programming language and the capabilities of the Galaxy workﬂow system, thus providing an expandable platform for further developments for BBD methods and tools. Public Health Relevance Biomedical big data (BBD), including large collections of omics data, medical imaging data, and electronic health records, offer unprecedented opportunities for discovering disease mechanisms and developing effective treatments. However, despite their tremendous potential, discovery using BBD has been hindered by computational challenges, including limited advances in statistical inference procedures that allow biomedical researchers to investigate uncon- founded associations among biomarkers of interest and various biological phenotypes, while integrating data from multiple BBD sources. The current proposal bridges this gap by developing novel statistical machine learning methods and easy-to-use open-source software for statistical inference in BBD, which are designed to facilitate the integration of data from multiple studies and platforms.",Novel Statistical Inference for Biomedical Big Data,9969887,R01GM133848,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data Methods', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Fostering', 'Galaxy', 'Genetic study', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Linear Models', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multiomic Data', 'Outcome', 'Phenotype', 'Procedures', 'R programming language ', 'Research Personnel', 'Sample Size', 'Scientist', 'Screening procedure', 'Software Tools', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine', 'Uncertainty', 'Work', 'base', 'big biomedical data', 'computational pipelines', 'data integration', 'design', 'diverse data', 'effective therapy', 'experimental study', 'heterogenous data', 'high dimensionality', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'member', 'novel', 'open source', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'simulation', 'statistical and machine learning', 'structured data', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'user friendly software']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2020,456980,-0.040399108416043224
"Protege: A Knowledge-Engineering Environment for Advancing Biomedical Sciences Project Abstract The engineering of ontologies that define the entities in an application area and the relationships among them has become essential for modern work in biomedicine. Ontologies help both humans and computers to manage burgeoning numbers of data. The need to annotate, retrieve, and integrate high- throughput data sets, to process natural language, and to build systems for decision support has set many communities of investigators to work building large ontologies. The Protégé system has become an indispensable open-source resource for an enormous international community of scientists—supporting the development, maintenance, and use of ontologies and electronic knowledge bases by biomedical investigators everywhere. The number of registered Protégé users has grown from 3,500 in 2002 to more than 300,000 users as of this writing. The widespread use of ontologies in biomedicine and the availability of tools, such as Protégé, have taken the biomedical field forward to a new set of challenges that current technology has not been designed to address: Biomedical ontologies have grown in size and scope, and their creation, maintenance and quality assurance have become particularly effort-intensive and error-prone. In this proposal, we will develop new methods and tools that will significantly aid biomedical researchers in easily creating and testing biomedical ontologies throughout their lifecycle. Our plan entails four specific aims. First, we will develop methods and tools to allow biomedical scientist to easily create ontologies directly from their source documents, such as spreadsheets, tab indented hierarchies, and document outlines. Second, we will provide the methods and tools to allow biomedical scientist to identify potential “hot spots” in their ontologies that might affect their quality. Third, we will implement a comprehensive, automated testing framework for ontologies that will assist biomedical researchers in performing ontology and data quality assurance throughout the development cycle. Fourth, we will continue to expand and support the thriving Protégé user community, as it grows to include new clinicians and biomedical scientists as they build the ontologies needed to support clinical care, data-driven research, and the elucidation of new discoveries. Project Narrative Protégé is a software system that helps a burgeoning user community to develop ontologies that enhance biomedical research and improve patient care. Protégé supports scientists, clinician researchers, and workers in informatics in data annotation, data integration, information retrieval, natural-language processing, electronic patient record systems, and decision-support systems. The Protégé resource provides critical semantic-technology infrastructure and expertise for biomedical research and the development of advanced clinical information systems.",Protege: A Knowledge-Engineering Environment for Advancing Biomedical Sciences,9848600,R01GM121724,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Advanced Development', 'Affect', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Biomedical Research', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computerized Patient Records', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Education and Outreach', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Hot Spot', 'Human', 'Informatics', 'Information Retrieval', 'Information Systems', 'Infrastructure', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Letters', 'Maintenance', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Ontology', 'Patient Care', 'Process', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Semantics', 'Source', 'System', 'Technology', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Update', 'Work', 'Writing', 'biomedical ontology', 'biomedical scientist', 'clinical care', 'data integration', 'data quality', 'data sharing', 'design', 'document outlines', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interoperability', 'knowledge base', 'large datasets', 'natural language', 'next generation', 'ontology development', 'open source', 'quality assurance', 'software systems', 'tool']",NIGMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,559088,0.061252610306597746

"University of Buffalo Clinical and Translational Science Institute The Buffalo Translational Consortium (BTC), which includes the University at Buffalo (UB) health sciences schools, the major healthcare institutions in our region, four key research institutes and five influential community partners, have embarked on a comprehensive strategic plan to build a strong foundation for clinical and translational research in response to our community needs. Buffalo is the second most populous city in New York State and has a rich cultural history. The proportion of underrepresented minorities in Buffalo in 2018 (50%) parallels that projected for the US in 2050, making Buffalo a microcosm of what the US will look like in 30 years. A similar proportion of our population experiences health disparities. The vision for our CTSA hub is to perform innovative research across the translational spectrum to improve the health of our community and the nation. We will develop, test and share novel approaches to engage difficult-to-engage populations and reduce health disparities in our community, which represents a “population of the future”. Guided by our vision, the CTSA has catalyzed a transformation of our environment since our CTSA was first funded in August 2015 with remarkable growth in clinical and translational research. Further, in just the past year, the UB medical school has moved into a spectacular new building and our clinical partner, Kaleida Health, the largest healthcare system in the region, opened the new Oishei Children’s Hospital, both on the Buffalo Niagara Medical Campus and connected to the Clinical and Translational Research Center devoted entirely to clinical and translational research that opened in 2012. This rapid and continuing trajectory of growth in healthcare and research in the region has resulted in a new 21st century Academic Health Center with healthcare, medical education and clinical and translational research on one campus in the heart of Buffalo, creating a foundation to enhance the impact of our CTSA even further. While launching our CTSA, we have prioritized participation in the national consortium through hosting and testing Innovation Labs as a team science tool, working with multiple hubs on initiatives to solve translational research barriers and sharing tools that we have developed with the CTSA consortium, including novel health informatics tools. Our CTSA has five ambitious but achievable aims, including: 1) Accelerate innovative translational research with teams that engage communities, regional stakeholders and the national consortium; 2) Train an excellent, diverse workforce to advance translation of discoveries; 3) Enhance inclusion of special populations across the lifespan and difficult-to-engage populations; 4) Streamline clinical research processes focusing on quality and efficiency with emphasis on multisite studies; 5) Develop, test and share biomedical informatics tools to integrate data from multiple sources to speed translation. Guided by our vision to perform research to improve the health of our community and the nation, we will continue our momentum to expand translational research, train our diverse workforce, streamline processes, engage our community, and actively contribute to the national consortium. The University at Buffalo Clinical and Translational Science Institute (CTSI) is the coordinating center of the Buffalo Translational Consortium, which includes the region's premier research, educational and clinical institutions with influential community partners. The vision of the CTSI is to perform innovative clinical and translational research to reduce health disparities and improve the health of our community and the nation.

"Development of a novel method for cryopreservation of Drosophila melanogaster PROJECT SUMMARY This proposal seeks to develop a resource for the preservation of the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. This insect is a foundational model organism for biological research. Over a century of work, an enormous number of fly strains harboring different mutant alleles or transgenic constructs have been generated. However, one limitation of working with flies is that there is as yet no practical method for cryopreservation of Drosophila strains. Conventional methods of vitrifying Drosophila were developed in the early 1990s and were never widely adopted due to the difficulty in performing the protocols. This is a problem from a practical perspective since all these strains need to be individually maintained in continuous culture at substantial cost and labor, and also from a scientific perspective, since in the process of continuous culture mutations can accumulate and contamination can occur, degrading the value of these resources for future experiments. A novel approach for cryopreservation of Drosophila is proposed for this R24 resource center. Isolated embryonic nuclei, rather than intact embryos, will be cryopreserved and then nuclear transplantation via microinjection will be used to create clones derived from the cryopreserved nuclei. This approach avoids the issues associated with the impermeability of embryonic membranes that have prevented the use of conventional cryopreservation approaches that have been used with other organisms. Embryonic nuclei will be cryopreserved using a naturally inspired approach. Diverse biological systems (plants, insects, etc.) survive dehydration, drought, freezing temperatures and other stresses through the use of osmolytes. On an applied level, the proposed investigation has the potential to transform preservation of Drosophila lines by 1) preserving subcellular components (specifically nuclei) as opposed to embryos; and 2) automating much of the workflow. In the long- term, the goal of this resource center is to develop a robust and scalable protocol for cryopreservation of Drosophila, thus reducing the cost and improving the quality of long-term strain maintenance. PROJECT NARRATIVE The fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, is a very important model organism for biomedical research. The goal of this resource center is to develop effective methods of preserving fruit flies in order to lower the costs and improve the quality of stock maintenance. The approach leverages recent scientific advances to develop a new, highly automated approach for preserving fruit flies.",Development of a novel method for cryopreservation of Drosophila melanogaster,9935719,R24OD028444,"['Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Animal Model', 'Asses', 'Automation', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Communities', 'Cryopreservation', 'Dehydration', 'Development', 'Developmental Biology', 'Drosophila genus', 'Drosophila melanogaster', 'Droughts', 'Embryo', 'Engineering', 'Evolution', 'Formulation', 'Foundations', 'Freezing', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Insecta', 'Investigation', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Mechanics', 'Membrane', 'Methods', 'Microinjections', 'Molecular Biology', 'Monoclonal Antibody R24', 'Mutation', 'Neurosciences', 'Nuclear', 'Organism', 'Plants', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Raman Spectrum Analysis', 'Recovery', 'Resources', 'Robotics', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Stress', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Work', 'biological research', 'biological systems', 'cold temperature', 'cost', 'epigenome', 'experimental study', 'fly', 'genetic technology', 'high throughput screening', 'improved', 'individual response', 'mutant', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'nuclear transfer', 'preservation', 'prevent', 'tool']",OD,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R24,2020,599090,0.013660541751352272
"South Carolina Clinical & Translational Research Institute (SCTR) PROJECT SUMMARY – SCTR INSTITUTE Parent Award UL1-TR001450 Since 2009, the South Carolina Clinical and Translational Research Institute (SCTR) has transformed the research environment across South Carolina (SC) by creating a Learning Health System that supports high- quality clinical and translational research (CTR) and fosters collaboration and innovation. Headquartered at the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC), SCTR has engaged stakeholders and created statewide partnerships to improve care and address social determinants of health across SC. However, greater than 75% of SC is rural, and all 46 counties contain areas designated as medically underserved, so health disparities remain an issue. Over the next five years, SCTR will strengthen its outreach to these medically underserved areas through collaboration with the Clemson University Health Extension Program and the MUSC Telehealth Center of Excellence. With a focus on implementation and dissemination as well as discovery, we will develop and demonstrate innovative technologies and outreach to improve the health of our stakeholders. We will build on prior successes and introduce innovative approaches to expand CTR across SC through the following aims: Aim 1. Extend and enhance high-quality, innovative, flexible curricula and training experiences for all levels of the CTR workforce, with particular emphasis on enhancing workforce heterogeneity and team science. Aim 2. Engage a diverse group of stakeholders as active partners in CTR to address health care priorities while enhancing the scientific knowledge base about collaboration and engagement. Aim 3. Promote greater inclusion across the full translational spectrum of research by engaging investigators from many disciplines and patient populations from diverse demographic backgrounds and geographic areas. Aim 4. Develop, demonstrate and disseminate innovative methods and processes to address barriers and accelerate the translation of research discoveries to improvements in human health that can be generalized to a variety of practice settings. Aim 5.

"Tufts Clinical and Translational Science Institute (N3C Supplement) PROJECT SUMMARY Tufts Clinical and Translational Science Institute (Tufts CTSI) is based on the conviction that authentic involvement of the entire spectrum of clinical and translational research (CTR) is critical to fulfilling the promise of biomedical science for meeting the public's needs. This includes not only from translation from bench to bedside (T1 translation), but also, crucially for having health impact, translation into effective clinical practice (T2), care delivery and public health (T3), and health policy (T4). Advances on all of these fronts is increasingly dependent on making effective use of scientific data from multiple domains. The COVID-19 global emergency presents both an immediate challenge and an opportunity to progress on important data sharing aims emphasized by NIH. In response, NCATS and the Centers for Translational Science Award (CTSA) hubs, several HHS agencies, and other partnering organizations have committed to developing a next-generation repository for clinical data related to COVID-19, the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C), as a means of accelerating global research into the disease and aiding the development of diagnostics, therapeutics, and effective vaccines. The N3C initiative's goal of improving the efficiency and accessibility of analyses with clinical data is consistent with the primary informatics objectives of Tufts CTSI, which am to reduce barriers to the integration of healthcare and research by providing innovative systems, data repositories, and analytical tools, and by enabling greater exchange and collaboration through interoperability, standardization, and resource sharing.

"Knowledge Management Center for Illuminating the Druggable Genome The main goal of the Knowledge Management Center (KMC) for the Illuminating the Druggable Genome (IDG) program is to aggregate, update and articulate protein-centric data, information and knowledge for the entire human proteome with emphasis on understudied proteins from the 3 families that are the focus of the IDG (“IDG List”). The long-term objective of the KMC is to encourage and support biomedical research aimed at understudied proteins by providing an extensive resource of data, information, knowledge, methods and reagents for the entire human proteome, and to support the growing online community focused on understudied proteins. With focus on the IDG List and human proteins, the KMC will enable support for expanded coverage for non-human proteins of therapeutic interest and other associated human health data, in order to catalyze novel biomedical discoveries. To support the overall IDG objective, and to maintain, update and improve these integrated resources, the KMC draws upon expertise from multiple knowledge domains, specifically biology, chemistry and medicine, as well as computer science, graphic design and web programming. Specifically, for the Phase 2 of the IDG KMC we propose 4 Aims:1. Create an automated workflow that captures relevant public data for the entire proteome and manual annotations for the IDG list. The KMC knowledge management system will be built around knowledge graphs, focused on five major branches of the target knowledge tree, tkt: Genotype, Phenotype, Expression, Structure & Function, and Interactions & Pathways, respectively. Aim 2: Design, develop and implement a protein knowledgebase with Data Analytics support. Our protein-centric biomedical knowledge base, TCKB (Target Central Knowledgebase) will be comprised of the data, knowledge and information container, together with its codebase and software pipelines. TCKB will be the repository for experimental, processed and computed data and reagents originating from the IDG DRGCs (Data and Resource Generation Centers). We will provide informatics and modeling support for DRGC activities. Aim 3: We will expand, improve and maintain Pharos. Particularly “knowledge packages,” support automated data summaries for Protein Dossiers, and actively seek feedback from our community. Aim 4. Outreach to scientific community. We will support a series of activities that will leverage TCKB, Pharos and other IDG resources to increase adoption of IDG work, while observing FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable) principles for our knowledgebase, portal and pipelines. The KMC will engage in community outreach by leading tutorials and feedback sessions and dissemination of the Pharos system. To meet its goals, the KMC will coordinate all core activities in close coordination with the IDG Steering Committee and IDG Project Scientists (PS), and include members of the IDG Consortium (IDG- C), other NIH Common Fund programs, NIH Commons, as well as other initiatives.

"WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE UNDIAGNOSED DISEASES NETWORK CLINICAL SITE 1.0 PROJECT SUMMARY The scientific premise of this application is that the individualized translational research process of the Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN) developed during Phase I is scalable and that its impact on patients, families, and disease discovery can be advanced and sustained by addition of a Clinical Site at Washington University School of Medicine (WUSM). WUSM represents a large academic medical center that is fully integrated with world-renowned basic science capabilities and demonstrated expertise in a gene first approach for patients with undiagnosed diseases. The highly collaborative clinical and biomedical research culture at WUSM promotes interactions within and across Departments, with institutional genomic, clinical, computational, and model system experts, and with colleagues regionally, nationally, and internationally. These interactions support recruitment, selection, evaluation, diagnosis discovery, and follow up of pediatric and adult patients with undiagnosed diseases through both established networks and individual referrals. Building on this infrastructure, WUSM faculty and staff will advance the success of the UDN in diagnosing and managing disease in undiagnosed patients by, first, using, refining, and improving protocols designed during Phase I of the UDN for comprehensive, timely clinical evaluations of 30 undiagnosed patients annually. Secondly, we will collect, securely store, and share standardized, high-quality clinical and laboratory data including genotyping, phenotyping, and documentation of environmental exposures and promote an integrated and collaborative community across the UDN and among laboratory and clinical investigators focused on defining the pathophysiology, cell biologic, and molecular mechanisms that cause these difficult to diagnose diseases. Thirdly, the WUSM UDN Clinical Site will propose a bioinformatics plan for leveraging institutional infrastructure and expertise to develop innovative strategies to improve discovery of pathogenic variants. Fourthly, the assessment, dissemination, outreach, and training plan will accelerate assessment and dissemination of data, protocols, consent materials, and methods, availability of educational and outreach materials for participants, clinicians, and other researchers, engagement of underrepresented minorities, and training for students, fellows, staff, and faculty in collaboration with WUSM’s Clinical and Translational Science Award infrastructure. Finally, WUSM will make a clear institutional commitment to maintain its Clinical Site, to adapt UDN Phase I practices for sustainability, to contribute to formation of a sustainable national UDN resource, and to adapt to unique needs and unexpected circumstances that may arise once Common Fund support ends in fiscal year 2022. 2.0 PROJECT NARRATIVE Undiagnosed diseases in children and adults represent frustrating and costly challenges for patients, families, physicians, and society.

"Computational Methods for Enhancing Privacy in Biomedical Data Sharing Project Summary Data sharing is essential to modern biomedical data science. Access to a large amount of genomic and clinical data can help us better understand human genetics and its impact on health and disease. However, the sensitive nature of biomedical information presents a key bottleneck in data sharing and collection efforts, limiting the utility of these data for science. The goal of this project is to leverage cutting-edge advances in cryptography and information theory to develop innovative computational frameworks for privacy-preserving sharing and analysis of biomedical data. We will draw upon our recent success in developing secure pipelines for collaborative biomedical analyses to address the imminent need to share sensitive data securely and at scale.  Practical adoption of existing privacy-preserving techniques in biomedicine has thus far been largely limited due to two major pitfalls, which this project overcomes with novel technical advances. First, emerging cryptographic data sharing frameworks, which promise to enable collaborative analysis pipelines that securely combine data across multiple institutions with theoretical privacy guarantees, are too costly to support complex and large-scale computations required in biomedical analyses. In this project, we will build upon recent advances in cryptography (e.g., secure distributed computation, pseudorandom correlation, zero-knowledge proofs) to significantly enhance the scalability and security of cryptographic biomedical data sharing pipelines. Second, existing approaches that locally transform data to protect sensitive information before sharing (e.g. de-identification techniques) either offer insufficient levels of protection or require excessive perturbation in order to ensure privacy. We will draw upon recent tools from information theory to develop effective local privacy protection methods that achieve superior utility-privacy tradeoffs on a range of biomedical data including genomes, transcriptomes, and medical images by directly exploiting the latent correlation structure of the data.  To promote the use of our privacy techniques, we will create production-grade software of our tools and publicly release them. We will also actively participate in international standard-setting organizations in genomics, e.g. GA4GH and ICDA, to incorporate our insights into community guidelines for biomedical privacy. Successful completion of these aims will result in computational methods and software tools that open the door to secure sharing and analysis of massive sets of sensitive genomic and clinical data. Our long-term goal is to broadly enable data sharing and collaboration efforts in biomedicine, thus empowering researchers to better understand the molecular basis of human health and to drive translation of new biological insights to the clinic. Project Narrative Rapidly-growing volume of biomedical datasets around the world promises to enable unprecedented insights into human health and disease. However, increasing concerns for individual privacy severely limited the extent of data sharing in the field. This project draws upon cutting-edge tools from cryptography and information theory to develop effective privacy- preserving methods for collecting, sharing, and analyzing sensitive biomedical data to empower advances in genomics and medicine.",Computational Methods for Enhancing Privacy in Biomedical Data Sharing,10017554,DP5OD029574,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Brain', 'Clinic', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Complex Analysis', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Enhancement Technology', 'Ensure', 'Foundations', 'Genome', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Information Theory', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'International', 'Knowledge', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mainstreaming', 'Mathematics', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medical Imaging', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Nature', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacology', 'Policies', 'Polynomial Models', 'Preservation Technique', 'Privacy', 'Privatization', 'Production', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Science', 'Secure', 'Security', 'Software Tools', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Translations', 'Vision', 'Work', 'analysis pipeline', 'base', 'biomedical data science', 'computer framework', 'computing resources', 'cost', 'cryptography', 'data sharing', 'design', 'empowered', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'genetic analysis', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic data', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'insight', 'novel', 'privacy preservation', 'privacy protection', 'software development', 'statistics', 'structured data', 'success', 'task analysis', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'web server']",OD,"BROAD INSTITUTE, INC.",DP5,2020,392799,0.03423605696554204
"Alliance for Regenerative Rehabilitation Research & Training 2.0 (AR3T 2.0) OVERALL: ABSTRACT  The scope of regenerative medicine encompasses the repair, regeneration, and replacement of defective, injured, and diseased tissues and organs. The success of regenerative therapies is dependent, at least in part, on a favorable microenvironment in which the regenerative processes occur. Technological innovations and a deepened mechanistic understanding of how these microenvironmental signals influence tissue regeneration has drawn attention to the critical importance of the clinical field with foundations in the application of physical, thermal, and electrical stimuli to promote functional restoration—rehabilitation. We propose that the fields of regenerative medicine and rehabilitative science are inextricably intertwined, an intersection of disciplines that we and others have termed Regenerative Rehabilitation. To realize the full potential of Regenerative Rehabilitation, there is a need for formalized mechanisms that promote the interaction of basic scientists with rehabilitation specialists. During the initial funding cycle, the Alliance for Regenerative Rehabilitation Research & Training (AR3T) built a national network of investigators and programs that has helped to expand scientific knowledge, expertise and methodologies across the domains of regenerative medicine and rehabilitation. This proposal seeks funding for AR3T 2.0, in which we will build on successes achieved and lessons learned over the initial period of support with the goal of being even more responsive to the needs of the greater community. Six specific aims define a framework upon which we will achieve our goals. AR3T will provide education and drive the science underlying Regenerative Rehabilitation by: 1) Providing didactic programs that expose rehabilitation researchers to cutting-edge investigations and state-of-the-art technologies in the field of regenerative medicine (Didactic Aim); 2) Cultivating collaborative opportunities between renowned investigators in the fields of regenerative medicine and rehabilitation (Collaborations Aim); 3) Coordinating a pilot funding program to support novel lines of Regenerative Rehabilitation research (Pilot Funding Aim); 4) Developing and validating technologies to advance the measurement and use of the regenerative rehabilitation programs (Technology Aim); 5) Promoting our center’s expertise to a broad community of trainees, investigators, and clinicians (Promotion Aim); 6) Carefully monitoring and evaluating the effectiveness of our program will ensure that we are successful in achieving our goals (Quality Control Aim). Administrative note: In the preparation of this proposal, we made every effort to present a comprehensive and detailed plan for achieving our goals while minimizing redundancy. Therefore, in multiple places, we refer the reader to specific components of the application, rather than repeating text. We appreciate the time and effort the reviewers devote to the evaluation of the proposals.  Sincerely, Fabrisia, Tom and Mike PROJECT NARRATIVE  Regenerative Rehabilitation is the integration of principles and approaches across the fields of rehabilitation science and regenerative medicine. The integration of these two fields will increase the efficiency of interventions designed to optimize physical functioning to the benefit of a wide range of individuals with disabilities.

"Research Resource for Complex Physiologic Signals PhysioNet, established in 1999 as the NIH-sponsored Research Resource for Complex Physiologic Signals, has attained a preeminent status among biomedical data and software resources. Its data archive was the first, and remains the world's largest, most comprehensive and widely used repository of time-varying physiologic signals. Its software collection supports exploration and quantitative analyses of its own and other databases by providing a wide range of well-documented, rigorously tested open-source programs that can be run on any platform. PhysioNet's team of researchers drive the creation and enrichment of: i) Data collections that provide comprehensive, multifaceted views of pathophysiology over long time intervals, such as the MIMIC (Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care) Databases of critical care patients; ii) Analytic methods for quantification of information encoded in physiologic signals relevant to risk stratification and health status assessment; iii) User interfaces, reference materials and services that add value and improve access to the resource’s data and software; and iv) unique annual Challenges focusing on high priority clinical problems, such as early prediction of sepsis, detection and quantification of sleep apnea syndromes from a single lead electrocardiogram (ECG), false alarm detection in the intensive care unit (ICU), continuous fetal ECG monitoring, and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation detection and prediction. PhysioNet is a proven enabler and accelerator of innovative research by investigators with a diverse range of interests, working on projects made possible by data that are otherwise inaccessible. The creation and development of PhysioNet were recognized with the 2016 highest honor of the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI). PhysioNet's world-wide, growing community of researchers, clinicians, educators, trainees, and medical instrument and software developers retrieve about 380 GB of data per day and publish a yearly average of nearly 300 new scholarly articles. Over the next five years we aim to: 1) Enhance PhysioNet’s impact with new data and technology; 2) Develop new methods to quantify dynamical information in physiologic signals relevant for health status assessment, and for acute and chronic risk stratification, and 3) Harness the research community through our international Challenges that address key clinical problems and a new data annotation initiative. PhysioNet, the Research Resource for Complex Physiological Signals, maintains the world's largest, most comprehensive and most widely used repository of physiological data and data analysis software, making them freely available to the research community. PhysioNet is a proven enabler and accelerator of innovative biomedical research through its unique role in providing data and other resources that otherwise would be inaccessible.",Research Resource for Complex Physiologic Signals,10050843,R01EB030362,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Area', 'Arrhythmia', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Coupling', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Documentation', 'Educational Background', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Entropy', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health Status', 'Heart failure', 'Image', 'Improve Access', 'Intensive Care', 'Intensive Care Units', 'International', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Legal patent', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Neonatal', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Patient Care', 'Physiological', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk stratification', 'Role', 'Running', 'Sepsis', 'Services', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep Apnea Syndromes', 'Source Code', 'Stroke', 'Students', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visualization', 'Visualization software', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'clinical care', 'cloud based', 'data archive', 'data exploration', 'data resource', 'fetal', 'graphical user interface', 'high school', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'instrumentation', 'interest', 'open source', 'opioid use', 'programs', 'repository', 'response', 'time interval', 'tool']",NIBIB,BETH ISRAEL DEACONESS MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2020,759918,0.00463289092118695
"Overall: Eunice Kennedy Shriver Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Research Center at Vanderbilt Founded in 1965 as one of the original Intellectual and Developmental Disorders Research Centers (IDDRC), the Vanderbilt Kennedy Center (VKC) IDDRC serves as the central nexus across Vanderbilt for interdisciplinary research, communication, and training in intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD). The VKC IDDRC serves as a trans-institutional institute that brings together over 200 faculty from 38 departments in 10 schools at Vanderbilt. The VKC’s mission to facilitate discoveries that inform best practices to improve the lives of people with IDD and their families. This mission is met by leveraging our outstanding institutional resources and support, partnering with disability communities, and capitalizing on synergistic interactions across the VKC’s federally-designated centers: the VKC IDDRC, a University Center of Excellence in Developmental Disabilities and a Leadership Education in Neurodevelopmental Disabilities program. The IDDRC as the centerpiece of the VKC is the foundational organizing structure that creates a “Center culture” wherein research and discovery permeates the VKC’s broader training and service activities, thus enhancing the translational research goals of the IDDRC. Demonstrable IDDRC success includes 976 investigator- authored publications and robust NIH funding to Vanderbilt to support IDD-related research ($52.6M in FY20). Harnessing and leveraging this trans-institutional strength to focus on unique challenges in IDD, the overarching goal of the next phase of the IDDRC is to develop precision care for IDD by providing infrastructure and scientific leadership to enable rapid translation of basic discoveries into high- impact IDD interventions and treatments. Three global Aims guide the IDDRC’s work. Aim 1 provides core services to enable and disseminate impactful research on individualizing treatments based upon the causes, mechanisms, and contributing co-morbid sequelae of IDD; Aim 2 focuses on incorporating innovative methods and approaches to enhance multidisciplinary IDD research; and Aim 3 proposes to conduct a signature research project to improve the precision use of antipsychotic medication in people with autism. Across these Aims and five Cores supported by the IDDRC (Administrative, Clinical Translational, Translational Neuroscience, Behavioral Phenotyping, and Data Sciences), three themes permeate our work: (1) recruitment of highly-skilled researchers not currently conducting IDD research (non-traditional researchers); (2) inclusion of IDD participants into research studies that currently do not include IDD (non-traditional subjects); and (3) incorporation of novel scientific approaches and methods (non-traditional approaches). Our IDDRC is ideally posed to enable rapid discovery of precision care approaches by supporting 50 investigators leading 70 research projects (15 from NICHD) and, as highlighted by the Signature Research Project, to promote and implement generative, novel, and impactful research directions, thus meeting the NICHD’s vision of applying newly evolved technologies and approaches to rapidly accelerate the prevention and/or amelioration of IDDs. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: As a group, intellectual and developmental disabilities, including Down syndrome and autism spectrum disorder, have dramatic effects on affected people’s and their caregiver’s lives. Unfortunately, there remains a lack of understanding about what causes these disabilities and, critically, how to treat them with targeted therapies. The Vanderbilt Kennedy Center’s Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Research Center serves as the hub for Vanderbilt’s research efforts focusing on improving the lives of people with intellectual and developmental disabilities by understanding the causes of these disorders and developing and testing therapies tailored to each individual’s precise needs.",Overall: Eunice Kennedy Shriver Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Research Center at Vanderbilt,10085550,P50HD103537,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Affect', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Biomedical Research', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Developmental Disabilities', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Down Syndrome', 'Education', 'Evaluation', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gap Junctions', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Research Centers', 'Intellectual functioning disability', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Leadership', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Neurodevelopmental Disability', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Phase', 'Pilot Projects', 'Policy Research', 'Prevention', 'Problem behavior', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Series', 'Services', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Vision', 'Weight Gain', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'clinical translation', 'comorbidity', 'cost effective', 'developmental disease', 'disability', 'drug-induced weight gain', 'experience', 'image processing', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'large datasets', 'lectures', 'meetings', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'personalized approach', 'personalized care', 'personalized medicine', 'population based', 'pragmatic trial', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'research study', 'success', 'targeted treatment', 'translational neuroscience', 'trial comparing']",NICHD,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,P50,2020,1387605,-0.013829058821590688
