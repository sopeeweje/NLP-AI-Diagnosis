"Advancing Protein Engineering Using Artificial Intelligence and the ProtaBank Mutation Database PROJECT SUMMARY Therapeutic antibodies, specialized enzymes for drug manufacturing, small molecule drug screening agents, and other proteins have been instrumental in advancing biotechnology and medicine. Protein therapeutics alone represents a rapidly growing $100+ billion market with broad applications in the treatment of cancer, inflammatory and metabolic diseases, and numerous other disorders. Most of the antibodies and other protein therapeutics developed in the last several years have been engineered, leading to improvements in important properties such as efficacy, binding affinity, expression, stability, and immunogenicity. However, improving protein properties through sequence modification remains a challenging task. Artificial intelligence (AI), which has been enormously successful in several fields (e.g., image recognition, self-driving cars, natural language processing), is now being applied to protein engineering and has the potential to transform this field as well. AI and machine learning (ML) can take advantage of large and diverse datasets to identify correlations, predict beneficial mutations, and explore novel protein sequences in ways that are not possible using other techniques. Other advantages include the ability to simultaneously optimize multiple protein properties and explore sequence space more efficiently. In Phases I and II of this project, we developed the ProtaBank database as a central repository to store, organize, and annotate protein mutation data spanning a broad range of properties. ProtaBank is the largest and only database actively collecting such a comprehensive set of sequence mutation data and is growing rapidly due to the wealth of data being generated with advanced automation and next-generation sequencing techniques. ProtaBank's depth and breadth makes it an ideal data source to train ML models. This proposal aims to create the ProtaBank AI Platform to enable the use of AI and ML tools to apply the data in ProtaBank to engineer proteins. The platform will provide fully customizable computational tools and will invoke protein-specific knowledge to properly prepare data for use with ML models. An interface to popular ML frameworks will be provided so that scientists can use these techniques to discover new predictive algorithms and enhance their ability to design proteins with the desired properties. Specific aims include: (1) integrating peer validated ML methods and proprietary technology for protein engineering into the ProtaBank AI Platform, (2) developing dynamic ML dataset creation tools, (3) expanding and improving the ProtaBank database by reaching out to scientists to contribute data, (4) enhancing our data deposition tools, and (5) integrating ProtaBank with the Protein Data Bank structure database and other databases. ! Project Narrative Protein engineering has enabled significant advances in health care by playing a key role in the development of antibodies and other protein therapeutics (e.g., for the treatment of cancer, inflammatory and metabolic diseases, and other disorders), highly selective enzymes for drug manufacturing, and novel proteins for use in diagnostics and the identification of new small molecule drugs. This project will enable the power of artificial intelligence (AI) to be applied to accelerate the engineering of proteins with new and improved properties. AI approaches can capitalize on the large amounts of protein mutation data being generated and stored in our recently developed ProtaBank protein mutation database to transform the way in which protein therapeutics and reagents are discovered and developed.!",Advancing Protein Engineering Using Artificial Intelligence and the ProtaBank Mutation Database,9847841,R44GM117961,"['Affinity', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antibodies', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automation', 'Automobile Driving', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Biotechnology', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Drug Screening', 'Engineering', 'Enzymes', 'Generations', 'Healthcare', 'Image', 'Inflammatory', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Meteor', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Mutation', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Preparation', 'Property', 'Protein Engineering', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reagent', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Standardization', 'Structural Protein', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic antibodies', 'Training', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'computerized tools', 'data submission', 'data warehouse', 'database structure', 'deep learning', 'design', 'flexibility', 'immunogenicity', 'improved', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'multitask', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'peer', 'prediction algorithm', 'protein structure', 'repository', 'small molecule', 'therapeutic protein', 'tool']",NIGMS,"PROTABIT, LLC",R44,2019,990318,0.12595532413868368
"Deep learning for protein subcellular/sub-organelle localizations and localization motifs Project Summary Eukaryotic cells have diverse cellular components, including subcellular organelles and sub-organelle compartments. The accurate targeting of proteins to these cellular components is crucial in establishing and maintaining cellular organizations and functions. Mis-localization of proteins is often associated with metabolic disorders and diseases. However, the vast majority of proteins lack subcellular/sub-organelle localization annotation. Compared with experimental methods, computational prediction of protein localization provides an efficient and effective way for proteome annotation and experimental design. The current prediction tools for protein localization have significant room for improvement. In addition, no tool can predict localization at the sub- organelle resolution or internal localization signals. Deep learning, as the cutting-edge technology in machine learning, presents a new opportunity for this classical bioinformatics problem. The availability of recent high- throughput localization data can also train deep learning well. The PI’s lab has demonstrated some success on a special case, i.e., predicting mitochondrial localizations for plants using deep learning.  In this project, the PI proposes to develop new methods and a standalone toolkit for accurate and scalable protein localization prediction at the subcellular and sub-organelle levels, as well as for characterization of localization motifs (including novel internal motifs). The general approach is to design a semi-supervised deep- learning method that utilizes both annotated protein sequences with known localization and unannotated protein sequences as training data. Through the realization of an unsupervised deep-learning approach, a general representation of protein sequences will be implemented, characterizing both local and global features of protein sequences. By visualizing and characterizing the deep-learning models, novel, interpretable protein sequence patterns will be predicted as putative targeting peptides and compared with known localization signals. We will also use the methods to be developed and the unsupervised models to be trained on all protein sequences as a general framework for other sequence-based prediction problems that predict the label of a protein and the key residues contributing to the label. We will make the platform highly customizable and apply it to three applications, including ubiquitination protein prediction, enzyme EC number prediction, and protein family/subfamily classification. The innovative contributions to protein sequence-based analyses and predictions include: (1) using raw amino acid sequences as training inputs without feature engineering; (2) utilizing the huge amount of unannotated data in an unsupervised deep learning to characterize a general protein feature representation; (3) identifying potential targeting signals (especially internal motifs) by decoding the trained deep- learning models, augmented with sophisticated attention mechanisms; 4) detecting multiple-organelle targeting and sub-organelle localizations by a novel hierarchical multi-label architecture; and (5) combining features from different data sources by a multiplicative fused CNN model. Relevance to Public Health  A protein typically has a well-defined localization in a cell to perform its function, and mis-localization of proteins is often associated with metabolic disorders and diseases. Protein localization prediction can provide valuable information for understanding disease mechanisms and designing treatment. To address the limitations of current computational methods, this project will apply cutting-edge deep-learning methods to deliver new computational methods and tools with improved accuracy and detailed sub-organelle prediction for protein localization.",Deep learning for protein subcellular/sub-organelle localizations and localization motifs,9768571,R21LM012790,"['Address', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Architecture', 'Attention', 'Base Sequence', 'Bioinformatics', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Enzymes', 'Eukaryotic Cell', 'Experimental Designs', 'Generations', 'Hybrids', 'Imagery', 'Label', 'Machine Learning', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mitochondria', 'Modeling', 'N-terminal', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Nobel Prize', 'Organelles', 'Pattern', 'Peptide Signal Sequences', 'Peptides', 'Plants', 'Protein Family', 'Protein translocation', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Supervision', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Ubiquitination', 'Work', 'base', 'bioinformatics tool', 'computerized tools', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'design', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'learning network', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'online resource', 'predictive modeling', 'protein function', 'recurrent neural network', 'success', 'therapy design', 'tool']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI-COLUMBIA,R21,2019,205330,0.11063525630086565
"Synergistic integration of topology and machine learning for the predictions of protein-ligand binding affinities and mutation impacts Project Summary Fundamental challenges that hinder the current understanding of biomolecular systems are their tremendous complexity, high dimensionality and excessively large data sets associated with their geometric modeling and simulations. These challenges call for innovative strategies for handling massive biomolecular datasets. Topology, in contrast to geometry, provides a unique tool for dimensionality reduction and data simplification. However, traditional topology typically incurs with excessive reduction in geometric information. Persistent homology is a new branch of topology that is able to bridge traditional topology and geometry, but suffers from neglecting biological information. Built upon PI’s recent work in the topological data analysis of biomolecules, this project will explore how to integrate topological data analysis and machine learning to significantly improve the current state-of-the-art predictions of protein-ligand binding and mutation impact established in the PI’s preliminary studies. These improvements will be achieved through developing physics-embedded topological methodologies and advanced deep learning architectures for tackling heterogeneous biomolecular data sets arising from a variety of physical and biological considerations. Finally, the PI will establish robust databases and online servers for the proposed predictions. Project Narrative The project concerns the integration of topological data analysis and machine learning architectures for the predictions of protein-ligand binding affinities and mutation induced protein stability changes from massive data sets. This new data approach has considerable impact for future generation methods in computational biophysics and drug design.",Synergistic integration of topology and machine learning for the predictions of protein-ligand binding affinities and mutation impacts,9756427,R01GM126189,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Affinity', 'Architecture', 'Big Data', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Sciences', 'Biophysics', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Drug Design', 'Electrostatics', 'Elements', 'Free Energy', 'Freedom', 'Future Generations', 'Geometry', 'Handwriting', 'Image Analysis', 'Induced Mutation', 'Ions', 'Learning', 'Ligand Binding', 'Ligands', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Membrane', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Metals', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mutation', 'Physics', 'Plant Roots', 'Proteins', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Site', 'Speech', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Thermodynamics', 'Work', 'algebraic topology', 'base', 'cofactor', 'data warehouse', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'direct application', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'language processing', 'learning algorithm', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'metallicity', 'models and simulation', 'multi-task learning', 'multitask', 'mutant', 'neglect', 'next generation', 'search engine', 'tool', 'trend', 'user-friendly']",NIGMS,MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,319267,0.02035198462232308
"Towards a comprehensive multiscale 3D human interactome network PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Almost all proteins function through interacting with other proteins. On average, a protein interacts with ~5 other protein partners in the current human interactome. Therefore, it is of great importance to accurately determine the interface of each interaction, in order to understand how each protein works with different partners to carry out different functions. In our previous Nature Biotechnology study, we implemented a proteome-scale homology modeling approach to generate the first 3D human structural interactome: the interface for each interaction in this network was determined at atomic resolution through co-crystal structures and homology models. Using our 3D interactome, we found that, among >1,800 known disease genes associated with two or more clinically distinctly disorders, pairs of mutations on the same gene but in different interfaces with different partners are significantly more likely to cause distinct diseases. However, only 4,150 human protein interactions have co-crystal structures and 2,921 have high-quality homology models. ~50,000 interactions (87% of the current human interactome) are not amenable to current structural modeling methods. Here, we propose to develop a big-data-driven machine-learning approach integrating biophysiochemical, evolutionary, structural, and population genetic features to identify interaction- specific interfaces for the whole human interactome. Because several key features are unavailable for many proteins and interactions, we propose an innovative approach to use an ensemble of random forest classifiers, named Ensemble Protein Interface Classifier (EPIC), to address this large-scale non-random missing data problem (Aim 1). The high throughput of our massively parallel Clone-seq and INtegrated PrOtein INteractome perTurbation screening (InPOINT) pipeline! uniquely enables us to perform real-time experimental parameter optimization (in Years 2-4 we will clone ~1,500 mutations and examine their impact on ~2,500 interactions every year to iteratively evaluate and refine EPIC; Aim 2). Finally, we will construct a comprehensive multiscale 3D interactome for all known human protein-protein interactions: we will collect/generate atomic- resolution structural models for interactions whenever possible (co-crystal structures and homology models); we will accurately determine interaction-specific interface residues and domains for the whole human interactome. We will deploy an interactive web portal to disseminate our results and allow functional genomic inference in the context of our structural interactome (Aim 3). Our comprehensive multiscale 3D human interactome and the accompanying web portal will greatly reduce the barrier-to-entry for performing systematic structural analysis on a large number of proteins and their interactions, and open the flood gates for such analyses in genomic studies. NARRATIVE Almost all proteins function through interacting with other proteins and the structural details of these interaction interfaces are key in understanding protein function. However, the interfaces for vast majority of human protein interactions are currently unknown. Here, we propose to establish an innovative ensemble classifier approach and implement an unprecedented large-scale computational-experimental iterative learning scheme to predict interfaces for the whole human interactome, in anticipation that our predicted interfaces will help dissect functional sites of disease mutations and be useful for rational drug design to target these sites.",Towards a comprehensive multiscale 3D human interactome network,9731549,R01GM124559,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Big Data', 'Binding', 'Biotechnology', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Crystallization', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Drug Design', 'Evolution', 'Floods', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Homology Modeling', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Missense Mutation', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Names', 'Nature', 'Population Genetics', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Publishing', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Scheme', 'Site', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'Study models', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Work', 'biological research', 'functional genomics', 'human interactome', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'protein function', 'protein protein interaction', 'protein structure', 'random forest', 'screening', 'three dimensional structure', 'user-friendly', 'web portal', 'web-accessible']",NIGMS,CORNELL UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,384166,0.07834322588325304
"Quantifying molecular consequences of human missense variants with large-scale interactome perturbation studies Almost all proteins function through interacting with other proteins. Previous studies have shown that the vast majority of damaging single amino acid mutations in proteins disrupt only a subset of specific protein-protein interactions, and that mutations in the same protein that disrupt different interactions tend to cause clinically distinct disorders. Therefore, it is of great importance to determine interaction-specific disruptions caused by each mutation. Furthermore, rapid advances in sequencing technologies have enabled the identification of tens of millions of single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in the human population, driving an urgent need to understand the impact of each SNV on the human interactome network. Unfortunately, there is currently no method that is capable of predicting the specific impact of a large fraction of these SNVs on individual protein-protein interactions. To address this issue, we propose to leverage our massively-parallel site-directed mutagenesis pipeline, Clone-seq, to generate clones for ~6,000 coding SNVs in the human population: ~4,000 from gnomAD and ~2,000 to be submitted by the international human genetics community. We will then experimentally examine the impact on protein stability and individual protein-protein interactions for every variant using high-throughput DUAL-FLUO and InPOINT (integrating PCA, LUMIER, Y2H, and wNAPPA) assays. This proposal brings together three groups with complementary expertise in high-throughput interactome experiments and network analysis from the Yu lab, in genomic and population genetic studies from the Clark lab, and in comprehensive biophysical and structural modeling of mutation’s impact on binding free energy of protein interactions from the Alexov lab. Out of the ~6,000 SNVs, we expect to identify ~1,200 disruptive SNVs and ~4,000 different SNV-interaction pairs where the SNV disrupt that specific interaction. The data produced by our project will increase the available experimental information by >140× in number of human proteins and >500× in number of interactions, allowing us for the first time to comprehensively assess the relationships between the impact of SNVs on interactions and their various population genetic attributes (including, but not limited to, allele frequency and flanking haplotype, inter-population differentiation, local rate of recombination, allele age, modes of selection). Finally, we will establish a computational-experimental- integrated iterative learning scheme to build a multi-layer random-forest-based framework, SIMPACT, which can accurately predict specific impacts on all individual protein-protein interactions for all missense SNVs. Our proposed work will fuel hypothesis-driven research, will significantly improve our functional understanding of variants, and will likely fundamentally change the experimental design and data interpretation for whole genome/exome studies going forward. The dramatic increase of DNA variants discovered through advances in sequencing technologies has been inadequately translated into therapeutic successes. Although many of these variants are related to human disorders, the overwhelming number of non-functional variants makes the assessment of functional significance a steep challenge. In this study, we aim to develop a high-throughput pipeline to quickly clone and directly test a large number of coding variants for their impact on the human interactome network and use the results to build a machine learning pipeline to predict functional impact of all coding variants, in anticipation that both our experimental data and computational pipeline will lead to broad clinical and therapeutic applications.",Quantifying molecular consequences of human missense variants with large-scale interactome perturbation studies,9629970,R01GM125639,"['Address', 'Age', 'Alleles', 'Amino Acids', 'Automobile Driving', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Assay', 'Biophysics', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Coupling', 'Crystallization', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Experimental Designs', 'Free Energy', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genes', 'Genetic Recombination', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Haplotypes', 'Homology Modeling', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Individual', 'International', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Nucleotides', 'Output', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Population', 'Population Genetics', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Scheme', 'Site-Directed Mutagenesis', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'biological research', 'biophysical model', 'biophysical techniques', 'exome', 'experimental study', 'human interactome', 'improved', 'interest', 'molecular phenotype', 'mutant', 'next generation sequencing', 'protein function', 'protein protein interaction', 'random forest', 'screening', 'success', 'web portal', 'whole genome']",NIGMS,CORNELL UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,563248,0.11112636184956917

"Computational modulator design and machine learning to target protein-protein interactions Abstract The overall goal of my research program is to develop and apply computational tools to facilitate the rational design of modulators of important cellular pathways for therapeutic use. Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are central factors in cellular signaling and gene regulation networks. Their misregulation is associated with a variety of diseases, including cancer, neurodegenerative disease, autoimmune disease, and diabetes. Inevitably, many PPIs are biologically compelling targets for drug discovery. But despite a few notable successes, most PPIs have not been successfully targeted and remain undruggable. The fundamental challenge derives from their intrinsic structural features: the binding surfaces of many PPIs are generally large in area, flat, and dynamic. PPIs are often transient and involve multivalent contacts. Currently, one most promising PPI inhibitor discovery strategy is to use miniature protein domain mimetics (PDMs) to reproduce the key interface contacts utilized by nature. PDMs are advantageous as medium-sized molecules with high surface complementarity and a broader set of contact points than typical small molecules, but are still limited because—by definition—only a portion of the total PPI binding energy is captured in the interaction. The binding affinity of the synthetic domains is often lower than the cognate full-length proteins. On the other hand, targeted covalent inhibition is an orthogonal therapeutic approach fit to overcome the fundamental binding limitations at PPIs, but has a well-known drawback: the high reactivity of typical covalent warheads leads to nonspecific inhibition, and toxicity. Here we aim to develop computational methods for a new design strategy that will leverage the strengths of these two methods—PDMs and covalent inhibition—while simultaneously mitigating their respective limitations. The focus of the effort is to rationally discover potent inhibitors that will non-covalently recognize and then covalently target protein-protein binding interfaces with exquisite specificity. Furthermore, our development of robust scoring functions by integrating multitask machine learning and molecular modeling would significantly accelerate the rational drug discovery process. The planned work builds on our recent advances in three state-of-the-art computational approaches: AlphaSpace for fragment- centric topographical mapping of PPI interfaces; ab initio QM/MM molecular dynamics for modeling covalent inhibition; and a novel delta-machine learning strategy to simultaneously improve scoring, docking and screening performance of a protein-ligand scoring function. Our design efforts will result in highly specific and potent modulators of a variety of therapeutically important but previously undruggable PPI interfaces, providing new leads for drug development. Project Narrative Our computational methodology development work will lead to powerful computational tools for rational design of covalent and non-covalent inhibitors, which would significantly accelerate the drug discovery process. Our computational modulator design would result in highly specific and potent inhibitors of a variety of therapeutic targets, which can be used as tools for studying cell signaling and gene regulation, and as new leads for drug development.",Computational modulator design and machine learning to target protein-protein interactions,9684634,R35GM127040,"['Affinity', 'Area', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biological', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Drug Targeting', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Goals', 'Length', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Tertiary Protein Structure', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Uses', 'Toxic effect', 'Work', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'improved', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'learning strategy', 'mimetics', 'molecular dynamics', 'molecular modeling', 'multitask', 'novel', 'programs', 'protein protein interaction', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'success', 'therapeutic target', 'tool']",NIGMS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R35,2019,297553,0.04129744766653498
"Accelerating Site-specific Characterization of Protein Therapeutics with Novel Machine Learning Methods PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Title: Accelerating Site-specific Characterization of Protein Therapeutics with Novel Machine Learning Methods The project seeks to improve reliability and speed up the development of life-saving and life-enhancing, precision, protein therapeutics and magnify the positive impact of biomedical research and education worldwide, leading to a quantum leap in our understanding of the molecular and cellular pathways and mechanisms involved in healthy and diseased biological systems. The development of biologics is bottlenecked across the entire drug development process, from discovery to early stage candidate selection, process development and manufacturing, due to manual intervention in the mass spectrometry data analysis pipeline. Similarly, the proteomics research community is hindered as it moves from analysis of complex mixtures to more in-depth characterization of proteins and their modifications. Novel machine learning methods will be added to MassMatrix’s (LC-MS/MS software) proven analytical engine and visualization platform to minimize the loss of true positive peptide spectral matches. An innovative approach for efficient accountability of experimental data at the chromatogram level will also be researched, developed and added. The latter providing for easy traceability of each peak’s status in the chromatogram as soon as possible, thus providing convenient high-level assessment. Together, these aims are expected to improve the reliability and accuracy of results as well as to significantly reduce the mass spec bottleneck for the pharmaceutical industry and the research community. Deeper understanding and better decision making will follow, both having a potentially dramatic positive impact on downstream processes and resource deployment, including improved drug safety and efficacy.

"Structure based Prediction of the interactome The interactions of small molecules with proteins is not only omnipresent throughout cellular processes, but also of fundamental importance to drug design and disease treatment. Much like with protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions, high-throughput (HTP) experimental methods have led to the generation of enormous volumes of protein-small molecule and related data. However, in addition to sheer scale, high degrees of heterogeneity in these data, combined with proprietary ownership concerns when originating from within industry, present significant challenges to the sharing and full use of this data in basic research and therapeutic development. This proposal aims to develop new mathematical methods that can address not only interpreting the data itself, but also the collaborative and generative process through which researchers work: new cryptographic tools can enable unprecedented forms of secure sharing and collaboration between industry and the public, and deep learning of structural features can reduce the dependence of researchers on prior assumptions as to important predictors of drug-target interactions (DTI).  In our previous granting period, we successfully developed methods for structure-based prediction and HTP data analysis of protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions, uncovering novel biology (e.g., for neurodegenerative diseases). In this renewal, we aim to: 1) develop scalable methods for multi-party computation and differential privacy to enable the secure sharing of large proprietary drug-target interaction databases among industry and public researchers; 2) develop novel integrative machine learning approaches for identifying drug-target interactions based on interactome, molecular structure and chemogenomic data (in collaboration with co-I Jian Peng); and 3) establish innovative collaborations with industry, academia and the scientific community to drive use and adoption of these computational tools and technologies among practicing biomedical researchers.  Successful completion of these aims will provide both public and private research communities with scalable access to technologies for secure sharing of proprietary drug screening data as well as flexible, accurate tools for predicting drug-target interactions. All developed software will be made available via publicly accessible web-based portals under open source software licenses. Collaborations with research partners will validate the relevance of these tools to human health and disease, while the dissemination aim will ensure research communities convenient and ongoing access to these innovations. Narrative The interactions of small molecules with proteins are omnipresent throughout cellular processes and of fundamental importance to drug design and disease treatment, yet the task of predicting these interactions brings major challenges because of the heterogeneity and proprietary nature of the data. In this proposal, we develop new mathematical methods and software that can address not only interpreting the data itself, but also the collaborative and generative process through which researchers work: new cryptographic tools can enable unprecedented forms of secure sharing and collaboration between industry and the public, and deep learning can accelerate the drug discovery process.",Structure based Prediction of the interactome,9700682,R01GM081871,"['3-Dimensional', 'Academia', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Affinity', 'Algorithms', 'Basic Science', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Biotechnology', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Dependence', 'Disease', 'Disease Pathway', 'Drug Design', 'Drug Screening', 'Drug Targeting', 'Ensure', 'Essential Genes', 'Expression Profiling', 'Fright', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Knowledge', 'Licensing', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Structure', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Network-based', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Online Systems', 'Ownership', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Privacy', 'Privatization', 'Process', 'Progress Reports', 'Protein Analysis', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Protocols documentation', 'PubChem', 'RNA-Protein Interaction', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Secure', 'Software Tools', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Trust', 'Work', 'analysis pipeline', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'convolutional neural network', 'cryptography', 'data integration', 'data sharing', 'deep learning', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'drug efficacy', 'experimental analysis', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'gene interaction', 'high dimensionality', 'high throughput analysis', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mathematical methods', 'medical schools', 'novel', 'open source', 'predictive tools', 'repository', 'research and development', 'small molecule', 'software development', 'therapeutic development', 'tool', 'web-accessible']",NIGMS,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2019,354744,0.06335284309742524
"Unraveling molecular and system-level mechanisms of human disease-associated protein mutations Project Summary Although a quickly expanding catalogue of protein mutations have been discovered, including those that cause human diseases or confer drug resistance, mechanistic understanding and prediction of functional consequences of these mutations remain rather limited. There is a critical need to develop novel, multiscale computational frameworks that are rigorous and generalizable to help close the ever-increasing gap between phenotypic data and mechanistic knowledge about the mutations and to develop effective therapeutic strategies.  My long-term research goals are two folds: (1) to unravel how a change in protein sequence ripples through various aspects of molecular and system-levels to a change in cellular function and cause human diseases or confer drug resistance; and (2) to translate learned mechanistic knowledge to effective drug-design strategies for human diseases and drug resistance. Toward these goals I propose to advance and combine the strengths of computational molecular biology (structural modeling and design for proteins or protein interactions) and computational systems biology (pathway/network-level topology and dynamics) and follow a novel, formal paradigm to develop methods that systematically identify mechanisms underlying various stages of consequence propagation (from conformation, molecular and system-level variables, to cellular functions, where intermediates can be skipped if necessary). In the forward direction of propagating consequences, I will determine, explain and understand mutational consequences at various levels with machine learning, causal analysis, and combinatorial optimization, starting with known or modelled changes at various levels. In the inverse direction of designing consequences, I will follow known or learned mechanistic hypotheses and develop efficient combinatorial optimization methods to design mutagenesis experiments or screen / design ligands for desired perturbations at various levels, which would test and refine corresponding hypotheses directly and translate mechanistic hypotheses to therapeutic strategies. Mechanisms underlying distal (potentially allosteric) mutations, multiple mutations within a protein or across proteins as well as systems pharmacology strategies will also be rigorously determined in the process.  The expected outcomes from the innovative project will include two main components. The first will be both biophysical principles of proteins and integrative understanding of biomedical systems, which will be organized in a database for public access. The second will be translating mechanistic insights into therapeutic intervention strategies to treat diseases. In particular, targeted experiments (mutagenesis or ligand-binding) will be designed following known or discovered mechanistic hypotheses. This project will involve close collaboration with structural biologists and clinician-scientists who are active collaborators of the PI. Project Narrative Genetic mutations, many of which lead to protein mutations, are often associated with human diseases: they often directly cause diseases or contribute to their progressions. Understanding mechanisms by which these mutations lead to significant functional consequences is of extreme importance to developing effective therapeutics to cure diseases and ameliorate drug resistance.",Unraveling molecular and system-level mechanisms of human disease-associated protein mutations,9774239,R35GM124952,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Biophysics', 'Catalogs', 'Cell physiology', 'Collaborations', 'Combinatorial Optimization', 'Computational Molecular Biology', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Disease Resistance', 'Distal', 'Drug Design', 'Drug resistance', 'Goals', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Ligand Binding', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutation', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmacology', 'Process', 'Protein Engineering', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Scientist', 'Structural Biologist', 'Structural Models', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Translating', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'computer framework', 'design', 'experimental study', 'human disease', 'innovation', 'insight', 'novel', 'phenotypic data']",NIGMS,TEXAS ENGINEERING EXPERIMENT STATION,R35,2019,335245,0.05220218978458675
"A predictive model of mRNA stability and translation for variant interpretation and mRNA therapeutics The leading and trailing untranslated regions (UTRs) of an mRNA, along with the coding sequence (CDS), control protein production by modulating translation and mRNA stability. However, although we have identified a vast number of regulatory features in these regions, we are still far from being able to predict, for example, whether and how a sequence variant affects the levels of protein being made. Here, we propose to combine high-throughput experimental characterization of protein expression in synthetic libraries with machine learning to create predictive models of translation and mRNA stability, addressing an urgent need. Recent progress in machine vision, voice recognition and other fields of computer science has been driven by the availability of enormous data sets on which to train models. Machine learning approaches have also had remarkable impact in biology, but biological data sets often are comparatively small, limiting the quality of models that can be learned. For example, there are only around 20,000 genes in the human genome, a restrictively small set of examples for training a predictive model that captures the full extent of the genome’s “regulatory code.” In this proposal, we aim to overcome this data size limitation by training predictive models of protein expression on data from millions of synthetic constructs -- a data set several orders of magnitude larger than the number of genes in the genome. Specifically, we will create libraries of in vitro transcribed mRNA with targeted variation in the UTRs and CDS and will assay protein expression of each library member by performing high-throughput polysome profiling, ribosome profiling, and mRNA stability assays. We will then use neural network approaches to learn predictive models of the relationship between mRNA sequence and levels of protein production. We will apply our models to three applications of practical importance: first, we expect to uncover novel biology, for example identifying regulatory sequence elements and interactions between them. Second, we will validate our models through the de novo design and experimental testing of sequences that result in higher levels or protein production than any of the millions of randomly generated members of the original library or than the endogenous UTR sequences currently used in biotechnology. Such stable and highly translating mRNA constructs would be of particular value for the field or mRNA therapeutics. Third, we will predict the functional consequences of genetic variation in UTRs on protein production and we will validate these predictions experimentally. We are far from understanding which genetic variants compromise gene regulatory function in ways that may contribute to disease, making such a comprehensive and quantitative analysis of variants valuable. This research project aims to use machine learning to build predictive models of translation and mRNA stability. Models are trained on data obtained by measuring protein production for millions of synthetic RNA constructs. Models will then be applied for understanding the consequences of genetic variation in humans and for the design of mRNA therapeutics.",A predictive model of mRNA stability and translation for variant interpretation and mRNA therapeutics,9712954,R01HG009892,"['3&apos', ' Untranslated Regions', '5&apos', ' Untranslated Regions', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Biotechnology', 'Code', 'Computational Technique', 'DNA Library', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Expression Library', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Programming', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Translation', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Human', 'Human Engineering', 'Human Genetics', 'Human Genome', 'Image', 'In Vitro', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Performance', 'Polyribosomes', 'Production', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'RNA Splicing', 'RNA Stability', 'RNA-Binding Proteins', 'Randomized', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Ribosomes', 'Role', 'Site', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Thiouridine', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Untranslated Regions', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'comparative', 'computer science', 'convolutional neural network', 'design', 'experimental study', 'genetic variant', 'mRNA Stability', 'machine vision', 'member', 'neural network', 'novel', 'polysome profiling', 'practical application', 'predictive modeling', 'protein expression', 'ribosome profiling', 'screening', 'stable cell line', 'synthetic construct', 'voice recognition']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2019,459955,0.04824304586488791
"Understanding membrane proteins’ allosteric modulation with cryo-EM Project Summary/Abstract My laboratory's research is focused on understanding the molecular mechanisms key to the regulation of membrane protein function and to the modulation of their output signaling. We use cryo-EM and advanced classification methods, such as manifold embedding, combined with modeling and molecular dynamics to study how ligands produce shifts in conformation equilibria and bias signaling output. We are currently studying two systems that allow us to study how different types of ligands influence the gating of ion channels. We are studying the role of lipids in triggering gating of mechanosensitive channels of the MscS family, a model system of membrane tension-sensing which can yield important information about the fundamental principles governing ion channel gating and the role that lipid-protein interactions play in this process. We have a longstanding interest in the mechanism and modulation of the ryanodine receptor (RyR), a calcium release channel fundamental to heart and skeletal function. We are using manifold embedding, a machine learning-based method to analyze cryo-EM images, to better understand how small molecules and ions such as calcium and ATP affect the conformational energy landscape of the channel. We aim to shed light on the gating mechanism of this very large ion channel, a prerequisite to understanding of its modulation by protein ligands, post-translational modifications and drugs. Our approach to these fundamental problems is to use a commbination of cryo-electron microscopy, advanced image classification techniques, modelling and molecular dynamics simulations to delineate allosteric pathways mechanistically and then test proposed models with biophysical methods such as single-channel measurements, HDX-MS and mutagenesis. Our ultimate aim is to greatly increase our molecular understanding of the gating and allosteric modulation of ion channels. Progress towards such knowledge has the potential to open the way for the design of small molecule allosteric modulators with very well controlled effects on their targets, aiding the development of drugs with limited side effects. A longer-term aim is to further develp and use our tools towards gaining a better understanding of allosteric modulation in other classes of membrane proteins of therapeutic importance. In particular, G protein-coupled receptor ligands can induce the selective binding of different transducers in a process called biased signaling. The molecular mechanisms at play in this process are still poorly understood despite their fundamental importance for the development of safer drugs. Project Narrative Ion channels are involved in a large number of vital processes, such as heart and muscle function for the ryanodine receptor and function of kidneys and regulation of blood pressure for mechanosensitive channels. This work focuses on understanding the function and regulation of ion channels. Better understanding of small ligand and lipid-protein interactions in these channels can lead more generally to a better understanding of ion channels function and to the design of drugs treating the numerous diseases associated with their malfunction.",Understanding membrane proteins’ allosteric modulation with cryo-EM,9798643,R35GM133598,"['Affect', 'Binding', 'Biological Models', 'Calcium', 'Classification', 'Cryoelectron Microscopy', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Design', 'Family', 'G-Protein-Coupled Receptors', 'Gated Ion Channel', 'Heart', 'Image', 'Ion Channel', 'Ion Channel Gating', 'Ions', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratory Research', 'Lead', 'Ligands', 'Light', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Membrane', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Muscle function', 'Mutagenesis', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Regulation', 'Renal function', 'Role', 'Ryanodine Receptor Calcium Release Channel', 'Signal Transduction', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Transducers', 'Work', 'base', 'biophysical techniques', 'blood pressure regulation', 'design', 'drug development', 'heart function', 'interest', 'molecular dynamics', 'protein function', 'side effect', 'skeletal', 'small molecule', 'therapeutic protein', 'tool']",NIGMS,ADVANCED SCIENCE RESEARCH CENTER,R35,2019,392500,0.053966430574987435
"Mass Spectrometry Measurements for Complex PTMs Abstract:  Recombinant protein expression technology has revolutionized human health research, enabling scientists to generate large quantities of protein for small-molecule drug discovery campaigns, for the development of protein-based drugs, and for studying protein structure and function. Yet while researchers are adept at producing proteins with known genetic sequences, they possess entirely inadequate knowledge about the protein's post-translational modifications, both during recombinant expression and when the proteins are isolated from endogenous sources. Alterations in a protein's post-translational modifications can change the protein from an active enzyme to a dead one; they can change a protein-based drug from a life-saving molecule to one that is either ineffective or worse, dangerously immunogenic; these seemingly simple “add- ons” to proteins can be the defining features that determine whether the protein functions as designed or not. Characterizing proteins' PTMs is a necessary prerequisite for identifying disease states, modulating protein binding and function, and producing safe and effective protein-based drugs and vaccines. The long term goals of my research program are to expedite the analysis of post-translational modifications (PTMs) on proteins, to use these analytical tools to answer critical health-related challenges, and to widely distribute the technology. We are pursuing both near-term advancements, such as developing a robust solution to quantifying aberrant disulfide bonds in recombinant proteins, as well as long-range, revolutionary changes in the way proteins are analyzed, by laying the foundational infrastructure needed to bring artificial intelligence solutions to the field of PTM analysis. We will develop and launch these technologies in the context of meaningful biological problems where field advancements cannot be made without information about proteins' PTMs. Solutions in the fields of HIV vaccine design, cancer treatment, and antibody therapy will be targeted first. Project Narrative:  Rapid, precision tools are needed to assess and quantify proteins' post-translational modifications (PTMs); such tools will drive the production of optimal proteins and enable the detection of disease biomarkers. We will make the necessary tools, distribute them widely, and use them to solve key problems in a number of disease contexts.",Mass Spectrometry Measurements for Complex PTMs,9626635,R35GM130354,"['Antibody Therapy', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Complex', 'Dangerousness', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Enzymes', 'Foundations', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'HIV vaccine', 'Health', 'Human', 'Infrastructure', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Post Translational Modification Analysis', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Production', 'Protein Analysis', 'Proteins', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Recombinants', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Savings', 'Scientist', 'Source', 'Technology', 'Vaccine Design', 'Vaccines', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'design', 'disulfide bond', 'drug discovery', 'immunogenic', 'programs', 'protein expression', 'protein function', 'protein structure function', 'small molecule', 'tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS LAWRENCE,R35,2019,377124,0.11309228716239626
"Systems-level functional proteomics analysis assemblies in Alzheimer's disease and mouse models of tauopathy The goal of this proposal is to comprehensively map and identify the subnetworks of synaptic protein complexes that are central players in the synaptic dysfunction occurring with neurodegeneration. We will use the emerging power of quantitative network proteomics in the Emili laboratory to systematically characterize the major protein assemblies present at normal and diseased synapses on a proteome scale. This research will be propelled by discoveries from the Wolozin laboratory demonstrating that a dynamic network of protein interactions drives tau biology and changes with the course of disease. Interpreting these perturbed assembly networks, though, demands knowledge of the localization and compositional specificity of such complexes. The unbiased interactome screening technology developed by the Emili laboratory is uniquely suited for unbiased interrogations of synaptic protein networks. We hypothesize that selective disruption of specific synaptic protein assemblies mediates the functional degeneration associated with tauopathy. Aim 1 will determine how synaptic protein complexes differ between general cortical and cholinergic neurons. We will isolate and biochemical separate synaptic assemblies from total cortical and cholinergic (ChAT::GFP) synapses, using FACS to further purify ChAT:GFP synapses. Separated assemblies will be characterized by precision mass spectrometry and integrative data mining (machine learning) procedures to determine their composition and post- translational modification states, and to map dynamically changing interactions implicated in altered synaptic function during normal aging. Aim 2 will determine how the macromolecular structures of synaptic protein assemblies change with aging and AD. We will analyze cortical synaptosomal complexes from P301S tau and P301S tau x TIA1+/- mice, the latter which exhibited delayed degeneration. Key drivers in synaptic dysfunction will be identified and verified in AD and control human samples by co-immunoprecipitation. Aim 3 will identify complexes that are critical drivers of synaptic function by disrupting prioritized assemblies using genetic and opticogenetic tools. This work will determine key regulators of synaptic function in health and disease, and will also produce expanded genetic tools and outstanding targets for future approaches using bio-engineered regulation.

"Misfoldome-centered multiOMICS approach to unravel preeclampsia subphenotypes ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Preeclampsia is a heterogeneous disorder specific to human pregnancy and an important contributor to maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality worldwide. To date, there is no cure for preeclampsia except delivery. Spearheaded by our prior proteomics research, we discovered that preeclampsia shares characteristics of protein misfolding with established conformational disorders including Alzheimer's. These features involve urine congophilia (affinity for the amyloidophilic dye Congo red), affinity for conformational state-dependent antibodies, and dysregulation in the amyloid proteolytic pathway in the placenta and decidua. Our overarching hypothesis is that the excessive formation of misfolded proteins in preeclampsia is driven by increased macromolecular crowding due to defective clearance and/or underlying metabolic disorders leading to faulty protein folding. As a result, the universe of misfolded proteins (misfoldome) could be a rich source of biomarkers more closely related to disease etiology than the properly folded proteome. We propose to use existing biorepositories to understand the underpinnings of different subtypes of preeclampsia. Specifically, we aim to discover specific markers and druggable targets relevant to each preeclampsia subtype that can be corrected before the onset of manifest disease. To achieve these goals we will investigate 4 ""omics"" layers: proteomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics and phenomics uniquely integrated through machine learning bioinformatics approaches aimed to solve complex and interconnected systems biology data. These include: Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) and ""fuzzy"" soft clustering algorithms for integration of multi-omics data layers. Specific Aim 1 plans to apply shotgun bottom-up proteomics methods to catalogue the protein components of the misfoldome as reflected in urine congophilic aggregates of women with various clinical subphenotypes of preeclampsia. The proteins and biophysical characteristics of peptide sequences in the misfoldome will be analyzed and compared with those of total urine and serum proteomes. Specific Aim 2 plans to illuminate biological pathways of high interest by triangulating proteomics with transcriptomics (RNAseq on placental villous and decidual tissues) and metabolomics (serum and urine) data. Lastly, Specific Aim 3 will validate urine congophila and the newly discovered molecular signatures in a large biorepository of women followed longitudinally during their first pregnancy (nuMoM2b cohort). Together, the three aims of this proposal offer a unique opportunity toward personalized therapeutic options for preeclampsia before the onset of clinically manifest disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Preeclampsia is a heterogeneous multi-systemic disorder of human pregnancy with unknown etiology and an important contributor to maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality. We determined preeclampsia shares features of protein misfolding with established protein conformational disorders including as Alzheimer's disease. Using machine learning algorithms uniquely available to our team, we will integrate four ""omics"" layers centered on the misfoldome: proteomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics and phenomics with ultimate goal toward discovery of personalized molecular signatures and druggable targets that can be corrected before onset of manifest disease.",Misfoldome-centered multiOMICS approach to unravel preeclampsia subphenotypes,9933617,R01HD084628,"['3-Dimensional', 'Affinity', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amyloid', 'Antibodies', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Catalogs', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Congo Red', 'Crowding', 'Cystic Fibrosis', 'Data', 'Decidua', 'Deposition', 'Diagnostic', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Disease', 'Dyes', 'Entropy', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Knowledge', 'Light Chain Deposition Disease', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Target', 'Multiomic Data', 'Neonatal Mortality', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Organ', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Perinatal mortality demographics', 'Phenotype', 'Placenta', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Pregnant Women', 'Prion Diseases', 'Protein Conformation', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Secondary to', 'Serum', 'Shotguns', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Source', 'Specimen', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'Villous', 'Woman', 'adverse pregnancy outcome', 'base', 'biobank', 'biophysical properties', 'clinical heterogeneity', 'cohort', 'curative treatments', 'cytotoxicity', 'design', 'driving force', 'druggable target', 'extracellular', 'functional outcomes', 'improved', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'maternal morbidity', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'misfolded protein', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple omics', 'neonatal morbidity', 'neonatal outcome', 'novel therapeutics', 'perinatal morbidity', 'personalized therapeutic', 'phenome', 'phenomics', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'protein aminoacid sequence', 'protein folding', 'protein misfolding', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'trophoblast']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,R01,2019,626430,0.07532990041858872

"Integrative approach to studying LncRNA functions ABSTRACT  Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play regulatory roles in biological cell process and disease development. It has been emerging as a key regulator of diverse cellular processes. Great efforts have been made towards investigation of lncRNA functions with both experimental determination and theoretical modeling, leading to a rudimentary understanding of this class of RNAs. However, all of these cannot keep pace with the fast growth of diverse genetic data and urgent request of individual lncRNA function annotation, which is inhibited by the tremendous amount of lncRNAs and expensive experimental cost. This propose aim to address this issue by providing efficient and user-friendly tools for key lncRNA discovery and lncRNA function annotation. To do so, we will develop a unique bioinformatics and Systems Biology integrated approach, ISSNLncFA system, which enables the integration of all sorts of omics data and a comprehensive understanding of lncRNA functions.  We propose three specific aims for the ultimate lncRNA function annotation: (1) To develop a novel Co- Modules-based LncRNA Function Annotation (CoMoLncFA) model to detect key lncRNAs and to annotate lncRNA functions at post transcription level as lncRNA-PCG co-modules, lncRNA-pathways association network and lncRNA’s triplets (lncRNA-miRNA/TF-PCG) by considering the expression profiles of lncRNA, protein coding genes and miRNAs and transcript factors, and integrating the curated protein-protein interactions and biological pathways. (2) To develop a novel Structure-based LncRNA-protein Function Annotation (STRULncFA) model to characterize lncRNAs identified from Aim 1 by using their primary sequences and secondary structures for detecting lncRNA-protein functional relations; and to further reveal the regulatory roles and mechanism of these lncRNAs by determining the binding sites in both lncRNA and protein. (3) To experimentally validate the identified abnormal lncRNAs and their cellular products, to validate the identified lncRNA-protein interacting pairs and the predicted binding sites, and to develop software tools and an environment for functional annotation of lncRNAs, use these tools to evaluate the overall proposed approach, and apply them to identify lncRNA functions that may be involved in cell states, species, diseases and cancers and build lncRNA function databases.  We believe that we will build the models, tools and databases, and make them available to the public in a timely fashion. Our achievements will lead to a complete understanding of lncRNA functions and regulatory roles in cell and disease states. Moreover, our models and tools will be feasibly transformed to other function annotation tasks and disease studies with appropriate changes, and thus will move forward the general function annotation community and disease-related drug or therapy development.

"Integrating experiment and theory for predicting protein folding pathways and structure Project Summary/Abstract  Protein folding and dynamics are integral to many biological activities, including chaperone action, degradation, amyloid diseases and aging. Our goal is to combine experimental and computational studies to produce a predictive understanding of protein dynamics through the development of methods capable of simulating folding and dynamics just using physio-chemical principles. Our past studies have focused on single domain proteins. Our efforts have expanded to more complicated systems including the snow flea anti-freeze protein (sfAFP) and TonB-dependent transporters (TBDT) that are relevant to iron sequestration in pathogenic bacteria. Tying these studies together is our new molecular dynamics (MD) package, Upside, which can reversibly fold some proteins up to 97 AA to under 4 Å Cα-RMSD in cpu-days without the use of fragments, homology or evolution. Upside utilizes a number of unique features, including rapid side chain packing that enables simulations using only 3 backbone atoms while retaining considerable detail and avoiding side chain “rattling”, which slows all-atom methods. We will improve Upside and implement enhanced sampling methods to increase our accuracy and size range, and study protein dynamics as monitored by hydrogen exchange.  sfAFP's unique structure challenges conventional wisdom regarding cooperative folding and stability. Lacking a hydrophobic core to promote folding, other factors must contribute to sfAFP's stability. We will test our quantum calculations that sfAFP's H-bonds are unusually stable by measuring amide H/D fractionation factors and NMR J-couplings. We will evaluate whether intrinsic biases in backbone dihedral angles for the PP2 basin in the unfolded state are another major stabilizing factor. This information will be used to improve the Upside simulations. Finally, we will apply our standard folding tools to characterize the folding pathway and compare it to the behavior we expect based on principles derived from proteins with hydrophobic cores.  Many aspects of the transport cycle in TBDT remain unknown despite protracted study, including the conformational rearrangement of the plug domain during transport. We will provide the first structure of the plug domain outside the barrel, and so answer whether this structure matches the crystal structure in the barrel. Additionally, the study of Nakamoto's V10C-S120C variant of the BtuB plug enables the investigation of a possible folding or transport intermediate. We will characterize the plug's dynamics while it is in the barrel using HX to observe possible transport-competent states. The mechanism of plug folding and insertion into the barrel will be investigated, with comparative studies for FhuA, a TBDT whose plug domain is intrinsically disordered in solution. These studies represent an exciting combination of protein folding and function, at the interface between soluble and membrane folding, using experiments and complementary folding simulations. Project Narrative We are combining experimental and computational approaches to produce a predictive understanding of protein folding and dynamics. Our focus has expanded to more complicated systems, including an anti-freeze protein and the plug domain of the TonB-dependent transporters involved in pathogenic bacterial iron sequestration.

"Determining the scope of prenylatable protein sequences PROJECT SUMMARY This study investigates the specificity of farnesyl transferase (FTase) that isoprenylates CaaX proteins. Studies probing the in vivo activity of the FTase have historically used reporters (e.g. Ras GTPases) that undergo complex multi-step post-translational modification (PTM), involving initial farnesylation followed by CaaX proteolysis and carboxyl methylation. This study takes advantage of Hsp40 Ydj1, a farnesylation-only reporter for which we have developed a range of methods to monitor its PTM status. Its use reveals that farnesylation is not necessarily coupled to subsequent PTMs as has been generally accepted for CaaX proteins, and that FTase specificity is significantly more promiscuous than anticipated. These findings challenge the conventional paradigm for how farnesylated proteins are modified and which proteins are targeted by FTase. We will extend our studies to fully resolve the specificity of FTase using a combination of genetic, biochemical, bioinformatic, and biophysical studies. We bring to bear on our investigations an exceptionally strong set of preliminary findings, the complementary expertise of several research groups, and a comprehensive molecular toolbox for the study of farnesylated proteins and other enzymes associated with this post-translational modification pathway. PROJECT NARRATIVE Farnesylated proteins are intimately involved in disease. This project investigates the target specificity of the farnesyl transferase that mediates protein farnesylation.

"UniProt: A centralized protein sequence and function resource Project summary The mission of the Universal Protein Resource (UniProt) is to support biomedical research by providing a freely available, stable, comprehensive, richly and accurately annotated protein sequence knowledgebase (www.uniprot.org). UniProt integrates, interprets and standardizes data from a multitude of sources to achieve the most comprehensive catalog of protein sequences and functional annotation available to date, providing information from hundreds of thousands of publications for tens of millions of proteins from tens of thousands of species. The activities proposed here will increase the utility of UniProt for biomedical research and precision medicine. The expert curated functional information provided by UniProt is widely acknowledged to be of exceptional quality and is continuously updated as new knowledge becomes available. Our first aim will be to continue to curate the scientific literature to ensure UniProt remains up to date. We will also work with the text-mining community to continue to improve curation efficiency. The curated records (0.5 million) are complemented by the (80 million) records for uncharacterized proteins. To ensure their usefulness for the community we will continue to develop our automatic annotation systems to annotate these proteins based on the knowledge of characterized proteins. Our third aim is to connect to and integrate protein data from resources around the world to make UniProt the worldwide global hub of protein information. The integration of clinical variation data as well as metabolomics information with proteins will help to support the multi-omics approaches of precision medicine. Our fourth aim describes the production of the resource to ensure that our data is freely available according to the FAIR principles. UniProt forms a foundation for hundreds of life sciences data resources. Continuous software development is needed to ensure delivery of this key component of the life science infrastructure. The UniProt website is used by hundreds of thousands of scientists every month. The final aim describes how we will enable this community to make best use of UniProt, through user training, outreach and improved user interfaces, driven by user testing.

"Proteomics of ciliopathy protein complexes Summary Ciliopathies are a diverse class of developmental diseases that can manifest as defects in kidney, skeletal, eye, heart, reproductive, or mental function. Many ciliopathies, including Bardet-Biedl, Joubert, and Meckel Gruber Syndromes, are caused by defects in the major protein complexes that characterize the ciliary compartment. At least 1,000 proteins are associated with cilia biogenesis and function; uncovering the principles of ciliary protein organization thus requires a large scale, systematic investigation. Our current human protein complex maps, while extensive, have only moderate coverage of ciliary proteins, warranting the collection of targeted experimental datasets. I will use comparative proteomic analysis of cilia from multiple organisms to determine deeply conserved protein-protein interactions likely to be critical to ciliary function in humans. Examining human biological systems in the context of their level of conservation across species is a productive route to distinguish biological signal from noise. My preliminary data on three ciliated species confirm that this approach is capable of identifying conserved ciliary protein complexes. If a pair of proteins are found in physical contact in diverse species, having survived speciation events and gene loss, it can be predicted that this physical interaction is important. First, using mass spectrometry, we will experimentally detect protein complexes within the cilia across a spectrum of eukaryotic organisms, broadly defining conserved ciliary proteins. Second, we will integrate our own experimental data, some of which we have already collected, with outside data to construct a system-wide map of conserved ciliary protein complexes. These conserved ciliary protein complexes are strongly predicted to be functionally important in humans, and potentially involved in human birth defects. Finally, we will test a targeted subset of proteins predicted to associate with known birth defect proteins in vivo using Xenopus laevis embryos as a model system. We have four candidate genes in hand, and will consider candidates from the prior aims as appropriate. This project will lead to a map of critical conserved ciliary protein complexes, a future primary resource for research into diverse ciliopathies. Project Narrative! Ciliopathies are a class of birth defects caused by defective cilia.

"Reshaping Immunogenicity of Proteins Abstract Immune responses to therapeutic proteins can pose enormous problems for the patient causing either adverse events or loss of efficacy. As therapeutic proteins represent one of the fastest-growing class of pharmaceuticals, it is vital to evaluate whether a protein is likely immunogenic early in the drug development stage and also to have methods available to re-design potential leads to eliminate immune response-causing epitopes. Equally important—yet demanding the opposite effect—is the design of broadly specific vaccines, where increased immunogenicity of subdominant conserved immunogens is desired. The adaptive immune response entails formation of a complex between a T-cell receptor (TCR) and a “foreign” peptide bound to a major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecule that is presented on an antigen presenting cell - a crucial step for the induction of high-titer IgG responses if CD4+ T helper cells become activated. De-immunization efforts of therapeutic proteins have mostly relied on experimental characterization of a large number of point mutants followed by laborious single peptide analysis assays. Data on of over 330,000 experimentally verified T-cell immuno-reactive peptides has been integration and used to predict new epitopes and to bias the computational re-design of a protein to eliminate T-cell epitopes. While this represents a promising strategy, improvements are still needed and no design approach to date is available to systematically incorporate optimized T-cell epitopes to increase immunogenicity. We propose to develop a novel computational design approach capable of reducing immunogenicity of therapeutic proteins or alternatively increasing immunogenicity of vaccine immunogens without disrupting proper folding or function. As proof of concept, we will demonstrate the ability of this approach to 1) reduce immunogenicity of a novel influenza protein therapeutic and 2) increase immunogenicity of influenza's hemagglutinin's stem-region. Finally, we will establish an in vitro high-throughput strategy to evaluate tiled peptide arrays derived from the re-designed proteins or viral surface proteins for the following characteristics: (a) immuno-reactivity, as defined by their ability to form a MHC-peptide complex and (b) ability to activate T-cells. Our approach will take advantage of oligonucleotide-chip technology and next-generation sequencing, enabling the screening of thousands of peptides in parallel. If successful, this strategy will provide a general computational protein design pipeline for reshaping the immunogenicity of proteins and immunogens as well as a two-level experimental verification platform for T-cell epitopes. Narrative The objective of this proposal is to establish a robust platform using both experimental and computational methods that enables the quick and facile identification, verification and re-design immune-reactive epitopes with the goal to either eliminate or introduce T-cell stimulating epitopes. The latter is applicable for the development of either therapeutics or immunogens for vaccination. We will use novel influenza therapeutics and universal vaccines as proof of concept.",Reshaping Immunogenicity of Proteins,9647931,R21AI143399,"['Adverse event', 'Alleles', 'Anaphylaxis', 'Antibody Response', 'Antigen-Presenting Cells', 'Antigens', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Autoimmune Process', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes', 'Cause of Death', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Epitopes', 'Escherichia coli', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Genetic Drift', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'Hemagglutinin', 'Homologous Gene', 'Hospitalization', 'Hybridomas', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunization', 'Immunize', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Influenza', 'Influenza Hemagglutinin', 'Influenza Therapeutic', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Histocompatibility Complex', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mutation', 'Oligonucleotides', 'Patients', 'Peptide Fragments', 'Peptides', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Procedures', 'Protein Engineering', 'Protein Fragment', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reaction', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Scheme', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'T cell response', 'T-Cell Receptor', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'T-Lymphocyte Epitopes', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Update', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccine Design', 'Vaccines', 'Variant', 'Vertebral column', 'Viral', 'Virus', 'Yeasts', 'adaptive immune response', 'base', 'cytokine release syndrome', 'density', 'design', 'drug development', 'experimental study', 'high throughput screening', 'immunogenic', 'immunogenicity', 'immunoreactivity', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'interest', 'large scale production', 'mutant', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'patient safety', 'protein aminoacid sequence', 'protein complex', 'response', 'screening', 'stem', 'therapeutic protein', 'therapeutic vaccine', 'universal influenza vaccine', 'universal vaccine']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA,R21,2019,225875,0.03154131944365082
"Functional Determinants in G-Protein-Coupled Receptors FUNCTIONAL DETERMINANTS OF G PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTORS PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The long-term goal of this work is to rationally manipulate G protein-coupled receptor (GPCRs) activation with the hope to develop novel therapeutic approaches in this major family of transmembrane receptors and drug targets. Our hypothesis is that evolutionary divergence patterns can reveal the roles that GPCR sequence positions play, individually or together, in order to mediate ligand binding, allosteric conformational switching, and finally ligand-biased activation of efferent signaling pathways, which can be G protein-dependent or independent. In the past funding period, computational analysis of such evolutionary patterns revealed: Intramolecular allosteric communication in the transmembrane domain of dopamine D2R receptor; Modular components of an allosteric switch controlling B2AR functional selectivity; A new non-canonical cAMP- independent signaling pathway in that same receptor; and Ligand specificity determinants in the extracellular domain of metabotropic glutamate receptors (MGluR). Technical progress led to: increased accuracy to assess the impact of coding mutations in proteins through a first-principle equation for the evolutionary variations of genotype and phenotype; The generalization of our analyses of evolutionary divergence to consider co-varying residues; and new methods to unravel complex simultaneous assay readouts to stratify drug effects on GPCRs. Together these and other data support new aims that combine biological and algorithmic goals: 1. To titrate mutationally the signaling bias of bioamine receptors. 2. To uncover allosteric mediators in metabotropic glutamate receptors. 3. To identify a systematic role of GPCR mutations in cancer. The outcome should reveal new aspects of the molecular basis of signaling in an important family of pharmaceutical targets. It will also link sequence and structure genomics databases to the molecular basis of function and to the rational re- design of protein function–key steps towards manipulating cellular pathways. FUNCTIONAL DETERMINANTS OF G PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTORS Narrative of the project G protein-coupled receptors account for nearly half of all current medications, yet so far relatively few have been successfully targeted by drugs. One of the difficulties is that we have limited knowledge of their mechanisms at a detailed level.

"MELD: accelerating MD modeling of proteins using Bayesian inference PROJECT SUMMARY This proposal is to develop MELD, a computational Bayesian accelerator that “melds” together molecular dynamics simulations with external knowledge. It is novel in harnessing information that has not been usable before – because it is too sparse, noisy, ambiguous, combinatoric, or too corrupted for traditional approaches. In contrast to the high-certainty restraints traditionally used in MD simulations, MELD leverages a much broader range of real-world high-uncertainty restraints. The first specific aim is to incorporate such information in protein structure determination, in several collaboration projects with experimentalists who perform solution x-ray scattering, ESR, and high-throughput alanine scanning structures of peptide protein complexes. The second aim is to also harness information about processes, trajectories, and dynamic routes to speed the identification of protein states. MELD promises to extend physics-based simulations for determining larger protein structures, for folding larger proteins, for binding more flexible ligands, and for exploring larger mechanistic actions, than current MD simulation methods can handle. PROJECT NARRATIVE Biomedical research and pharmaceutics depend on detailed understanding of the structures and motions of proteins. Molecular dynamics simulations provide the most detailed descriptions possible, however they cannot yet describe average to large sized protein structures or motions within a reasonable time frame. We propose to develop a new physics-based computational accelerator for Molecular Dynamics, called MELD, which incorporates many types of relevant external information that was too vague and difficult to compute to have been practically useful before.",MELD: accelerating MD modeling of proteins using Bayesian inference,9618886,R01GM125813,"['Affinity', 'Alanine', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Bayesian Method', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biomedical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Combinatorics', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Crystallization', 'Data', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Homology Modeling', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laws', 'Learning', 'Ligands', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Computations', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Motion', 'Pharmacy (field)', 'Physics', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Resolution', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Route', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Structural Protein', 'Structure', 'Supercomputing', 'System', 'TP53 gene', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Virginia', 'base', 'blind', 'deep learning', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'insight', 'molecular dynamics', 'novel', 'peptide structure', 'protein complex', 'protein structure', 'protein structure prediction', 'restraint', 'scale up', 'simulation']",NIGMS,STATE UNIVERSITY NEW YORK STONY BROOK,R01,2019,317007,0.0638746949207735
"Integrative computational framework for pattern mining in big -omics data: linking synonymous codon usage to protein biogenesis PROJECT SUMMARY Efficient production of functional proteins is arguably the most important function of a cell. Ribosomes synthesize proteins by decoding mRNA codons, and N-terminal portions of proteins can begin to fold even while synthesis is still underway. The genetic code is degenerate, meaning that most amino acids can be encoded by more than one codon. Because synonymous codon substitutions do not alter the amino acid sequence of the encoded protein, they have historically been regarded as “silent”. However, it is now known that some synonymous substitutions can disrupt the expression, folding, targeting and/or function of the encoded protein, although the precise mechanisms are poorly understood. Computational analyses have attempted to identify connections between the locations of synonymous codons and features of the encoded protein, but to date have yielded conflicting results, and there have been few attempts to experimentally test predictions made from these computational studies. Hence we currently lack a systematic understanding of the connections between synonymous codon usage and protein biogenesis. Establishing these connections would broadly transform our interpretation of synonymous codon substitutions, including single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with human disease and synonymous substitutions in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Establishing these connections would also enable the addition of coding sequence design as an integral aspect of the rational design of novel gene products (proteins). Thus, we aim to design an innovative integrative computational and experimental strategy with which to identify connections between codon usage patterns and protein biogenesis. We will search broadly for such connections, developing and applying several novel new approaches: (i) computational approaches to track, quantify and align synonymous codon usage patterns in homologous proteins, (ii) network approaches to map codon usage onto all levels of protein structure, and (iii) an innovative combination of broad and targeted experimental approaches to test the importance and specific effects of altering codon usage on protein biogenesis. Throughout the project, rigorous statistical methods will be applied to test the validity of identified connections, and cell-based experiments will be used to both test and refine hypotheses resulting from the computational analyses and develop new hypotheses that will feed back into the computational analyses. The goal of this project is to transform our understanding of the connections between synonymous codon usage and protein biogenesis. The endpoint for this project period is the development of a set of general principles for codon usage, including user-friendly open-source software to enable the biomedical community to analyze genes of interest for synonymous codon usage features likely to affect protein biogenesis. At the same time, our methodology will be generalizable, to allow the public to search for additional connections between sequence and/or network patterns and protein function, as well as for similar connections in other domains.

Historically, “synonymous” changes in a nucleic acid sequence were thought to be “silent”, but it is now emerging that some synonymous changes can change the folding of the encoded protein, and/or its transport into a membrane.

"Deep learning for protein subcellular/sub-organelle localizations and localization motifs Project Summary Eukaryotic cells have diverse cellular components, including subcellular organelles and sub-organelle compartments. The accurate targeting of proteins to these cellular components is crucial in establishing and maintaining cellular organizations and functions. Mis-localization of proteins is often associated with metabolic disorders and diseases. However, the vast majority of proteins lack subcellular/sub-organelle localization annotation. Compared with experimental methods, computational prediction of protein localization provides an efficient and effective way for proteome annotation and experimental design. The current prediction tools for protein localization have significant room for improvement. In addition, no tool can predict localization at the sub- organelle resolution or internal localization signals. Deep learning, as the cutting-edge technology in machine learning, presents a new opportunity for this classical bioinformatics problem. The availability of recent high- throughput localization data can also train deep learning well. The PI’s lab has demonstrated some success on a special case, i.e., predicting mitochondrial localizations for plants using deep learning.  In this project, the PI proposes to develop new methods and a standalone toolkit for accurate and scalable protein localization prediction at the subcellular and sub-organelle levels, as well as for characterization of localization motifs (including novel internal motifs). The general approach is to design a semi-supervised deep- learning method that utilizes both annotated protein sequences with known localization and unannotated protein sequences as training data. Through the realization of an unsupervised deep-learning approach, a general representation of protein sequences will be implemented, characterizing both local and global features of protein sequences. By visualizing and characterizing the deep-learning models, novel, interpretable protein sequence patterns will be predicted as putative targeting peptides and compared with known localization signals. We will also use the methods to be developed and the unsupervised models to be trained on all protein sequences as a general framework for other sequence-based prediction problems that predict the label of a protein and the key residues contributing to the label. We will make the platform highly customizable and apply it to three applications, including ubiquitination protein prediction, enzyme EC number prediction, and protein family/subfamily classification. The innovative contributions to protein sequence-based analyses and predictions include: (1) using raw amino acid sequences as training inputs without feature engineering; (2) utilizing the huge amount of unannotated data in an unsupervised deep learning to characterize a general protein feature representation; (3) identifying potential targeting signals (especially internal motifs) by decoding the trained deep- learning models, augmented with sophisticated attention mechanisms; 4) detecting multiple-organelle targeting and sub-organelle localizations by a novel hierarchical multi-label architecture; and (5) combining features from different data sources by a multiplicative fused CNN model. Relevance to Public Health  A protein typically has a well-defined localization in a cell to perform its function, and mis-localization of proteins is often associated with metabolic disorders and diseases. Protein localization prediction can provide valuable information for understanding disease mechanisms and designing treatment. To address the limitations of current computational methods, this project will apply cutting-edge deep-learning methods to deliver new computational methods and tools with improved accuracy and detailed sub-organelle prediction for protein localization.",Deep learning for protein subcellular/sub-organelle localizations and localization motifs,9600437,R21LM012790,"['Address', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Architecture', 'Attention', 'Base Sequence', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Enzymes', 'Eukaryotic Cell', 'Experimental Designs', 'Generations', 'Hybrids', 'Imagery', 'Label', 'Machine Learning', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mitochondria', 'Modeling', 'N-terminal', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Nobel Prize', 'Organelles', 'Pattern', 'Peptide Signal Sequences', 'Peptides', 'Plants', 'Protein Family', 'Protein translocation', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Supervision', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Ubiquitination', 'Work', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'deep learning', 'design', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'learning network', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'online resource', 'predictive modeling', 'protein function', 'recurrent neural network', 'success', 'therapy design', 'tool']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI-COLUMBIA,R21,2018,174375,0.11063525630086565
"Synergistic integration of topology and machine learning for the predictions of protein-ligand binding affinities and mutation impacts Project Summary Fundamental challenges that hinder the current understanding of biomolecular systems are their tremendous complexity, high dimensionality and excessively large data sets associated with their geometric modeling and simulations. These challenges call for innovative strategies for handling massive biomolecular datasets. Topology, in contrast to geometry, provides a unique tool for dimensionality reduction and data simplification. However, traditional topology typically incurs with excessive reduction in geometric information. Persistent homology is a new branch of topology that is able to bridge traditional topology and geometry, but suffers from neglecting biological information. Built upon PI’s recent work in the topological data analysis of biomolecules, this project will explore how to integrate topological data analysis and machine learning to significantly improve the current state-of-the-art predictions of protein-ligand binding and mutation impact established in the PI’s preliminary studies. These improvements will be achieved through developing physics-embedded topological methodologies and advanced deep learning architectures for tackling heterogeneous biomolecular data sets arising from a variety of physical and biological considerations. Finally, the PI will establish robust databases and online servers for the proposed predictions. Project Narrative The project concerns the integration of topological data analysis and machine learning architectures for the predictions of protein-ligand binding affinities and mutation induced protein stability changes from massive data sets. This new data approach has considerable impact for future generation methods in computational biophysics and drug design.",Synergistic integration of topology and machine learning for the predictions of protein-ligand binding affinities and mutation impacts,9591863,R01GM126189,"['Address', 'Affinity', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Big Data', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Sciences', 'Biophysics', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Drug Design', 'Electrostatics', 'Elements', 'Free Energy', 'Freedom', 'Future Generations', 'Geometry', 'Handwriting', 'Image Analysis', 'Induced Mutation', 'Ions', 'Learning', 'Ligand Binding', 'Ligands', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Membrane', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Metals', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mutation', 'Physics', 'Plant Roots', 'Proteins', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Site', 'Speech', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Thermodynamics', 'Work', 'algebraic topology', 'base', 'cofactor', 'data warehouse', 'deep learning', 'direct application', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'language processing', 'learning strategy', 'metallicity', 'models and simulation', 'multitask', 'mutant', 'neglect', 'next generation', 'search engine', 'tool', 'trend', 'user-friendly']",NIGMS,MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,319737,0.02035198462232308
"Towards a comprehensive multiscale 3D human interactome network PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Almost all proteins function through interacting with other proteins. On average, a protein interacts with ~5 other protein partners in the current human interactome. Therefore, it is of great importance to accurately determine the interface of each interaction, in order to understand how each protein works with different partners to carry out different functions. In our previous Nature Biotechnology study, we implemented a proteome-scale homology modeling approach to generate the first 3D human structural interactome: the interface for each interaction in this network was determined at atomic resolution through co-crystal structures and homology models. Using our 3D interactome, we found that, among >1,800 known disease genes associated with two or more clinically distinctly disorders, pairs of mutations on the same gene but in different interfaces with different partners are significantly more likely to cause distinct diseases. However, only 4,150 human protein interactions have co-crystal structures and 2,921 have high-quality homology models. ~50,000 interactions (87% of the current human interactome) are not amenable to current structural modeling methods. Here, we propose to develop a big-data-driven machine-learning approach integrating biophysiochemical, evolutionary, structural, and population genetic features to identify interaction- specific interfaces for the whole human interactome. Because several key features are unavailable for many proteins and interactions, we propose an innovative approach to use an ensemble of random forest classifiers, named Ensemble Protein Interface Classifier (EPIC), to address this large-scale non-random missing data problem (Aim 1). The high throughput of our massively parallel Clone-seq and INtegrated PrOtein INteractome perTurbation screening (InPOINT) pipeline! uniquely enables us to perform real-time experimental parameter optimization (in Years 2-4 we will clone ~1,500 mutations and examine their impact on ~2,500 interactions every year to iteratively evaluate and refine EPIC; Aim 2). Finally, we will construct a comprehensive multiscale 3D interactome for all known human protein-protein interactions: we will collect/generate atomic- resolution structural models for interactions whenever possible (co-crystal structures and homology models); we will accurately determine interaction-specific interface residues and domains for the whole human interactome. We will deploy an interactive web portal to disseminate our results and allow functional genomic inference in the context of our structural interactome (Aim 3). Our comprehensive multiscale 3D human interactome and the accompanying web portal will greatly reduce the barrier-to-entry for performing systematic structural analysis on a large number of proteins and their interactions, and open the flood gates for such analyses in genomic studies. NARRATIVE Almost all proteins function through interacting with other proteins and the structural details of these interaction interfaces are key in understanding protein function. However, the interfaces for vast majority of human protein interactions are currently unknown. Here, we propose to establish an innovative ensemble classifier approach and implement an unprecedented large-scale computational-experimental iterative learning scheme to predict interfaces for the whole human interactome, in anticipation that our predicted interfaces will help dissect functional sites of disease mutations and be useful for rational drug design to target these sites.",Towards a comprehensive multiscale 3D human interactome network,9520213,R01GM124559,"['Address', 'Big Data', 'Binding', 'Biotechnology', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Crystallization', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Drug Design', 'Evolution', 'Floods', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Homology Modeling', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Missense Mutation', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Names', 'Nature', 'Population Genetics', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Scheme', 'Site', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'Study models', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Work', 'biological research', 'forest', 'functional genomics', 'human interactome', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'protein function', 'protein protein interaction', 'screening', 'user-friendly', 'web portal', 'web-accessible']",NIGMS,CORNELL UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,384167,0.07834322588325304
"Computational modulator design and machine learning to target protein-protein interactions Abstract The overall goal of my research program is to develop and apply computational tools to facilitate the rational design of modulators of important cellular pathways for therapeutic use. Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are central factors in cellular signaling and gene regulation networks. Their misregulation is associated with a variety of diseases, including cancer, neurodegenerative disease, autoimmune disease, and diabetes. Inevitably, many PPIs are biologically compelling targets for drug discovery. But despite a few notable successes, most PPIs have not been successfully targeted and remain undruggable. The fundamental challenge derives from their intrinsic structural features: the binding surfaces of many PPIs are generally large in area, flat, and dynamic. PPIs are often transient and involve multivalent contacts. Currently, one most promising PPI inhibitor discovery strategy is to use miniature protein domain mimetics (PDMs) to reproduce the key interface contacts utilized by nature. PDMs are advantageous as medium-sized molecules with high surface complementarity and a broader set of contact points than typical small molecules, but are still limited because—by definition—only a portion of the total PPI binding energy is captured in the interaction. The binding affinity of the synthetic domains is often lower than the cognate full-length proteins. On the other hand, targeted covalent inhibition is an orthogonal therapeutic approach fit to overcome the fundamental binding limitations at PPIs, but has a well-known drawback: the high reactivity of typical covalent warheads leads to nonspecific inhibition, and toxicity. Here we aim to develop computational methods for a new design strategy that will leverage the strengths of these two methods—PDMs and covalent inhibition—while simultaneously mitigating their respective limitations. The focus of the effort is to rationally discover potent inhibitors that will non-covalently recognize and then covalently target protein-protein binding interfaces with exquisite specificity. Furthermore, our development of robust scoring functions by integrating multitask machine learning and molecular modeling would significantly accelerate the rational drug discovery process. The planned work builds on our recent advances in three state-of-the-art computational approaches: AlphaSpace for fragment- centric topographical mapping of PPI interfaces; ab initio QM/MM molecular dynamics for modeling covalent inhibition; and a novel delta-machine learning strategy to simultaneously improve scoring, docking and screening performance of a protein-ligand scoring function. Our design efforts will result in highly specific and potent modulators of a variety of therapeutically important but previously undruggable PPI interfaces, providing new leads for drug development. Project Narrative Our computational methodology development work will lead to powerful computational tools for rational design of covalent and non-covalent inhibitors, which would significantly accelerate the drug discovery process. Our computational modulator design would result in highly specific and potent inhibitors of a variety of therapeutic targets, which can be used as tools for studying cell signaling and gene regulation, and as new leads for drug development.",Computational modulator design and machine learning to target protein-protein interactions,9486119,R35GM127040,"['Affinity', 'Area', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biological', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Drug Targeting', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Goals', 'Length', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Surface', 'Tertiary Protein Structure', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Uses', 'Toxic effect', 'Work', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'improved', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'learning strategy', 'mimetics', 'molecular dynamics', 'molecular modeling', 'multitask', 'novel', 'programs', 'protein protein interaction', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'success', 'therapeutic target', 'tool']",NIGMS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R35,2018,297553,0.04129744766653498
"Probing Hidden Conformational Space and Dynamical States of Circadian Clock Proteins through Rigid Residue Scan and Machine Learning Protein dynamical distribution as ensemble in their phase space is directly linked to allostery. Some triggering events, such as binding process or chemical modification, could cause significant change of protein conformation as well as dynamics distribution. These led to two complementary allosteric models: conformation-driven and dynamics-driven allostery. Mutations of certain amino acid residues could alter distribution of protein conformation or dynamics, and regulate its allosteric function. This suggests that overall space for conformational and dynamical distribution potentially accessible for certain protein is much larger than those of specific structure, such as wild type. Certain perturbation including mutation could cause protein to dwell in additional (referred as hidden) conformational space or dynamical states. Therefore, directing proteins into these hidden states could serve as a novel approach in protein engineering. We propose to apply rigid residue scan method recently developed in our lab and machine learning models for data mining to systematically explore hidden conformational space and dynamical states of proteins with quantitative evaluations based on individual residue assessment. Our long-term goal is to exploit hidden conformational spaces and dynamical states of proteins and develop precise regulations of protein allostery and function. Two parallel and complementary specific aims are proposed to test our hypothesis that many proteins have hidden conformational space and dynamical states inaccessible to the wild type but could be accessed through certain perturbation, and that additional space and states lead to precise allostery regulation or even new protein functions. In Aim 1, we propose to identify residues guiding conformational driven allostery to reach certain hidden conformational space for conformation driven allosteric circadian clock proteins. We will apply rigid residue scan method to efficiently sample hidden conformational space, and develop dimension deduction and Markov state model to theoretically describe protein conformational space. We will also apply machine learning and feature selection methods to develop classification model to quantitatively measure the conformation driven allostery. In Aim 2, we propose to identify residues of dynamics driven allosteric protein as keys to reach hidden dynamical states for dynamics driven allosteric circadian clock proteins. Similarly, we will apply rigid residue scan method to efficiently sample hidden dynamical space, and apply machine learning and feature selection methods to quantitatively measure the dynamics driven allostery. Mutants will be designed for the identified key residues in both aims. These mutants will be subjected to further molecular simulation for validation purpose. Only those computationally validated mutants will be subject to experimental test. We expect that the proposed research will lead to a novel theoretical model of protein allostery and provide computational tools to quantitatively predict the impacts on protein allostery from specific residue, which could benefit experimental study of the circadian clock proteins to design mutants as novel optogenetic tools. Narratives Protein allostery regulates protein functional activities by perturbation at a distant site. Allosteric modulation has become a novel approach to develop optogenetic tools to control biological processes. Here we propose to exploit hidden conformational spaces and dynamical states of proteins and develop precise regulations of protein allostery and function. Our efforts will lead to a novel theoretical model of protein allostery and provide computational tools to quantitatively predict the impacts on protein allostery from specific residue.

"Structure based Prediction of the interactome The interactions of small molecules with proteins is not only omnipresent throughout cellular processes, but also of fundamental importance to drug design and disease treatment. Much like with protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions, high-throughput (HTP) experimental methods have led to the generation of enormous volumes of protein-small molecule and related data. However, in addition to sheer scale, high degrees of heterogeneity in these data, combined with proprietary ownership concerns when originating from within industry, present significant challenges to the sharing and full use of this data in basic research and therapeutic development. This proposal aims to develop new mathematical methods that can address not only interpreting the data itself, but also the collaborative and generative process through which researchers work: new cryptographic tools can enable unprecedented forms of secure sharing and collaboration between industry and the public, and deep learning of structural features can reduce the dependence of researchers on prior assumptions as to important predictors of drug-target interactions (DTI).  In our previous granting period, we successfully developed methods for structure-based prediction and HTP data analysis of protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions, uncovering novel biology (e.g., for neurodegenerative diseases). In this renewal, we aim to: 1) develop scalable methods for multi-party computation and differential privacy to enable the secure sharing of large proprietary drug-target interaction databases among industry and public researchers; 2) develop novel integrative machine learning approaches for identifying drug-target interactions based on interactome, molecular structure and chemogenomic data (in collaboration with co-I Jian Peng); and 3) establish innovative collaborations with industry, academia and the scientific community to drive use and adoption of these computational tools and technologies among practicing biomedical researchers.  Successful completion of these aims will provide both public and private research communities with scalable access to technologies for secure sharing of proprietary drug screening data as well as flexible, accurate tools for predicting drug-target interactions. All developed software will be made available via publicly accessible web-based portals under open source software licenses. Collaborations with research partners will validate the relevance of these tools to human health and disease, while the dissemination aim will ensure research communities convenient and ongoing access to these innovations. Narrative The interactions of small molecules with proteins are omnipresent throughout cellular processes and of fundamental importance to drug design and disease treatment, yet the task of predicting these interactions brings major challenges because of the heterogeneity and proprietary nature of the data.

"Quantifying molecular consequences of human missense variants with large-scale interactome perturbation studies Almost all proteins function through interacting with other proteins. Previous studies have shown that the vast majority of damaging single amino acid mutations in proteins disrupt only a subset of specific protein-protein interactions, and that mutations in the same protein that disrupt different interactions tend to cause clinically distinct disorders. Therefore, it is of great importance to determine interaction-specific disruptions caused by each mutation. Furthermore, rapid advances in sequencing technologies have enabled the identification of tens of millions of single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in the human population, driving an urgent need to understand the impact of each SNV on the human interactome network. Unfortunately, there is currently no method that is capable of predicting the specific impact of a large fraction of these SNVs on individual protein-protein interactions. To address this issue, we propose to leverage our massively-parallel site-directed mutagenesis pipeline, Clone-seq, to generate clones for ~6,000 coding SNVs in the human population: ~4,000 from gnomAD and ~2,000 to be submitted by the international human genetics community. We will then experimentally examine the impact on protein stability and individual protein-protein interactions for every variant using high-throughput DUAL-FLUO and InPOINT (integrating PCA, LUMIER, Y2H, and wNAPPA) assays. This proposal brings together three groups with complementary expertise in high-throughput interactome experiments and network analysis from the Yu lab, in genomic and population genetic studies from the Clark lab, and in comprehensive biophysical and structural modeling of mutation’s impact on binding free energy of protein interactions from the Alexov lab. Out of the ~6,000 SNVs, we expect to identify ~1,200 disruptive SNVs and ~4,000 different SNV-interaction pairs where the SNV disrupt that specific interaction. The data produced by our project will increase the available experimental information by >140× in number of human proteins and >500× in number of interactions, allowing us for the first time to comprehensively assess the relationships between the impact of SNVs on interactions and their various population genetic attributes (including, but not limited to, allele frequency and flanking haplotype, inter-population differentiation, local rate of recombination, allele age, modes of selection). Finally, we will establish a computational-experimental- integrated iterative learning scheme to build a multi-layer random-forest-based framework, SIMPACT, which can accurately predict specific impacts on all individual protein-protein interactions for all missense SNVs. Our proposed work will fuel hypothesis-driven research, will significantly improve our functional understanding of variants, and will likely fundamentally change the experimental design and data interpretation for whole genome/exome studies going forward. The dramatic increase of DNA variants discovered through advances in sequencing technologies has been inadequately translated into therapeutic successes. Although many of these variants are related to human disorders, the overwhelming number of non-functional variants makes the assessment of functional significance a steep challenge. In this study, we aim to develop a high-throughput pipeline to quickly clone and directly test a large number of coding variants for their impact on the human interactome network and use the results to build a machine learning pipeline to predict functional impact of all coding variants, in anticipation that both our experimental data and computational pipeline will lead to broad clinical and therapeutic applications.",Quantifying molecular consequences of human missense variants with large-scale interactome perturbation studies,9420242,R01GM125639,"['Address', 'Age', 'Alleles', 'Amino Acids', 'Automobile Driving', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Assay', 'Biophysics', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Coupling', 'Crystallization', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Experimental Designs', 'Free Energy', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genes', 'Genetic Recombination', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Haplotypes', 'Homology Modeling', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Individual', 'International', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Nucleotides', 'Output', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Population', 'Population Genetics', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Scheme', 'Site-Directed Mutagenesis', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'biological research', 'biophysical model', 'biophysical techniques', 'exome', 'experimental study', 'forest', 'human interactome', 'improved', 'interest', 'molecular phenotype', 'mutant', 'next generation sequencing', 'protein function', 'protein protein interaction', 'screening', 'success', 'web portal', 'whole genome']",NIGMS,CORNELL UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,577782,0.11112636184956917

In this study, we aim to develop a high-throughput pipeline to quickly clone and directly test a large number of coding variants for their impact on the human interactome network and use the results to build a machine learning pipeline to predict functional impact of all coding variants, in anticipation that both our experimental data and computational pipeline will lead to broad clinical and therapeutic applications.",Quantifying molecular consequences of human missense variants with large-scale interactome perturbation studies,9702305,R01GM125639,"['Address', 'Age', 'Alleles', 'Amino Acids', 'Automobile Driving', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Assay', 'Biophysics', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Coupling', 'Crystallization', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Experimental Designs', 'Free Energy', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genes', 'Genetic Recombination', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Haplotypes', 'Homology Modeling', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Individual', 'International', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Nucleotides', 'Output', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Population', 'Population Genetics', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Scheme', 'Site-Directed Mutagenesis', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'biological research', 'biophysical model', 'biophysical techniques', 'exome', 'experimental study', 'forest', 'human interactome', 'improved', 'interest', 'molecular phenotype', 'mutant', 'next generation sequencing', 'protein function', 'protein protein interaction', 'screening', 'success', 'web portal', 'whole genome']",NIGMS,CORNELL UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,99500,0.11088348135698806
"Understanding molecular rules governing protein allostery by deep mutational scanning Project Summary/Abstract Allostery is action at a distance in proteins. It is a property by which perturbation at one site of a protein causes an effect at a distant site of the protein. As nature's biological switches allosteric proteins regulate virtually every major process including catalysis, transcription, transport and signaling. Kinases, G-protein coupled receptors and nuclear receptors are therapeutically important allosteric proteins that play a major role in human health. Disruption of allosteric communication caused by mutations in these proteins is strongly associated with many types of disease abnormalities including cancer. Since the discovery of allostery in the 1960s, the molecular mechanism by which perturbation at one end of a protein is allosterically transmitted to the other end remains a mystery. Understanding molecular “rules” governing allostery is a fundamental problem in protein biochemistry and biophysics. Such rules may provide a deep insight into how proteins work through interactions between residues. Current approaches to studying allostery, which are biophysical, structural or computational, have two limitations. First, they provide an incomplete picture. Allostery involves the interplay of protein dynamics, structural changes and their effects on function. Probing each independently, as most studies do, does not give a complete understanding. Structure alone cannot explain dynamics, dynamical movement does not imply functional role, and functional studies may not provide insight into the underlying molecular causes. Second, detailed mechanistic studies of individual allosteric proteins while invaluable, are tedious, and cannot be scaled up to investigate many types of allosteric proteins. As a result, unifying heuristic rules would be difficult to infer from such individual case studies. The goal of my research is to develop a generalized, scalable method integrating structure, function and dynamics to understand, quantify and predict molecular drivers of protein allostery. With allosteric transcription factors as a model system, we will determine residues important for allostery (`hotspots') and their connectivity (`pathway') by deep mutational scanning, a method for large-scale functional characterization. We establish a critical link between structure and function by computationally modeling each mutation with Rosetta. We use machine learning on this rich sequence-structure-function dataset to recognize common molecular features (van der Waals, electrostatics, hydrogen bonds etc.) of allosteric hotspot residues, to build a predictive molecular model of allostery. Thus, we integrate high-throughput functional studies, structure-based modeling and machine learning to understand molecular rules governing allostery. Any allosteric protein whose activity can be coupled to a high-throughput screen, of which there are many, is amenable to our approach. Over time as the number and diversity of allosteric protein datasets increases, we expect that the accuracy and generalizability of predictions will continuously improve. Our long-term objective is to be able to (a) predict functional impact of thousands of mutations in disease-associated allosteric proteins revealed by genome sequencing (b) discover novel allosteric sites that improve selectivity and efficacy of drugs. Project Narrative GPCRs, nuclear receptors, ion channels and kinases are allosteric proteins that alone account for 44% of all human protein drug targets. We propose to develop a broad experimental and computational platform to understand molecular mechanism of allostery. This study will pave the way to explaining how dysfunction in allosteric proteins manifests into disease, and developing `smart' (allosteric) drugs that restore normal function.",Understanding molecular rules governing protein allostery by deep mutational scanning,9562195,DP2GM132682,"['Allosteric Site', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biophysics', 'Case Study', 'Catalysis', 'Communication', 'Computer Simulation', 'Coupled', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Distant', 'Drug Targeting', 'Electrostatics', 'Functional disorder', 'G-Protein-Coupled Receptors', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Hydrogen Bonding', 'Individual', 'Ion Channel', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Movement', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Nuclear Receptors', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Play', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protein Biochemistry', 'Protein Dynamics', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Work', 'base', 'drug efficacy', 'genome sequencing', 'heuristics', 'high throughput screening', 'improved', 'insight', 'molecular modeling', 'mutation screening', 'novel', 'scale up', 'transcription factor', 'virtual']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,DP2,2018,2146877,0.06937366593814714
"Unraveling molecular and system-level mechanisms of human disease-associated protein mutations Project Summary Although a quickly expanding catalogue of protein mutations have been discovered, including those that cause human diseases or confer drug resistance, mechanistic understanding and prediction of functional consequences of these mutations remain rather limited. There is a critical need to develop novel, multiscale computational frameworks that are rigorous and generalizable to help close the ever-increasing gap between phenotypic data and mechanistic knowledge about the mutations and to develop effective therapeutic strategies.  My long-term research goals are two folds: (1) to unravel how a change in protein sequence ripples through various aspects of molecular and system-levels to a change in cellular function and cause human diseases or confer drug resistance; and (2) to translate learned mechanistic knowledge to effective drug-design strategies for human diseases and drug resistance. Toward these goals I propose to advance and combine the strengths of computational molecular biology (structural modeling and design for proteins or protein interactions) and computational systems biology (pathway/network-level topology and dynamics) and follow a novel, formal paradigm to develop methods that systematically identify mechanisms underlying various stages of consequence propagation (from conformation, molecular and system-level variables, to cellular functions, where intermediates can be skipped if necessary). In the forward direction of propagating consequences, I will determine, explain and understand mutational consequences at various levels with machine learning, causal analysis, and combinatorial optimization, starting with known or modelled changes at various levels. In the inverse direction of designing consequences, I will follow known or learned mechanistic hypotheses and develop efficient combinatorial optimization methods to design mutagenesis experiments or screen / design ligands for desired perturbations at various levels, which would test and refine corresponding hypotheses directly and translate mechanistic hypotheses to therapeutic strategies. Mechanisms underlying distal (potentially allosteric) mutations, multiple mutations within a protein or across proteins as well as systems pharmacology strategies will also be rigorously determined in the process.  The expected outcomes from the innovative project will include two main components. The first will be both biophysical principles of proteins and integrative understanding of biomedical systems, which will be organized in a database for public access. The second will be translating mechanistic insights into therapeutic intervention strategies to treat diseases. In particular, targeted experiments (mutagenesis or ligand-binding) will be designed following known or discovered mechanistic hypotheses. This project will involve close collaboration with structural biologists and clinician-scientists who are active collaborators of the PI. Project Narrative Genetic mutations, many of which lead to protein mutations, are often associated with human diseases: they often directly cause diseases or contribute to their progressions. Understanding mechanisms by which these mutations lead to significant functional consequences is of extreme importance to developing effective therapeutics to cure diseases and ameliorate drug resistance.",Unraveling molecular and system-level mechanisms of human disease-associated protein mutations,9564155,R35GM124952,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Biophysics', 'Catalogs', 'Cell physiology', 'Collaborations', 'Combinatorial Optimization', 'Computational Molecular Biology', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Disease Resistance', 'Distal', 'Drug Design', 'Drug resistance', 'Goals', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Ligand Binding', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutation', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmacology', 'Process', 'Protein Engineering', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Scientist', 'Structural Biologist', 'Structural Models', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Translating', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'computer framework', 'design', 'experimental study', 'human disease', 'innovation', 'insight', 'novel', 'phenotypic data']",NIGMS,TEXAS ENGINEERING EXPERIMENT STATION,R35,2018,335245,0.05220218978458675
"A predictive model of mRNA stability and translation for variant interpretation and mRNA therapeutics The leading and trailing untranslated regions (UTRs) of an mRNA, along with the coding sequence (CDS), control protein production by modulating translation and mRNA stability. However, although we have identified a vast number of regulatory features in these regions, we are still far from being able to predict, for example, whether and how a sequence variant affects the levels of protein being made. Here, we propose to combine high-throughput experimental characterization of protein expression in synthetic libraries with machine learning to create predictive models of translation and mRNA stability, addressing an urgent need. Recent progress in machine vision, voice recognition and other fields of computer science has been driven by the availability of enormous data sets on which to train models. Machine learning approaches have also had remarkable impact in biology, but biological data sets often are comparatively small, limiting the quality of models that can be learned. For example, there are only around 20,000 genes in the human genome, a restrictively small set of examples for training a predictive model that captures the full extent of the genome’s “regulatory code.” In this proposal, we aim to overcome this data size limitation by training predictive models of protein expression on data from millions of synthetic constructs -- a data set several orders of magnitude larger than the number of genes in the genome. Specifically, we will create libraries of in vitro transcribed mRNA with targeted variation in the UTRs and CDS and will assay protein expression of each library member by performing high-throughput polysome profiling, ribosome profiling, and mRNA stability assays. We will then use neural network approaches to learn predictive models of the relationship between mRNA sequence and levels of protein production. We will apply our models to three applications of practical importance: first, we expect to uncover novel biology, for example identifying regulatory sequence elements and interactions between them. Second, we will validate our models through the de novo design and experimental testing of sequences that result in higher levels or protein production than any of the millions of randomly generated members of the original library or than the endogenous UTR sequences currently used in biotechnology. Such stable and highly translating mRNA constructs would be of particular value for the field or mRNA therapeutics. Third, we will predict the functional consequences of genetic variation in UTRs on protein production and we will validate these predictions experimentally. We are far from understanding which genetic variants compromise gene regulatory function in ways that may contribute to disease, making such a comprehensive and quantitative analysis of variants valuable. This research project aims to use machine learning to build predictive models of translation and mRNA stability. Models are trained on data obtained by measuring protein production for millions of synthetic RNA constructs. Models will then be applied for understanding the consequences of genetic variation in humans and for the design of mRNA therapeutics.",A predictive model of mRNA stability and translation for variant interpretation and mRNA therapeutics,9421497,R01HG009892,"['3&apos', ' Untranslated Regions', '5&apos', ' Untranslated Regions', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biology', 'Biotechnology', 'Code', 'Computational Technique', 'DNA Library', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Expression Library', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Programming', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Translation', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Human', 'Human Engineering', 'Human Genetics', 'Human Genome', 'Image', 'In Vitro', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Performance', 'Polyribosomes', 'Production', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'RNA Splicing', 'RNA Stability', 'RNA-Binding Proteins', 'Randomized', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Ribosomes', 'Role', 'Site', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Thiouridine', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Untranslated Regions', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'comparative', 'computer science', 'design', 'experimental study', 'genetic variant', 'mRNA Stability', 'member', 'novel', 'polysome profiling', 'practical application', 'predictive modeling', 'protein expression', 'ribosome profiling', 'screening', 'stable cell line', 'synthetic construct', 'voice recognition']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2018,444578,0.04824304586488791
"Quantitative Biotherapeutic Particle Characterization via Deep Neural Networks Project Summary  Despite their many beneﬁts and common use, protein-based drugs can elicit serious adverse side-effects. Many of these side-effects are believed to be caused by small protein aggregates. One tool for measuring these particles in a high-throughput fashion is Microﬂow-Imaging (MFI). MFI is commonly used in both academia and industry to characterize subvisible particles (those   25 m in size) in protein therapeutics. In many formulations protein aggregates that are   10 m in size account for upwards of 90% of the protein aggregates in the product. Subvisible protein aggregates have been demonstrated to correlate with adverse drug responses; however, which speciﬁc protein aggregates induce immunogenic responses remains unknown.  Pharmaceutical companies are required to record and catalog vast volumes of FIM data on protein therapeutic products, but are only mandated under FDA regulations (i.e., USP 788 ) to control the number of particles exceeding 10 and 25 m in delivered products. Hence a vast amount of digital images are available to analyze. Recent studies have indicated that some of the factors correlated with adverse drug responses are encoded in MFI image data.  Current state-of-the-art MFI analysis methods rely on a relatively low-dimensional list of “morphological fea- tures” to characterize particles, but these methods ignore an enormous amount of information encoded in the ex- isting large digital image repositories. Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs or “ConvNets”) have demon- strated the ability to extract predictive information from raw macroscopic image data without requiring the selection or speciﬁcation of “morphological features” in a variety of tasks. However, the heterogeneity, polydispersity of pro- tein therapeutics, and optical phenomena associated with subvisible MFI particle measurements introduce new challenges regarding the application of CNNs to MFI image analysis.  This proposal will spring from state-of-the-art deep CNN methods to provide new analysis tools capable of reliably analyzing and classifying heterogeneous MFI protein therapeutics data. The envisioned software product, capable of processing images from both of the leading manufacturers of MFI instruments (Fluid Imaging Inc. and ProteinSimple), will provide high-throughput, data-driven models that efﬁciently capture information encoded in the large collection of image data, avoiding the need to deﬁne “features” a priori and is anticipated to provide a paradigm shift to the MFI quantiﬁcation ﬁeld. We anticipate that the proposed algorithms and software will help in correlating which protein aggregates induce adverse side-effects and will also serve as a useful process monitoring tool. Project Narrative  Protein aggregates, found to some level in all commercial protein therapeutic based drugs, can be asso- ciated with a number of adverse responses in patients. In this project, new machine learning algorithms will be developed for analyzing large collections of biotherapeutics (protein therapeutic based drugs) measured via microﬂow-imaging (MFI) microscopy. Phase I will develop prototype software capable analyzing images of protein aggregrates in biotherapeutics measured via MFI for both process monitoring and identifying which characteris- tics of protein aggregates are correlated to high risk for causing adverse responses in patients.",Quantitative Biotherapeutic Particle Characterization via Deep Neural Networks,9619673,R41GM130513,"['Academia', 'Adopted', 'Adverse effects', 'Adverse reactions', 'Agitation', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Anaphylaxis', 'Architecture', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biological Products', 'Biological Response Modifier Therapy', 'Catalogs', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Formulation', 'Freezing', 'Heat shock proteins', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging technology', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Letters', 'Light', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Metals', 'Methods', 'Microfluidics', 'Microscope', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Mus', 'Optics', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protein Analysis', 'Proteins', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Pump', 'Pythons', 'Regulation', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Shapes', 'Stress', 'Supervision', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic community technique', 'Vendor', 'base', 'commercialization', 'deep neural network', 'density', 'digital', 'digital imaging', 'experimental study', 'high risk', 'image processing', 'imaging software', 'immunogenic', 'improved', 'insight', 'microscopic imaging', 'network architecture', 'novel', 'particle', 'protein aggregate', 'prototype', 'repository', 'response', 'therapeutic protein', 'tool', 'ward']",NIGMS,"URSA ANALYTICS, INC.",R41,2018,222381,0.11976385191389112

"Misfoldome-centered multiOMICS approach to unravel preeclampsia subphenotypes. ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Preeclampsia is a heterogeneous disorder specific to human pregnancy and an important contributor to maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality worldwide. To date, there is no cure for preeclampsia except delivery. Spearheaded by our prior proteomics research, we discovered that preeclampsia shares characteristics of protein misfolding with established conformational disorders including Alzheimer's. These features involve urine congophilia (affinity for the amyloidophilic dye Congo red), affinity for conformational state-dependent antibodies, and dysregulation in the amyloid proteolytic pathway in the placenta and decidua. Our overarching hypothesis is that the excessive formation of misfolded proteins in preeclampsia is driven by increased macromolecular crowding due to defective clearance and/or underlying metabolic disorders leading to faulty protein folding. As a result, the universe of misfolded proteins (misfoldome) could be a rich source of biomarkers more closely related to disease etiology than the properly folded proteome. We propose to use existing biorepositories to understand the underpinnings of different subtypes of preeclampsia. Specifically, we aim to discover specific markers and druggable targets relevant to each preeclampsia subtype that can be corrected before the onset of manifest disease. To achieve these goals we will investigate 4 ""omics"" layers: proteomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics and phenomics uniquely integrated through machine learning bioinformatics approaches aimed to solve complex and interconnected systems biology data. These include: Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) and ""fuzzy"" soft clustering algorithms for integration of multi-omics data layers. Specific Aim 1 plans to apply shotgun bottom-up proteomics methods to catalogue the protein components of the misfoldome as reflected in urine congophilic aggregates of women with various clinical subphenotypes of preeclampsia. The proteins and biophysical characteristics of peptide sequences in the misfoldome will be analyzed and compared with those of total urine and serum proteomes. Specific Aim 2 plans to illuminate biological pathways of high interest by triangulating proteomics with transcriptomics (RNAseq on placental villous and decidual tissues) and metabolomics (serum and urine) data. Lastly, Specific Aim 3 will validate urine congophila and the newly discovered molecular signatures in a large biorepository of women followed longitudinally during their first pregnancy (nuMoM2b cohort). Together, the three aims of this proposal offer a unique opportunity toward personalized therapeutic options for preeclampsia before the onset of clinically manifest disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Preeclampsia is a heterogeneous multi-systemic disorder of human pregnancy with unknown etiology and an important contributor to maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality. We determined preeclampsia shares features of protein misfolding with established protein conformational disorders including as Alzheimer's disease.

"Integrative approach to studying LncRNA functions ABSTRACT  Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play regulatory roles in biological cell process and disease development. It has been emerging as a key regulator of diverse cellular processes. Great efforts have been made towards investigation of lncRNA functions with both experimental determination and theoretical modeling, leading to a rudimentary understanding of this class of RNAs. However, all of these cannot keep pace with the fast growth of diverse genetic data and urgent request of individual lncRNA function annotation, which is inhibited by the tremendous amount of lncRNAs and expensive experimental cost. This propose aim to address this issue by providing efficient and user-friendly tools for key lncRNA discovery and lncRNA function annotation. To do so, we will develop a unique bioinformatics and Systems Biology integrated approach, ISSNLncFA system, which enables the integration of all sorts of omics data and a comprehensive understanding of lncRNA functions.  We propose three specific aims for the ultimate lncRNA function annotation: (1) To develop a novel Co- Modules-based LncRNA Function Annotation (CoMoLncFA) model to detect key lncRNAs and to annotate lncRNA functions at post transcription level as lncRNA-PCG co-modules, lncRNA-pathways association network and lncRNA’s triplets (lncRNA-miRNA/TF-PCG) by considering the expression profiles of lncRNA, protein coding genes and miRNAs and transcript factors, and integrating the curated protein-protein interactions and biological pathways. (2) To develop a novel Structure-based LncRNA-protein Function Annotation (STRULncFA) model to characterize lncRNAs identified from Aim 1 by using their primary sequences and secondary structures for detecting lncRNA-protein functional relations; and to further reveal the regulatory roles and mechanism of these lncRNAs by determining the binding sites in both lncRNA and protein. (3) To experimentally validate the identified abnormal lncRNAs and their cellular products, to validate the identified lncRNA-protein interacting pairs and the predicted binding sites, and to develop software tools and an environment for functional annotation of lncRNAs, use these tools to evaluate the overall proposed approach, and apply them to identify lncRNA functions that may be involved in cell states, species, diseases and cancers and build lncRNA function databases.  We believe that we will build the models, tools and databases, and make them available to the public in a timely fashion. Our achievements will lead to a complete understanding of lncRNA functions and regulatory roles in cell and disease states. Moreover, our models and tools will be feasibly transformed to other function annotation tasks and disease studies with appropriate changes, and thus will move forward the general function annotation community and disease-related drug or therapy development. Project Narrative The ISSNLncFA software package will allow the investigators to characterize the LncRNA functions by integrating RNA-Seq, micorRNA-Seq, and together with protein and RNA structure data with systems biology approaches. As a prototype to test our system, we aim to use this system to study myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs).

"Integrating experiment and theory for predicting protein folding pathways and structure Project Summary/Abstract  Protein folding and dynamics are integral to many biological activities, including chaperone action, degradation, amyloid diseases and aging. Our goal is to combine experimental and computational studies to produce a predictive understanding of protein dynamics through the development of methods capable of simulating folding and dynamics just using physio-chemical principles. Our past studies have focused on single domain proteins. Our efforts have expanded to more complicated systems including the snow flea anti-freeze protein (sfAFP) and TonB-dependent transporters (TBDT) that are relevant to iron sequestration in pathogenic bacteria. Tying these studies together is our new molecular dynamics (MD) package, Upside, which can reversibly fold some proteins up to 97 AA to under 4 Å C-RMSD in cpu-days without the use of fragments, homology or evolution. Upside utilizes a number of unique features, including rapid side chain packing that enables simulations using only 3 backbone atoms while retaining considerable detail and avoiding side chain “rattling”, which slows all-atom methods. We will improve Upside and implement enhanced sampling methods to increase our accuracy and size range, and study protein dynamics as monitored by hydrogen exchange.  sfAFP's unique structure challenges conventional wisdom regarding cooperative folding and stability. Lacking a hydrophobic core to promote folding, other factors must contribute to sfAFP's stability. We will test our quantum calculations that sfAFP's H-bonds are unusually stable by measuring amide H/D fractionation factors and NMR J-couplings. We will evaluate whether intrinsic biases in backbone dihedral angles for the PP2 basin in the unfolded state are another major stabilizing factor. This information will be used to improve the Upside simulations. Finally, we will apply our standard folding tools to characterize the folding pathway and compare it to the behavior we expect based on principles derived from proteins with hydrophobic cores.  Many aspects of the transport cycle in TBDT remain unknown despite protracted study, including the conformational rearrangement of the plug domain during transport. We will provide the first structure of the plug domain outside the barrel, and so answer whether this structure matches the crystal structure in the barrel. Additionally, the study of Nakamoto's V10C-S120C variant of the BtuB plug enables the investigation of a possible folding or transport intermediate. We will characterize the plug's dynamics while it is in the barrel using HX to observe possible transport-competent states. The mechanism of plug folding and insertion into the barrel will be investigated, with comparative studies for FhuA, a TBDT whose plug domain is intrinsically disordered in solution.

"Computational Design of Crystal Lattice Interactions to Determine Recalcitrant Protein Structures PROJECT SUMMARY Proteins are macromolecules that carry out innumerable biological functions ranging from intracellular signaling to immune response. The specific function of a protein is determined by its three-dimensional structure. Therefore, an essential step towards understanding protein function is elucidating protein structure. However, the premier method for structure determination, X-ray crystallography, can be limited by many potential factors including the quality of the protein crystal. The proposed research will investigate the effects of protein– protein interactions in the crystal lattice on crystal quality and resolution and develop a design approach to stabilize lattice interactions, which should result in higher-quality crystals.  First, the molecular determinants of high-quality protein crystal structures will be identified by (1) curating a set of representative structures from the Protein Data Bank, (2) extracting relevant features, such as interaction energy, buried solvent accessible surface area, interfacial packing quality, and residue usage, and (3) analyzing the features’ relationship to crystal resolution (a proxy for quality). Based on these findings, a design strategy and score function for ranking designs within the Rosetta framework will be developed.  Second, the design strategy will be applied to SNase, a model protein that is easy to purify and well- behaved in crystallization and diffraction experiments. The designed proteins will be crystallized and the crystal structures will be solved, testing for improved resolution. Analysis of the resultant crystal structures will drive development of the design strategy.  Third, the design strategy will be applied on a bacterial gyrase, an antibiotic-target protein for which there are several drug-bound structures at low resolution, lacking sufficient detail to reveal key antibiotic– gyrase interactions. Preliminary data suggests that the designed gyrase mutants will yield high-resolution structures, permitting a better understanding of antibiotic–gyrase interactions, with implications for drug design.  Should the method be successful, it will be immediately applicable to ~26,000 structures in the Protein Data Bank, and countless structures that have not been published due to lack of resolution. Re-engineered, high-resolution structures of these proteins could yield structural data on molecular interactions pertinent to disease, drug development, and basic understanding of protein function. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will develop methods to improve low-resolution crystal structures of proteins to high-resolution sufficient (1) to resolve key mechanistic features of enzyme function and disease, and (2) to design or screen drug molecules. In addition to method development, we will pursue crystal structure of M. tuberculosis DNA gyrase in complex with relevant antibiotic drugs.",Computational Design of Crystal Lattice Interactions to Determine Recalcitrant Protein Structures,9644449,F31GM123616,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithm Design', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Antibiotics', 'Area', 'Basic Science', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Complex', 'Crystallization', 'Crystallography', 'DNA', 'DNA Gyrase', 'Data', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Drug Design', 'Drug Screening', 'Engineering', 'Enzymes', 'Free Energy', 'Glean', 'Goals', 'Immune response', 'Ligand Binding', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Protein Engineering', 'Proteins', 'Proxy', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Solvents', 'Staphylococcus aureus', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Testing', 'X-Ray Crystallography', 'base', 'data warehouse', 'design', 'drug development', 'experimental study', 'functional gain', 'improved', 'insight', 'interfacial', 'macromolecule', 'method development', 'mutant', 'novel', 'nuclease', 'protein function', 'protein protein interaction', 'protein structure', 'research and development', 'structural biology', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool']",NIGMS,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,F31,2018,37308,0.05782591062437742
"UniProt: A centralized protein sequence and function resource Project summary The mission of the Universal Protein Resource (UniProt) is to support biomedical research by providing a freely available, stable, comprehensive, richly and accurately annotated protein sequence knowledgebase (www.uniprot.org). UniProt integrates, interprets and standardizes data from a multitude of sources to achieve the most comprehensive catalog of protein sequences and functional annotation available to date, providing information from hundreds of thousands of publications for tens of millions of proteins from tens of thousands of species. The activities proposed here will increase the utility of UniProt for biomedical research and precision medicine. The expert curated functional information provided by UniProt is widely acknowledged to be of exceptional quality and is continuously updated as new knowledge becomes available. Our first aim will be to continue to curate the scientific literature to ensure UniProt remains up to date. We will also work with the text-mining community to continue to improve curation efficiency. The curated records (0.5 million) are complemented by the (80 million) records for uncharacterized proteins. To ensure their usefulness for the community we will continue to develop our automatic annotation systems to annotate these proteins based on the knowledge of characterized proteins. Our third aim is to connect to and integrate protein data from resources around the world to make UniProt the worldwide global hub of protein information. The integration of clinical variation data as well as metabolomics information with proteins will help to support the multi-omics approaches of precision medicine. Our fourth aim describes the production of the resource to ensure that our data is freely available according to the FAIR principles. UniProt forms a foundation for hundreds of life sciences data resources. Continuous software development is needed to ensure delivery of this key component of the life science infrastructure. The UniProt website is used by hundreds of thousands of scientists every month. The final aim describes how we will enable this community to make best use of UniProt, through user training, outreach and improved user interfaces, driven by user testing. Project narrative UniProt is the world’s leading resource of protein sequence and functional information, covering all species including Homo sapiens, model organisms and pathogens.

"Protective biomarkers for the development of novel serotype-independent protein-based vaccine candidates against pneumococcus Streptococcus pneumoniae (the pneumococcus) is the most common cause of severe pneumonia, and, despite the existence of licensed vaccines, annually kills half of a million children under five years old worldwide. Pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs) have the intrinsic disadvantage of a limited number of serotypes against which they provide protection, resulting in disease due to serotype replacement that reduces their impact. A protein-based vaccine could be used alone or in combination with PCVs to provide protection against all pneumococcal types in low and middle income, as well as developed countries. Antigen Discovery, Inc (ADI) of Irvine, California has developed a S. pneumoniae pan-proteome microarray, with coverage of both the core and accessory geneome, which can be used to screen antibody responses against the entire pneumococcal proteome. A proteome-scale platform for antibody immune-profiling has never before been available to the pneumococcus research community, and this technology has the power to rapidly advance our understanding of the protective immune response directed to pneumococcal proteins. The Respiratory Infections Group (RIG) at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine (LSTM) in the U.K. has developed a unique human model, which allows for the discovery of targets of naturally acquired and vaccine induced immunity against nasal colonization with pneumococci. In the Experimental Human Pneumococcal Carriage (EHPC) model, healthy volunteers are inoculated with a pneumococcal challenge strain, and acquisition of the challenge strain (carriage-positive) or protection from it (carriage-negative), as well as immune responses before and after challenge, are determined in mucosal secretions and peripheral blood. We will use pan-proteome microarrays to measure the anti-protein IgG and IgA levels to specific proteins before bacteria inoculation and associate these responses with protection from carriage using samples from the volunteers of EHPC trials. This tool will allow us to identify novel relevant protein targets that can be exploited as a part of a multi-component or monovalent vaccine. We expect to identify >200 immunoreactive protein targets, at least 10-20 of which are significantly associated with protection. We will attempt to prioritize 10 of the most promising candidate antigens to take forward for vaccine development. Streptococcus pneumoniae (the pneumococcus) is the most common cause of severe pneumonia, and, despite the existence of licensed vaccines against limited number of serotypes, annually kills half of a million children under five years old worldwide. A new protein microarray developed by Antigen Discovery, Inc. with coverage of the entire pneumoccocal proteome is a technology that provides an opportunity to discover antibodies to target proteins that provide protection against pneumoccoal colonization and invasive disease. We will screen antibodies in participants of an Experimental Human Pneumoccocal Carriage trial to identify target proteins of antibodies associated with protection from carriage and take these candidate antigens forward for the development of more effective vaccines against all pneumococcal types.",Protective biomarkers for the development of novel serotype-independent protein-based vaccine candidates against pneumococcus,9559177,R43AI138827,"['5 year old', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Response', 'Antigens', 'Bacteremia', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Adhesins', 'Binding', 'Biological Markers', 'California', 'Cell Wall', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Developed Countries', 'Developing Countries', 'Development', 'Disadvantaged', 'Disease', 'Enzymes', 'Exposure to', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunoglobulin A', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'Income', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Measures', 'Meningitis', 'Modeling', 'Mucous Membrane', 'Nose', 'Otitis Media', 'Participant', 'Phase', 'Pneumococcal Colonization', 'Pneumococcal Infections', 'Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine', 'Pneumococcal vaccine', 'Pneumonia', 'Protein Microchips', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiratory Tract Infections', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Serotyping', 'Serum', 'Sinusitis', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Streptococcus pneumoniae', 'Structure of mucous membrane of nose', 'Technology', 'Tropical Medicine', 'Upper respiratory tract', 'Vaccine Design', 'Vaccines', 'Viral Vector', 'Work', 'base', 'biomarker development', 'clinical development', 'cohort', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'density', 'healthy volunteer', 'human model', 'immunoreactivity', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'peripheral blood', 'prevent', 'respiratory', 'response', 'solute', 'tool', 'vaccine candidate', 'vaccine development', 'vaccine evaluation', 'vaccine-induced immunity', 'volunteer']",NIAID,"IMMPORT THERAPEUTICS, INC.",R43,2018,224852,0.07312707197516441
"MELD: accelerating MD modeling of proteins using Bayesian inference PROJECT SUMMARY This proposal is to develop MELD, a computational Bayesian accelerator that “melds” together molecular dynamics simulations with external knowledge. It is novel in harnessing information that has not been usable before – because it is too sparse, noisy, ambiguous, combinatoric, or too corrupted for traditional approaches. In contrast to the high-certainty restraints traditionally used in MD simulations, MELD leverages a much broader range of real-world high-uncertainty restraints. The first specific aim is to incorporate such information in protein structure determination, in several collaboration projects with experimentalists who perform solution x-ray scattering, ESR, and high-throughput alanine scanning structures of peptide protein complexes. The second aim is to also harness information about processes, trajectories, and dynamic routes to speed the identification of protein states. MELD promises to extend physics-based simulations for determining larger protein structures, for folding larger proteins, for binding more flexible ligands, and for exploring larger mechanistic actions, than current MD simulation methods can handle. PROJECT NARRATIVE Biomedical research and pharmaceutics depend on detailed understanding of the structures and motions of proteins. Molecular dynamics simulations provide the most detailed descriptions possible, however they cannot yet describe average to large sized protein structures or motions within a reasonable time frame.

"PRO: A Protein Ontology in OBO Foundry for Scalable Integration of Biomedical Knowledge ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): PROJECT SUMMARY Biomedical ontologies are critical to the accurate representation and integration of genome-scale data in biomedical and clinical research. The Protein Ontology (PRO)-the reference ontology for protein entities in the OBO (Open Biological and Biomedical Ontologies) Foundry-represents protein families, multiple protein forms (proteoforms) arising from single genes, and protein complexes. This competitive renewal grant application will further establish PRO as a scalable, flexible, collaborative research infrastructure for protein-centric semantic integration of biomedical data of increasing volume and complexity. Specific aims are to: (i) enable scalable and dynamic representation of protein types; (ii) provide comprehensive coverage of human proteoforms in their biological context; (iii) develop collaborative use cases and support an expanding community of users to advance protein-disease understanding; and (iv) broaden dissemination to support semantic computing, dynamic term mapping, and interoperability and reusability. We will increase PRO coverage by semi-automated import of proteoforms and complexes from curated databases and via established text mining approaches. Expert curation will focus on human variant forms, post-translational modification (PTM) forms and complexes critical to disease processes, along with homologous mouse forms. We will develop a new PRO sub-ontology of protein sites-amino acid positions of significance-to enable automatic and dynamic definition of combinatoric proteoforms. We will establish PRO OWL and RDF versions and provide a SPARQL query endpoint to support semantic computing. We will organize annual workshops and annotation jamborees to develop use cases and promote PRO co-development with community collaborators to address specific disciplinary needs. PRO has several unique features. For knowledge representation, PRO defines precise protein entities to support accurate annotation at the appropriate level of granularity and provides the ontological framework to connect PTM and variant proteoforms and complexes necessary to model human health and disease. For semantic data integration, PRO provides the ontological structure to connect-via specified relations-the vast amounts of proteomics data and biomedical knowledge to support hypothesis generation and testing. PRO therefore addresses the gaps in the bioinformatics infrastructure for protein representations in a way that makes knowledge about proteins more accessible to computational reasoning, fully complementing existing knowledge sources. The proposed research will allow the PRO Consortium to deepen and broaden PRO for scalable semantic integration of biomedical data, facilitating protein-disease knowledge discovery and clinical applications by an expanding community of biomedical, clinical and computational users. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: PROJECT NARRATIVE The Protein Ontology (PRO) will allow researchers to capture and accurately represent scientific knowledge of proteins thus providing a research infrastructure for modeling biological systems and for protein-centric integration of existing and emerging experimental and clinical data. As a component of the global informatics resource network, the PRO resource will be instrumental in computational analysis and knowledge discovery of genome-scale data and will aid in improving our understanding of human disease, and in the identification of potential diagnostic and therapeutic targets.",PRO: A Protein Ontology in OBO Foundry for Scalable Integration of Biomedical Knowledge,9546737,R01GM080646,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Amino Acids', 'Applications Grants', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biomedical Research', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Combinatorics', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Educational workshop', 'FAIR principles', 'Fostering', 'Gene Proteins', 'Generations', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Health', 'Histones', 'Human', 'Imagery', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Literature', 'Mus', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Ontology', 'Organism', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Post-Translational Modification Site', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Process', 'Protein Family', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Informatics', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Semantics', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Services', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Variant', 'base', 'biological systems', 'biomedical ontology', 'clinical application', 'computational reasoning', 'data integration', 'disease classification', 'flexibility', 'genome-wide', 'human disease', 'human model', 'improved', 'information organization', 'interoperability', 'knowledge base', 'protein complex', 'public health relevance', 'symposium', 'text searching', 'therapeutic target', 'usability', 'web portal', 'web services']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF DELAWARE,R01,2018,688354,0.13610663293940015
"Integrative computational framework for pattern mining in big -omics data: linking synonymous codon usage to protein biogenesis PROJECT SUMMARY Efficient production of functional proteins is arguably the most important function of a cell. Ribosomes synthesize proteins by decoding mRNA codons, and N-terminal portions of proteins can begin to fold even while synthesis is still underway. The genetic code is degenerate, meaning that most amino acids can be encoded by more than one codon. Because synonymous codon substitutions do not alter the amino acid sequence of the encoded protein, they have historically been regarded as “silent”. However, it is now known that some synonymous substitutions can disrupt the expression, folding, targeting and/or function of the encoded protein, although the precise mechanisms are poorly understood. Computational analyses have attempted to identify connections between the locations of synonymous codons and features of the encoded protein, but to date have yielded conflicting results, and there have been few attempts to experimentally test predictions made from these computational studies. Hence we currently lack a systematic understanding of the connections between synonymous codon usage and protein biogenesis. Establishing these connections would broadly transform our interpretation of synonymous codon substitutions, including single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with human disease and synonymous substitutions in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Establishing these connections would also enable the addition of coding sequence design as an integral aspect of the rational design of novel gene products (proteins). Thus, we aim to design an innovative integrative computational and experimental strategy with which to identify connections between codon usage patterns and protein biogenesis. We will search broadly for such connections, developing and applying several novel new approaches: (i) computational approaches to track, quantify and align synonymous codon usage patterns in homologous proteins, (ii) network approaches to map codon usage onto all levels of protein structure, and (iii) an innovative combination of broad and targeted experimental approaches to test the importance and specific effects of altering codon usage on protein biogenesis. Throughout the project, rigorous statistical methods will be applied to test the validity of identified connections, and cell-based experiments will be used to both test and refine hypotheses resulting from the computational analyses and develop new hypotheses that will feed back into the computational analyses. The goal of this project is to transform our understanding of the connections between synonymous codon usage and protein biogenesis. The endpoint for this project period is the development of a set of general principles for codon usage, including user-friendly open-source software to enable the biomedical community to analyze genes of interest for synonymous codon usage features likely to affect protein biogenesis. At the same time, our methodology will be generalizable, to allow the public to search for additional connections between sequence and/or network patterns and protein function, as well as for similar connections in other domains.

"Towards a comprehensive multiscale 3D human interactome network PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Almost all proteins function through interacting with other proteins. On average, a protein interacts with ~5 other protein partners in the current human interactome. Therefore, it is of great importance to accurately determine the interface of each interaction, in order to understand how each protein works with different partners to carry out different functions. In our previous Nature Biotechnology study, we implemented a proteome-scale homology modeling approach to generate the first 3D human structural interactome: the interface for each interaction in this network was determined at atomic resolution through co-crystal structures and homology models. Using our 3D interactome, we found that, among >1,800 known disease genes associated with two or more clinically distinctly disorders, pairs of mutations on the same gene but in different interfaces with different partners are significantly more likely to cause distinct diseases. However, only 4,150 human protein interactions have co-crystal structures and 2,921 have high-quality homology models. ~50,000 interactions (87% of the current human interactome) are not amenable to current structural modeling methods. Here, we propose to develop a big-data-driven machine-learning approach integrating biophysiochemical, evolutionary, structural, and population genetic features to identify interaction- specific interfaces for the whole human interactome. Because several key features are unavailable for many proteins and interactions, we propose an innovative approach to use an ensemble of random forest classifiers, named Ensemble Protein Interface Classifier (EPIC), to address this large-scale non-random missing data problem (Aim 1). The high throughput of our massively parallel Clone-seq and INtegrated PrOtein INteractome perTurbation screening (InPOINT) pipeline! uniquely enables us to perform real-time experimental parameter optimization (in Years 2-4 we will clone ~1,500 mutations and examine their impact on ~2,500 interactions every year to iteratively evaluate and refine EPIC; Aim 2). Finally, we will construct a comprehensive multiscale 3D interactome for all known human protein-protein interactions: we will collect/generate atomic- resolution structural models for interactions whenever possible (co-crystal structures and homology models); we will accurately determine interaction-specific interface residues and domains for the whole human interactome. We will deploy an interactive web portal to disseminate our results and allow functional genomic inference in the context of our structural interactome (Aim 3). Our comprehensive multiscale 3D human interactome and the accompanying web portal will greatly reduce the barrier-to-entry for performing systematic structural analysis on a large number of proteins and their interactions, and open the flood gates for such analyses in genomic studies. NARRATIVE Almost all proteins function through interacting with other proteins and the structural details of these interaction interfaces are key in understanding protein function. However, the interfaces for vast majority of human protein interactions are currently unknown. Here, we propose to establish an innovative ensemble classifier approach and implement an unprecedented large-scale computational-experimental iterative learning scheme to predict interfaces for the whole human interactome, in anticipation that our predicted interfaces will help dissect functional sites of disease mutations and be useful for rational drug design to target these sites.",Towards a comprehensive multiscale 3D human interactome network,9375803,R01GM124559,"['Address', 'Big Data', 'Binding', 'Biotechnology', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Crystallization', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Drug Design', 'Evolution', 'Floods', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Homology Modeling', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Missense Mutation', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Names', 'Nature', 'Population Genetics', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Scheme', 'Site', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'Study models', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Work', 'biological research', 'forest', 'functional genomics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'protein function', 'protein protein interaction', 'screening', 'user-friendly', 'web portal', 'web-accessible']",NIGMS,CORNELL UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,379776,0.07834322588325304
"Structure based Prediction of the interactome The interactions of small molecules with proteins is not only omnipresent throughout cellular processes, but also of fundamental importance to drug design and disease treatment. Much like with protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions, high-throughput (HTP) experimental methods have led to the generation of enormous volumes of protein-small molecule and related data. However, in addition to sheer scale, high degrees of heterogeneity in these data, combined with proprietary ownership concerns when originating from within industry, present significant challenges to the sharing and full use of this data in basic research and therapeutic development. This proposal aims to develop new mathematical methods that can address not only interpreting the data itself, but also the collaborative and generative process through which researchers work: new cryptographic tools can enable unprecedented forms of secure sharing and collaboration between industry and the public, and deep learning of structural features can reduce the dependence of researchers on prior assumptions as to important predictors of drug-target interactions (DTI).  In our previous granting period, we successfully developed methods for structure-based prediction and HTP data analysis of protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions, uncovering novel biology (e.g., for neurodegenerative diseases). In this renewal, we aim to: 1) develop scalable methods for multi-party computation and differential privacy to enable the secure sharing of large proprietary drug-target interaction databases among industry and public researchers; 2) develop novel integrative machine learning approaches for identifying drug-target interactions based on interactome, molecular structure and chemogenomic data (in collaboration with co-I Jian Peng); and 3) establish innovative collaborations with industry, academia and the scientific community to drive use and adoption of these computational tools and technologies among practicing biomedical researchers.  Successful completion of these aims will provide both public and private research communities with scalable access to technologies for secure sharing of proprietary drug screening data as well as flexible, accurate tools for predicting drug-target interactions. All developed software will be made available via publicly accessible web-based portals under open source software licenses. Collaborations with research partners will validate the relevance of these tools to human health and disease, while the dissemination aim will ensure research communities convenient and ongoing access to these innovations. Narrative The interactions of small molecules with proteins are omnipresent throughout cellular processes and of fundamental importance to drug design and disease treatment, yet the task of predicting these interactions brings major challenges because of the heterogeneity and proprietary nature of the data. In this proposal, we develop new mathematical methods and software that can address not only interpreting the data itself, but also the collaborative and generative process through which researchers work: new cryptographic tools can enable unprecedented forms of secure sharing and collaboration between industry and the public, and deep learning can accelerate the drug discovery process.",Structure based Prediction of the interactome,9384431,R01GM081871,"['Academia', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Affinity', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Basic Science', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Biotechnology', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Dependence', 'Disease', 'Disease Pathway', 'Drug Design', 'Drug Targeting', 'Ensure', 'Essential Genes', 'Fright', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Licensing', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Structure', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Network-based', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Online Systems', 'Ownership', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Preclinical Drug Evaluation', 'Privacy', 'Privatization', 'Process', 'Progress Reports', 'Protein Analysis', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Protocols documentation', 'PubChem', 'RNA analysis', 'RNA-Protein Interaction', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Secure', 'Software Tools', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Trust', 'Work', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'cryptography', 'data integration', 'data sharing', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'drug efficacy', 'experimental analysis', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'gene interaction', 'high dimensionality', 'high throughput analysis', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mathematical methods', 'medical schools', 'novel', 'open source', 'predictive tools', 'relating to nervous system', 'repository', 'research and development', 'small molecule', 'software development', 'therapeutic development', 'tool', 'web-accessible']",NIGMS,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2017,422166,0.06335284309742524
"Unraveling molecular and system-level mechanisms of human disease-associated protein mutations Project Summary Although a quickly expanding catalogue of protein mutations have been discovered, including those that cause human diseases or confer drug resistance, mechanistic understanding and prediction of functional consequences of these mutations remain rather limited. There is a critical need to develop novel, multiscale computational frameworks that are rigorous and generalizable to help close the ever-increasing gap between phenotypic data and mechanistic knowledge about the mutations and to develop effective therapeutic strategies.  My long-term research goals are two folds: (1) to unravel how a change in protein sequence ripples through various aspects of molecular and system-levels to a change in cellular function and cause human diseases or confer drug resistance; and (2) to translate learned mechanistic knowledge to effective drug-design strategies for human diseases and drug resistance. Toward these goals I propose to advance and combine the strengths of computational molecular biology (structural modeling and design for proteins or protein interactions) and computational systems biology (pathway/network-level topology and dynamics) and follow a novel, formal paradigm to develop methods that systematically identify mechanisms underlying various stages of consequence propagation (from conformation, molecular and system-level variables, to cellular functions, where intermediates can be skipped if necessary). In the forward direction of propagating consequences, I will determine, explain and understand mutational consequences at various levels with machine learning, causal analysis, and combinatorial optimization, starting with known or modelled changes at various levels. In the inverse direction of designing consequences, I will follow known or learned mechanistic hypotheses and develop efficient combinatorial optimization methods to design mutagenesis experiments or screen / design ligands for desired perturbations at various levels, which would test and refine corresponding hypotheses directly and translate mechanistic hypotheses to therapeutic strategies. Mechanisms underlying distal (potentially allosteric) mutations, multiple mutations within a protein or across proteins as well as systems pharmacology strategies will also be rigorously determined in the process.  The expected outcomes from the innovative project will include two main components. The first will be both biophysical principles of proteins and integrative understanding of biomedical systems, which will be organized in a database for public access. The second will be translating mechanistic insights into therapeutic intervention strategies to treat diseases. In particular, targeted experiments (mutagenesis or ligand-binding) will be designed following known or discovered mechanistic hypotheses. This project will involve close collaboration with structural biologists and clinician-scientists who are active collaborators of the PI. Project Narrative Genetic mutations, many of which lead to protein mutations, are often associated with human diseases: they often directly cause diseases or contribute to their progressions. Understanding mechanisms by which these mutations lead to significant functional consequences is of extreme importance to developing effective therapeutics to cure diseases and ameliorate drug resistance.",Unraveling molecular and system-level mechanisms of human disease-associated protein mutations,9382414,R35GM124952,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Biophysics', 'Catalogs', 'Cell physiology', 'Collaborations', 'Combinatorial Optimization', 'Computational Molecular Biology', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Disease Resistance', 'Distal', 'Drug Design', 'Drug resistance', 'Goals', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Ligand Binding', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutation', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmacology', 'Process', 'Protein Engineering', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Scientist', 'Structural Biologist', 'Structural Models', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Translating', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'computer framework', 'design', 'experimental study', 'human disease', 'innovation', 'insight', 'novel', 'phenotypic data']",NIGMS,TEXAS ENGINEERING EXPERIMENT STATION,R35,2017,335245,0.05220218978458675
"Data-driven analysis of protein structure, function, and regulation PROJECT SUMMARY Proteins are capable of performing a wide variety of complex molecular functions and play a central role in all biological processes.

"Misfoldome-centered multiOMICS approach to unravel preeclampsia subphenotypes. ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Preeclampsia is a heterogeneous disorder specific to human pregnancy and an important contributor to maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality worldwide. To date, there is no cure for preeclampsia except delivery. Spearheaded by our prior proteomics research, we discovered that preeclampsia shares characteristics of protein misfolding with established conformational disorders including Alzheimer's. These features involve urine congophilia (affinity for the amyloidophilic dye Congo red), affinity for conformational state-dependent antibodies, and dysregulation in the amyloid proteolytic pathway in the placenta and decidua. Our overarching hypothesis is that the excessive formation of misfolded proteins in preeclampsia is driven by increased macromolecular crowding due to defective clearance and/or underlying metabolic disorders leading to faulty protein folding. As a result, the universe of misfolded proteins (misfoldome) could be a rich source of biomarkers more closely related to disease etiology than the properly folded proteome. We propose to use existing biorepositories to understand the underpinnings of different subtypes of preeclampsia. Specifically, we aim to discover specific markers and druggable targets relevant to each preeclampsia subtype that can be corrected before the onset of manifest disease. To achieve these goals we will investigate 4 ""omics"" layers: proteomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics and phenomics uniquely integrated through machine learning bioinformatics approaches aimed to solve complex and interconnected systems biology data. These include: Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) and ""fuzzy"" soft clustering algorithms for integration of multi-omics data layers. Specific Aim 1 plans to apply shotgun bottom-up proteomics methods to catalogue the protein components of the misfoldome as reflected in urine congophilic aggregates of women with various clinical subphenotypes of preeclampsia. The proteins and biophysical characteristics of peptide sequences in the misfoldome will be analyzed and compared with those of total urine and serum proteomes. Specific Aim 2 plans to illuminate biological pathways of high interest by triangulating proteomics with transcriptomics (RNAseq on placental villous and decidual tissues) and metabolomics (serum and urine) data. Lastly, Specific Aim 3 will validate urine congophila and the newly discovered molecular signatures in a large biorepository of women followed longitudinally during their first pregnancy (nuMoM2b cohort). Together, the three aims of this proposal offer a unique opportunity toward personalized therapeutic options for preeclampsia before the onset of clinically manifest disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Preeclampsia is a heterogeneous multi-systemic disorder of human pregnancy with unknown etiology and an important contributor to maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality. We determined preeclampsia shares features of protein misfolding with established protein conformational disorders including as Alzheimer's disease.

"Integrating experiment and theory for predicting protein folding pathways and structure Project Summary/Abstract  Protein folding and dynamics are integral to many biological activities, including chaperone action, degradation, amyloid diseases and aging. Our goal is to combine experimental and computational studies to produce a predictive understanding of protein dynamics through the development of methods capable of simulating folding and dynamics just using physio-chemical principles. Our past studies have focused on single domain proteins. Our efforts have expanded to more complicated systems including the snow flea anti-freeze protein (sfAFP) and TonB-dependent transporters (TBDT) that are relevant to iron sequestration in pathogenic bacteria. Tying these studies together is our new molecular dynamics (MD) package, Upside, which can reversibly fold some proteins up to 97 AA to under 4 Å C-RMSD in cpu-days without the use of fragments, homology or evolution. Upside utilizes a number of unique features, including rapid side chain packing that enables simulations using only 3 backbone atoms while retaining considerable detail and avoiding side chain “rattling”, which slows all-atom methods. We will improve Upside and implement enhanced sampling methods to increase our accuracy and size range, and study protein dynamics as monitored by hydrogen exchange.  sfAFP's unique structure challenges conventional wisdom regarding cooperative folding and stability. Lacking a hydrophobic core to promote folding, other factors must contribute to sfAFP's stability. We will test our quantum calculations that sfAFP's H-bonds are unusually stable by measuring amide H/D fractionation factors and NMR J-couplings. We will evaluate whether intrinsic biases in backbone dihedral angles for the PP2 basin in the unfolded state are another major stabilizing factor. This information will be used to improve the Upside simulations. Finally, we will apply our standard folding tools to characterize the folding pathway and compare it to the behavior we expect based on principles derived from proteins with hydrophobic cores.  Many aspects of the transport cycle in TBDT remain unknown despite protracted study, including the conformational rearrangement of the plug domain during transport. We will provide the first structure of the plug domain outside the barrel, and so answer whether this structure matches the crystal structure in the barrel. Additionally, the study of Nakamoto's V10C-S120C variant of the BtuB plug enables the investigation of a possible folding or transport intermediate. We will characterize the plug's dynamics while it is in the barrel using HX to observe possible transport-competent states. The mechanism of plug folding and insertion into the barrel will be investigated, with comparative studies for FhuA, a TBDT whose plug domain is intrinsically disordered in solution. These studies represent an exciting combination of protein folding and function, at the interface between soluble and membrane folding, using experiments and complementary folding simulations. Project Narrative We are combining experimental and computational approaches to produce a predictive understanding of protein folding and dynamics. Our focus has expanded to more complicated systems, including an anti-freeze protein and the plug domain of the TonB-dependent transporters involved in pathogenic bacterial iron sequestration.

"Structural characterization of protein complexes involved in embryogenesis. DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Birth defects, such as those effecting cardiovascular (e.g. Coarctation of the Aorta), nervous system (e.g. Spina bifida) and craniofacial development (e.g. Cleft Palate) are responsible for roughly 20% of infant deaths in the United States and place an exceeding burden on the health care system amounting to billions of dollars each year. Such defects are often the result of disruptions in embryogenesis, which depends on tight regulation of key pathways including Wnt, Hedgehog, Notch, PAR, and Bone morphogenetic peptide/TGF beta. Many of the protein complexes involved in these pathways however lack detailed molecular characterization, and more still remain to be discovered. Large-scale proteomics efforts focused on embryonic tissues are beginning to systematically identify proteins in vast numbers. Using these data, I propose to develop new methods to structurally and functionally characterize protein complexes associated with embryogenesis. Specifically, I will develop novel computational tools (i) to datamine for proximal interactions (i.e. protein subcomplexes) as well as (ii) to calculate protein stoichiometry. I will then integrate this information to build structural models capable of both characterizing individual complex functions as well as identifying their role in developmental failure. These results will provide a greatly needed mechanistic understanding of the protein complexes associated with embryogenesis and potentially uncover therapeutic targets to treat developmental failures. Moreover, the methods developed here will provide the capability to analyze virtually any biological system and thus should have broad implications for the study of many diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Failures during embryogenesis result in debilitating birth defects, which are responsible for roughly 20% of the US infant mortality rate and billions of dollars in health care costs. I propose to investigate protein complexes that regulate embryogenesis using recent advances in proteomics as well as novel computational techniques of my own.

"Integrative approach to studying LncRNA functions ABSTRACT  Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play regulatory roles in biological cell process and disease development. It has been emerging as a key regulator of diverse cellular processes. Great efforts have been made towards investigation of lncRNA functions with both experimental determination and theoretical modeling, leading to a rudimentary understanding of this class of RNAs. However, all of these cannot keep pace with the fast growth of diverse genetic data and urgent request of individual lncRNA function annotation, which is inhibited by the tremendous amount of lncRNAs and expensive experimental cost. This propose aim to address this issue by providing efficient and user-friendly tools for key lncRNA discovery and lncRNA function annotation. To do so, we will develop a unique bioinformatics and Systems Biology integrated approach, ISSNLncFA system, which enables the integration of all sorts of omics data and a comprehensive understanding of lncRNA functions.  We propose three specific aims for the ultimate lncRNA function annotation: (1) To develop a novel Co- Modules-based LncRNA Function Annotation (CoMoLncFA) model to detect key lncRNAs and to annotate lncRNA functions at post transcription level as lncRNA-PCG co-modules, lncRNA-pathways association network and lncRNA’s triplets (lncRNA-miRNA/TF-PCG) by considering the expression profiles of lncRNA, protein coding genes and miRNAs and transcript factors, and integrating the curated protein-protein interactions and biological pathways. (2) To develop a novel Structure-based LncRNA-protein Function Annotation (STRULncFA) model to characterize lncRNAs identified from Aim 1 by using their primary sequences and secondary structures for detecting lncRNA-protein functional relations; and to further reveal the regulatory roles and mechanism of these lncRNAs by determining the binding sites in both lncRNA and protein. (3) To experimentally validate the identified abnormal lncRNAs and their cellular products, to validate the identified lncRNA-protein interacting pairs and the predicted binding sites, and to develop software tools and an environment for functional annotation of lncRNAs, use these tools to evaluate the overall proposed approach, and apply them to identify lncRNA functions that may be involved in cell states, species, diseases and cancers and build lncRNA function databases.  We believe that we will build the models, tools and databases, and make them available to the public in a timely fashion. Our achievements will lead to a complete understanding of lncRNA functions and regulatory roles in cell and disease states. Moreover, our models and tools will be feasibly transformed to other function annotation tasks and disease studies with appropriate changes, and thus will move forward the general function annotation community and disease-related drug or therapy development. Project Narrative The ISSNLncFA software package will allow the investigators to characterize the LncRNA functions by integrating RNA-Seq, micorRNA-Seq, and together with protein and RNA structure data with systems biology approaches. As a prototype to test our system, we aim to use this system to study myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs).

"PRO: A Protein Ontology in OBO Foundry for Scalable Integration of Biomedical Knowledge ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): PROJECT SUMMARY Biomedical ontologies are critical to the accurate representation and integration of genome-scale data in biomedical and clinical research. The Protein Ontology (PRO)-the reference ontology for protein entities in the OBO (Open Biological and Biomedical Ontologies) Foundry-represents protein families, multiple protein forms (proteoforms) arising from single genes, and protein complexes. This competitive renewal grant application will further establish PRO as a scalable, flexible, collaborative research infrastructure for protein-centric semantic integration of biomedical data of increasing volume and complexity. Specific aims are to: (i) enable scalable and dynamic representation of protein types; (ii) provide comprehensive coverage of human proteoforms in their biological context; (iii) develop collaborative use cases and support an expanding community of users to advance protein-disease understanding; and (iv) broaden dissemination to support semantic computing, dynamic term mapping, and interoperability and reusability. We will increase PRO coverage by semi-automated import of proteoforms and complexes from curated databases and via established text mining approaches. Expert curation will focus on human variant forms, post-translational modification (PTM) forms and complexes critical to disease processes, along with homologous mouse forms. We will develop a new PRO sub-ontology of protein sites-amino acid positions of significance-to enable automatic and dynamic definition of combinatoric proteoforms. We will establish PRO OWL and RDF versions and provide a SPARQL query endpoint to support semantic computing. We will organize annual workshops and annotation jamborees to develop use cases and promote PRO co-development with community collaborators to address specific disciplinary needs. PRO has several unique features. For knowledge representation, PRO defines precise protein entities to support accurate annotation at the appropriate level of granularity and provides the ontological framework to connect PTM and variant proteoforms and complexes necessary to model human health and disease. For semantic data integration, PRO provides the ontological structure to connect-via specified relations-the vast amounts of proteomics data and biomedical knowledge to support hypothesis generation and testing. PRO therefore addresses the gaps in the bioinformatics infrastructure for protein representations in a way that makes knowledge about proteins more accessible to computational reasoning, fully complementing existing knowledge sources.

"Integrative computational framework for pattern mining in big -omics data: linking synonymous codon usage to protein biogenesis PROJECT SUMMARY Efficient production of functional proteins is arguably the most important function of a cell. Ribosomes synthesize proteins by decoding mRNA codons, and N-terminal portions of proteins can begin to fold even while synthesis is still underway. The genetic code is degenerate, meaning that most amino acids can be encoded by more than one codon. Because synonymous codon substitutions do not alter the amino acid sequence of the encoded protein, they have historically been regarded as “silent”. However, it is now known that some synonymous substitutions can disrupt the expression, folding, targeting and/or function of the encoded protein, although the precise mechanisms are poorly understood. Computational analyses have attempted to identify connections between the locations of synonymous codons and features of the encoded protein, but to date have yielded conflicting results, and there have been few attempts to experimentally test predictions made from these computational studies. Hence we currently lack a systematic understanding of the connections between synonymous codon usage and protein biogenesis. Establishing these connections would broadly transform our interpretation of synonymous codon substitutions, including single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with human disease and synonymous substitutions in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Establishing these connections would also enable the addition of coding sequence design as an integral aspect of the rational design of novel gene products (proteins). Thus, we aim to design an innovative integrative computational and experimental strategy with which to identify connections between codon usage patterns and protein biogenesis. We will search broadly for such connections, developing and applying several novel new approaches: (i) computational approaches to track, quantify and align synonymous codon usage patterns in homologous proteins, (ii) network approaches to map codon usage onto all levels of protein structure, and (iii) an innovative combination of broad and targeted experimental approaches to test the importance and specific effects of altering codon usage on protein biogenesis. Throughout the project, rigorous statistical methods will be applied to test the validity of identified connections, and cell-based experiments will be used to both test and refine hypotheses resulting from the computational analyses and develop new hypotheses that will feed back into the computational analyses. The goal of this project is to transform our understanding of the connections between synonymous codon usage and protein biogenesis. The endpoint for this project period is the development of a set of general principles for codon usage, including user-friendly open-source software to enable the biomedical community to analyze genes of interest for synonymous codon usage features likely to affect protein biogenesis. At the same time, our methodology will be generalizable, to allow the public to search for additional connections between sequence and/or network patterns and protein function, as well as for similar connections in other domains. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE The same protein sequence can be encoded by more than one nucleic acid sequence. Historically, “synonymous” changes in a nucleic acid sequence were thought to be “silent”, but it is now emerging that some synonymous changes can change the folding of the encoded protein, and/or its transport into a membrane. We will integrate novel computational analyses and laboratory experiments to uncover the connections between synonymous substitutions and protein production in the cell.",Integrative computational framework for pattern mining in big -omics data: linking synonymous codon usage to protein biogenesis,9315195,R01GM120733,"['3-Dimensional', 'Affect', 'Alpha Cell', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Amino Acids', 'Back', 'Base Sequence', 'Biogenesis', 'Biological', 'Carrier Proteins', 'Case Study', 'Cells', 'Code', 'Codon Nucleotides', 'Communities', 'Companions', 'Complement', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Evolution', 'Feedback', 'Genes', 'Genetic Code', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Homologous Protein', 'Informatics', 'Length', 'Link', 'Location', 'Maps', 'Membrane', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'N-terminal', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Network-based', 'Noise', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pattern', 'Process', 'Production', 'Property', 'Protein Engineering', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Ribosomes', 'Role', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Side', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Social Network', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'analytical method', 'base', 'computer framework', 'computer studies', 'design', 'experimental study', 'feeding', 'gene product', 'genome wide association study', 'human disease', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'interest', 'laboratory experiment', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'protein aggregation', 'protein folding', 'protein function', 'protein structure', 'protein transport', 'public health relevance', 'skills', 'user-friendly']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME,R01,2017,278100,0.1384770059811477

"Misfoldome-centered multiOMICS approach to unravel preeclampsia subphenotypes. ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Preeclampsia is a heterogeneous disorder specific to human pregnancy and an important contributor to maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality worldwide. To date, there is no cure for preeclampsia except delivery. Spearheaded by our prior proteomics research, we discovered that preeclampsia shares characteristics of protein misfolding with established conformational disorders including Alzheimer's. These features involve urine congophilia (affinity for the amyloidophilic dye Congo red), affinity for conformational state-dependent antibodies, and dysregulation in the amyloid proteolytic pathway in the placenta and decidua. Our overarching hypothesis is that the excessive formation of misfolded proteins in preeclampsia is driven by increased macromolecular crowding due to defective clearance and/or underlying metabolic disorders leading to faulty protein folding. As a result, the universe of misfolded proteins (misfoldome) could be a rich source of biomarkers more closely related to disease etiology than the properly folded proteome. We propose to use existing biorepositories to understand the underpinnings of different subtypes of preeclampsia. Specifically, we aim to discover specific markers and druggable targets relevant to each preeclampsia subtype that can be corrected before the onset of manifest disease. To achieve these goals we will investigate 4 ""omics"" layers: proteomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics and phenomics uniquely integrated through machine learning bioinformatics approaches aimed to solve complex and interconnected systems biology data. These include: Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) and ""fuzzy"" soft clustering algorithms for integration of multi-omics data layers. Specific Aim 1 plans to apply shotgun bottom-up proteomics methods to catalogue the protein components of the misfoldome as reflected in urine congophilic aggregates of women with various clinical subphenotypes of preeclampsia. The proteins and biophysical characteristics of peptide sequences in the misfoldome will be analyzed and compared with those of total urine and serum proteomes. Specific Aim 2 plans to illuminate biological pathways of high interest by triangulating proteomics with transcriptomics (RNAseq on placental villous and decidual tissues) and metabolomics (serum and urine) data. Lastly, Specific Aim 3 will validate urine congophila and the newly discovered molecular signatures in a large biorepository of women followed longitudinally during their first pregnancy (nuMoM2b cohort). Together, the three aims of this proposal offer a unique opportunity toward personalized therapeutic options for preeclampsia before the onset of clinically manifest disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Preeclampsia is a heterogeneous multi-systemic disorder of human pregnancy with unknown etiology and an important contributor to maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality. We determined preeclampsia shares features of protein misfolding with established protein conformational disorders including as Alzheimer's disease. Using machine learning algorithms uniquely available to our team, we will integrate four ""omics"" layers centered on the misfoldome: proteomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics and phenomics with ultimate goal toward discovery of personalized molecular signatures and druggable targets that can be corrected before onset of manifest disease.",Misfoldome-centered multiOMICS approach to unravel preeclampsia subphenotypes.,9131774,R01HD084628,"['Affinity', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amyloid', 'Antibodies', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Congo Red', 'Crowding', 'Cystic Fibrosis', 'Data', 'Decidua', 'Deposition', 'Diagnostic', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Disease', 'Dyes', 'Entropy', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Knowledge', 'Light Chain Deposition Disease', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Target', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Organ', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Placenta', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnant Women', 'Prion Diseases', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Secondary to', 'Serum', 'Shotguns', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Source', 'Specimen', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'Villous', 'Woman', 'adverse pregnancy outcome', 'base', 'biobank', 'biophysical properties', 'cohort', 'curative treatments', 'cytotoxicity', 'design', 'driving force', 'extracellular', 'functional outcomes', 'improved', 'interest', 'maternal morbidity', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'molecular marker', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'neonatal morbidity', 'neonatal outcome', 'novel therapeutics', 'perinatal morbidity', 'personalized therapeutic', 'phenome', 'phenomics', 'prognostic', 'protein aminoacid sequence', 'protein folding', 'protein misfolding', 'prototype', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'trophoblast']",NICHD,RESEARCH INST NATIONWIDE CHILDREN'S HOSP,R01,2016,498328,0.07532990041858872
"Interactive Informatics Resource for Research-driven Cancer Proteomics DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  In 2013 over 1.6 million new cases of cancer are expected to be diagnosed and over 580,000 people are expected to die of the disease. Thus, continued research in the identification of new diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers of cancer is necessary. Although cancer is widely recognized as a genomic disease, the directives of the DNA-based drivers are executed at the level of proteins and their biological functions, and the application of potential protein level biomarkers remains a compelling vision. Thus, a large investment has been made by NCI and other research centers in high-throughput global proteomics experiments to mine for novel biomarkers of cancer. However, few of these markers have come to fruition. We believe that one of the major challenges to the discovery of robust protein- or pathway-biomarker candidates from these large and complex proteomics datasets is due to naive data analysis approaches that do not take into account the underlying complexity of the proteome (e.g., splice variants, post- translational modifications). State-of-the-art statistical algorithms to improve the tasks of quality assessment, peptide and protein quantification, and pathway modeling that are designed to account for the design of the experiment have been developed; however access to these methodologies by the larger community is hindered since they are in the prototype stage and typically require knowledge of statistical programming. Furthermore, the likelihood of these tools moving to robust software is low since they are developed within the context of existing grants that do not support the transition from prototype to software. For the field of clinical proteomics to successfully identif new mechanistic etiologies of cancer requires not only high quality data with respect to the instrument, but also high quality statistical analysis of the data. This project proposes new informatics technology in the form of a robust, interactive and cross- platform software environment that will enable biomedical and biological scientists to perform in-depth analyses of global proteomics data from the point of quality assessment and normalization of raw inferred abundances (e.g., peak area) to the identification of protein biomarkers and enriched pathways. The software will be designed in a single programming language (Java) to assure easy installation across platforms with wizard-based data entry and advanced data reporting. Java will also support the development of advanced graphical user interfaces for data presentation and interactive graphics with a modern look and feel. This approach will ensure that scientists outside of the development institution can develop modules to include in the software or extensions for data integration without challenges of re-compiling the application. The software modules to be developed under this project are Aim 1) peptide and protein level quality assessment and quantification, Aim 2) protein biomarker discovery via exploratory data analysis and machine learning, and Aim 3) pathway biomarker discovery through integration with the NCI Protein Interaction Database. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  For the past decade, cancer researchers have been utilizing global proteomics analyses to extensively categorize proteins and other molecular species in hopes of identifying distinctive features of cancer cells that not only explain the biology, but alo enable better patient care. Despite these investments, relatively few protein biomarkers have achieved clinical validation largely due to naive data analysis strategies used in the protein quantification and statistical validation of candidate biomarkers.

"Structural characterization of protein complexes involved in embryogenesis.     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Birth defects, such as those effecting cardiovascular (e.g. Coarctation of the Aorta), nervous system (e.g. Spina bifida) and craniofacial development (e.g. Cleft Palate) are responsible for roughly 20% of infant deaths in the United States and place an exceeding burden on the health care system amounting to billions of dollars each year. Such defects are often the result of disruptions in embryogenesis, which depends on tight regulation of key pathways including Wnt, Hedgehog, Notch, PAR, and Bone morphogenetic peptide/TGF beta. Many of the protein complexes involved in these pathways however lack detailed molecular characterization, and more still remain to be discovered. Large-scale proteomics efforts focused on embryonic tissues are beginning to systematically identify proteins in vast numbers. Using these data, I propose to develop new methods to structurally and functionally characterize protein complexes associated with embryogenesis. Specifically, I will develop novel computational tools (i) to datamine for proximal interactions (i.e. protein subcomplexes) as well as (ii) to calculate protein stoichiometry. I will then integrate this information to build structural models capable of both characterizing individual complex functions as well as identifying their role in developmental failure. These results will provide a greatly needed mechanistic understanding of the protein complexes associated with embryogenesis and potentially uncover therapeutic targets to treat developmental failures. Moreover, the methods developed here will provide the capability to analyze virtually any biological system and thus should have broad implications for the study of many diseases.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Failures during embryogenesis result in debilitating birth defects, which are responsible for roughly 20% of the US infant mortality rate and billions of dollars in health care costs. I propose to investigate protein complexes that regulate embryogenesis using recent advances in proteomics as well as novel computational techniques of my own. Results of this proposal will allow for greater insight into how birth defects arise and should provide avenues for therapeutics.            ",Structural characterization of protein complexes involved in embryogenesis.,8915540,F32GM112495,"['Aortic coarctation', 'Binding Sites', 'Biochemical', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Cleft Palate', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Analysis', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Developmental Biology', 'Disease', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Embryo', 'Embryonic Development', 'Erinaceidae', 'Failure', 'Fractionation', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Homology Modeling', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Infant Mortality', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Methods', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Sieve Chromatography', 'Mus', 'Nervous system structure', 'Pathway interactions', 'Peptides', 'Process', 'Protein Subunits', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Rana', 'Regulation', 'Role', 'Sea Anemones', 'Sea Urchins', 'Spinal Dysraphism', 'Staging', 'Structural Models', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta', 'Uncertainty', 'United States', 'Xenopus laevis', 'biological systems', 'bone', 'computer studies', 'computerized tools', 'craniofacial development', 'crosslink', 'data acquisition', 'data mining', 'egg', 'embryo tissue', 'fly', 'infant death', 'insight', 'model building', 'notch protein', 'novel', 'protein complex', 'protein structure', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'stoichiometry', 'structural biology', 'therapeutic target', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool']",NIGMS,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",F32,2016,56118,0.11231678028241981
"Computer Studies of Protein Structure and Function DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The research described in the current proposal has the long-range goals of enabling the prediction of protein-protein interactions and the application of this knowledge to problems of biomedical relevance. An additional long-term goal is the fuller integration of Structural and Systems Biology. Specific Aims include: a) The development of three-dimensional structure-based methods to predict, on a genome-wide scale, whether and how two proteins interact. b) The integration of structural information with other sources of evidence as to protein-protein interactions. c) The application of the methods being developed to important biomedical problems. These research goals are motivated by a number of factors. First, cellular function is mediated by tens or even hundreds of thousands of protein-protein interactions yet these are generally hard to predict in advance or to measure accurately with high-throughput experimental techniques. A method that allows the computational prediction of such interactions would thus be of significant impact. Second, there are many more protein sequences than protein structures so it is necessary to find ways to amplify the information in protein databases if structure is to be fully integrated in genome scale research. The proposed research is intended to bridge this gap.  A central element of the approach to be taken is the use of structural alignments to reveal novel functional relationships between proteins. Since structure is better conserved than sequence, these alignments can reveal new information. A novel structure-based method is introduced which exploits homology models and remote geometric relationships to amplify structural information. The evidence that is obtained is then combined with non-structural sources of evidence using Bayesian networks to yield a probability of whether two proteins interact. An important element in the proposed research strategy is the recognition that structural modeling on a large scale is necessarily imprecise so that it is necessary to use low resolution ""scoring functions for a given model that do not depend sensitively on atomic detail. Bayesian methods then allow the extraction of a clear signal from the underlying noise.  The biological impact of the research will be enhanced through computational/experimental applications in areas where structural clues have the potential of discovering truly novel interactions. Validated predictions on adhesion proteins, nuclear hormone receptors and cytokine signaling proteins demonstrate the efficacy of the methodology. New applications to viral host interactions and to cancer signaling pathways are described. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The health relatedness of the proposed research arises from the fact that a better understanding of protein- protein interactions opens the way to a better understanding of the biology underlying human disease. Applications to interactions involved in viral-host interactions, and in cancer-related pathways serve to highlight this aspect of the proposed research.",Computer Studies of Protein Structure and Function,8972013,R01GM030518,"['Adhesions', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Area', 'Bayesian Method', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Birds', 'Cell physiology', 'Chromosomes', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Conserved Sequence', 'Cytokine Signaling', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Elements', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Family', 'Family suidae', 'Funding', 'Gene Fusion', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Homology Modeling', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Indium', 'Influenza', 'Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Noise', 'Nuclear Hormone Receptors', 'Pathway interactions', 'Peptide Sequence Determination', 'Peptides', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Protein Region', 'Protein Structure Databases', 'Proteins', 'RNA Interference', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Homology', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signal Transduction Pathway', 'Signaling Protein', 'Site', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Tropism', 'Viral', 'Viral Proteins', 'Virus', 'Work', 'Yeasts', 'base', 'computer based statistical methods', 'computer infrastructure', 'computer studies', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'genome-wide', 'human disease', 'improved', 'influenzavirus', 'innovation', 'interest', 'method development', 'novel', 'predictive tools', 'programs', 'protein complex', 'protein function', 'protein protein interaction', 'protein structure', 'protein structure function', 'success', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool', 'tumor progression', 'tumorigenesis', 'virus host interaction']",NIGMS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2016,292404,0.09965866227049666
"PRO: A Protein Ontology in OBO Foundry for Scalable Integration of Biomedical Knowledge ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): PROJECT SUMMARY Biomedical ontologies are critical to the accurate representation and integration of genome-scale data in biomedical and clinical research. The Protein Ontology (PRO)-the reference ontology for protein entities in the OBO (Open Biological and Biomedical Ontologies) Foundry-represents protein families, multiple protein forms (proteoforms) arising from single genes, and protein complexes. This competitive renewal grant application will further establish PRO as a scalable, flexible, collaborative research infrastructure for protein-centric semantic integration of biomedical data of increasing volume and complexity. Specific aims are to: (i) enable scalable and dynamic representation of protein types; (ii) provide comprehensive coverage of human proteoforms in their biological context; (iii) develop collaborative use cases and support an expanding community of users to advance protein-disease understanding; and (iv) broaden dissemination to support semantic computing, dynamic term mapping, and interoperability and reusability. We will increase PRO coverage by semi-automated import of proteoforms and complexes from curated databases and via established text mining approaches. Expert curation will focus on human variant forms, post-translational modification (PTM) forms and complexes critical to disease processes, along with homologous mouse forms. We will develop a new PRO sub-ontology of protein sites-amino acid positions of significance-to enable automatic and dynamic definition of combinatoric proteoforms. We will establish PRO OWL and RDF versions and provide a SPARQL query endpoint to support semantic computing. We will organize annual workshops and annotation jamborees to develop use cases and promote PRO co-development with community collaborators to address specific disciplinary needs. PRO has several unique features. For knowledge representation, PRO defines precise protein entities to support accurate annotation at the appropriate level of granularity and provides the ontological framework to connect PTM and variant proteoforms and complexes necessary to model human health and disease. For semantic data integration, PRO provides the ontological structure to connect-via specified relations-the vast amounts of proteomics data and biomedical knowledge to support hypothesis generation and testing. PRO therefore addresses the gaps in the bioinformatics infrastructure for protein representations in a way that makes knowledge about proteins more accessible to computational reasoning, fully complementing existing knowledge sources.

"PRO: A Protein Ontology in OBO Foundry for Scalable Integration of Biomedical Knowledge ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): PROJECT SUMMARY Biomedical ontologies are critical to the accurate representation and integration of genome-scale data in biomedical and clinical research. The Protein Ontology (PRO)-the reference ontology for protein entities in the OBO (Open Biological and Biomedical Ontologies) Foundry-represents protein families, multiple protein forms (proteoforms) arising from single genes, and protein complexes. This competitive renewal grant application will further establish PRO as a scalable, flexible, collaborative research infrastructure for protein-centric semantic integration of biomedical data of increasing volume and complexity. Specific aims are to: (i) enable scalable and dynamic representation of protein types; (ii) provide comprehensive coverage of human proteoforms in their biological context; (iii) develop collaborative use cases and support an expanding community of users to advance protein-disease understanding; and (iv) broaden dissemination to support semantic computing, dynamic term mapping, and interoperability and reusability. We will increase PRO coverage by semi-automated import of proteoforms and complexes from curated databases and via established text mining approaches. Expert curation will focus on human variant forms, post-translational modification (PTM) forms and complexes critical to disease processes, along with homologous mouse forms. We will develop a new PRO sub-ontology of protein sites-amino acid positions of significance-to enable automatic and dynamic definition of combinatoric proteoforms. We will establish PRO OWL and RDF versions and provide a SPARQL query endpoint to support semantic computing. We will organize annual workshops and annotation jamborees to develop use cases and promote PRO co-development with community collaborators to address specific disciplinary needs. PRO has several unique features. For knowledge representation, PRO defines precise protein entities to support accurate annotation at the appropriate level of granularity and provides the ontological framework to connect PTM and variant proteoforms and complexes necessary to model human health and disease. For semantic data integration, PRO provides the ontological structure to connect-via specified relations-the vast amounts of proteomics data and biomedical knowledge to support hypothesis generation and testing. PRO therefore addresses the gaps in the bioinformatics infrastructure for protein representations in a way that makes knowledge about proteins more accessible to computational reasoning, fully complementing existing knowledge sources. The proposed research will allow the PRO Consortium to deepen and broaden PRO for scalable semantic integration of biomedical data, facilitating protein-disease knowledge discovery and clinical applications by an expanding community of biomedical, clinical and computational users.

"Integrative computational framework for pattern mining in big -omics data: linking synonymous codon usage to protein biogenesis PROJECT SUMMARY Efficient production of functional proteins is arguably the most important function of a cell. Ribosomes synthesize proteins by decoding mRNA codons, and N-terminal portions of proteins can begin to fold even while synthesis is still underway. The genetic code is degenerate, meaning that most amino acids can be encoded by more than one codon. Because synonymous codon substitutions do not alter the amino acid sequence of the encoded protein, they have historically been regarded as “silent”. However, it is now known that some synonymous substitutions can disrupt the expression, folding, targeting and/or function of the encoded protein, although the precise mechanisms are poorly understood. Computational analyses have attempted to identify connections between the locations of synonymous codons and features of the encoded protein, but to date have yielded conflicting results, and there have been few attempts to experimentally test predictions made from these computational studies. Hence we currently lack a systematic understanding of the connections between synonymous codon usage and protein biogenesis. Establishing these connections would broadly transform our interpretation of synonymous codon substitutions, including single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with human disease and synonymous substitutions in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Establishing these connections would also enable the addition of coding sequence design as an integral aspect of the rational design of novel gene products (proteins). Thus, we aim to design an innovative integrative computational and experimental strategy with which to identify connections between codon usage patterns and protein biogenesis. We will search broadly for such connections, developing and applying several novel new approaches: (i) computational approaches to track, quantify and align synonymous codon usage patterns in homologous proteins, (ii) network approaches to map codon usage onto all levels of protein structure, and (iii) an innovative combination of broad and targeted experimental approaches to test the importance and specific effects of altering codon usage on protein biogenesis. Throughout the project, rigorous statistical methods will be applied to test the validity of identified connections, and cell-based experiments will be used to both test and refine hypotheses resulting from the computational analyses and develop new hypotheses that will feed back into the computational analyses. The goal of this project is to transform our understanding of the connections between synonymous codon usage and protein biogenesis. The endpoint for this project period is the development of a set of general principles for codon usage, including user-friendly open-source software to enable the biomedical community to analyze genes of interest for synonymous codon usage features likely to affect protein biogenesis. At the same time, our methodology will be generalizable, to allow the public to search for additional connections between sequence and/or network patterns and protein function, as well as for similar connections in other domains. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE The same protein sequence can be encoded by more than one nucleic acid sequence. Historically, “synonymous” changes in a nucleic acid sequence were thought to be “silent”, but it is now emerging that some synonymous changes can change the folding of the encoded protein, and/or its transport into a membrane. We will integrate novel computational analyses and laboratory experiments to uncover the connections between synonymous substitutions and protein production in the cell.",Integrative computational framework for pattern mining in big -omics data: linking synonymous codon usage to protein biogenesis,9029632,R01GM120733,"['3-Dimensional', 'Affect', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Amino Acids', 'Back', 'Base Sequence', 'Biogenesis', 'Biological', 'Carrier Proteins', 'Case Study', 'Cells', 'Code', 'Codon Nucleotides', 'Communities', 'Companions', 'Complement', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Evolution', 'Feedback', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Genetic Code', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Homologous Protein', 'Informatics', 'Length', 'Link', 'Location', 'Maps', 'Membrane', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'N-terminal', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Network-based', 'Noise', 'Nucleic acid sequencing', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pattern', 'Peptide Sequence Determination', 'Process', 'Production', 'Property', 'Protein Engineering', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Ribosomes', 'Role', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Side', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Social Network', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Subcellular structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'analytical method', 'base', 'computer framework', 'computer studies', 'design', 'feeding', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'human disease', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'interest', 'laboratory experiment', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'protein aggregation', 'protein folding', 'protein function', 'protein structure', 'protein transport', 'research study', 'skills', 'user-friendly']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME,R01,2016,278100,0.1384770059811477
"Discovery of Mental Health and Inflammation (MHAIN) Interactome DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Knowledge of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) is necessary to understand system-level aspects of organisms including that of psychiatric processes. The PPI network (interactome) acts as a vehicle for several types of biomedical research. It can be used to understand the disease mechanisms, drug targets and side effects, and genetic causes for disease. There are 1,014 human genes associated with 'brain'; for 448 of these genes not even a single PPI is known today. While it is useful to discover which pairs of proteins interact, it is also exceptionally challenging as more than 99.9% of protein pairs do not interact. The objective of this work is to carry out systematically designed computational work to discover the human mental health and inflammation (MHAIN) interactome. The MHAIN interactome refers to the network of PPIs where at least one of the two proteins is involved in either brain or inflammation. Many challenges will be addressed in discovering new protein-protein interactions towards building the interactome. Well-established algorithms from diverse computational fields, such as machine learning and signal processing will be applied to achieve the proposed goals. Further, pathways of influence of neuropsychological processes and inflammatory processes on each other will be mined from the interactome. Selected interactions will be validated by wet-lab experiments. The approaches that will be employed for predicting the MHAIN interactome are proactive-learning (to obtain the labels and features of proteins that would provide the maximum impact), transfer-learning (to transfer the knowledge of protein features and interactions from one species to another), multi-sensor fusion (to intelligently integrate output from different predictors). The predicted interactome would accelerate discovery of the biology and treatment of mental health related diseases, by serving as a central resource for biomedical research on mental health. For every protein of interest, verifiable hypothesis of its interactions will be generated that reduce the search space of interactions of that protein from about 25,000 to a few possibilities. New PPIs of proteins involved in major depressive disorder, psychosis in patients with Alzherimer's disease, and systemic inflammation (which is intricately connected to psychiatric diseases), will be put in biomedical context by co- investigators who specialize in these areas. The interactome will identify ""hub-proteins"" that are central to many pathways. It will provide hypothesis of ""functional connectivity"" of new proteins (namely, those of which nothing is currently known). Further, many diseases are found to be untreatable by suppressing a single pathway, and often require manipulating multiple pathways, and the MHAIN interactome can provide the overlap points of multiple pathways that may be used for treatment of diseases. The MHAIN interactome, which would be the outcome of the proposed research, can thus have a broad impact on our understanding of molecular basis of mental health. 1 The proposed research discovers interactions among proteins that are involved in mental health and inflammation. The knowledge of such interactions would generate hypotheses about the role of these proteins in biological functional pathways and would contribute towards the understanding of the biology of diseases and towards development of mechanisms of treatment.",Discovery of Mental Health and Inflammation (MHAIN) Interactome,8841004,R01MH094564,"['Address', 'Adverse effects', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Area', 'Autophagocytosis', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Brain', 'Chronic', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Happiness', 'Human', 'Immunity', 'Infection', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Information Networks', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Mind', 'Mining', 'Molecular', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Neurologic', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Panic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Physiological', 'Physiological Processes', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychological Side Effects', 'Psychological Stress', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'System', 'Systemic disease', 'Systems Biology', 'Thinking', 'Viral Cancer', 'Virus Diseases', 'Work', 'base', 'body-mind', 'brain behavior', 'design', 'environmental stressor', 'insight', 'interest', 'neuropsychological', 'protein protein interaction', 'psychologic', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'sensor', 'signal processing']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2015,357427,0.09484100648018787
"Misfoldome-centered multiOMICS approach to unravel preeclampsia subphenotypes. ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Preeclampsia is a heterogeneous disorder specific to human pregnancy and an important contributor to maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality worldwide. To date, there is no cure for preeclampsia except delivery. Spearheaded by our prior proteomics research, we discovered that preeclampsia shares characteristics of protein misfolding with established conformational disorders including Alzheimer's. These features involve urine congophilia (affinity for the amyloidophilic dye Congo red), affinity for conformational state-dependent antibodies, and dysregulation in the amyloid proteolytic pathway in the placenta and decidua. Our overarching hypothesis is that the excessive formation of misfolded proteins in preeclampsia is driven by increased macromolecular crowding due to defective clearance and/or underlying metabolic disorders leading to faulty protein folding. As a result, the universe of misfolded proteins (misfoldome) could be a rich source of biomarkers more closely related to disease etiology than the properly folded proteome. We propose to use existing biorepositories to understand the underpinnings of different subtypes of preeclampsia. Specifically, we aim to discover specific markers and druggable targets relevant to each preeclampsia subtype that can be corrected before the onset of manifest disease. To achieve these goals we will investigate 4 ""omics"" layers: proteomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics and phenomics uniquely integrated through machine learning bioinformatics approaches aimed to solve complex and interconnected systems biology data. These include: Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) and ""fuzzy"" soft clustering algorithms for integration of multi-omics data layers. Specific Aim 1 plans to apply shotgun bottom-up proteomics methods to catalogue the protein components of the misfoldome as reflected in urine congophilic aggregates of women with various clinical subphenotypes of preeclampsia. The proteins and biophysical characteristics of peptide sequences in the misfoldome will be analyzed and compared with those of total urine and serum proteomes. Specific Aim 2 plans to illuminate biological pathways of high interest by triangulating proteomics with transcriptomics (RNAseq on placental villous and decidual tissues) and metabolomics (serum and urine) data. Lastly, Specific Aim 3 will validate urine congophila and the newly discovered molecular signatures in a large biorepository of women followed longitudinally during their first pregnancy (nuMoM2b cohort). Together, the three aims of this proposal offer a unique opportunity toward personalized therapeutic options for preeclampsia before the onset of clinically manifest disease.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Preeclampsia is a heterogeneous multi-systemic disorder of human pregnancy with unknown etiology and an important contributor to maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality. We determined preeclampsia shares features of protein misfolding with established protein conformational disorders including as Alzheimer's disease. Using machine learning algorithms uniquely available to our team, we will integrate four ""omics"" layers centered on the misfoldome: proteomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics and phenomics with ultimate goal toward discovery of personalized molecular signatures and druggable targets that can be corrected before onset of manifest disease.            ",Misfoldome-centered multiOMICS approach to unravel preeclampsia subphenotypes.,8947210,R01HD084628,"['Affinity', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amyloid', 'Antibodies', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Congo Red', 'Crowding', 'Cystic Fibrosis', 'Data', 'Decidua', 'Deposition', 'Diagnostic', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Disease', 'Dyes', 'Entropy', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Knowledge', 'Light Chain Deposition Disease', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Target', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neonatal', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Perinatal', 'Placenta', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Pregnant Women', 'Prion Diseases', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Secondary to', 'Serum', 'Shotguns', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Source', 'Specimen', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'Villous', 'Woman', 'base', 'biobank', 'biophysical properties', 'cohort', 'cytotoxicity', 'design', 'driving force', 'extracellular', 'functional outcomes', 'improved', 'interest', 'maternal morbidity', 'metabolomics', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'neonatal morbidity', 'novel therapeutics', 'personalized therapeutic', 'phenome', 'phenomics', 'prognostic', 'protein aminoacid sequence', 'protein folding', 'protein misfolding', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'trophoblast']",NICHD,RESEARCH INST NATIONWIDE CHILDREN'S HOSP,R01,2015,513319,0.07532990041858872
"Interactive Informatics Resource for Research-driven Cancer Proteomics DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  In 2013 over 1.6 million new cases of cancer are expected to be diagnosed and over 580,000 people are expected to die of the disease. Thus, continued research in the identification of new diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers of cancer is necessary. Although cancer is widely recognized as a genomic disease, the directives of the DNA-based drivers are executed at the level of proteins and their biological functions, and the application of potential protein level biomarkers remains a compelling vision. Thus, a large investment has been made by NCI and other research centers in high-throughput global proteomics experiments to mine for novel biomarkers of cancer. However, few of these markers have come to fruition. We believe that one of the major challenges to the discovery of robust protein- or pathway-biomarker candidates from these large and complex proteomics datasets is due to naive data analysis approaches that do not take into account the underlying complexity of the proteome (e.g., splice variants, post- translational modifications). State-of-the-art statistical algorithms to improve the tasks of quality assessment, peptide and protein quantification, and pathway modeling that are designed to account for the design of the experiment have been developed; however access to these methodologies by the larger community is hindered since they are in the prototype stage and typically require knowledge of statistical programming. Furthermore, the likelihood of these tools moving to robust software is low since they are developed within the context of existing grants that do not support the transition from prototype to software. For the field of clinical proteomics to successfully identif new mechanistic etiologies of cancer requires not only high quality data with respect to the instrument, but also high quality statistical analysis of the data. This project proposes new informatics technology in the form of a robust, interactive and cross- platform software environment that will enable biomedical and biological scientists to perform in-depth analyses of global proteomics data from the point of quality assessment and normalization of raw inferred abundances (e.g., peak area) to the identification of protein biomarkers and enriched pathways. The software will be designed in a single programming language (Java) to assure easy installation across platforms with wizard-based data entry and advanced data reporting. Java will also support the development of advanced graphical user interfaces for data presentation and interactive graphics with a modern look and feel. This approach will ensure that scientists outside of the development institution can develop modules to include in the software or extensions for data integration without challenges of re-compiling the application. The software modules to be developed under this project are Aim 1) peptide and protein level quality assessment and quantification, Aim 2) protein biomarker discovery via exploratory data analysis and machine learning, and Aim 3) pathway biomarker discovery through integration with the NCI Protein Interaction Database. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  For the past decade, cancer researchers have been utilizing global proteomics analyses to extensively categorize proteins and other molecular species in hopes of identifying distinctive features of cancer cells that not only explain the biology, but alo enable better patient care. Despite these investments, relatively few protein biomarkers have achieved clinical validation largely due to naive data analysis strategies used in the protein quantification and statistical validation of candidate biomarkers. This project will develop a robust user- friendly software environment that builds upon state-of-the-art statistical algorithms that are focused on addressing the underlying proteome complexity associated with cancer.",Interactive Informatics Resource for Research-driven Cancer Proteomics,8847691,U01CA184783,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Breast', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Quality', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Security', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Experimental Designs', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Investments', 'Java', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Letters', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Ovarian', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Pattern', 'Peptide Mapping', 'Peptides', 'Phenotype', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Process', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Programming Languages', 'Protein Fragment', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'RNA Splicing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Informatics', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Source Code', 'Specificity', 'Staging', 'Statistical Algorithm', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Sum', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'base', 'built environment', 'cancer cell', 'cancer proteomics', 'candidate validation', 'computerized data processing', 'computerized tools', 'data integration', 'design', 'experience', 'graphical user interface', 'improved', 'instrument', 'link protein', 'mathematical methods', 'model design', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'protein expression', 'prototype', 'research study', 'software development', 'statistics', 'tool', 'user friendly software']",NCI,BATTELLE PACIFIC NORTHWEST LABORATORIES,U01,2015,421696,0.043727228068364675
"Multiscale modeling of G protein-coupled receptors DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are the largest family in the mammalian genome, and are critical to a number of cell signaling processes. As a result, they are of enormous biomedical importance; by some estimates, as many as 50% of new pharmaceuticals target GPCRs. Unsurprisingly, there has been a huge research investment in understanding their biophysics. However, integral membrane proteins are challenging to work with experimentally, leaving an opportunity for computational methods to make a significant contribution. We will use multiscale modeling techniques, including all-atom molecular dynamics simulations and elastic network models, to explore the behavior of several GPCRs, including rhodopsin (and its retinal-free form, opsin) and the �2-adrenergic receptor (B2AR). Specifically, we will investigate the role of ligand binding in modulating GPCR function, via two separate all-atom molecular dynamics calculations. Microsecond-scale simulations of opsin will, when contrasted with our previous work on rhodopsin in the dark state and during the early stages of activation, allow us to see which interactions in rhodopsin are determined by the presence of the ligand, while the planned simulations of the full activation process will give the first atomic-level view of the structural changes involved in GPCR activation; this knowledge could be critical to the design of novel inhibitors to other GPCRs. The second goal of this proposal is to clarify the role of internal waters in the activation mechanism of GPCRs; our previous simulations described significant increases in the internal hydration of rhodopsin and B2AR. Here, we propose to pursue those observations more rigorously, using automatic pattern recognition methods to correlate hydration changes with functionally interesting protein motions in simulations of rhodopsin, B2AR, and the cannabinoid-2 receptor (CB2). The third goal of the proposal is to develop elastic network models - a simple, computationally inexpensive approach where the protein's interactions are represented as a network of springs - in order to explore larger scale problems not readily amenable to all-atom molecular dynamics, like the modulation of protein motions by G protein binding and GPCR oligomerization. A number of possible network model implementations will be considered, and the models will be carefully validated by quantitative comparison to extensive molecular dynamics simulations, including those proposed for the first aim. The fourth and final goal of the proposal is to assess the validity of a common assumption, that rhodopsin is a good template for understanding GPCR activation in general. To test this hypothesis we will apply multiple computational methods, including long timescale molecular dynamics and elastic network models, to a series of GPCRs, including rhodopsin, opsin, B2AR, and CB2. We will quantitatively correlate the fluctuations of the different GPCRs, with the hypothesis that motions conserved across multiple GPCRs are likely to be functionally significant. G protein-coupled receptors are the largest family of proteins in the human genome, and are the most targeted proteins for therapeutics development. We will use multiscale modeling methods to connect their structure and dynamics to function, in order to aid in the design and refinement of novel drugs.",Multiscale modeling of G protein-coupled receptors,8895982,R01GM095496,"['ADRB2 gene', 'Adrenergic Receptor', 'Behavior', 'Biophysics', 'CNR2 gene', 'Cell Signaling Process', 'Collaborations', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Dimerization', 'Drug Targeting', 'Elements', 'Event', 'Family', 'G-Protein-Coupled Receptors', 'GTP-Binding Proteins', 'Goals', 'Human Genome', 'Hydration status', 'Integral Membrane Protein', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Left', 'Ligand Binding', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Opsin', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Play', 'Process', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Family', 'Proteins', 'Receptor Activation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retinal', 'Rhodopsin', 'Role', 'Running', 'Series', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Water', 'Work', 'cost', 'design', 'follow-up', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'insight', 'interest', 'laptop', 'mammalian genome', 'metarhodopsin I', 'metarhodopsin II', 'molecular dynamics', 'multi-scale modeling', 'network models', 'novel', 'protein structure', 'receptor function', 'research study', 'signal processing', 'simulation', 'supercomputer', 'temporal measurement', 'therapeutic development']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,R01,2015,262650,0.08430728646159508
"Structure based prediction of the interactome DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Molecular interactions play a central role in all biological processes. Akin to the complete sequencing of genomes, complete descriptions of interactomes is a fundamental step towards a deeper understanding of biological processes, and has a vast potential to impact systems biology, genomics, molecular biology and therapeutics. Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) and protein-RNA interactions (PRIs) are of particular interest as they are critical in maintenance of cellular integrity, metabolism, transcription/translation, and cell-cell communication. Although high-throughput experimental PPI and PRI data is rapidly accumulating, building complete and confident datasets requires multiple replicates of expensive screens. This proposal aims to develop new methods that will significantly advance our efforts at structure-based approaches to better predict PPIs and RPIs and boost confidence in emerging high-throughput (HTP) data with the goal of comprehensive interactome mapping at lower cost. Taken together, these methods will vastly expand our understanding of macromolecular networks. We will continue to devise structure-based methods for protein-protein interaction prediction and branch out to methods for protein-RNA interaction prediction; this represents a major shift from the purely sequence-based approaches that most bioinformatics approaches utilize to predict  We will also build computational frameworks for boosting confidence in HTP protein-protein and protein-RNA interaction datasets using structure-based approaches; these frameworks will provide a comprehensive assessment of in-house and public HTP data, with potential biomedical applications such as heat shock protein-kinase interactions related to development for cancer therapeutics, MAPK6's role in a cancer-related signaling network, and (long non-coding) RNA-protein binding roles in neurodegenerative disease. Finally, we will computationally screen for PPIs and PRIs at the genome scale and expand our Struct2Net webserver to disseminate tools based on our methods and results to the community. An increasing number of HTP interaction datasets are being determined, thus presenting new opportunities to leverage this data in conjunction with structural insights to map binding sites and to uncover the underlying molecular mechanisms of cellular functions. molecular interactions and will enhance coverage and accuracy of the complete interactome. Successful completion of these aims will result in computational methods that will significantly increase our confidence in high-throughput data on protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions and will reveal fundamental aspects of their functioning, as well as testable hypotheses for experimental investigations. All developed software will be made publicly available. Biological processes are carried out through thousands of interactions between various types of molecules (the Interactome) that play fundamental roles in all biomedical processes including the maintenance of cellular integrity, metabolism, transcription/translation, and cell-cell communication. Understanding these interaction networks on a large scale will empower both rational, targeted drug design and more intelligent disease management. In this project, we develop computational methods for structure-based prediction of protein-protein and protein- RNA interactions, and integrate these predictions with available high-throughput genomic data to predict the Interactomes of entire species' genomes.",Structure based prediction of the interactome,8848384,R01GM081871,"['Algorithms', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Drug Design', 'Explosion', 'Future', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Heat shock proteins', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Linear Programming', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Organism', 'Play', 'Process', 'Progress Reports', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Kinase Interaction', 'Proteins', 'Public Housing', 'RNA', 'RNA-Protein Interaction', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sequence Homology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Translations', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Yeasts', 'base', 'computer framework', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'empowered', 'flexibility', 'fly', 'functional genomics', 'genome sequencing', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'infancy', 'insight', 'interest', 'novel', 'protein protein interaction', 'research study', 'software development', 'success', 'tool', 'web services']",NIGMS,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2015,320843,0.11423665093035626
"Computer Studies of Protein Structure and Function DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The research described in the current proposal has the long-range goals of enabling the prediction of protein-protein interactions and the application of this knowledge to problems of biomedical relevance. An additional long-term goal is the fuller integration of Structural and Systems Biology. Specific Aims include: a) The development of three-dimensional structure-based methods to predict, on a genome-wide scale, whether and how two proteins interact. b) The integration of structural information with other sources of evidence as to protein-protein interactions. c) The application of the methods being developed to important biomedical problems. These research goals are motivated by a number of factors. First, cellular function is mediated by tens or even hundreds of thousands of protein-protein interactions yet these are generally hard to predict in advance or to measure accurately with high-throughput experimental techniques. A method that allows the computational prediction of such interactions would thus be of significant impact. Second, there are many more protein sequences than protein structures so it is necessary to find ways to amplify the information in protein databases if structure is to be fully integrated in genome scale research. The proposed research is intended to bridge this gap.  A central element of the approach to be taken is the use of structural alignments to reveal novel functional relationships between proteins. Since structure is better conserved than sequence, these alignments can reveal new information. A novel structure-based method is introduced which exploits homology models and remote geometric relationships to amplify structural information. The evidence that is obtained is then combined with non-structural sources of evidence using Bayesian networks to yield a probability of whether two proteins interact. An important element in the proposed research strategy is the recognition that structural modeling on a large scale is necessarily imprecise so that it is necessary to use low resolution ""scoring functions for a given model that do not depend sensitively on atomic detail. Bayesian methods then allow the extraction of a clear signal from the underlying noise.  The biological impact of the research will be enhanced through computational/experimental applications in areas where structural clues have the potential of discovering truly novel interactions. Validated predictions on adhesion proteins, nuclear hormone receptors and cytokine signaling proteins demonstrate the efficacy of the methodology. New applications to viral host interactions and to cancer signaling pathways are described. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The health relatedness of the proposed research arises from the fact that a better understanding of protein- protein interactions opens the way to a better understanding of the biology underlying human disease. Applications to interactions involved in viral-host interactions, and in cancer-related pathways serve to highlight this aspect of the proposed research.",Computer Studies of Protein Structure and Function,8773597,R01GM030518,"['Adhesions', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Area', 'Bayesian Method', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Birds', 'Cell physiology', 'Chromosomes', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Conserved Sequence', 'Cytokine Signaling', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Elements', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Family', 'Family suidae', 'Funding', 'Gene Fusion', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Homology Modeling', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Indium', 'Influenza', 'Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Noise', 'Nuclear Hormone Receptors', 'Pathway interactions', 'Peptide Sequence Determination', 'Peptides', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Protein Region', 'Protein Structure Databases', 'Proteins', 'RNA Interference', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Homology', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signal Transduction Pathway', 'Signaling Protein', 'Site', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Tropism', 'Viral', 'Viral Proteins', 'Virus', 'Work', 'Yeasts', 'base', 'computer based statistical methods', 'computer infrastructure', 'computer studies', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'genome-wide', 'human disease', 'improved', 'influenzavirus', 'innovation', 'interest', 'method development', 'novel', 'programs', 'protein complex', 'protein function', 'protein protein interaction', 'protein structure', 'protein structure function', 'success', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool', 'tumor progression', 'tumorigenesis', 'virus host interaction']",NIGMS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2015,291815,0.09965866227049666
"PRO: A Protein Ontology in OBO Foundry for Scalable Integration of Biomedical Knowledge ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): PROJECT SUMMARY Biomedical ontologies are critical to the accurate representation and integration of genome-scale data in biomedical and clinical research. The Protein Ontology (PRO)-the reference ontology for protein entities in the OBO (Open Biological and Biomedical Ontologies) Foundry-represents protein families, multiple protein forms (proteoforms) arising from single genes, and protein complexes. This competitive renewal grant application will further establish PRO as a scalable, flexible, collaborative research infrastructure for protein-centric semantic integration of biomedical data of increasing volume and complexity. Specific aims are to: (i) enable scalable and dynamic representation of protein types; (ii) provide comprehensive coverage of human proteoforms in their biological context; (iii) develop collaborative use cases and support an expanding community of users to advance protein-disease understanding; and (iv) broaden dissemination to support semantic computing, dynamic term mapping, and interoperability and reusability. We will increase PRO coverage by semi-automated import of proteoforms and complexes from curated databases and via established text mining approaches. Expert curation will focus on human variant forms, post-translational modification (PTM) forms and complexes critical to disease processes, along with homologous mouse forms. We will develop a new PRO sub-ontology of protein sites-amino acid positions of significance-to enable automatic and dynamic definition of combinatoric proteoforms. We will establish PRO OWL and RDF versions and provide a SPARQL query endpoint to support semantic computing. We will organize annual workshops and annotation jamborees to develop use cases and promote PRO co-development with community collaborators to address specific disciplinary needs. PRO has several unique features. For knowledge representation, PRO defines precise protein entities to support accurate annotation at the appropriate level of granularity and provides the ontological framework to connect PTM and variant proteoforms and complexes necessary to model human health and disease. For semantic data integration, PRO provides the ontological structure to connect-via specified relations-the vast amounts of proteomics data and biomedical knowledge to support hypothesis generation and testing. PRO therefore addresses the gaps in the bioinformatics infrastructure for protein representations in a way that makes knowledge about proteins more accessible to computational reasoning, fully complementing existing knowledge sources. The proposed research will allow the PRO Consortium to deepen and broaden PRO for scalable semantic integration of biomedical data, facilitating protein-disease knowledge discovery and clinical applications by an expanding community of biomedical, clinical and computational users.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: PROJECT NARRATIVE The Protein Ontology (PRO) will allow researchers to capture and accurately represent scientific knowledge of proteins thus providing a research infrastructure for modeling biological systems and for protein-centric integration of existing and emerging experimental and clinical data. As a component of the global informatics resource network, the PRO resource will be instrumental in computational analysis and knowledge discovery of genome-scale data and will aid in improving our understanding of human disease, and in the identification of potential diagnostic and therapeutic targets.            ",PRO: A Protein Ontology in OBO Foundry for Scalable Integration of Biomedical Knowledge,8964875,R01GM080646,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Amino Acids', 'Applications Grants', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Research', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Combinatorics', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Educational workshop', 'Fostering', 'Gene Proteins', 'Generations', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Health', 'Histones', 'Human', 'Imagery', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Literature', 'Maps', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Ontology', 'Organism', 'Peptide Sequence Determination', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Post-Translational Modification Site', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Process', 'Protein Family', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Informatics', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Semantics', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Services', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'System', 'Taxon', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Variant', 'base', 'biological systems', 'biomedical ontology', 'clinical application', 'data integration', 'disease classification', 'disease phenotype', 'flexibility', 'genome-wide', 'human disease', 'improved', 'information organization', 'interoperability', 'knowledge base', 'protein complex', 'public health relevance', 'symposium', 'text searching', 'therapeutic target', 'usability', 'web services']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF DELAWARE,R01,2015,745136,0.13610663293940015
"New Computational Methods for Data-driven Protein Structure Prediction    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Proteins play a central role in all biological processes. Akin to the complete sequencing of genomes, complete description of protein structures is a fundamental step towards understanding biological life, and is also highly relevant medically in the development of therapeutics and drugs. The broad, long-term goal of the project is to develop machine learning methods for data-driven protein structure prediction through two independent but complementary strategies: 1) much more accurate template-based modeling for proteins with remote homologs in the Protein Data Bank and 2) better template-free modeling method for proteins without detectable templates and for improving template-based models. The specific aims are: Aim 1) to greatly improve template-based modeling by 1a) improving protein sequence-template alignment using a regression-tree-based nonlinear scoring function, especially when good sequence profiles are unavailable; and 1b) improving fold recognition using a machine learning method to combine both residue-level and atom-level features; Aim 2) to improve protein conformation sampling in a continuous space and thus template-free modeling by three independent but complementary approaches: 2a) modeling nonlinear sequence- structure relationship using Conditional (Markov) Random Fields (CRF) models; 2b) simultaneously sampling secondary and tertiary structure; and 2c) learning structure information from template. The core of the project is to develop various CRF models for data-driven protein structure prediction, by learning protein sequence-structure relationship from existing sequence/structure databases. The product of this research includes a regression-tree-based CRF model for accurate protein alignment, especially for proteins without close homologs in the PDB or without very good sequence profiles; a SVM model for protein fold recognition; a few CRF models for efficient protein conformation sampling in a continuous space; and a complete protein structure prediction software package. Also, it will produce a web server publicly available for various academic and biomedical users. Protein structure prediction will lead to a broad range of biomedical applications, such as the development of novel diagnostics, better understanding of disease processes and improved preventive therapies leading to reduced health care costs. Protein modeling is also widely applied in the pharmaceutical industry and integrated into most stages of pharmaceutical research.

"Very large datasets and new models to predict and design protein interactions PROJECT SUMMARY  Specific protein-protein interactions are responsible for organizing the cell, for processing biological signals and information, and for the chemistry of life. Thus, understanding biological mechanism relies on understanding the interactions that occur between proteins. An important long-term goal is to develop methods for reliably predicting and rationally modifying protein-protein interactions. Such capabilities would  provide insight into the molecular details of pathology and highlight opportunities for disease treatment. This proposal describes an integrated experimental/computational technology platform that will provide predictive models of protein interaction specificity. The experimental component involves constructing randomized libraries of proteins or peptides that will be sorted according to their affinities for binding a particular  receptor. The identities and binding affinities for very large numbers of library members will be decoded using high-throughput sequencing methods. The data, consisting of up to 107 {sequence, affinity} pairs per sequencing run, will be used as input to computational machine learning methods. Models will be generated that capture the relationship between sequence and interactions, and the predictive power of these models  will be tested experimentally. The work described in this proposal emphasizes technology development and application of the new platform to study two general types of protein complexes. First are interactions of short helical ligands with mid-sized globular proteins, here studied using anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and Ca2+- binding EF-hand proteins. Second are interactions of short linear peptides with modular interaction  domains, here PDZ and SH3 domains. These four protein families mediate an enormous number of important molecular recognition events in human cells, and the resulting models will provide valuable support to study of their biological functions. This work will also provide a stringent test of the capabilities of the proposed technology, which can then be applied to a much wider variety of molecular complexes, e.g., protein-protein, protein-small molecule and protein-nucleic acid assemblies. Given the paucity of high-  throughput methods for accurately measuring protein-protein interactions, and the primitive capabilities of most computational models for predicting protein binding, the proposed technology platform has the potential to dramatically transform the study of protein interaction specificity. Relevance  Specific protein-protein interactions underlie all biological processes. Knowledge of interactions that occur in healthy vs. diseased tissues, coupled with methods for inhibiting such interactions, would dramatically expand opportunities to treat human disease.

"Refinement Methods for Protein Docking based on Exploring Multi-Dimensional Energ DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): All successful state-of-the-art protein docking methods employ a so called multistage approach. At the first stage of such approaches a rough energy potential is used to score billions of conformations. At a second stage, thousands of conformations with the best scores are retained and clustered based on a certain similarity metric. Cluster centers correspond to putative predictions/models. Recent work by the proposing team demonstrated that greater prediction quality can be achieved by properly exploring these clusters through a process called refinement. This work resulted in the development of a prototype refinement approach - the Semi-Definite programming-based Underestimation method (SDU). The central goal of the project is to build on the SDU success and develop a new high-throughput refinement protocol able to produce predictions of near-crystallographic quality in the most computationally efficient manner. Efficiency will be achieved by leveraging the funnel-like shape that binding free energy potentials exhibit. The specific aims are: (1) the development of a new clustering method that can classify the conformations retained from a first-stage method into clusters suitable for the proposed refinement strategy; (2) the characterization of the structure of the multi-dimensional funnel corresponding to each cluster and the development of an efficient refinement strategy to explore this funnel; (3) the development of a side-chain positioning algorithm appropriate for docking by leveraging Markov random field theory; and (4) the dissemination of the algorithms developed through the release to the research community of a software package and an automated refinement server. It is anticipated that the computational efficiency gains of the proposed refinement protocol over alternative Monte Carlo methods will exceed two orders of magnitude, while, at the same time, significantly improve upon the accuracy achieved by earlier refinement approaches. A novelty of the proposed work is in its use of sophisticated machinery from the fields of optimization and decision theory specially tailored to the biophysical properties of the docking problem. Techniques from convex and combinatorial optimization, machine learning, and Markov random fields are brought to bear on the refinement stage of multistage protein docking approaches. An important element of the work is the systematic characterization of multi-dimensional binding energy funnels. The existence of such funnels has been long conjectured but it has not led to new docking approaches so far. The proposed algorithms essentially achieve this goal by devising efficient strategies to identify, characterize, and explore these funnels. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This work will substantially improve upon computational methods for characterizing and predicting protein- protein interactions. It will enable treating relatively weak protein complexes involving larger proteins than what is possible today. This will result in a better understanding of processes such as metabolic control, immune response, signal transduction, and gene regulation.",Refinement Methods for Protein Docking based on Exploring Multi-Dimensional Energ,8633467,R01GM093147,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Combinatorial Optimization', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Decision Theory', 'Development', 'Dill', 'Dimensions', 'Discrimination', 'Docking', 'Electrostatics', 'Elements', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Fourier Transform', 'Free Energy', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Generations', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Immune response', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Ligands', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Metabolic Control', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Motion', 'Motivation', 'Movement', 'National Institute of General Medical Sciences', 'Paper', 'Pathway interactions', 'Plant Roots', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Potential Energy', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Published Comment', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rotation', 'Sampling', 'Scoring Method', 'Shapes', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Simulate', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Transduction Gene', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Ursidae Family', 'Vertebral column', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'biophysical properties', 'cost', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'interest', 'programs', 'protein complex', 'protein folding', 'protein protein interaction', 'prototype', 'receptor', 'research study', 'screening', 'success', 'theories']",NIGMS,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),R01,2014,316023,0.06918191158801695
"Discovery of Mental Health and Inflammation (MHAIN) Interactome    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Knowledge of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) is necessary to understand system-level aspects of organisms including that of psychiatric processes. The PPI network (interactome) acts as a vehicle for several types of biomedical research. It can be used to understand the disease mechanisms, drug targets and side effects, and genetic causes for disease. There are 1,014 human genes associated with 'brain'; for 448 of these genes not even a single PPI is known today. While it is useful to discover which pairs of proteins interact, it is also exceptionally challenging as more than 99.9% of protein pairs do not interact. The objective of this work is to carry out systematically designed computational work to discover the human mental health and inflammation (MHAIN) interactome. The MHAIN interactome refers to the network of PPIs where at least one of the two proteins is involved in either brain or inflammation. Many challenges will be addressed in discovering new protein-protein interactions towards building the interactome. Well-established algorithms from diverse computational fields, such as machine learning and signal processing will be applied to achieve the proposed goals. Further, pathways of influence of neuropsychological processes and inflammatory processes on each other will be mined from the interactome. Selected interactions will be validated by wet-lab experiments. The approaches that will be employed for predicting the MHAIN interactome are proactive-learning (to obtain the labels and features of proteins that would provide the maximum impact), transfer-learning (to transfer the knowledge of protein features and interactions from one species to another), multi-sensor fusion (to intelligently integrate output from different predictors). The predicted interactome would accelerate discovery of the biology and treatment of mental health related diseases, by serving as a central resource for biomedical research on mental health. For every protein of interest, verifiable hypothesis of its interactions will be generated that reduce the search space of interactions of that protein from about 25,000 to a few possibilities. New PPIs of proteins involved in major depressive disorder, psychosis in patients with Alzherimer's disease, and systemic inflammation (which is intricately connected to psychiatric diseases), will be put in biomedical context by co- investigators who specialize in these areas. The interactome will identify ""hub-proteins"" that are central to many pathways. It will provide hypothesis of ""functional connectivity"" of new proteins (namely, those of which nothing is currently known). Further, many diseases are found to be untreatable by suppressing a single pathway, and often require manipulating multiple pathways, and the MHAIN interactome can provide the overlap points of multiple pathways that may be used for treatment of diseases. The MHAIN interactome, which would be the outcome of the proposed research, can thus have a broad impact on our understanding of molecular basis of mental health. 1        The proposed research discovers interactions among proteins that are involved in mental health and inflammation. The knowledge of such interactions would generate hypotheses about the role of these proteins in biological functional pathways and would contribute towards the understanding of the biology of diseases and towards development of mechanisms of treatment.

"Interactive Informatics Resource for Research-driven Cancer Proteomics     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  In 2013 over 1.6 million new cases of cancer are expected to be diagnosed and over 580,000 people are expected to die of the disease. Thus, continued research in the identification of new diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers of cancer is necessary. Although cancer is widely recognized as a genomic disease, the directives of the DNA-based drivers are executed at the level of proteins and their biological functions, and the application of potential protein level biomarkers remains a compelling vision. Thus, a large investment has been made by NCI and other research centers in high-throughput global proteomics experiments to mine for novel biomarkers of cancer. However, few of these markers have come to fruition. We believe that one of the major challenges to the discovery of robust protein- or pathway-biomarker candidates from these large and complex proteomics datasets is due to naive data analysis approaches that do not take into account the underlying complexity of the proteome (e.g., splice variants, post- translational modifications). State-of-the-art statistical algorithms to improve the tasks of quality assessment, peptide and protein quantification, and pathway modeling that are designed to account for the design of the experiment have been developed; however access to these methodologies by the larger community is hindered since they are in the prototype stage and typically require knowledge of statistical programming. Furthermore, the likelihood of these tools moving to robust software is low since they are developed within the context of existing grants that do not support the transition from prototype to software. For the field of clinical proteomics to successfully identif new mechanistic etiologies of cancer requires not only high quality data with respect to the instrument, but also high quality statistical analysis of the data. This project proposes new informatics technology in the form of a robust, interactive and cross- platform software environment that will enable biomedical and biological scientists to perform in-depth analyses of global proteomics data from the point of quality assessment and normalization of raw inferred abundances (e.g., peak area) to the identification of protein biomarkers and enriched pathways. The software will be designed in a single programming language (Java) to assure easy installation across platforms with wizard-based data entry and advanced data reporting. Java will also support the development of advanced graphical user interfaces for data presentation and interactive graphics with a modern look and feel. This approach will ensure that scientists outside of the development institution can develop modules to include in the software or extensions for data integration without challenges of re-compiling the application. The software modules to be developed under this project are Aim 1) peptide and protein level quality assessment and quantification, Aim 2) protein biomarker discovery via exploratory data analysis and machine learning, and Aim 3) pathway biomarker discovery through integration with the NCI Protein Interaction Database.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  For the past decade, cancer researchers have been utilizing global proteomics analyses to extensively categorize proteins and other molecular species in hopes of identifying distinctive features of cancer cells that not only explain the biology, but alo enable better patient care. Despite these investments, relatively few protein biomarkers have achieved clinical validation largely due to naive data analysis strategies used in the protein quantification and statistical validation of candidate biomarkers. This project will develop a robust user- friendly software environment that builds upon state-of-the-art statistical algorithms that are focused on addressing the underlying proteome complexity associated with cancer.            ",Interactive Informatics Resource for Research-driven Cancer Proteomics,8685758,U01CA184783,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Breast', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Quality', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Security', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Experimental Designs', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Investments', 'Java', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Letters', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Ovarian', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Pattern', 'Peptide Mapping', 'Peptides', 'Phenotype', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Process', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Programming Languages', 'Protein Fragment', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'RNA Splicing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Informatics', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Source Code', 'Specificity', 'Staging', 'Statistical Algorithm', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Sum', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer proteomics', 'candidate validation', 'computerized data processing', 'computerized tools', 'data integration', 'design', 'experience', 'graphical user interface', 'improved', 'instrument', 'link protein', 'mathematical methods', 'model design', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'protein expression', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'software development', 'statistics', 'tool', 'user friendly software']",NCI,BATTELLE PACIFIC NORTHWEST LABORATORIES,U01,2014,419855,0.043727228068364675
"Reversible protein acetylation and sirtuin function    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over the last several years, accumulating evidence suggests that reversible acetylation may be a major regulatory mechanism for controlling protein function. Recent proteomic investigations have cataloged the existence of hundreds of acetylated proteins, implicating a potential regulatory role for nearly all facets of cellular biochemistry. Interestingly, metabolic enzymes constitute the largest portion of acetylated proteins. Only in a handful of examples has the functional significance of protein acetylation been revealed. Thus, there is tremendous need to determine the regulatory functions of protein acetylation, both at the level of physiological outcomes and at the level of molecular mechanism. This proposal directly investigates the central hypothesis that reversible acetylation is a major regulatory mechanism for controlling protein function. To accomplish these goals, we will investigate the biochemical and biological functions of sirtuins, NAD+dependent protein deacetylases, which are implicated in genome maintenance, metabolism, cell survival, and lifespan. The specific aims are focused on demonstrating a direct regulatory role for sirtuins in several major metabolic processes, and elucidating how site-specific acetylation affects enzyme function. Employing mechanistic enzymology, quantitative mass spectrometry, novel high-throughput assays, metabolic pathway analysis, structural biology, enzyme regulation, cell culture models, and mouse genetics, these studies will provide the first comprehensive understanding of the functional significance of reversible protein acetylation. The results have the potential to uncover the prominence of a previously-unknown regulatory mechanism and to transform how we understand metabolic and aged-related diseases.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: New evidence suggests that a previously-unknown form of cellular and metabolic regulation exits. This proposal seeks to investigate the functional importance of this regulatory mechanism and the role played by a group of enzymes that are implicated in genome maintenance, metabolism, cell survival, and lifespan. The results have the potential to the transform how we understand metabolic and aged-related diseases, and to generate novel therapeutic opportunities.

"Multiscale modeling of G protein-coupled receptors    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are the largest family in the mammalian genome, and are critical to a number of cell signaling processes. As a result, they are of enormous biomedical importance; by some estimates, as many as 50% of new pharmaceuticals target GPCRs. Unsurprisingly, there has been a huge research investment in understanding their biophysics. However, integral membrane proteins are challenging to work with experimentally, leaving an opportunity for computational methods to make a significant contribution. We will use multiscale modeling techniques, including all-atom molecular dynamics simulations and elastic network models, to explore the behavior of several GPCRs, including rhodopsin (and its retinal-free form, opsin) and the ¿2-adrenergic receptor (B2AR). Specifically, we will investigate the role of ligand binding in modulating GPCR function, via two separate all-atom molecular dynamics calculations. Microsecond-scale simulations of opsin will, when contrasted with our previous work on rhodopsin in the dark state and during the early stages of activation, allow us to see which interactions in rhodopsin are determined by the presence of the ligand, while the planned simulations of the full activation process will give the first atomic-level view of the structural changes involved in GPCR activation; this knowledge could be critical to the design of novel inhibitors to other GPCRs. The second goal of this proposal is to clarify the role of internal waters in the activation mechanism of GPCRs; our previous simulations described significant increases in the internal hydration of rhodopsin and B2AR. Here, we propose to pursue those observations more rigorously, using automatic pattern recognition methods to correlate hydration changes with functionally interesting protein motions in simulations of rhodopsin, B2AR, and the cannabinoid-2 receptor (CB2). The third goal of the proposal is to develop elastic network models - a simple, computationally inexpensive approach where the protein's interactions are represented as a network of springs - in order to explore larger scale problems not readily amenable to all-atom molecular dynamics, like the modulation of protein motions by G protein binding and GPCR oligomerization. A number of possible network model implementations will be considered, and the models will be carefully validated by quantitative comparison to extensive molecular dynamics simulations, including those proposed for the first aim. The fourth and final goal of the proposal is to assess the validity of a common assumption, that rhodopsin is a good template for understanding GPCR activation in general. To test this hypothesis we will apply multiple computational methods, including long timescale molecular dynamics and elastic network models, to a series of GPCRs, including rhodopsin, opsin, B2AR, and CB2. We will quantitatively correlate the fluctuations of the different GPCRs, with the hypothesis that motions conserved across multiple GPCRs are likely to be functionally significant.        G protein-coupled receptors are the largest family of proteins in the human genome, and are the most targeted proteins for therapeutics development. We will use multiscale modeling methods to connect their structure and dynamics to function, in order to aid in the design and refinement of novel drugs.

"Structure based prediction of the interactome     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Molecular interactions play a central role in all biological processes. Akin to the complete sequencing of genomes, complete descriptions of interactomes is a fundamental step towards a deeper understanding of biological processes, and has a vast potential to impact systems biology, genomics, molecular biology and therapeutics. Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) and protein-RNA interactions (PRIs) are of particular interest as they are critical in maintenance of cellular integrity, metabolism, transcription/translation, and cell-cell communication. Although high-throughput experimental PPI and PRI data is rapidly accumulating, building complete and confident datasets requires multiple replicates of expensive screens. This proposal aims to develop new methods that will significantly advance our efforts at structure-based approaches to better predict PPIs and RPIs and boost confidence in emerging high-throughput (HTP) data with the goal of comprehensive interactome mapping at lower cost. Taken together, these methods will vastly expand our understanding of macromolecular networks. We will continue to devise structure-based methods for protein-protein interaction prediction and branch out to methods for protein-RNA interaction prediction; this represents a major shift from the purely sequence-based approaches that most bioinformatics approaches utilize to predict  We will also build computational frameworks for boosting confidence in HTP protein-protein and protein-RNA interaction datasets using structure-based approaches; these frameworks will provide a comprehensive assessment of in-house and public HTP data, with potential biomedical applications such as heat shock protein-kinase interactions related to development for cancer therapeutics, MAPK6's role in a cancer-related signaling network, and (long non-coding) RNA-protein binding roles in neurodegenerative disease. Finally, we will computationally screen for PPIs and PRIs at the genome scale and expand our Struct2Net webserver to disseminate tools based on our methods and results to the community. An increasing number of HTP interaction datasets are being determined, thus presenting new opportunities to leverage this data in conjunction with structural insights to map binding sites and to uncover the underlying molecular mechanisms of cellular functions. molecular interactions and will enhance coverage and accuracy of the complete interactome. Successful completion of these aims will result in computational methods that will significantly increase our confidence in high-throughput data on protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions and will reveal fundamental aspects of their functioning, as well as testable hypotheses for experimental investigations. All developed software will be made publicly available.          Biological processes are carried out through thousands of interactions between various types of molecules (the Interactome) that play fundamental roles in all biomedical processes including the maintenance of cellular integrity, metabolism, transcription/translation, and cell-cell communication. Understanding these interaction networks on a large scale will empower both rational, targeted drug design and more intelligent disease management. In this project, we develop computational methods for structure-based prediction of protein-protein and protein- RNA interactions, and integrate these predictions with available high-throughput genomic data to predict the Interactomes of entire species' genomes.

"Analysis of force developed by a AAA ATPase    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The AAA ATPases family includes molecules whose roles include, but are far from limited to, biogenesis of mitochondria and multivesicular bodies, proteins in involved in gene regulation and protein transport. This project will focus on studying the activity of these machines at the single molecule level. The model protein will be ClpX - it is the part of the proteosome, a key effect of protein degradation that unfolds the proteins to prepare them for degradation. . Cellular proteins differ widely in their liability, from half-lives of minutes to days. Regulated degradation, by allowing rapid changes in the levels of cellular proteins, helps control signal transduction pathways, the cell- cycle, transcription, apoptosis, antigen processing, biological clock control, differentiation and surface receptor desensitization. The questions to be addressed are: How is work partitioned between alternative outcomes? What is the maximum work that can be performed by the system? What factors limit its efficiency in performing work? These questions have health implications: human pathological conditions are associated with failures of the degradation system and its regulation offers the potential for therapeutic intervention. Furthermore, an inhibitor of proteasome catalytic activity is in use for treatment of recurrent multiple myeloma, and proteasome inhibitors are in clinical trial for treatment of a broad spectrum of human malignancies. Thus, understanding the regulation of the half-life of proteins should provide critical insights into cell physiology and pathology. The mishandling of aberrant proteins incurs penalties throughout biology: the survival of bacteria subjected to stress depends on the effective performance of systems which deal with misfolded and structurally aberrant proteins- to either fold them properly or destroy them. The specific questions to be addressed are: How hard can the device pull to cause unfolding? How many pulls are needed to commit irreversibly? What is the limit of pulling power, and the statistical distribution of pulling power? Answers to these questions will begin to reveal not just what these machines do but the decision tree that describes how outcomes are controlled and when machine capacity may be exceeded. We want to know not just how the machine works, but how its decision tree yields alternative outcomes.        The AAA ATPases family includes molecules whose roles include, but are far from limited to, biogenesis of mitochondria and multivesicular bodies, proteins in involved in gene regulation and protein transport. The model will be a protein involved in degrading other proteins.

"Computer Studies of Protein Structure and Function     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The research described in the current proposal has the long-range goals of enabling the prediction of protein-protein interactions and the application of this knowledge to problems of biomedical relevance. An additional long-term goal is the fuller integration of Structural and Systems Biology. Specific Aims include: a) The development of three-dimensional structure-based methods to predict, on a genome-wide scale, whether and how two proteins interact. b) The integration of structural information with other sources of evidence as to protein-protein interactions. c) The application of the methods being developed to important biomedical problems. These research goals are motivated by a number of factors. First, cellular function is mediated by tens or even hundreds of thousands of protein-protein interactions yet these are generally hard to predict in advance or to measure accurately with high-throughput experimental techniques. A method that allows the computational prediction of such interactions would thus be of significant impact. Second, there are many more protein sequences than protein structures so it is necessary to find ways to amplify the information in protein databases if structure is to be fully integrated in genome scale research. The proposed research is intended to bridge this gap.  A central element of the approach to be taken is the use of structural alignments to reveal novel functional relationships between proteins. Since structure is better conserved than sequence, these alignments can reveal new information. A novel structure-based method is introduced which exploits homology models and remote geometric relationships to amplify structural information. The evidence that is obtained is then combined with non-structural sources of evidence using Bayesian networks to yield a probability of whether two proteins interact. An important element in the proposed research strategy is the recognition that structural modeling on a large scale is necessarily imprecise so that it is necessary to use low resolution ""scoring functions for a given model that do not depend sensitively on atomic detail. Bayesian methods then allow the extraction of a clear signal from the underlying noise.  The biological impact of the research will be enhanced through computational/experimental applications in areas where structural clues have the potential of discovering truly novel interactions. Validated predictions on adhesion proteins, nuclear hormone receptors and cytokine signaling proteins demonstrate the efficacy of the methodology. New applications to viral host interactions and to cancer signaling pathways are described.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The health relatedness of the proposed research arises from the fact that a better understanding of protein- protein interactions opens the way to a better understanding of the biology underlying human disease. Applications to interactions involved in viral-host interactions, and in cancer-related pathways serve to highlight this aspect of the proposed research.            ",Computer Studies of Protein Structure and Function,8588329,R01GM030518,"['Adhesions', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Area', 'Bayesian Method', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Birds', 'Cell physiology', 'Chromosomes', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Conserved Sequence', 'Cytokine Signaling', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Elements', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Family', 'Family suidae', 'Funding', 'Gene Fusion', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Homology Modeling', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Indium', 'Influenza', 'Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Noise', 'Nuclear Hormone Receptors', 'Pathway interactions', 'Peptide Sequence Determination', 'Peptides', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Protein Region', 'Protein Structure Databases', 'Proteins', 'RNA Interference', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Homology', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signal Transduction Pathway', 'Signaling Protein', 'Site', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Tropism', 'Viral', 'Viral Proteins', 'Virus', 'Work', 'Yeasts', 'base', 'computer based statistical methods', 'computer infrastructure', 'computer studies', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'genome-wide', 'human disease', 'improved', 'influenzavirus', 'innovation', 'interest', 'method development', 'novel', 'programs', 'protein complex', 'protein function', 'protein protein interaction', 'protein structure', 'protein structure function', 'public health relevance', 'success', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool', 'tumor progression', 'tumorigenesis', 'virus host interaction']",NIGMS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2014,291243,0.09965866227049666

"Integrated Prediction of Protein Struture at 1D, 2D and 3D Levels    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Computational prediction of protein structure from the amino acid sequence is one of the most important and challenging problems in bioinformatics and computational biology. With the exponential growth of protein sequences without solved protein structures in the post-genomic era, accurate protein structure prediction methods and tools are in urgent need. Here, we propose to develop an integrated approach to advance protein structure prediction at the 1-dimensional (1D), 2-dimensional (2D) and 3-dimensional (3D) levels. At the 1D level, novel information such as domain evolution signals, alternative gene splicing sites, and 2D protein contact map will be used to predict protein domain boundaries from the sequences. At the 2D level, new methods such as residue contact propagation, machine learning boosting, linear programming, and Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations will be used to advance residue-residue contact prediction for a domain, or a protein. At the 3D level, 2D contact prediction, fold recognition via machine learning, and multi-template combination will be used to enhance both template-based and ab initio structure prediction. Finally, knowledge-based statistical machine learning methods and model combination algorithms will be developed to reliably evaluate and refine the quality of predicted protein structural models. One of several innovative aspects of this approach is to integrate 1D, 2D, and 3D predictions in order to improve each other through protein structural unit - domains. The 1D, 2D, and 3D protein structure prediction methods will be implemented as user-friendly software packages and web services released to the scientific community. These tools and web services will be useful for protein structure prediction, structure determination, functional analysis, protein engineering, protein mutagenesis analysis, and protein design.

"New Computational Methods for Data-driven Protein Structure Prediction    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Proteins play a central role in all biological processes. Akin to the complete sequencing of genomes, complete description of protein structures is a fundamental step towards understanding biological life, and is also highly relevant medically in the development of therapeutics and drugs. The broad, long-term goal of the project is to develop machine learning methods for data-driven protein structure prediction through two independent but complementary strategies: 1) much more accurate template-based modeling for proteins with remote homologs in the Protein Data Bank and 2) better template-free modeling method for proteins without detectable templates and for improving template-based models. The specific aims are: Aim 1) to greatly improve template-based modeling by 1a) improving protein sequence-template alignment using a regression-tree-based nonlinear scoring function, especially when good sequence profiles are unavailable; and 1b) improving fold recognition using a machine learning method to combine both residue-level and atom-level features; Aim 2) to improve protein conformation sampling in a continuous space and thus template-free modeling by three independent but complementary approaches: 2a) modeling nonlinear sequence- structure relationship using Conditional (Markov) Random Fields (CRF) models; 2b) simultaneously sampling secondary and tertiary structure; and 2c) learning structure information from template. The core of the project is to develop various CRF models for data-driven protein structure prediction, by learning protein sequence-structure relationship from existing sequence/structure databases. The product of this research includes a regression-tree-based CRF model for accurate protein alignment, especially for proteins without close homologs in the PDB or without very good sequence profiles; a SVM model for protein fold recognition; a few CRF models for efficient protein conformation sampling in a continuous space; and a complete protein structure prediction software package. Also, it will produce a web server publicly available for various academic and biomedical users. Protein structure prediction will lead to a broad range of biomedical applications, such as the development of novel diagnostics, better understanding of disease processes and improved preventive therapies leading to reduced health care costs.

"Refinement Methods for Protein Docking based on Exploring Multi-Dimensional Energ DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): All successful state-of-the-art protein docking methods employ a so called multistage approach. At the first stage of such approaches a rough energy potential is used to score billions of conformations. At a second stage, thousands of conformations with the best scores are retained and clustered based on a certain similarity metric. Cluster centers correspond to putative predictions/models. Recent work by the proposing team demonstrated that greater prediction quality can be achieved by properly exploring these clusters through a process called refinement. This work resulted in the development of a prototype refinement approach - the Semi-Definite programming-based Underestimation method (SDU). The central goal of the project is to build on the SDU success and develop a new high-throughput refinement protocol able to produce predictions of near-crystallographic quality in the most computationally efficient manner. Efficiency will be achieved by leveraging the funnel-like shape that binding free energy potentials exhibit. The specific aims are: (1) the development of a new clustering method that can classify the conformations retained from a first-stage method into clusters suitable for the proposed refinement strategy; (2) the characterization of the structure of the multi-dimensional funnel corresponding to each cluster and the development of an efficient refinement strategy to explore this funnel; (3) the development of a side-chain positioning algorithm appropriate for docking by leveraging Markov random field theory; and (4) the dissemination of the algorithms developed through the release to the research community of a software package and an automated refinement server. It is anticipated that the computational efficiency gains of the proposed refinement protocol over alternative Monte Carlo methods will exceed two orders of magnitude, while, at the same time, significantly improve upon the accuracy achieved by earlier refinement approaches. A novelty of the proposed work is in its use of sophisticated machinery from the fields of optimization and decision theory specially tailored to the biophysical properties of the docking problem. Techniques from convex and combinatorial optimization, machine learning, and Markov random fields are brought to bear on the refinement stage of multistage protein docking approaches. An important element of the work is the systematic characterization of multi-dimensional binding energy funnels. The existence of such funnels has been long conjectured but it has not led to new docking approaches so far. The proposed algorithms essentially achieve this goal by devising efficient strategies to identify, characterize, and explore these funnels. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This work will substantially improve upon computational methods for characterizing and predicting protein- protein interactions.

"Very large datasets and new models to predict and design protein interactions PROJECT SUMMARY  Specific protein-protein interactions are responsible for organizing the cell, for processing biological signals and information, and for the chemistry of life. Thus, understanding biological mechanism relies on understanding the interactions that occur between proteins. An important long-term goal is to develop methods for reliably predicting and rationally modifying protein-protein interactions. Such capabilities would  provide insight into the molecular details of pathology and highlight opportunities for disease treatment. This proposal describes an integrated experimental/computational technology platform that will provide predictive models of protein interaction specificity. The experimental component involves constructing randomized libraries of proteins or peptides that will be sorted according to their affinities for binding a particular  receptor. The identities and binding affinities for very large numbers of library members will be decoded using high-throughput sequencing methods. The data, consisting of up to 107 {sequence, affinity} pairs per sequencing run, will be used as input to computational machine learning methods. Models will be generated that capture the relationship between sequence and interactions, and the predictive power of these models  will be tested experimentally. The work described in this proposal emphasizes technology development and application of the new platform to study two general types of protein complexes. First are interactions of short helical ligands with mid-sized globular proteins, here studied using anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and Ca2+- binding EF-hand proteins. Second are interactions of short linear peptides with modular interaction  domains, here PDZ and SH3 domains. These four protein families mediate an enormous number of important molecular recognition events in human cells, and the resulting models will provide valuable support to study of their biological functions. This work will also provide a stringent test of the capabilities of the proposed technology, which can then be applied to a much wider variety of molecular complexes, e.g., protein-protein, protein-small molecule and protein-nucleic acid assemblies. Given the paucity of high-  throughput methods for accurately measuring protein-protein interactions, and the primitive capabilities of most computational models for predicting protein binding, the proposed technology platform has the potential to dramatically transform the study of protein interaction specificity. Relevance  Specific protein-protein interactions underlie all biological processes. Knowledge of interactions that occur in healthy vs. diseased tissues, coupled with methods for inhibiting such interactions, would dramatically expand opportunities to treat human disease.

"Discovery of Mental Health and Inflammation (MHAIN) Interactome    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Knowledge of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) is necessary to understand system-level aspects of organisms including that of psychiatric processes. The PPI network (interactome) acts as a vehicle for several types of biomedical research. It can be used to understand the disease mechanisms, drug targets and side effects, and genetic causes for disease. There are 1,014 human genes associated with 'brain'; for 448 of these genes not even a single PPI is known today. While it is useful to discover which pairs of proteins interact, it is also exceptionally challenging as more than 99.9% of protein pairs do not interact. The objective of this work is to carry out systematically designed computational work to discover the human mental health and inflammation (MHAIN) interactome. The MHAIN interactome refers to the network of PPIs where at least one of the two proteins is involved in either brain or inflammation. Many challenges will be addressed in discovering new protein-protein interactions towards building the interactome. Well-established algorithms from diverse computational fields, such as machine learning and signal processing will be applied to achieve the proposed goals. Further, pathways of influence of neuropsychological processes and inflammatory processes on each other will be mined from the interactome. Selected interactions will be validated by wet-lab experiments. The approaches that will be employed for predicting the MHAIN interactome are proactive-learning (to obtain the labels and features of proteins that would provide the maximum impact), transfer-learning (to transfer the knowledge of protein features and interactions from one species to another), multi-sensor fusion (to intelligently integrate output from different predictors). The predicted interactome would accelerate discovery of the biology and treatment of mental health related diseases, by serving as a central resource for biomedical research on mental health. For every protein of interest, verifiable hypothesis of its interactions will be generated that reduce the search space of interactions of that protein from about 25,000 to a few possibilities. New PPIs of proteins involved in major depressive disorder, psychosis in patients with Alzherimer's disease, and systemic inflammation (which is intricately connected to psychiatric diseases), will be put in biomedical context by co- investigators who specialize in these areas. The interactome will identify ""hub-proteins"" that are central to many pathways. It will provide hypothesis of ""functional connectivity"" of new proteins (namely, those of which nothing is currently known). Further, many diseases are found to be untreatable by suppressing a single pathway, and often require manipulating multiple pathways, and the MHAIN interactome can provide the overlap points of multiple pathways that may be used for treatment of diseases. The MHAIN interactome, which would be the outcome of the proposed research, can thus have a broad impact on our understanding of molecular basis of mental health. 1        The proposed research discovers interactions among proteins that are involved in mental health and inflammation. The knowledge of such interactions would generate hypotheses about the role of these proteins in biological functional pathways and would contribute towards the understanding of the biology of diseases and towards development of mechanisms of treatment.

"Reversible protein acetylation and sirtuin function    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over the last several years, accumulating evidence suggests that reversible acetylation may be a major regulatory mechanism for controlling protein function. Recent proteomic investigations have cataloged the existence of hundreds of acetylated proteins, implicating a potential regulatory role for nearly all facets of cellular biochemistry. Interestingly, metabolic enzymes constitute the largest portion of acetylated proteins. Only in a handful of examples has the functional significance of protein acetylation been revealed. Thus, there is tremendous need to determine the regulatory functions of protein acetylation, both at the level of physiological outcomes and at the level of molecular mechanism. This proposal directly investigates the central hypothesis that reversible acetylation is a major regulatory mechanism for controlling protein function. To accomplish these goals, we will investigate the biochemical and biological functions of sirtuins, NAD+dependent protein deacetylases, which are implicated in genome maintenance, metabolism, cell survival, and lifespan. The specific aims are focused on demonstrating a direct regulatory role for sirtuins in several major metabolic processes, and elucidating how site-specific acetylation affects enzyme function. Employing mechanistic enzymology, quantitative mass spectrometry, novel high-throughput assays, metabolic pathway analysis, structural biology, enzyme regulation, cell culture models, and mouse genetics, these studies will provide the first comprehensive understanding of the functional significance of reversible protein acetylation. The results have the potential to uncover the prominence of a previously-unknown regulatory mechanism and to transform how we understand metabolic and aged-related diseases.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: New evidence suggests that a previously-unknown form of cellular and metabolic regulation exits. This proposal seeks to investigate the functional importance of this regulatory mechanism and the role played by a group of enzymes that are implicated in genome maintenance, metabolism, cell survival, and lifespan. The results have the potential to the transform how we understand metabolic and aged-related diseases, and to generate novel therapeutic opportunities.

"Multiscale modeling of G protein-coupled receptors    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are the largest family in the mammalian genome, and are critical to a number of cell signaling processes. As a result, they are of enormous biomedical importance; by some estimates, as many as 50% of new pharmaceuticals target GPCRs. Unsurprisingly, there has been a huge research investment in understanding their biophysics. However, integral membrane proteins are challenging to work with experimentally, leaving an opportunity for computational methods to make a significant contribution. We will use multiscale modeling techniques, including all-atom molecular dynamics simulations and elastic network models, to explore the behavior of several GPCRs, including rhodopsin (and its retinal-free form, opsin) and the ¿2-adrenergic receptor (B2AR). Specifically, we will investigate the role of ligand binding in modulating GPCR function, via two separate all-atom molecular dynamics calculations. Microsecond-scale simulations of opsin will, when contrasted with our previous work on rhodopsin in the dark state and during the early stages of activation, allow us to see which interactions in rhodopsin are determined by the presence of the ligand, while the planned simulations of the full activation process will give the first atomic-level view of the structural changes involved in GPCR activation; this knowledge could be critical to the design of novel inhibitors to other GPCRs. The second goal of this proposal is to clarify the role of internal waters in the activation mechanism of GPCRs; our previous simulations described significant increases in the internal hydration of rhodopsin and B2AR. Here, we propose to pursue those observations more rigorously, using automatic pattern recognition methods to correlate hydration changes with functionally interesting protein motions in simulations of rhodopsin, B2AR, and the cannabinoid-2 receptor (CB2). The third goal of the proposal is to develop elastic network models - a simple, computationally inexpensive approach where the protein's interactions are represented as a network of springs - in order to explore larger scale problems not readily amenable to all-atom molecular dynamics, like the modulation of protein motions by G protein binding and GPCR oligomerization. A number of possible network model implementations will be considered, and the models will be carefully validated by quantitative comparison to extensive molecular dynamics simulations, including those proposed for the first aim. The fourth and final goal of the proposal is to assess the validity of a common assumption, that rhodopsin is a good template for understanding GPCR activation in general. To test this hypothesis we will apply multiple computational methods, including long timescale molecular dynamics and elastic network models, to a series of GPCRs, including rhodopsin, opsin, B2AR, and CB2. We will quantitatively correlate the fluctuations of the different GPCRs, with the hypothesis that motions conserved across multiple GPCRs are likely to be functionally significant.        G protein-coupled receptors are the largest family of proteins in the human genome, and are the most targeted proteins for therapeutics development. We will use multiscale modeling methods to connect their structure and dynamics to function, in order to aid in the design and refinement of novel drugs.

"Structure based prediction of the interactome     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Molecular interactions play a central role in all biological processes. Akin to the complete sequencing of genomes, complete descriptions of interactomes is a fundamental step towards a deeper understanding of biological processes, and has a vast potential to impact systems biology, genomics, molecular biology and therapeutics. Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) and protein-RNA interactions (PRIs) are of particular interest as they are critical in maintenance of cellular integrity, metabolism, transcription/translation, and cell-cell communication. Although high-throughput experimental PPI and PRI data is rapidly accumulating, building complete and confident datasets requires multiple replicates of expensive screens. This proposal aims to develop new methods that will significantly advance our efforts at structure-based approaches to better predict PPIs and RPIs and boost confidence in emerging high-throughput (HTP) data with the goal of comprehensive interactome mapping at lower cost. Taken together, these methods will vastly expand our understanding of macromolecular networks. We will continue to devise structure-based methods for protein-protein interaction prediction and branch out to methods for protein-RNA interaction prediction; this represents a major shift from the purely sequence-based approaches that most bioinformatics approaches utilize to predict  We will also build computational frameworks for boosting confidence in HTP protein-protein and protein-RNA interaction datasets using structure-based approaches; these frameworks will provide a comprehensive assessment of in-house and public HTP data, with potential biomedical applications such as heat shock protein-kinase interactions related to development for cancer therapeutics, MAPK6's role in a cancer-related signaling network, and (long non-coding) RNA-protein binding roles in neurodegenerative disease. Finally, we will computationally screen for PPIs and PRIs at the genome scale and expand our Struct2Net webserver to disseminate tools based on our methods and results to the community. An increasing number of HTP interaction datasets are being determined, thus presenting new opportunities to leverage this data in conjunction with structural insights to map binding sites and to uncover the underlying molecular mechanisms of cellular functions. molecular interactions and will enhance coverage and accuracy of the complete interactome. Successful completion of these aims will result in computational methods that will significantly increase our confidence in high-throughput data on protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions and will reveal fundamental aspects of their functioning, as well as testable hypotheses for experimental investigations. All developed software will be made publicly available.          Biological processes are carried out through thousands of interactions between various types of molecules (the Interactome) that play fundamental roles in all biomedical processes including the maintenance of cellular integrity, metabolism, transcription/translation, and cell-cell communication. Understanding these interaction networks on a large scale will empower both rational, targeted drug design and more intelligent disease management. In this project, we develop computational methods for structure-based prediction of protein-protein and protein- RNA interactions, and integrate these predictions with available high-throughput genomic data to predict the Interactomes of entire species' genomes.

"Analysis of force developed by a AAA ATPase    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The AAA ATPases family includes molecules whose roles include, but are far from limited to, biogenesis of mitochondria and multivesicular bodies, proteins in involved in gene regulation and protein transport. This project will focus on studying the activity of these machines at the single molecule level. The model protein will be ClpX - it is the part of the proteosome, a key effect of protein degradation that unfolds the proteins to prepare them for degradation. . Cellular proteins differ widely in their liability, from half-lives of minutes to days. Regulated degradation, by allowing rapid changes in the levels of cellular proteins, helps control signal transduction pathways, the cell- cycle, transcription, apoptosis, antigen processing, biological clock control, differentiation and surface receptor desensitization. The questions to be addressed are: How is work partitioned between alternative outcomes? What is the maximum work that can be performed by the system? What factors limit its efficiency in performing work? These questions have health implications: human pathological conditions are associated with failures of the degradation system and its regulation offers the potential for therapeutic intervention. Furthermore, an inhibitor of proteasome catalytic activity is in use for treatment of recurrent multiple myeloma, and proteasome inhibitors are in clinical trial for treatment of a broad spectrum of human malignancies. Thus, understanding the regulation of the half-life of proteins should provide critical insights into cell physiology and pathology. The mishandling of aberrant proteins incurs penalties throughout biology: the survival of bacteria subjected to stress depends on the effective performance of systems which deal with misfolded and structurally aberrant proteins- to either fold them properly or destroy them. The specific questions to be addressed are: How hard can the device pull to cause unfolding? How many pulls are needed to commit irreversibly? What is the limit of pulling power, and the statistical distribution of pulling power? Answers to these questions will begin to reveal not just what these machines do but the decision tree that describes how outcomes are controlled and when machine capacity may be exceeded. We want to know not just how the machine works, but how its decision tree yields alternative outcomes.        The AAA ATPases family includes molecules whose roles include, but are far from limited to, biogenesis of mitochondria and multivesicular bodies, proteins in involved in gene regulation and protein transport. The model will be a protein involved in degrading other proteins.

"Computer Studies of Protein Structure and Function     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The research described in the current proposal has the long-range goals of enabling the prediction of protein-protein interactions and the application of this knowledge to problems of biomedical relevance. An additional long-term goal is the fuller integration of Structural and Systems Biology. Specific Aims include: a) The development of three-dimensional structure-based methods to predict, on a genome-wide scale, whether and how two proteins interact. b) The integration of structural information with other sources of evidence as to protein-protein interactions. c) The application of the methods being developed to important biomedical problems. These research goals are motivated by a number of factors. First, cellular function is mediated by tens or even hundreds of thousands of protein-protein interactions yet these are generally hard to predict in advance or to measure accurately with high-throughput experimental techniques. A method that allows the computational prediction of such interactions would thus be of significant impact. Second, there are many more protein sequences than protein structures so it is necessary to find ways to amplify the information in protein databases if structure is to be fully integrated in genome scale research. The proposed research is intended to bridge this gap.  A central element of the approach to be taken is the use of structural alignments to reveal novel functional relationships between proteins. Since structure is better conserved than sequence, these alignments can reveal new information. A novel structure-based method is introduced which exploits homology models and remote geometric relationships to amplify structural information. The evidence that is obtained is then combined with non-structural sources of evidence using Bayesian networks to yield a probability of whether two proteins interact. An important element in the proposed research strategy is the recognition that structural modeling on a large scale is necessarily imprecise so that it is necessary to use low resolution ""scoring functions for a given model that do not depend sensitively on atomic detail. Bayesian methods then allow the extraction of a clear signal from the underlying noise.  The biological impact of the research will be enhanced through computational/experimental applications in areas where structural clues have the potential of discovering truly novel interactions. Validated predictions on adhesion proteins, nuclear hormone receptors and cytokine signaling proteins demonstrate the efficacy of the methodology. New applications to viral host interactions and to cancer signaling pathways are described.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The health relatedness of the proposed research arises from the fact that a better understanding of protein- protein interactions opens the way to a better understanding of the biology underlying human disease. Applications to interactions involved in viral-host interactions, and in cancer-related pathways serve to highlight this aspect of the proposed research.            ",Computer Studies of Protein Structure and Function,8437358,R01GM030518,"['Adhesions', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Area', 'Bayesian Method', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Birds', 'Cell physiology', 'Chromosomes', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Conserved Sequence', 'Cytokine Signaling', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Elements', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Family', 'Family suidae', 'Funding', 'Fungal Genome', 'Gene Fusion', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Homology Modeling', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Indium', 'Influenza', 'Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Noise', 'Nuclear Hormone Receptors', 'Pathway interactions', 'Peptide Sequence Determination', 'Peptides', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Protein Region', 'Protein Structure Databases', 'Proteins', 'RNA Interference', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Homology', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signal Transduction Pathway', 'Signaling Protein', 'Site', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Tropism', 'Viral', 'Viral Proteins', 'Virus', 'Work', 'base', 'computer based statistical methods', 'computer infrastructure', 'computer studies', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'genome-wide', 'human disease', 'improved', 'influenzavirus', 'innovation', 'interest', 'method development', 'novel', 'programs', 'protein complex', 'protein function', 'protein protein interaction', 'protein structure', 'protein structure function', 'public health relevance', 'success', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool', 'tumor progression', 'tumorigenesis', 'virus host interaction']",NIGMS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2013,290550,0.09965866227049666
"Integrated Prediction of Protein Struture at 1D, 2D and 3D Levels    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Computational prediction of protein structure from the amino acid sequence is one of the most important and challenging problems in bioinformatics and computational biology. With the exponential growth of protein sequences without solved protein structures in the post-genomic era, accurate protein structure prediction methods and tools are in urgent need. Here, we propose to develop an integrated approach to advance protein structure prediction at the 1-dimensional (1D), 2-dimensional (2D) and 3-dimensional (3D) levels. At the 1D level, novel information such as domain evolution signals, alternative gene splicing sites, and 2D protein contact map will be used to predict protein domain boundaries from the sequences. At the 2D level, new methods such as residue contact propagation, machine learning boosting, linear programming, and Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations will be used to advance residue-residue contact prediction for a domain, or a protein. At the 3D level, 2D contact prediction, fold recognition via machine learning, and multi-template combination will be used to enhance both template-based and ab initio structure prediction. Finally, knowledge-based statistical machine learning methods and model combination algorithms will be developed to reliably evaluate and refine the quality of predicted protein structural models. One of several innovative aspects of this approach is to integrate 1D, 2D, and 3D predictions in order to improve each other through protein structural unit - domains. The 1D, 2D, and 3D protein structure prediction methods will be implemented as user-friendly software packages and web services released to the scientific community.

"New Computational Methods for Data-driven Protein Structure Prediction    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Proteins play a central role in all biological processes. Akin to the complete sequencing of genomes, complete description of protein structures is a fundamental step towards understanding biological life, and is also highly relevant medically in the development of therapeutics and drugs. The broad, long-term goal of the project is to develop machine learning methods for data-driven protein structure prediction through two independent but complementary strategies: 1) much more accurate template-based modeling for proteins with remote homologs in the Protein Data Bank and 2) better template-free modeling method for proteins without detectable templates and for improving template-based models. The specific aims are: Aim 1) to greatly improve template-based modeling by 1a) improving protein sequence-template alignment using a regression-tree-based nonlinear scoring function, especially when good sequence profiles are unavailable; and 1b) improving fold recognition using a machine learning method to combine both residue-level and atom-level features; Aim 2) to improve protein conformation sampling in a continuous space and thus template-free modeling by three independent but complementary approaches: 2a) modeling nonlinear sequence- structure relationship using Conditional (Markov) Random Fields (CRF) models; 2b) simultaneously sampling secondary and tertiary structure; and 2c) learning structure information from template. The core of the project is to develop various CRF models for data-driven protein structure prediction, by learning protein sequence-structure relationship from existing sequence/structure databases. The product of this research includes a regression-tree-based CRF model for accurate protein alignment, especially for proteins without close homologs in the PDB or without very good sequence profiles; a SVM model for protein fold recognition; a few CRF models for efficient protein conformation sampling in a continuous space; and a complete protein structure prediction software package. Also, it will produce a web server publicly available for various academic and biomedical users. Protein structure prediction will lead to a broad range of biomedical applications, such as the development of novel diagnostics, better understanding of disease processes and improved preventive therapies leading to reduced health care costs. Protein modeling is also widely applied in the pharmaceutical industry and integrated into most stages of pharmaceutical research.

"Refinement Methods for Protein Docking based on Exploring Multi-Dimensional Energ DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): All successful state-of-the-art protein docking methods employ a so called multistage approach. At the first stage of such approaches a rough energy potential is used to score billions of conformations. At a second stage, thousands of conformations with the best scores are retained and clustered based on a certain similarity metric. Cluster centers correspond to putative predictions/models. Recent work by the proposing team demonstrated that greater prediction quality can be achieved by properly exploring these clusters through a process called refinement. This work resulted in the development of a prototype refinement approach - the Semi-Definite programming-based Underestimation method (SDU). The central goal of the project is to build on the SDU success and develop a new high-throughput refinement protocol able to produce predictions of near-crystallographic quality in the most computationally efficient manner. Efficiency will be achieved by leveraging the funnel-like shape that binding free energy potentials exhibit. The specific aims are: (1) the development of a new clustering method that can classify the conformations retained from a first-stage method into clusters suitable for the proposed refinement strategy; (2) the characterization of the structure of the multi-dimensional funnel corresponding to each cluster and the development of an efficient refinement strategy to explore this funnel; (3) the development of a side-chain positioning algorithm appropriate for docking by leveraging Markov random field theory; and (4) the dissemination of the algorithms developed through the release to the research community of a software package and an automated refinement server. It is anticipated that the computational efficiency gains of the proposed refinement protocol over alternative Monte Carlo methods will exceed two orders of magnitude, while, at the same time, significantly improve upon the accuracy achieved by earlier refinement approaches. A novelty of the proposed work is in its use of sophisticated machinery from the fields of optimization and decision theory specially tailored to the biophysical properties of the docking problem. Techniques from convex and combinatorial optimization, machine learning, and Markov random fields are brought to bear on the refinement stage of multistage protein docking approaches. An important element of the work is the systematic characterization of multi-dimensional binding energy funnels. The existence of such funnels has been long conjectured but it has not led to new docking approaches so far. The proposed algorithms essentially achieve this goal by devising efficient strategies to identify, characterize, and explore these funnels. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This work will substantially improve upon computational methods for characterizing and predicting protein- protein interactions. It will enable treating relatively weak protein complexes involving larger proteins than what is possible today. This will result in a better understanding of processes such as metabolic control, immune response, signal transduction, and gene regulation.",Refinement Methods for Protein Docking based on Exploring Multi-Dimensional Energ,8240452,R01GM093147,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Decision Theory', 'Development', 'Dill', 'Dimensions', 'Discrimination', 'Docking', 'Electrostatics', 'Elements', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Fourier Transform', 'Free Energy', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Immune response', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Ligands', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Metabolic Control', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Motion', 'Motivation', 'Movement', 'National Institute of General Medical Sciences', 'Paper', 'Pathway interactions', 'Plant Roots', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Potential Energy', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Published Comment', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rotation', 'Sampling', 'Scoring Method', 'Screening procedure', 'Shapes', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Simulate', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Transduction Gene', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Ursidae Family', 'Vertebral column', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'combinatorial', 'cost', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'interest', 'programs', 'protein complex', 'protein folding', 'protein protein interaction', 'prototype', 'receptor', 'research study', 'success', 'theories']",NIGMS,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),R01,2012,308407,0.06918191158801695
"Discovery of Mental Health and Inflammation (MHAIN) Interactome    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Knowledge of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) is necessary to understand system-level aspects of organisms including that of psychiatric processes. The PPI network (interactome) acts as a vehicle for several types of biomedical research. It can be used to understand the disease mechanisms, drug targets and side effects, and genetic causes for disease. There are 1,014 human genes associated with 'brain'; for 448 of these genes not even a single PPI is known today. While it is useful to discover which pairs of proteins interact, it is also exceptionally challenging as more than 99.9% of protein pairs do not interact. The objective of this work is to carry out systematically designed computational work to discover the human mental health and inflammation (MHAIN) interactome. The MHAIN interactome refers to the network of PPIs where at least one of the two proteins is involved in either brain or inflammation. Many challenges will be addressed in discovering new protein-protein interactions towards building the interactome. Well-established algorithms from diverse computational fields, such as machine learning and signal processing will be applied to achieve the proposed goals. Further, pathways of influence of neuropsychological processes and inflammatory processes on each other will be mined from the interactome. Selected interactions will be validated by wet-lab experiments. The approaches that will be employed for predicting the MHAIN interactome are proactive-learning (to obtain the labels and features of proteins that would provide the maximum impact), transfer-learning (to transfer the knowledge of protein features and interactions from one species to another), multi-sensor fusion (to intelligently integrate output from different predictors). The predicted interactome would accelerate discovery of the biology and treatment of mental health related diseases, by serving as a central resource for biomedical research on mental health. For every protein of interest, verifiable hypothesis of its interactions will be generated that reduce the search space of interactions of that protein from about 25,000 to a few possibilities. New PPIs of proteins involved in major depressive disorder, psychosis in patients with Alzherimer's disease, and systemic inflammation (which is intricately connected to psychiatric diseases), will be put in biomedical context by co- investigators who specialize in these areas. The interactome will identify ""hub-proteins"" that are central to many pathways. It will provide hypothesis of ""functional connectivity"" of new proteins (namely, those of which nothing is currently known). Further, many diseases are found to be untreatable by suppressing a single pathway, and often require manipulating multiple pathways, and the MHAIN interactome can provide the overlap points of multiple pathways that may be used for treatment of diseases. The MHAIN interactome, which would be the outcome of the proposed research, can thus have a broad impact on our understanding of molecular basis of mental health. 1        The proposed research discovers interactions among proteins that are involved in mental health and inflammation. The knowledge of such interactions would generate hypotheses about the role of these proteins in biological functional pathways and would contribute towards the understanding of the biology of diseases and towards development of mechanisms of treatment.

"Protein Design Using Physical Scoring Functions integrated with Site Couplings    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tremendous progress has been made in computational protein design in the last 10 years. Though most work has focused on redesign of existing proteins to enhance their stability, specificity or new functionality, successful designs of novel protein folds (not naturally occurring) have emerged. However, to make protein design useful in practical applications, many challenges still exist in the design of protein-protein and protein- DNA interface and the design of dynamic properties of proteins, etc. To conquer those challenges, a practical solution is to develop more accurate scoring functions. It has been proved both experimentally and theoretically that intra and intermolecular signaling between distant sites within one or among many proteins plays a significant role in many biological processes, such as signal transmission and allosteric regulation, etc. The main research goal of this R21 grant is to develop new algorithms and strategies to incorporate the site-site couplings into a protein design procedure. Specifically, in Aim 1, we propose to study the site-site couplings and cooperative interactions of a protein or protein system using both the sequence-based and the physics-based approaches. Critical assessment of the existing approaches will be conducted and a novel algorithm will be developed using the residue-residue interaction energies. In Aim 2, the best methods for site-site couplings prediction will be tailored and integrated to physical scoring functions of protein design. To guarantee the success of this research grant, we propose four schemes to incorporate/combine the site-site coupling into a protein design procedure. The first two schemes represent simple combinations of sequence-based and physics-based protein design approaches; on the other hand, the next two schemes represent a more advanced integration of site-site correlations and physical scoring functions. In the last protocol, we propose to develop a novel scheme and software package to conduct protein design using the residue-residue interaction energies as a template. This approach, which is referred to as correlation embedding (CE), is based on a hypothesis that the correlation information is intrinsically encoded in the interaction energy matrix. The success of this sub-aim will have a great impact on rational protein design, as it represents a perfect integration of site-site couplings into a physical scoring function and opens a new avenue to conduct protein design. All the designed promising PDZ proteins will be synthesized and tested in both folding and functional assays.        Protein Design Using Physical Scoring Functions integrated with Site Couplings In this proposal, we intend to develop novel approaches to conquer the challenges in protein design. The new protein design strategies can facilitate us to engineer dynamical controls into a novel protein so that it can undertake a dynamic function. The novel approaches could be used to develop more effective biomedicine.

"Protein recognition for modular domains    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Protein is essential for almost every biological process and the interaction between proteins and their interacting partners play critical roles in the functioning cells. Since mutations that disrupt the protein-protein interactions result in many diseases, it is important to understand the biochemical mechanisms of protein recognition, which is important for deciphering protein interaction network and designing potent drugs with high specificity against protein targets. Our long term goal is to develop theoretical models for describing protein binding specificity and reliably predict protein-protein interactions. In the proposed project, we have the following specific aims. Aim 1, we will develop a computational method that combines computer modeling and bioinformatics analysis to characterize the interaction interface between modular domains and their peptide ligands. We will test this method on several modular domains including SH3, SH2 and PDZ domains that bind to specific peptide sequences. Aim 2, we will systematically predict interacting peptides in the yeast genome of all yeast SH3 domains. Aim 3, we will experimentally validate the predictions in vitro to assess the performance of the computational method. We will also conduct in vivo experiments to examine the biological significance of a set of selected domain-peptide interactions.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Protein-protein interactions play critical roles in the cell and mutations that disrupt these interactions result in many diseases.

As a result, they are of enormous biomedical importance; by some estimates, as many as 50% of new pharmaceuticals target GPCRs. Unsurprisingly, there has been a huge research investment in understanding their biophysics. However, integral membrane proteins are challenging to work with experimentally, leaving an opportunity for computational methods to make a significant contribution. We will use multiscale modeling techniques, including all-atom molecular dynamics simulations and elastic network models, to explore the behavior of several GPCRs, including rhodopsin (and its retinal-free form, opsin) and the ¿2-adrenergic receptor (B2AR). Specifically, we will investigate the role of ligand binding in modulating GPCR function, via two separate all-atom molecular dynamics calculations. Microsecond-scale simulations of opsin will, when contrasted with our previous work on rhodopsin in the dark state and during the early stages of activation, allow us to see which interactions in rhodopsin are determined by the presence of the ligand, while the planned simulations of the full activation process will give the first atomic-level view of the structural changes involved in GPCR activation; this knowledge could be critical to the design of novel inhibitors to other GPCRs. The second goal of this proposal is to clarify the role of internal waters in the activation mechanism of GPCRs; our previous simulations described significant increases in the internal hydration of rhodopsin and B2AR. Here, we propose to pursue those observations more rigorously, using automatic pattern recognition methods to correlate hydration changes with functionally interesting protein motions in simulations of rhodopsin, B2AR, and the cannabinoid-2 receptor (CB2). The third goal of the proposal is to develop elastic network models - a simple, computationally inexpensive approach where the protein's interactions are represented as a network of springs - in order to explore larger scale problems not readily amenable to all-atom molecular dynamics, like the modulation of protein motions by G protein binding and GPCR oligomerization. A number of possible network model implementations will be considered, and the models will be carefully validated by quantitative comparison to extensive molecular dynamics simulations, including those proposed for the first aim. The fourth and final goal of the proposal is to assess the validity of a common assumption, that rhodopsin is a good template for understanding GPCR activation in general. To test this hypothesis we will apply multiple computational methods, including long timescale molecular dynamics and elastic network models, to a series of GPCRs, including rhodopsin, opsin, B2AR, and CB2. We will quantitatively correlate the fluctuations of the different GPCRs, with the hypothesis that motions conserved across multiple GPCRs are likely to be functionally significant.        G protein-coupled receptors are the largest family of proteins in the human genome, and are the most targeted proteins for therapeutics development. We will use multiscale modeling methods to connect their structure and dynamics to function, in order to aid in the design and refinement of novel drugs.

"Computer Studies of Protein Structure and Function    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goals of the proposed research include: a) The development of methods and associated computational tools that use three-dimensional structural information to predict protein function. b) The development of methods for the integration of structural information in the generation of networks of protein- protein interactions (interactomes). c) The application of structural information in the creation of an interactome of human and tumor B-cells and the use of this network in applications to B-cell Biology. These research goals are motivated by a number of factors. First, there is a general sense that structural information, as provided for example by the Protein Structure Initiative (PSI) is not fully exploited by the wider biological community. An interactive function prediction server is being developed with this issue in mind. Second, Structural Biology has not been fully integrated into Systems Biology approaches to predict protein networks and it would be extremely valuable to try to increase the integration of the two fields. Third, human B-cell phenomena are of great biological and medical interest and there is an exciting opportunity to incorporate structural information into this field in a novel way. A central element of the approach to be taken is the use of structural alignments to reveal novel functional relationships between proteins that have been classified as belonging to different protein ""folds"". Evidence is provided that there is a wealth of functional information in such remote relationships and computational tools to mine and visualize this information will be developed. The research design also includes the description of a novel approach to use structural alignments to identify potential protein-protein ligand, protein-protein and protein-DNA binding partners and to identify interfacial residues in the complexes they form. A novel scoring scheme for protein-protein interactions will be developed and a database of potential complexes, designed originally for human proteins, will be constructed. The database will also identify complexes that are unlikely to form. The information in this database will be incorporated into a Baysian inference scheme and used in the construction of a ""structure-enabled"" B-cell Interactome.

"Structure based prediction of the interactome     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Molecular interactions play a central role in all biological processes. Akin to the complete sequencing of genomes, complete descriptions of interactomes is a fundamental step towards a deeper understanding of biological processes, and has a vast potential to impact systems biology, genomics, molecular biology and therapeutics. Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) and protein-RNA interactions (PRIs) are of particular interest as they are critical in maintenance of cellular integrity, metabolism, transcription/translation, and cell-cell communication. Although high-throughput experimental PPI and PRI data is rapidly accumulating, building complete and confident datasets requires multiple replicates of expensive screens. This proposal aims to develop new methods that will significantly advance our efforts at structure-based approaches to better predict PPIs and RPIs and boost confidence in emerging high-throughput (HTP) data with the goal of comprehensive interactome mapping at lower cost. Taken together, these methods will vastly expand our understanding of macromolecular networks. We will continue to devise structure-based methods for protein-protein interaction prediction and branch out to methods for protein-RNA interaction prediction; this represents a major shift from the purely sequence-based approaches that most bioinformatics approaches utilize to predict  We will also build computational frameworks for boosting confidence in HTP protein-protein and protein-RNA interaction datasets using structure-based approaches; these frameworks will provide a comprehensive assessment of in-house and public HTP data, with potential biomedical applications such as heat shock protein-kinase interactions related to development for cancer therapeutics, MAPK6's role in a cancer-related signaling network, and (long non-coding) RNA-protein binding roles in neurodegenerative disease. Finally, we will computationally screen for PPIs and PRIs at the genome scale and expand our Struct2Net webserver to disseminate tools based on our methods and results to the community. An increasing number of HTP interaction datasets are being determined, thus presenting new opportunities to leverage this data in conjunction with structural insights to map binding sites and to uncover the underlying molecular mechanisms of cellular functions. molecular interactions and will enhance coverage and accuracy of the complete interactome. Successful completion of these aims will result in computational methods that will significantly increase our confidence in high-throughput data on protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions and will reveal fundamental aspects of their functioning, as well as testable hypotheses for experimental investigations. All developed software will be made publicly available.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Biological processes are carried out through thousands of interactions between various types of molecules (the Interactome) that play fundamental roles in all biomedical processes including the maintenance of cellular integrity, metabolism, transcription/translation, and cell-cell communication. Understanding these interaction networks on a large scale will empower both rational, targeted drug design and more intelligent disease management.

"Analysis of force developed by a AAA ATPase    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The AAA ATPases family includes molecules whose roles include, but are far from limited to, biogenesis of mitochondria and multivesicular bodies, proteins in involved in gene regulation and protein transport. This project will focus on studying the activity of these machines at the single molecule level. The model protein will be ClpX - it is the part of the proteosome, a key effect of protein degradation that unfolds the proteins to prepare them for degradation. . Cellular proteins differ widely in their liability, from half-lives of minutes to days. Regulated degradation, by allowing rapid changes in the levels of cellular proteins, helps control signal transduction pathways, the cell- cycle, transcription, apoptosis, antigen processing, biological clock control, differentiation and surface receptor desensitization. The questions to be addressed are: How is work partitioned between alternative outcomes? What is the maximum work that can be performed by the system? What factors limit its efficiency in performing work? These questions have health implications: human pathological conditions are associated with failures of the degradation system and its regulation offers the potential for therapeutic intervention. Furthermore, an inhibitor of proteasome catalytic activity is in use for treatment of recurrent multiple myeloma, and proteasome inhibitors are in clinical trial for treatment of a broad spectrum of human malignancies. Thus, understanding the regulation of the half-life of proteins should provide critical insights into cell physiology and pathology. The mishandling of aberrant proteins incurs penalties throughout biology: the survival of bacteria subjected to stress depends on the effective performance of systems which deal with misfolded and structurally aberrant proteins- to either fold them properly or destroy them. The specific questions to be addressed are: How hard can the device pull to cause unfolding? How many pulls are needed to commit irreversibly? What is the limit of pulling power, and the statistical distribution of pulling power? Answers to these questions will begin to reveal not just what these machines do but the decision tree that describes how outcomes are controlled and when machine capacity may be exceeded. We want to know not just how the machine works, but how its decision tree yields alternative outcomes.        The AAA ATPases family includes molecules whose roles include, but are far from limited to, biogenesis of mitochondria and multivesicular bodies, proteins in involved in gene regulation and protein transport. The model will be a protein involved in degrading other proteins.

"Integrated Cheminformatics Resource for Orphan Neurodegenerative Diseases    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In this project, we seek to continue our development of new innovative computational tools, apply them to model relevant protein targets of orphan neurodegenerative diseases, and build a publicly accessible web resource to host these tools and models. These goals will be achieved via two Specific Aims. Aim-1 is to develop and validate two new structure-based computational tools. The first tool (Shape4) is a fast, structure-based virtual screening method designed to search large multi-conformer molecular databases for potential ligands for a protein target. It is based on this chief hypothesis: a ligand molecule's topographical shape and pharmacophore features should be complementary to those of its protein binding site. Novel computational geometry and shape modeling algorithms will be employed to fulfill the shape / pharmacophore matching tasks. The second tool (SB-PPK) generates structure-based descriptors for organic molecules. The descriptors so generated depend not only on the structure of an organic molecule, but also on the binding site features of the target protein. Thus, these new descriptors overcome the drawbacks of traditional molecular descriptors that depend only on the structures of organic molecules, regardless of what the target protein is. The new descriptors will be employed in conjunction with QSAR (quantitative structure activity relationship) modeling workflow to develop predictive models for selected protein targets (Aim-2a). Specifically, the two new methods developed in Aim-1 will be applied to build predictive models for targets from phosphodiesterase (PDE) and histone deacetylase (HDAC) families: PDE- 4, PDE-5, HDAC-7 and HDAC-8. We will then deploy the validated models via a web portal (Aim-2b) to benefit the research community of orphan neurodegenerative diseases. We aim to develop and apply innovative computational tools to study the protein targets of orphan neurodegenerative diseases, and to establish an open-access informatics resource to support the drug discovery efforts in these disease areas.

"Integrated Prediction of Protein Struture at 1D, 2D and 3D Levels    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Computational prediction of protein structure from the amino acid sequence is one of the most important and challenging problems in bioinformatics and computational biology. With the exponential growth of protein sequences without solved protein structures in the post-genomic era, accurate protein structure prediction methods and tools are in urgent need. Here, we propose to develop an integrated approach to advance protein structure prediction at the 1-dimensional (1D), 2-dimensional (2D) and 3-dimensional (3D) levels. At the 1D level, novel information such as domain evolution signals, alternative gene splicing sites, and 2D protein contact map will be used to predict protein domain boundaries from the sequences. At the 2D level, new methods such as residue contact propagation, machine learning boosting, linear programming, and Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations will be used to advance residue-residue contact prediction for a domain, or a protein. At the 3D level, 2D contact prediction, fold recognition via machine learning, and multi-template combination will be used to enhance both template-based and ab initio structure prediction. Finally, knowledge-based statistical machine learning methods and model combination algorithms will be developed to reliably evaluate and refine the quality of predicted protein structural models. One of several innovative aspects of this approach is to integrate 1D, 2D, and 3D predictions in order to improve each other through protein structural unit - domains. The 1D, 2D, and 3D protein structure prediction methods will be implemented as user-friendly software packages and web services released to the scientific community.

The broad, long-term goal of the project is to develop machine learning methods for data-driven protein structure prediction through two independent but complementary strategies: 1) much more accurate template-based modeling for proteins with remote homologs in the Protein Data Bank and 2) better template-free modeling method for proteins without detectable templates and for improving template-based models. The specific aims are: Aim 1) to greatly improve template-based modeling by 1a) improving protein sequence-template alignment using a regression-tree-based nonlinear scoring function, especially when good sequence profiles are unavailable; and 1b) improving fold recognition using a machine learning method to combine both residue-level and atom-level features; Aim 2) to improve protein conformation sampling in a continuous space and thus template-free modeling by three independent but complementary approaches: 2a) modeling nonlinear sequence- structure relationship using Conditional (Markov) Random Fields (CRF) models; 2b) simultaneously sampling secondary and tertiary structure; and 2c) learning structure information from template. The core of the project is to develop various CRF models for data-driven protein structure prediction, by learning protein sequence-structure relationship from existing sequence/structure databases. The product of this research includes a regression-tree-based CRF model for accurate protein alignment, especially for proteins without close homologs in the PDB or without very good sequence profiles; a SVM model for protein fold recognition; a few CRF models for efficient protein conformation sampling in a continuous space; and a complete protein structure prediction software package.

"Very large datasets and new models to predict and design protein interactions    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Specific protein-protein interactions are responsible for organizing the cell, for processing biological signals and information, and for the chemistry of life. Thus, understanding biological mechanism relies on understanding the interactions that occur between proteins. An important long-term goal is to develop methods for reliably predicting and rationally modifying protein-protein interactions. Such capabilities would provide insight into the molecular details of pathology and highlight opportunities for disease treatment. This proposal describes an integrated experimental/computational technology platform that will provide predictive models of protein interaction specificity. The experimental component involves constructing randomized libraries of proteins or peptides that will be sorted according to their affinities for binding a particular receptor. The identities and binding affinities for very large numbers of library members will be decoded using high-throughput sequencing methods. The data, consisting of up to 107 {sequence, affinity} pairs per sequencing run, will be used as input to computational machine learning methods. Models will be generated that capture the relationship between sequence and interactions, and the predictive power of these models will be tested experimentally. The work described in this proposal emphasizes technology development and application of the new platform to study two general types of protein complexes. First are interactions of short helical ligands with mid-sized globular proteins, here studied using anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and Ca2+ binding EF-hand proteins. Second are interactions of short linear peptides with modular interaction domains, here PDZ and SH3 domains. These four protein families mediate an enormous number of important molecular recognition events in human cells, and the resulting models will provide valuable support to study of their biological functions. This work will also provide a stringent test of the capabilities of the proposed technology, which can then be applied to a much wider variety of molecular complexes, e.g., protein-protein, protein-small molecule and protein-nucleic acid assemblies. Given the paucity of high- throughput methods for accurately measuring protein-protein interactions, and the primitive capabilities of most computational models for predicting protein binding, the proposed technology platform has the potential to dramatically transform the study of protein interaction specificity.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Specific protein-protein interactions underlie all biological processes. Knowledge of interactions that occur in healthy vs. diseased tissues, coupled with methods for inhibiting such interactions, would dramatically expand opportunities to treat human disease.

"Refinement Methods for Protein Docking based on Exploring Multi-Dimensional Energ    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  All successful state-of-the-art protein docking methods employ a so called multistage approach. At the first stage of such approaches a rough energy potential is used to score billions of conformations. At a second stage, thousands of conformations with the best scores are retained and clustered based on a certain similarity metric. Cluster centers correspond to putative predictions/models. Recent work by the proposing team demonstrated that greater prediction quality can be achieved by properly exploring these clusters through a process called refinement. This work resulted in the development of a prototype refinement approach - the Semi-Definite programming-based Underestimation method (SDU).  The central goal of the project is to build on the SDU success and develop a new high-throughput refinement protocol able to produce predictions of near-crystallographic quality in the most computationally efficient manner. Efficiency will be achieved by leveraging the funnel-like shape that binding free energy potentials exhibit. The specific aims are: (1) the development of a new clustering method that can classify the conformations retained from a first-stage method into clusters suitable for the proposed refinement strategy; (2) the characterization of the structure of the multi-dimensional funnel corresponding to each cluster and the development of an efficient refinement strategy to explore this funnel; (3) the development of a side-chain positioning algorithm appropriate for docking by leveraging Markov random field theory; and (4) the dissemination of the algorithms developed through the release to the research community of a software package and an automated refinement server. It is anticipated that the computational efficiency gains of the proposed refinement protocol over alternative Monte Carlo methods will exceed two orders of magnitude, while, at the same time, significantly improve upon the accuracy achieved by earlier refinement approaches.  A novelty of the proposed work is in its use of sophisticated machinery from the fields of optimization and decision theory specially tailored to the biophysical properties of the docking problem. Techniques from convex and combinatorial optimization, machine learning, and Markov random fields are brought to bear on the refinement stage of multistage protein docking approaches. An important element of the work is the systematic characterization of multi-dimensional binding energy funnels. The existence of such funnels has been long conjectured but it has not led to new docking approaches so far. The proposed algorithms essentially achieve this goal by devising efficient strategies to identify, characterize, and explore these funnels.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This work will substantially improve upon computational methods for characterizing and predicting protein- protein interactions. It will enable treating relatively weak protein complexes involving larger proteins than what is possible today. This will result in a better understanding of processes such as metabolic control, immune response, signal transduction, and gene regulation.          Project Narrative   This work will substantially improve upon computational methods for characterizing and predicting protein-  protein interactions.

"Discovery of Mental Health and Inflammation (MHAIN) Interactome    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Knowledge of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) is necessary to understand system-level aspects of organisms including that of psychiatric processes. The PPI network (interactome) acts as a vehicle for several types of biomedical research. It can be used to understand the disease mechanisms, drug targets and side effects, and genetic causes for disease. There are 1,014 human genes associated with 'brain'; for 448 of these genes not even a single PPI is known today. While it is useful to discover which pairs of proteins interact, it is also exceptionally challenging as more than 99.9% of protein pairs do not interact. The objective of this work is to carry out systematically designed computational work to discover the human mental health and inflammation (MHAIN) interactome. The MHAIN interactome refers to the network of PPIs where at least one of the two proteins is involved in either brain or inflammation. Many challenges will be addressed in discovering new protein-protein interactions towards building the interactome. Well-established algorithms from diverse computational fields, such as machine learning and signal processing will be applied to achieve the proposed goals. Further, pathways of influence of neuropsychological processes and inflammatory processes on each other will be mined from the interactome. Selected interactions will be validated by wet-lab experiments. The approaches that will be employed for predicting the MHAIN interactome are proactive-learning (to obtain the labels and features of proteins that would provide the maximum impact), transfer-learning (to transfer the knowledge of protein features and interactions from one species to another), multi-sensor fusion (to intelligently integrate output from different predictors). The predicted interactome would accelerate discovery of the biology and treatment of mental health related diseases, by serving as a central resource for biomedical research on mental health. For every protein of interest, verifiable hypothesis of its interactions will be generated that reduce the search space of interactions of that protein from about 25,000 to a few possibilities. New PPIs of proteins involved in major depressive disorder, psychosis in patients with Alzherimer's disease, and systemic inflammation (which is intricately connected to psychiatric diseases), will be put in biomedical context by co- investigators who specialize in these areas. The interactome will identify ""hub-proteins"" that are central to many pathways. It will provide hypothesis of ""functional connectivity"" of new proteins (namely, those of which nothing is currently known). Further, many diseases are found to be untreatable by suppressing a single pathway, and often require manipulating multiple pathways, and the MHAIN interactome can provide the overlap points of multiple pathways that may be used for treatment of diseases. The MHAIN interactome, which would be the outcome of the proposed research, can thus have a broad impact on our understanding of molecular basis of mental health. 1      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research discovers interactions among proteins that are involved in mental health and inflammation.

"Building and Validating Location Proteomics Databases    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary goal of this proposal is to collect high-resolution information on the distribution of proteins within mammalian cells and to link it to nucleotide and protein sequences. It builds on extensive prior work on development of protein tagging methods by the co-PIs and on development of software systems for automated analysis of subcellular patterns in fluorescence microscope images by the PI. 25,000 independent cell lines expressing GFP protein fusions will be created in NIH 3T3 cells using high-throughput CD-tagging (protein-trapping) methods. As the cell lines are created, high-resolution fluorescence microscope images will be collected using fluorescence microscopy and the gene and protein tagged in each cell line will be determined by high-throughput molecular analysis methods. The images will be subjected to automated, computerized image analysis to group proteins with statistically indistinguishable patterns. The determined location for each protein will be compared to whatever information is available from protein databases, journal articles and location predictors. Each assigned location will be accompanied by a confidence estimate derived from combining these sources. In addition, the images for each protein group will be used to build generative models that can synthesize new protein distributions statistically equivalent to the original images. The ability to synthesize distributions will provide an important structural framework for systems biology modeling of cell behavior in normal and disease states.              n/a",Building and Validating Location Proteomics Databases,8292333,R01GM075205,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Behavior', 'Build-it', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Chimeric Proteins', 'Coin', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Fluorescence Microscopy', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Analysis', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Pattern', 'Peptide Sequence Determination', 'Protein Databases', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Source', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Time', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'cell behavior', 'cellular imaging', 'computerized', 'fluorescence microscope', 'journal article', 'programs', 'protein distribution', 'software systems']",NIGMS,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R01,2011,156700,0.12996539576984417
"Protein Design Using Physical Scoring Functions integrated with Site Couplings    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tremendous progress has been made in computational protein design in the last 10 years. Though most work has focused on redesign of existing proteins to enhance their stability, specificity or new functionality, successful designs of novel protein folds (not naturally occurring) have emerged. However, to make protein design useful in practical applications, many challenges still exist in the design of protein-protein and protein- DNA interface and the design of dynamic properties of proteins, etc. To conquer those challenges, a practical solution is to develop more accurate scoring functions. It has been proved both experimentally and theoretically that intra and intermolecular signaling between distant sites within one or among many proteins plays a significant role in many biological processes, such as signal transmission and allosteric regulation, etc. The main research goal of this R21 grant is to develop new algorithms and strategies to incorporate the site-site couplings into a protein design procedure. Specifically, in Aim 1, we propose to study the site-site couplings and cooperative interactions of a protein or protein system using both the sequence-based and the physics-based approaches. Critical assessment of the existing approaches will be conducted and a novel algorithm will be developed using the residue-residue interaction energies. In Aim 2, the best methods for site-site couplings prediction will be tailored and integrated to physical scoring functions of protein design. To guarantee the success of this research grant, we propose four schemes to incorporate/combine the site-site coupling into a protein design procedure. The first two schemes represent simple combinations of sequence-based and physics-based protein design approaches; on the other hand, the next two schemes represent a more advanced integration of site-site correlations and physical scoring functions. In the last protocol, we propose to develop a novel scheme and software package to conduct protein design using the residue-residue interaction energies as a template. This approach, which is referred to as correlation embedding (CE), is based on a hypothesis that the correlation information is intrinsically encoded in the interaction energy matrix. The success of this sub-aim will have a great impact on rational protein design, as it represents a perfect integration of site-site couplings into a physical scoring function and opens a new avenue to conduct protein design. All the designed promising PDZ proteins will be synthesized and tested in both folding and functional assays.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Protein Design Using Physical Scoring Functions integrated with Site Couplings In this proposal, we intend to develop novel approaches to conquer the challenges in protein design. The new protein design strategies can facilitate us to engineer dynamical controls into a novel protein so that it can undertake a dynamic function.

"Protein recognition for modular domains    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Protein is essential for almost every biological process and the interaction between proteins and their interacting partners play critical roles in the functioning cells. Since mutations that disrupt the protein-protein interactions result in many diseases, it is important to understand the biochemical mechanisms of protein recognition, which is important for deciphering protein interaction network and designing potent drugs with high specificity against protein targets. Our long term goal is to develop theoretical models for describing protein binding specificity and reliably predict protein-protein interactions. In the proposed project, we have the following specific aims. Aim 1, we will develop a computational method that combines computer modeling and bioinformatics analysis to characterize the interaction interface between modular domains and their peptide ligands. We will test this method on several modular domains including SH3, SH2 and PDZ domains that bind to specific peptide sequences. Aim 2, we will systematically predict interacting peptides in the yeast genome of all yeast SH3 domains. Aim 3, we will experimentally validate the predictions in vitro to assess the performance of the computational method. We will also conduct in vivo experiments to examine the biological significance of a set of selected domain-peptide interactions.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Protein-protein interactions play critical roles in the cell and mutations that disrupt these interactions result in many diseases.

"Computer Studies of Protein Structure and Function    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goals of the proposed research include: a) The development of methods and associated computational tools that use three-dimensional structural information to predict protein function. b) The development of methods for the integration of structural information in the generation of networks of protein- protein interactions (interactomes). c) The application of structural information in the creation of an interactome of human and tumor B-cells and the use of this network in applications to B-cell Biology. These research goals are motivated by a number of factors. First, there is a general sense that structural information, as provided for example by the Protein Structure Initiative (PSI) is not fully exploited by the wider biological community. An interactive function prediction server is being developed with this issue in mind. Second, Structural Biology has not been fully integrated into Systems Biology approaches to predict protein networks and it would be extremely valuable to try to increase the integration of the two fields. Third, human B-cell phenomena are of great biological and medical interest and there is an exciting opportunity to incorporate structural information into this field in a novel way. A central element of the approach to be taken is the use of structural alignments to reveal novel functional relationships between proteins that have been classified as belonging to different protein ""folds"". Evidence is provided that there is a wealth of functional information in such remote relationships and computational tools to mine and visualize this information will be developed. The research design also includes the description of a novel approach to use structural alignments to identify potential protein-protein ligand, protein-protein and protein-DNA binding partners and to identify interfacial residues in the complexes they form. A novel scoring scheme for protein-protein interactions will be developed and a database of potential complexes, designed originally for human proteins, will be constructed. The database will also identify complexes that are unlikely to form. The information in this database will be incorporated into a Baysian inference scheme and used in the construction of a ""structure-enabled"" B-cell Interactome.

"Multiscale modeling of G protein-coupled receptors    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are the largest family in the mammalian genome, and are critical to a number of cell signaling processes. As a result, they are of enormous biomedical importance; by some estimates, as many as 50% of new pharmaceuticals target GPCRs. Unsurprisingly, there has been a huge research investment in understanding their biophysics. However, integral membrane proteins are challenging to work with experimentally, leaving an opportunity for computational methods to make a significant contribution. We will use multiscale modeling techniques, including all-atom molecular dynamics simulations and elastic network models, to explore the behavior of several GPCRs, including rhodopsin (and its retinal-free form, opsin) and the ¿2-adrenergic receptor (B2AR). Specifically, we will investigate the role of ligand binding in modulating GPCR function, via two separate all-atom molecular dynamics calculations. Microsecond-scale simulations of opsin will, when contrasted with our previous work on rhodopsin in the dark state and during the early stages of activation, allow us to see which interactions in rhodopsin are determined by the presence of the ligand, while the planned simulations of the full activation process will give the first atomic-level view of the structural changes involved in GPCR activation; this knowledge could be critical to the design of novel inhibitors to other GPCRs. The second goal of this proposal is to clarify the role of internal waters in the activation mechanism of GPCRs; our previous simulations described significant increases in the internal hydration of rhodopsin and B2AR. Here, we propose to pursue those observations more rigorously, using automatic pattern recognition methods to correlate hydration changes with functionally interesting protein motions in simulations of rhodopsin, B2AR, and the cannabinoid-2 receptor (CB2). The third goal of the proposal is to develop elastic network models - a simple, computationally inexpensive approach where the protein's interactions are represented as a network of springs - in order to explore larger scale problems not readily amenable to all-atom molecular dynamics, like the modulation of protein motions by G protein binding and GPCR oligomerization. A number of possible network model implementations will be considered, and the models will be carefully validated by quantitative comparison to extensive molecular dynamics simulations, including those proposed for the first aim. The fourth and final goal of the proposal is to assess the validity of a common assumption, that rhodopsin is a good template for understanding GPCR activation in general. To test this hypothesis we will apply multiple computational methods, including long timescale molecular dynamics and elastic network models, to a series of GPCRs, including rhodopsin, opsin, B2AR, and CB2. We will quantitatively correlate the fluctuations of the different GPCRs, with the hypothesis that motions conserved across multiple GPCRs are likely to be functionally significant.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: G protein-coupled receptors are the largest family of proteins in the human genome, and are the most targeted proteins for therapeutics development.

"Analysis of force developed by a AAA ATPase    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The AAA ATPases family includes molecules whose roles include, but are far from limited to, biogenesis of mitochondria and multivesicular bodies, proteins in involved in gene regulation and protein transport. This project will focus on studying the activity of these machines at the single molecule level. The model protein will be ClpX - it is the part of the proteosome, a key effect of protein degradation that unfolds the proteins to prepare them for degradation. . Cellular proteins differ widely in their liability, from half-lives of minutes to days. Regulated degradation, by allowing rapid changes in the levels of cellular proteins, helps control signal transduction pathways, the cell- cycle, transcription, apoptosis, antigen processing, biological clock control, differentiation and surface receptor desensitization. The questions to be addressed are: How is work partitioned between alternative outcomes? What is the maximum work that can be performed by the system? What factors limit its efficiency in performing work? These questions have health implications: human pathological conditions are associated with failures of the degradation system and its regulation offers the potential for therapeutic intervention. Furthermore, an inhibitor of proteasome catalytic activity is in use for treatment of recurrent multiple myeloma, and proteasome inhibitors are in clinical trial for treatment of a broad spectrum of human malignancies. Thus, understanding the regulation of the half-life of proteins should provide critical insights into cell physiology and pathology. The mishandling of aberrant proteins incurs penalties throughout biology: the survival of bacteria subjected to stress depends on the effective performance of systems which deal with misfolded and structurally aberrant proteins- to either fold them properly or destroy them. The specific questions to be addressed are: How hard can the device pull to cause unfolding? How many pulls are needed to commit irreversibly? What is the limit of pulling power, and the statistical distribution of pulling power? Answers to these questions will begin to reveal not just what these machines do but the decision tree that describes how outcomes are controlled and when machine capacity may be exceeded. We want to know not just how the machine works, but how its decision tree yields alternative outcomes.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The AAA ATPases family includes molecules whose roles include, but are far from limited to, biogenesis of mitochondria and multivesicular bodies, proteins in involved in gene regulation and protein transport.

"Integrated Cheminformatics Resource for Orphan Neurodegenerative Diseases    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In this project, we seek to continue our development of new innovative computational tools, apply them to model relevant protein targets of orphan neurodegenerative diseases, and build a publicly accessible web resource to host these tools and models. These goals will be achieved via two Specific Aims. Aim-1 is to develop and validate two new structure-based computational tools. The first tool (Shape4) is a fast, structure-based virtual screening method designed to search large multi-conformer molecular databases for potential ligands for a protein target. It is based on this chief hypothesis: a ligand molecule's topographical shape and pharmacophore features should be complementary to those of its protein binding site. Novel computational geometry and shape modeling algorithms will be employed to fulfill the shape / pharmacophore matching tasks. The second tool (SB-PPK) generates structure-based descriptors for organic molecules. The descriptors so generated depend not only on the structure of an organic molecule, but also on the binding site features of the target protein. Thus, these new descriptors overcome the drawbacks of traditional molecular descriptors that depend only on the structures of organic molecules, regardless of what the target protein is. The new descriptors will be employed in conjunction with QSAR (quantitative structure activity relationship) modeling workflow to develop predictive models for selected protein targets (Aim-2a). Specifically, the two new methods developed in Aim-1 will be applied to build predictive models for targets from phosphodiesterase (PDE) and histone deacetylase (HDAC) families: PDE- 4, PDE-5, HDAC-7 and HDAC-8. We will then deploy the validated models via a web portal (Aim-2b) to benefit the research community of orphan neurodegenerative diseases. We aim to develop and apply innovative computational tools to study the protein targets of orphan neurodegenerative diseases, and to establish an open-access informatics resource to support the drug discovery efforts in these disease areas. We will ultimately contribute to alleviating the pain of orphan neurodegenerative disease patients.          n/a",Integrated Cheminformatics Resource for Orphan Neurodegenerative Diseases,8019584,SC3GM086265,"['Academia', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Applications Grants', 'Appointment', 'Area', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding Sites', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biotechnology', 'Brain', 'Chemical Structure', 'Chemicals', 'Chicago', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Design', 'Drug Industry', 'Ensure', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Histone Deacetylase', 'Huntington Disease', 'Illinois', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Informatics', 'Internet', 'Letters', 'Libraries', 'Ligands', 'Marketing', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Models', 'Names', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'North Carolina', 'Orphan', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Productivity', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Family', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Research Training', 'Resource Informatics', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Screening procedure', 'Shapes', 'Solid', 'Speed', 'Spinal Muscular Atrophy', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Translational Research', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'cheminformatics', 'computer infrastructure', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'computing resources', 'conformer', 'design', 'drug candidate', 'drug discovery', 'innovation', 'method development', 'model development', 'molecular modeling', 'novel', 'pharmacophore', 'phosphodiesterase IV', 'phosphodiesterase V', 'phosphoric diester hydrolase', 'predictive modeling', 'research study', 'success', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool', 'virtual', 'web-accessible']",NIGMS,NORTH CAROLINA CENTRAL UNIVERSITY,SC3,2011,98010,0.06512615412987234
"Integrated Prediction of Protein Struture at 1D, 2D and 3D Levels    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Computational prediction of protein structure from the amino acid sequence is one of the most important and challenging problems in bioinformatics and computational biology. With the exponential growth of protein sequences without solved protein structures in the post-genomic era, accurate protein structure prediction methods and tools are in urgent need. Here, we propose to develop an integrated approach to advance protein structure prediction at the 1-dimensional (1D), 2-dimensional (2D) and 3-dimensional (3D) levels. At the 1D level, novel information such as domain evolution signals, alternative gene splicing sites, and 2D protein contact map will be used to predict protein domain boundaries from the sequences. At the 2D level, new methods such as residue contact propagation, machine learning boosting, linear programming, and Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations will be used to advance residue-residue contact prediction for a domain, or a protein. At the 3D level, 2D contact prediction, fold recognition via machine learning, and multi-template combination will be used to enhance both template-based and ab initio structure prediction. Finally, knowledge-based statistical machine learning methods and model combination algorithms will be developed to reliably evaluate and refine the quality of predicted protein structural models. One of several innovative aspects of this approach is to integrate 1D, 2D, and 3D predictions in order to improve each other through protein structural unit - domains. The 1D, 2D, and 3D protein structure prediction methods will be implemented as user-friendly software packages and web services released to the scientific community. These tools and web services will be useful for protein structure prediction, structure determination, functional analysis, protein engineering, protein mutagenesis analysis, and protein design.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The project will develop accurate computational methods and tools for basic biomedical research such as protein structure prediction, protein function analysis, protein design, protein engineering, and structure-based drug design.           PI: Jianlin Cheng Project Narrative The project will develop accurate computational methods and tools for basic biomedical research such as protein structure prediction, protein function analysis, protein design, protein engineering, and structure-based drug design.","Integrated Prediction of Protein Struture at 1D, 2D and 3D Levels",7863766,R01GM093123,"['3-Dimensional', 'Algorithms', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Arts', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biomedical Research', 'Communities', 'Computational Biology', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coupled', 'Crystallization', 'Drug Design', 'Evolution', 'Generations', 'Genetic Recombination', 'Genomics', 'Growth', 'Internet', 'Linear Programming', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Markov Chains', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutagenesis', 'Peptide Sequence Determination', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Potential Energy', 'Production', 'Protein Analysis', 'Protein Engineering', 'Proteins', 'Services', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Spliced Genes', 'Structural Models', 'Structural Protein', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Tertiary Protein Structure', 'base', 'design', 'disulfide bond', 'improved', 'innovation', 'knowledge base', 'novel', 'protein folding', 'protein function', 'protein structure', 'protein structure prediction', 'public health relevance', 'restraint', 'simulation', 'spatial relationship', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool', 'two-dimensional', 'user friendly software']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI-COLUMBIA,R01,2010,293715,0.11667786515224303
"New Computational Methods for Data-driven Protein Structure Prediction    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Proteins play a central role in all biological processes. Akin to the complete sequencing of genomes, complete description of protein structures is a fundamental step towards understanding biological life, and is also highly relevant medically in the development of therapeutics and drugs. The broad, long-term goal of the project is to develop machine learning methods for data-driven protein structure prediction through two independent but complementary strategies: 1) much more accurate template-based modeling for proteins with remote homologs in the Protein Data Bank and 2) better template-free modeling method for proteins without detectable templates and for improving template-based models. The specific aims are: Aim 1) to greatly improve template-based modeling by 1a) improving protein sequence-template alignment using a regression-tree-based nonlinear scoring function, especially when good sequence profiles are unavailable; and 1b) improving fold recognition using a machine learning method to combine both residue-level and atom-level features; Aim 2) to improve protein conformation sampling in a continuous space and thus template-free modeling by three independent but complementary approaches: 2a) modeling nonlinear sequence- structure relationship using Conditional (Markov) Random Fields (CRF) models; 2b) simultaneously sampling secondary and tertiary structure; and 2c) learning structure information from template. The core of the project is to develop various CRF models for data-driven protein structure prediction, by learning protein sequence-structure relationship from existing sequence/structure databases. The product of this research includes a regression-tree-based CRF model for accurate protein alignment, especially for proteins without close homologs in the PDB or without very good sequence profiles; a SVM model for protein fold recognition; a few CRF models for efficient protein conformation sampling in a continuous space; and a complete protein structure prediction software package. Also, it will produce a web server publicly available for various academic and biomedical users.

"Very large datasets and new models to predict and design protein interactions    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Specific protein-protein interactions are responsible for organizing the cell, for processing biological signals and information, and for the chemistry of life. Thus, understanding biological mechanism relies on understanding the interactions that occur between proteins. An important long-term goal is to develop methods for reliably predicting and rationally modifying protein-protein interactions. Such capabilities would provide insight into the molecular details of pathology and highlight opportunities for disease treatment. This proposal describes an integrated experimental/computational technology platform that will provide predictive models of protein interaction specificity. The experimental component involves constructing randomized libraries of proteins or peptides that will be sorted according to their affinities for binding a particular receptor. The identities and binding affinities for very large numbers of library members will be decoded using high-throughput sequencing methods. The data, consisting of up to 107 {sequence, affinity} pairs per sequencing run, will be used as input to computational machine learning methods. Models will be generated that capture the relationship between sequence and interactions, and the predictive power of these models will be tested experimentally. The work described in this proposal emphasizes technology development and application of the new platform to study two general types of protein complexes. First are interactions of short helical ligands with mid-sized globular proteins, here studied using anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and Ca2+ binding EF-hand proteins. Second are interactions of short linear peptides with modular interaction domains, here PDZ and SH3 domains. These four protein families mediate an enormous number of important molecular recognition events in human cells, and the resulting models will provide valuable support to study of their biological functions. This work will also provide a stringent test of the capabilities of the proposed technology, which can then be applied to a much wider variety of molecular complexes, e.g., protein-protein, protein-small molecule and protein-nucleic acid assemblies. Given the paucity of high- throughput methods for accurately measuring protein-protein interactions, and the primitive capabilities of most computational models for predicting protein binding, the proposed technology platform has the potential to dramatically transform the study of protein interaction specificity.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Specific protein-protein interactions underlie all biological processes.

"Optimization of Stuctures and Networks of Proteins    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application has three major aims that exploit the use of mathematical programming tools for biophysically motivated problems. The first goal is the refinement of protein structures that are obtained from homology. Structures based on homology are rarely of atomic resolution; a resolution which is necessary for detailed modeling of protein function, and for the design of drug molecules. Based on mathematical programming approach a new class of energy functions, suitable for the refinement problem, will be designed. The second goal is to investigate a new type of network; the network of sequence flow between protein structures. We examine the process in which new sequences, generated by point mutations, remain in the current fold, or switch to other stable structures (we exclude sequences with no stable fold). The adjustments to the structure are accepted or rejected based on stability criterion. The net. work defines a master equation which makes it possible to investigate past (ancient) folds, and future structures that serve as attractors. The third aim examines the network of protein-protein (physical) interactions and will be examined with bioinformatics and biophysical approaches. Comparison will be made between the network of sequence flow and the network of protein-protein interactions to better understand the evolution of biological mechanisms and recognition.

"Mechanisms of Protein Structure Evolution    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The traditional view of protein evolution has been that all protein domains are descendents of distinct evolutionary lines, that there are a relatively small number of such lines (about 1000), and that these lines are all of relatively ancient origin. Two new bodies of evidence make that view untenable. First, analysis of sets of fully sequenced genomes shows that most protein families appear to be small, and narrowly distributed in phylogenetic space, apparently implying recent emergence. Second, analysis of the relationship between known protein structures shows that there are many more than a 1000 distinct folds, appearing to imply many more evolutionary lines. The large discrepancy between theory and fact has been clear for some time and a number of explanations have been put forward. But so far there has been no definitive study of alternatives. In this project we will systematically and quantitatively investigate four separate hypotheses, each of which may account for some share of the large number of protein folds and apparently young proteins: that these (1) are the result of generation of new open reading frames or frame shifted older ones; (2) are the outcome of extensive recombination of portions of older proteins; (3) are laterally transferred from unexplored parts of phylogenetic space; (4) are part of larger older families where there has been rapid sequence change, such that not all relatives are found. To investigate these hypotheses we will develop and extend a set of computational methods. These include methods of building protein families; reliably estimating the age of protein families, detecting lateral gene transfer effects; determining to what extent members of families are likely to have been detected with sequence methods; more quantitatively determining whether protein structures are evolutionarily related; searching for remote structure and sequence relationships; and analyzing a range of protein properties as a function of family age. We will also construct a web resource for distributing the results and soliciting extensive community annotation and discussion.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Understanding the structural and functional adaptive properties of protein molecules underpins many aspects of medicine, particularly the emergence of new viruses, drug design, and combating resistance to new therapeutics in infectious diseases.           Project Narrative Understanding the structural and functional adaptive properties of protein molecules underpins many aspects of medicine, particularly the emergence of new viruses, drug design, and combating resistance to new therapeutics in infectious diseases.",Mechanisms of Protein Structure Evolution,7933643,R01GM081511,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Amino Acids', 'Appearance', 'Bacteriophages', 'Calibration', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA Sequence Rearrangement', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Drug Design', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Generations', 'Genetic Recombination', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Horizontal Gene Transfer', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Metagenomics', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Open Reading Frames', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Peptide Sequence Determination', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Play', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Protein Family', 'Proteins', 'Relative (related person)', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Tertiary Protein Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Virus', 'base', 'combat', 'genome sequencing', 'member', 'novel therapeutics', 'numb protein', 'prokaryotic kingdom', 'protein folding', 'protein structure', 'public health relevance', 'theories']",NIGMS,"UNIV OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK",R01,2010,296842,0.11281566337093936
"Nonparametric Analysis of Reverse-Phase Protein Lysate Array Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Proteins play major roles as biological effectors and diagnostic markers. One level of its complexity is due to the post-translational modifications that cannot be detected at the genome level, which makes it desirable to measure proteins directly. Recently, some new protein microarray technologies have begun to bloom for this purpose. We focus on the reverse-phase protein lysate arrays that allow us to quantify the relative expression levels of a protein in many different cellular samples simultaneously. One advantage of this technology is that it requires a small amount of cells with just one antibody binding. However, it is more challenging to analyze protein lysate arrays than DNA arrays, and at the present time, the applications of protein lysate arrays are still in the exploratory stage with a lack of reliable statistical tools for quantifying the information (including the uncertainty) from protein arrays. We find that it is difficult, if at all possible, to model all the samples with a simple parametric family of response curves. We propose a robust approach to quantify the protein lysate arrays by fitting a monotone nonparametric response curve to all samples on the same array. The proposed method has been shown to fit the data more adaptively, avoiding bias due to parameterization. We aim to incorporate the modern shrinkage ideas in statistics into the nonparametric approach, leading to more stable quantification in time course experiments where the number of replicates is small at each time point. We also propose to use wild-bootstrap for assessing uncertainty of the protein concentration estimates and for assessing the influence of such uncertainties in follow-up analyses. When completed, our research will enable more reliable analysis of protein lysate arrays, and provide feedback to chip makers to improve the design of the protein microarrays, both of which are essential in making lysate arrays a useful tool in biological and medical research. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Successful completion of the proposed research will lead to efficient and effective statistical and computing tools for analyzing protein lysate array data that have wide-ranging applications in biomedical and public health research, as evidenced by the recent discovery of target protein in signal pathway profiling related to prostate cancer.

"Protein recognition for modular domains    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Protein is essential for almost every biological process and the interaction between proteins and their interacting partners play critical roles in the functioning cells. Since mutations that disrupt the protein-protein interactions result in many diseases, it is important to understand the biochemical mechanisms of protein recognition, which is important for deciphering protein interaction network and designing potent drugs with high specificity against protein targets. Our long term goal is to develop theoretical models for describing protein binding specificity and reliably predict protein-protein interactions. In the proposed project, we have the following specific aims. Aim 1, we will develop a computational method that combines computer modeling and bioinformatics analysis to characterize the interaction interface between modular domains and their peptide ligands. We will test this method on several modular domains including SH3, SH2 and PDZ domains that bind to specific peptide sequences. Aim 2, we will systematically predict interacting peptides in the yeast genome of all yeast SH3 domains. Aim 3, we will experimentally validate the predictions in vitro to assess the performance of the computational method.

"Analysis of the Functional Impact of Coding region SNPs    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       During the current grant period, we have developed two models of the impact of missense SNPs on protein function in vivo. Through this work, and that of others, we now have a clearer understanding of the molecular mechanisms that lead to monogenic disease. We have also developed a web resource which integrates our results with a large range of other information relevant to disease. Goals for next phase fall into three categories: (1) Exploiting the present results to address basic questions concerning the relationship between genetic variation and disease. Specifically: What is the distribution of mechanisms by which mis-sense SNPs influence protein function; how common are epistatic (non-linear) interactions between SNPs with the same protein molecule and across protein-protein interfaces; what are the characteristics of the approximately 1500 proteins involved in monogenic disease, versus all the others; which SNPs are most significant in directly and indirectly affecting particular biological processes and susceptibility to common diseases? (2) Improving and extending SNP analysis methods, both to obtain a more extensive and reliable set of deleterious mis-sense SNPs, and to include analysis of SNPs that influence disease susceptibility through other processes. New models will be developed for effects on transcription, message processing and translation. Available database information will be augmented by a combination of literature analysis and   soliciting input from appropriate members of the scientific community. (3) Maintain and enhance the web resource to increase its utility to the research community. Functionality will be extended to allow users to input their own SNPs and receive a real time analysis from both models; a user annotation interface will be developed, to capture knowledge on the role of amino acids altered mis-sense SNPs, as well as which genes are most relevant to disease, and what buffering mechanisms shield the phenotype from particular deleterious SNPs; additional information sources will be incorporated, including SNP analysis by others.    Relevance to public health: Many common human diseases, such as heart attack, Alzheimer, asthma and diabetes, are partly inherited, through specific DNA features. At present, there is no common disease for which these inheritance mechanisms are understood. This work will provide specific insight into a number of diseases, and improved understanding of the inheritance process.              n/a",Analysis of the Functional Impact of Coding region SNPs,7842564,R01LM007174,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amino Acids', 'Asthma', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Process', 'Buffers', 'Catalysis', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Code', 'Communities', 'DNA', 'Databases', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Disease Association', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Ensure', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Ligand Binding', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molting', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Online Systems', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Set protein', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Time', 'Translation Process', 'Work', 'base', 'falls', 'human disease', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'member', 'mutant', 'programs', 'protein function', 'protein structure function']",NLM,"UNIV OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK",R01,2010,290690,0.0712782267952105
"Computer Studies of Protein Structure and Function    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goals of the proposed research include: a) The development of methods and associated computational tools that use three-dimensional structural information to predict protein function. b) The development of methods for the integration of structural information in the generation of networks of protein- protein interactions (interactomes). c) The application of structural information in the creation of an interactome of human and tumor B-cells and the use of this network in applications to B-cell Biology. These research goals are motivated by a number of factors. First, there is a general sense that structural information, as provided for example by the Protein Structure Initiative (PSI) is not fully exploited by the wider biological community. An interactive function prediction server is being developed with this issue in mind. Second, Structural Biology has not been fully integrated into Systems Biology approaches to predict protein networks and it would be extremely valuable to try to increase the integration of the two fields. Third, human B-cell phenomena are of great biological and medical interest and there is an exciting opportunity to incorporate structural information into this field in a novel way. A central element of the approach to be taken is the use of structural alignments to reveal novel functional relationships between proteins that have been classified as belonging to different protein ""folds"". Evidence is provided that there is a wealth of functional information in such remote relationships and computational tools to mine and visualize this information will be developed. The research design also includes the description of a novel approach to use structural alignments to identify potential protein-protein ligand, protein-protein and protein-DNA binding partners and to identify interfacial residues in the complexes they form. A novel scoring scheme for protein-protein interactions will be developed and a database of potential complexes, designed originally for human proteins, will be constructed. The database will also identify complexes that are unlikely to form. The information in this database will be incorporated into a Baysian inference scheme and used in the construction of a ""structure-enabled"" B-cell Interactome. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The relevance of the proposed research to public health lies in part in the insights, and accompanying methods, that will be provided about structure/function relationships in proteins. Specific applications to B-cell Biology have direct relevance to understanding a variety of B-cell related cancers.            The relevance of the proposed research to public health lies in part in the insights, and accompanying methods, that will be provided about structure/function relationships in proteins.

"Proteomic Phosphopeptide Chip Technology for Protein Profiling    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   This R21/R33 grant application is in response to NIH/NCI RFA-CA-07-005 for ""Advanced Proteomic Platforms and Computational Sciences for the NCI Clinical Proteomic Technologies Initiative"". Cancers are malignant growths caused by misregulated and uncontrolled cell division; these abnormal cellular activities are typically accompanied by unusual protein expression profiles1. Existing proteomics technologies cannot meet the demand of reliable, sensitive, accurate determinations of these disease-related molecular profiles; to achieve reproducible quality, high throughput, and affordable proteomic analyses, many challenging technological hurdles must first be addressed. We propose developing a proteomic phosphopeptide (PPEP) microchip technology platform that profiles proteins carrying phosphopeptide binding domains (PPBDs); using profiles generated in these experiments, along with predicative computational modeling based on both experimental data and a comprehensive PPEP and PPBD interaction database, we will demonstrate specific and quantitative measurements related to protein functions for proteins of significant biological importance. The strength of our proposed work lies in the integration of an already established array technology and a highly promising bioinformatics platform. The methods developed will enable many researchers to rapidly and vigorously develop peptide arrays for quantitative measurement of the proteins in the biological systems of their own interest or to use standard domain-optimized peptide arrays to systematically profile biological samples of basic research or clinical importance. Over the long term, the methods we develop will be used to establish domain-recognition systems for other types of domain-carrying proteins measurements. These capabilities of reliable measurement of proteins as a function of disease states are essential for cancer research, diagnosis and treatment.             n/a",Proteomic Phosphopeptide Chip Technology for Protein Profiling,7906880,R33CA126209,"['Address', 'Antibodies', 'Applications Grants', 'Basic Science', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biochemical Reaction', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Cell division', 'Clinical', 'Computational Science', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Epitopes', 'Experimental Designs', 'Growth', 'Information Resources', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microfluidic Microchips', 'Microfluidics', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'PTPN11 gene', 'Peptide Mapping', 'Peptide Signal Sequences', 'Peptides', 'Phase', 'Phosphopeptides', 'Phosphorylation Site', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Process', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Kinase', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Publishing', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Informatics', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'Staging', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'Writing', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'biological systems', 'database design', 'density', 'design', 'interest', 'meetings', 'microchip', 'novel', 'programs', 'protein aminoacid sequence', 'protein expression', 'protein function', 'protein profiling', 'research study', 'response', 'src Homology Region 2 Domain', 'technology development', 'tool', 'web-accessible']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF HOUSTON,R33,2010,498935,0.046788178496557364
"Integrated Cheminformatics Resource for Orphan Neurodegenerative Diseases    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In this project, we seek to continue our development of new innovative computational tools, apply them to model relevant protein targets of orphan neurodegenerative diseases, and build a publicly accessible web resource to host these tools and models. These goals will be achieved via two Specific Aims. Aim-1 is to develop and validate two new structure-based computational tools. The first tool (Shape4) is a fast, structure-based virtual screening method designed to search large multi-conformer molecular databases for potential ligands for a protein target. It is based on this chief hypothesis: a ligand molecule's topographical shape and pharmacophore features should be complementary to those of its protein binding site. Novel computational geometry and shape modeling algorithms will be employed to fulfill the shape / pharmacophore matching tasks. The second tool (SB-PPK) generates structure-based descriptors for organic molecules. The descriptors so generated depend not only on the structure of an organic molecule, but also on the binding site features of the target protein. Thus, these new descriptors overcome the drawbacks of traditional molecular descriptors that depend only on the structures of organic molecules, regardless of what the target protein is. The new descriptors will be employed in conjunction with QSAR (quantitative structure activity relationship) modeling workflow to develop predictive models for selected protein targets (Aim-2a). Specifically, the two new methods developed in Aim-1 will be applied to build predictive models for targets from phosphodiesterase (PDE) and histone deacetylase (HDAC) families: PDE- 4, PDE-5, HDAC-7 and HDAC-8. We will then deploy the validated models via a web portal (Aim-2b) to benefit the research community of orphan neurodegenerative diseases. We aim to develop and apply innovative computational tools to study the protein targets of orphan neurodegenerative diseases, and to establish an open-access informatics resource to support the drug discovery efforts in these disease areas. We will ultimately contribute to alleviating the pain of orphan neurodegenerative disease patients.          n/a",Integrated Cheminformatics Resource for Orphan Neurodegenerative Diseases,7753228,SC3GM086265,"['Academia', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Applications Grants', 'Appointment', 'Area', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding Sites', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biotechnology', 'Brain', 'Chemical Structure', 'Chemicals', 'Chicago', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Design', 'Drug Industry', 'Ensure', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Histone Deacetylase', 'Huntington Disease', 'Illinois', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Informatics', 'Internet', 'Letters', 'Libraries', 'Ligands', 'Marketing', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Models', 'Names', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'North Carolina', 'Orphan', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Productivity', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Family', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Research Training', 'Resource Informatics', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Screening procedure', 'Shapes', 'Solid', 'Speed', 'Spinal Muscular Atrophy', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Translational Research', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'cheminformatics', 'computer infrastructure', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'computing resources', 'conformer', 'design', 'drug candidate', 'drug discovery', 'innovation', 'method development', 'model development', 'molecular modeling', 'novel', 'pharmacophore', 'phosphodiesterase IV', 'phosphodiesterase V', 'phosphoric diester hydrolase', 'predictive modeling', 'research study', 'success', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool', 'virtual', 'web-accessible']",NIGMS,NORTH CAROLINA CENTRAL UNIVERSITY,SC3,2010,98700,0.06512615412987234
"Automatic Literature-based Protein Annotation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Knowledge of protein function serves as a corner stone for biomedical research, which is fundamental for understanding biologic systems, the mechanism of disease and ultimately the human health. Decades of biomedical research has accumulated a great wealth of such knowledge available in the form of biomedical literatures. An important task of biomedical informatics is to acquire and represent the knowledge from free text of literatures and transform it to languages that are understandable by computational agents, so that the knowledge can be stored, retrieved and used for knowledge discovery. Currently, all protein annotations are assigned manually which, unfortunately, is extremely labor-intense and cannot keep up the pace of the growth of information. Indeed, with the completion of genome sequences of several model organisms, manual annotation of proteins has already become a major bottleneck between large number of proteins and exploding amount information in biomedical literatures. In this application, we propose to develop methods to facilitate automatic annotation of protein functions based on the functional information buried in the biomedical literature. The proposed methods adapt and extend the state of art probabilistic semantic analysis, information retrieval and machine learning methodologies, which serve as principled approaches to modeling uncertainties in natural language text. The project will develop algorithmic building blocks for a future automatic annotation system such that, when given a brief description of a protein (e.g., a protein name and symbol), it will be capable of retrieving relevant literature articles about the protein, extracting biological concepts from the articles and mapping the concept to a controlled vocabulary. We envision that achieving these goals will result in advances with broader impact which not only facilitate automatic protein annotation but also for biomedical literature indexing-one of the important area of biomedical informatics.

Extensive testing and validation will be carried out at each stage and in each part of the project to ensure large gains in model accuracy. n/a",High-Accuracy Protein Models Derived from Lower Resolution Data,7931242,R01GM081680,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Area', 'Arts', 'Behavior', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'CASP6 gene', 'Carbon', 'Categories', 'Cellular biology', 'Cereals', 'Chemistry', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computers', 'Consensus', 'Crystallography', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Drug Design', 'Ensure', 'Enzymes', 'Evaluation', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'High Performance Computing', 'Homology Modeling', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'International', 'Investments', 'Iowa', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Medal', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Molecular Models', 'Monsters', 'Motion', 'Organism', 'Peptide Sequence Determination', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physics', 'Polishes', 'Principal Investigator', 'Procedures', 'Protein Structure Initiative', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Solutions', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Torsion', 'Universities', 'Ursidae Family', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Wisconsin', 'Work', 'base', 'comparative', 'computer science', 'data mining', 'database structure', 'experience', 'improved', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'member', 'method development', 'molecular mechanics', 'molecular modeling', 'network models', 'novel strategies', 'numb protein', 'programs', 'protein structure', 'protein structure prediction', 'quantum', 'quantum chemistry', 'reconstruction', 'research study', 'restraint', 'scaffold', 'simulation', 'software development', 'structural biology', 'theories', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool', 'web site']",NIGMS,IOWA STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2009,52007,0.0918069176864812
"Building and Validating Location Proteomics Databases    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary goal of this proposal is to collect high-resolution information on the distribution of proteins within mammalian cells and to link it to nucleotide and protein sequences. It builds on extensive prior work on development of protein tagging methods by the co-PIs and on development of software systems for automated analysis of subcellular patterns in fluorescence microscope images by the PI. 25,000 independent cell lines expressing GFP protein fusions will be created in NIH 3T3 cells using high-throughput CD-tagging (protein-trapping) methods. As the cell lines are created, high-resolution fluorescence microscope images will be collected using fluorescence microscopy and the gene and protein tagged in each cell line will be determined by high-throughput molecular analysis methods. The images will be subjected to automated, computerized image analysis to group proteins with statistically indistinguishable patterns. The determined location for each protein will be compared to whatever information is available from protein databases, journal articles and location predictors. Each assigned location will be accompanied by a confidence estimate derived from combining these sources. In addition, the images for each protein group will be used to build generative models that can synthesize new protein distributions statistically equivalent to the original images.

"Optimization of Stuctures and Networks of Proteins    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application has three major aims that exploit the use of mathematical programming tools for biophysically motivated problems. The first goal is the refinement of protein structures that are obtained from homology. Structures based on homology are rarely of atomic resolution; a resolution which is necessary for detailed modeling of protein function, and for the design of drug molecules. Based on mathematical programming approach a new class of energy functions, suitable for the refinement problem, will be designed. The second goal is to investigate a new type of network; the network of sequence flow between protein structures. We examine the process in which new sequences, generated by point mutations, remain in the current fold, or switch to other stable structures (we exclude sequences with no stable fold). The adjustments to the structure are accepted or rejected based on stability criterion. The net. work defines a master equation which makes it possible to investigate past (ancient) folds, and future structures that serve as attractors. The third aim examines the network of protein-protein (physical) interactions and will be examined with bioinformatics and biophysical approaches. Comparison will be made between the network of sequence flow and the network of protein-protein interactions to better understand the evolution of biological mechanisms and recognition.

"Mechanisms of Protein Structure Evolution    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The traditional view of protein evolution has been that all protein domains are descendents of distinct evolutionary lines, that there are a relatively small number of such lines (about 1000), and that these lines are all of relatively ancient origin. Two new bodies of evidence make that view untenable. First, analysis of sets of fully sequenced genomes shows that most protein families appear to be small, and narrowly distributed in phylogenetic space, apparently implying recent emergence. Second, analysis of the relationship between known protein structures shows that there are many more than a 1000 distinct folds, appearing to imply many more evolutionary lines. The large discrepancy between theory and fact has been clear for some time and a number of explanations have been put forward. But so far there has been no definitive study of alternatives. In this project we will systematically and quantitatively investigate four separate hypotheses, each of which may account for some share of the large number of protein folds and apparently young proteins: that these (1) are the result of generation of new open reading frames or frame shifted older ones; (2) are the outcome of extensive recombination of portions of older proteins; (3) are laterally transferred from unexplored parts of phylogenetic space; (4) are part of larger older families where there has been rapid sequence change, such that not all relatives are found. To investigate these hypotheses we will develop and extend a set of computational methods. These include methods of building protein families; reliably estimating the age of protein families, detecting lateral gene transfer effects; determining to what extent members of families are likely to have been detected with sequence methods; more quantitatively determining whether protein structures are evolutionarily related; searching for remote structure and sequence relationships; and analyzing a range of protein properties as a function of family age. We will also construct a web resource for distributing the results and soliciting extensive community annotation and discussion.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Understanding the structural and functional adaptive properties of protein molecules underpins many aspects of medicine, particularly the emergence of new viruses, drug design, and combating resistance to new therapeutics in infectious diseases.           Project Narrative Understanding the structural and functional adaptive properties of protein molecules underpins many aspects of medicine, particularly the emergence of new viruses, drug design, and combating resistance to new therapeutics in infectious diseases.",Mechanisms of Protein Structure Evolution,7583339,R01GM081511,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Amino Acids', 'Appearance', 'Bacteriophages', 'Calibration', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA Sequence Rearrangement', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Drug Design', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Generations', 'Genetic Recombination', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Horizontal Gene Transfer', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Metagenomics', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Open Reading Frames', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Peptide Sequence Determination', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Play', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Protein Family', 'Proteins', 'Relative (related person)', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Tertiary Protein Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Virus', 'base', 'combat', 'genome sequencing', 'member', 'novel therapeutics', 'numb protein', 'prokaryotic kingdom', 'protein folding', 'protein structure', 'public health relevance', 'theories']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MD BIOTECHNOLOGY INSTITUTE,R01,2009,110192,0.11281566337093936
"Nonparametric Analysis of Reverse-Phase Protein Lysate Array Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Proteins play major roles as biological effectors and diagnostic markers. One level of its complexity is due to the post-translational modifications that cannot be detected at the genome level, which makes it desirable to measure proteins directly. Recently, some new protein microarray technologies have begun to bloom for this purpose. We focus on the reverse-phase protein lysate arrays that allow us to quantify the relative expression levels of a protein in many different cellular samples simultaneously. One advantage of this technology is that it requires a small amount of cells with just one antibody binding. However, it is more challenging to analyze protein lysate arrays than DNA arrays, and at the present time, the applications of protein lysate arrays are still in the exploratory stage with a lack of reliable statistical tools for quantifying the information (including the uncertainty) from protein arrays. We find that it is difficult, if at all possible, to model all the samples with a simple parametric family of response curves. We propose a robust approach to quantify the protein lysate arrays by fitting a monotone nonparametric response curve to all samples on the same array. The proposed method has been shown to fit the data more adaptively, avoiding bias due to parameterization. We aim to incorporate the modern shrinkage ideas in statistics into the nonparametric approach, leading to more stable quantification in time course experiments where the number of replicates is small at each time point. We also propose to use wild-bootstrap for assessing uncertainty of the protein concentration estimates and for assessing the influence of such uncertainties in follow-up analyses. When completed, our research will enable more reliable analysis of protein lysate arrays, and provide feedback to chip makers to improve the design of the protein microarrays, both of which are essential in making lysate arrays a useful tool in biological and medical research. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Successful completion of the proposed research will lead to efficient and effective statistical and computing tools for analyzing protein lysate array data that have wide-ranging applications in biomedical and public health research, as evidenced by the recent discovery of target protein in signal pathway profiling related to prostate cancer. These tools are needed to support better applications of protein lysate array technology in clinical and biomedical research.              Project Narrative Successful completion of the proposed research will lead to efficient and effective statistical and computing tools for analyzing protein lysate array data that have wide-ranging applications in biomedical and public health research, as evidenced by the recent discovery of target protein in signal pathway profiling related to prostate cancer.

"Protein recognition for modular domains    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Protein is essential for almost every biological process and the interaction between proteins and their interacting partners play critical roles in the functioning cells. Since mutations that disrupt the protein-protein interactions result in many diseases, it is important to understand the biochemical mechanisms of protein recognition, which is important for deciphering protein interaction network and designing potent drugs with high specificity against protein targets. Our long term goal is to develop theoretical models for describing protein binding specificity and reliably predict protein-protein interactions. In the proposed project, we have the following specific aims. Aim 1, we will develop a computational method that combines computer modeling and bioinformatics analysis to characterize the interaction interface between modular domains and their peptide ligands. We will test this method on several modular domains including SH3, SH2 and PDZ domains that bind to specific peptide sequences. Aim 2, we will systematically predict interacting peptides in the yeast genome of all yeast SH3 domains. Aim 3, we will experimentally validate the predictions in vitro to assess the performance of the computational method. We will also conduct in vivo experiments to examine the biological significance of a set of selected domain-peptide interactions.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Protein-protein interactions play critical roles in the cell and mutations that disrupt these interactions result in many diseases.

"Analysis of the Functional Impact of Coding region SNPs    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       During the current grant period, we have developed two models of the impact of missense SNPs on protein function in vivo. Through this work, and that of others, we now have a clearer understanding of the molecular mechanisms that lead to monogenic disease. We have also developed a web resource which integrates our results with a large range of other information relevant to disease. Goals for next phase fall into three categories: (1) Exploiting the present results to address basic questions concerning the relationship between genetic variation and disease. Specifically: What is the distribution of mechanisms by which mis-sense SNPs influence protein function; how common are epistatic (non-linear) interactions between SNPs with the same protein molecule and across protein-protein interfaces; what are the characteristics of the approximately 1500 proteins involved in monogenic disease, versus all the others; which SNPs are most significant in directly and indirectly affecting particular biological processes and susceptibility to common diseases? (2) Improving and extending SNP analysis methods, both to obtain a more extensive and reliable set of deleterious mis-sense SNPs, and to include analysis of SNPs that influence disease susceptibility through other processes. New models will be developed for effects on transcription, message processing and translation. Available database information will be augmented by a combination of literature analysis and   soliciting input from appropriate members of the scientific community. (3) Maintain and enhance the web resource to increase its utility to the research community. Functionality will be extended to allow users to input their own SNPs and receive a real time analysis from both models; a user annotation interface will be developed, to capture knowledge on the role of amino acids altered mis-sense SNPs, as well as which genes are most relevant to disease, and what buffering mechanisms shield the phenotype from particular deleterious SNPs; additional information sources will be incorporated, including SNP analysis by others.    Relevance to public health: Many common human diseases, such as heart attack, Alzheimer, asthma and diabetes, are partly inherited, through specific DNA features. At present, there is no common disease for which these inheritance mechanisms are understood. This work will provide specific insight into a number of diseases, and improved understanding of the inheritance process.              n/a",Analysis of the Functional Impact of Coding region SNPs,7625225,R01LM007174,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amino Acids', 'Asthma', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Process', 'Buffers', 'Catalysis', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Code', 'Communities', 'DNA', 'Databases', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Disease Association', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Ensure', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Ligand Binding', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molting', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Online Systems', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Set protein', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Time', 'Translation Process', 'Work', 'base', 'falls', 'human disease', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'member', 'mutant', 'programs', 'protein function', 'protein structure function']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF MD BIOTECHNOLOGY INSTITUTE,R01,2009,290689,0.0712782267952105
"Computer Studies of Protein Structure and Function    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goals of the proposed research include: a) The development of methods and associated computational tools that use three-dimensional structural information to predict protein function. b) The development of methods for the integration of structural information in the generation of networks of protein- protein interactions (interactomes). c) The application of structural information in the creation of an interactome of human and tumor B-cells and the use of this network in applications to B-cell Biology. These research goals are motivated by a number of factors. First, there is a general sense that structural information, as provided for example by the Protein Structure Initiative (PSI) is not fully exploited by the wider biological community. An interactive function prediction server is being developed with this issue in mind. Second, Structural Biology has not been fully integrated into Systems Biology approaches to predict protein networks and it would be extremely valuable to try to increase the integration of the two fields. Third, human B-cell phenomena are of great biological and medical interest and there is an exciting opportunity to incorporate structural information into this field in a novel way. A central element of the approach to be taken is the use of structural alignments to reveal novel functional relationships between proteins that have been classified as belonging to different protein ""folds"". Evidence is provided that there is a wealth of functional information in such remote relationships and computational tools to mine and visualize this information will be developed. The research design also includes the description of a novel approach to use structural alignments to identify potential protein-protein ligand, protein-protein and protein-DNA binding partners and to identify interfacial residues in the complexes they form. A novel scoring scheme for protein-protein interactions will be developed and a database of potential complexes, designed originally for human proteins, will be constructed. The database will also identify complexes that are unlikely to form. The information in this database will be incorporated into a Baysian inference scheme and used in the construction of a ""structure-enabled"" B-cell Interactome.

"Proteomic Phosphopeptide Chip Technology for Protein Profiling    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   This R21/R33 grant application is in response to NIH/NCI RFA-CA-07-005 for ""Advanced Proteomic Platforms and Computational Sciences for the NCI Clinical Proteomic Technologies Initiative"". Cancers are malignant growths caused by misregulated and uncontrolled cell division; these abnormal cellular activities are typically accompanied by unusual protein expression profiles1. Existing proteomics technologies cannot meet the demand of reliable, sensitive, accurate determinations of these disease-related molecular profiles; to achieve reproducible quality, high throughput, and affordable proteomic analyses, many challenging technological hurdles must first be addressed. We propose developing a proteomic phosphopeptide (PPEP) microchip technology platform that profiles proteins carrying phosphopeptide binding domains (PPBDs); using profiles generated in these experiments, along with predicative computational modeling based on both experimental data and a comprehensive PPEP and PPBD interaction database, we will demonstrate specific and quantitative measurements related to protein functions for proteins of significant biological importance. The strength of our proposed work lies in the integration of an already established array technology and a highly promising bioinformatics platform. The methods developed will enable many researchers to rapidly and vigorously develop peptide arrays for quantitative measurement of the proteins in the biological systems of their own interest or to use standard domain-optimized peptide arrays to systematically profile biological samples of basic research or clinical importance. Over the long term, the methods we develop will be used to establish domain-recognition systems for other types of domain-carrying proteins measurements. These capabilities of reliable measurement of proteins as a function of disease states are essential for cancer research, diagnosis and treatment.             n/a",Proteomic Phosphopeptide Chip Technology for Protein Profiling,7676045,R33CA126209,"['Address', 'Antibodies', 'Applications Grants', 'Basic Science', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biochemical Reaction', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Cell division', 'Clinical', 'Computational Science', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Epitopes', 'Experimental Designs', 'Growth', 'Information Resources', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microfluidic Microchips', 'Microfluidics', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'PTPN11 gene', 'Peptide Mapping', 'Peptide Signal Sequences', 'Peptides', 'Phase', 'Phosphopeptides', 'Phosphorylation Site', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Process', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Kinase', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Publishing', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Informatics', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'Staging', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'Writing', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'biological systems', 'database design', 'density', 'design', 'interest', 'meetings', 'microchip', 'novel', 'programs', 'protein aminoacid sequence', 'protein expression', 'protein function', 'protein profiling', 'research study', 'response', 'src Homology Region 2 Domain', 'technology development', 'tool', 'web-accessible']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF HOUSTON,R33,2009,494433,0.046788178496557364
"Modeling of Protein Complexes and Missense Mutations Amino acid mutations in human proteins are often associated with inherited predispositions to specific diseases. Yet most observed missense polymorphisms, those involving a single nucleotide change leading to a changed amino acid, have not been characterized in terms of their effects on protein structure and function. We hypothesize that many of the most deleterious missense mutations affect protein function in one of two ways: 1) by altering interaction of proteins with other molecules, including other proteins, DMA, and small ligands; or 2) by altering stability of the protein. Both of these mechanisms depend primarily on the location of the mutation and its physical properties: changes in protein interactions are usually caused by mutations in or very near to a binding site; changes in stability are usually caused by mutations of buried hydrophobic residues. The aim of this proposal is to develop a computational system for predicting the functional effects of missense mutations through homology modeling of protein complexes. New functional data on 1000 random mutations in two dimeric enzyme systems will be obtained to train and test the model. The primary application of this computational system will be to genes associated with the development of cancer. Cancer is usually linked to a number of genetic changes, some inherited and others somatic. These include loss of DNA-damage repair, breakdown of cell-cycle checkpoints, and resistance to apoptosis. Each of these processes requires many protein interactions, often in large protein complexes. These interactions may be compromised by missense mutations that alter individual interactions between molecules or mutations that lower protein stability. n/a",Modeling of Protein Complexes and Missense Mutations,7582317,R01GM073784,"['Affect', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Amino Acids', 'Apoptosis', 'Bayesian Method', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Cancer Genome Anatomy Project', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoint', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cystathionine beta-Synthase', 'DNA Repair', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Association', 'Enzymes', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Goals', 'HIV Protease', 'Homologous Gene', 'Homology Modeling', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Ions', 'Lac Repressors', 'Ligands', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Methods', 'Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (NADPH)', 'Missense Mutation', 'Modeling', 'Muramidase', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutation', 'Nucleotides', 'Online Mendelian Inheritance In Man', 'Peptide Sequence Determination', 'Peptides', 'Phenotype', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Potential Energy', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Rest', 'Scheme', 'Scientist', 'Side', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Tertiary Protein Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'base', 'dimer', 'graphical user interface', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'interest', 'loss of function', 'monomer', 'open source', 'physical property', 'programs', 'protein complex', 'protein folding', 'protein function', 'protein protein interaction', 'protein structure function']",NIGMS,RESEARCH INST OF FOX CHASE CAN CTR,R01,2009,307176,0.1033099265470973
"Automatic Literature-based Protein Annotation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Knowledge of protein function serves as a corner stone for biomedical research, which is fundamental for understanding biologic systems, the mechanism of disease and ultimately the human health. Decades of biomedical research has accumulated a great wealth of such knowledge available in the form of biomedical literatures. An important task of biomedical informatics is to acquire and represent the knowledge from free text of literatures and transform it to languages that are understandable by computational agents, so that the knowledge can be stored, retrieved and used for knowledge discovery. Currently, all protein annotations are assigned manually which, unfortunately, is extremely labor-intense and cannot keep up the pace of the growth of information. Indeed, with the completion of genome sequences of several model organisms, manual annotation of proteins has already become a major bottleneck between large number of proteins and exploding amount information in biomedical literatures. In this application, we propose to develop methods to facilitate automatic annotation of protein functions based on the functional information buried in the biomedical literature. The proposed methods adapt and extend the state of art probabilistic semantic analysis, information retrieval and machine learning methodologies, which serve as principled approaches to modeling uncertainties in natural language text. The project will develop algorithmic building blocks for a future automatic annotation system such that, when given a brief description of a protein (e.g., a protein name and symbol), it will be capable of retrieving relevant literature articles about the protein, extracting biological concepts from the articles and mapping the concept to a controlled vocabulary. We envision that achieving these goals will result in advances with broader impact which not only facilitate automatic protein annotation but also for biomedical literature indexing-one of the important area of biomedical informatics. The efficient knowledge acquisition and management will enhance biomedical research regarding the mechanisms of diseases and drug discovery.          n/a",Automatic Literature-based Protein Annotation,8133305,R01LM009153,[' '],NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2009,109860,0.09907649869786908
"Integrated Cheminformatics Resource for Orphan Neurodegenerative Diseases    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In this project, we seek to continue our development of new innovative computational tools, apply them to model relevant protein targets of orphan neurodegenerative diseases, and build a publicly accessible web resource to host these tools and models. These goals will be achieved via two Specific Aims. Aim-1 is to develop and validate two new structure-based computational tools. The first tool (Shape4) is a fast, structure-based virtual screening method designed to search large multi-conformer molecular databases for potential ligands for a protein target. It is based on this chief hypothesis: a ligand molecule's topographical shape and pharmacophore features should be complementary to those of its protein binding site. Novel computational geometry and shape modeling algorithms will be employed to fulfill the shape / pharmacophore matching tasks. The second tool (SB-PPK) generates structure-based descriptors for organic molecules. The descriptors so generated depend not only on the structure of an organic molecule, but also on the binding site features of the target protein. Thus, these new descriptors overcome the drawbacks of traditional molecular descriptors that depend only on the structures of organic molecules, regardless of what the target protein is. The new descriptors will be employed in conjunction with QSAR (quantitative structure activity relationship) modeling workflow to develop predictive models for selected protein targets (Aim-2a). Specifically, the two new methods developed in Aim-1 will be applied to build predictive models for targets from phosphodiesterase (PDE) and histone deacetylase (HDAC) families: PDE- 4, PDE-5, HDAC-7 and HDAC-8. We will then deploy the validated models via a web portal (Aim-2b) to benefit the research community of orphan neurodegenerative diseases. We aim to develop and apply innovative computational tools to study the protein targets of orphan neurodegenerative diseases, and to establish an open-access informatics resource to support the drug discovery efforts in these disease areas. We will ultimately contribute to alleviating the pain of orphan neurodegenerative disease patients.          n/a",Integrated Cheminformatics Resource for Orphan Neurodegenerative Diseases,7559157,SC3GM086265,"['Academia', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Applications Grants', 'Appointment', 'Area', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding Sites', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biotechnology', 'Brain', 'Chemical Structure', 'Chemicals', 'Chicago', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Design', 'Drug Industry', 'Ensure', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Histone Deacetylase', 'Huntington Disease', 'Illinois', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Informatics', 'Internet', 'Letters', 'Libraries', 'Ligands', 'Marketing', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Models', 'Names', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'North Carolina', 'Orphan', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Productivity', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Family', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Research Training', 'Resource Informatics', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Screening procedure', 'Shapes', 'Solid', 'Speed', 'Spinal Muscular Atrophy', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Translational Research', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'cheminformatics', 'computer infrastructure', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'computing resources', 'conformer', 'design', 'drug candidate', 'drug discovery', 'innovation', 'method development', 'model development', 'molecular modeling', 'novel', 'pharmacophore', 'phosphodiesterase IV', 'phosphodiesterase V', 'phosphoric diester hydrolase', 'predictive modeling', 'research study', 'success', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool', 'virtual', 'web-accessible']",NIGMS,NORTH CAROLINA CENTRAL UNIVERSITY,SC3,2009,98400,0.06512615412987234
"Algorithms for protein superfamily classification and function prediction    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  I am a postdoctoral scholar associated with Steven Brenner's lab at Berkeley, working on structural biology and computational genomics. My long-term vision is to develop new algorithms for inferring protein evolution and function from sequence and structure. Currently I am working on algorithms that can automatically classify a protein into its proper superfamily. The long-term goal of this project is to improve the accuracy of protein structure classification and function prediction.      The superfamily defines ancient protein homology. Protein superfamily classification remains a challenging task, even when 3D structure is available. Currently this task still requires experts' manual work. We believe that the classification of protein superfamilies relies on the integration of sequence information and structure information. We will employ recent breakthroughs in kernel-based machine learning approaches for combining different sources of information. We will also develop structure-based discriminative profile models for protein superfamilies. We expect these algorithmic developments will not only result in a practical tool for superfamily classification, but they will also improve our understanding of the interplay of sequence and structure on defining very remote homology.      We will extend our structure-based discriminative profile models for protein classification to function prediction. We will develop new methods for the identification of structure-sequence signatures of protein functioin. In addition, we will extend the graph theoretical models for multiple sequence alignment I developed during my Ph.D. study to meet the challenge of domain annotation for large new sequence set.      The advancement of medical research is partly based on our detailed understanding of the functions of genes and proteins. My research will improve our understanding of protein evolution and function at the molecular level.

"Protein Packing Defects as Functional Markers and Drug Targets Our preliminary structure-based investigations show that water exclusion from deficiently packed hydrogen bonds and other pre-formed electrostatic interactions constitutes a driving factor conferring high specificity to protein association. Thus, an evolutionary conserved feature, the under-dehydrated hydrogen bond, termed dehydron, appears to be a structural marker for interactivity. Dehydrons were experimentally and statistically shown to constitute sticky spots on the protein surface and to be abundant at protein-protein interfaces, especially at those that cannot be understood in terms of standard interactions. The dehydron distribution on the surface of soluble proteins constitutes a determinant of the propensity for association and aberrant aggregation. The identification of dehydrons has relied so far on detailed structural information, a limitation precluding a proteomic analysis. This proposal is geared at introducing a sequence- based predictive method to establish the biological relevance of dehydrons and their potential as markers for drugable targets. Thus, we intend to introduce a powerful unsupervised scanning technology to detect signals of interactivity and drugability at a genomic scale. This goal requires constructing a machine-learning discriminator trained on a structural database. The over-all aim is to develop a sequence-based multi-purpose tool to expand the universe of drugable targets, diagnose propensity for aberrant aggregation and make interactomic inferences. The efficacy of our predictor will be tested on five grounds: a) Assaying for amino-acid variability and determining whether residues predicted solely from sequence to be engaged in dehydrons are actually conserved, b) Using a redundancy-free curated PDB sample as training set, we shall determine the accuracy and precision of the sequence-based predictor using a nonhomologous PDB complement set and annotated SwissProt entries as testing sets, c) Contrasting our results with an alternative dehydron predictor based on a reliable sequence-based predictor of native disorder (PONDR¿). This dehydron predictor is based on a correlation found between the extent of hydrogen-bond packing and the score of structural disorder, d) Contrasting sequence-based diagnosis of amyloidogenic aggregation with SwissProt annotations and other annotated disease-related sequence repositories; e) Contrasting compiled drug-target quality assessments and structural data and screening profiles for protein-ligand associations with the predicted dehydron patterns.

"High-Accuracy Protein Models Derived from Lower Resolution Data An outstanding international interdisciplinary team has been assembled that will bring a broad variety of expertise to bear on protein model building, bringing together researchers from chemistry, physics, computer science, mathematics, structural biology, and bioinformatics. The expertise ranges from quantum chemistry to machine learning, and from datamining to high performance computing. Input from collaborating NMR and crystallographers will be essential for validating the protein models. Improving abilities to model proteins can impact public health in important ways by enhancing our basic understanding of protein behavior and by facilitating a more efficient selection of protein targets for drug design. The overall goal is to improve a wide range of protein modeling approaches, both by developing new approaches, and by combining those previously been developed. The specific aims are to: 1) Improve existing comparative (homology) modeling and 2) Improve models obtained by fold-recognition and ab initio procedures to make them useful for molecular replacement. There will be some new methods development. Efforts are in four areas - databases, interaction potentials, conformational sampling, and optimization for combining approaches. We will develop ways to include constraints mined from sub-atomic resolution protein structures using a new HIRES Database (to include structures with resolution < 0.85 A). These will include a structure fragment database, as well as short-range distance distributions. These data can be used to compare modeled structures against the collected data. Uses of the high resolution data will ilclude selecting higher quality fragments to replace poor quality segments in the models, for mining interaction potentials, and as a source of a variety of other high quality information regarding protein structures. Better assessments of protein structural models will be developed, including the assessment of the quality of individual segments within a protein structure; the new metrics developed will be used for assessing the quality of computer-built models, crystal structures and NMR structures, and provide indicators of the expected quality of whole protein models as well as of its segments. New ways to sample protein motions will be pursued. Combining diverse methods will lead to significant gains in the computer modeling of protein structures. Extensive testing and validation will be carried out at each stage and in each part of the project to ensure large gains in model accuracy. n/a",High-Accuracy Protein Models Derived from Lower Resolution Data,7495009,R01GM081680,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Area', 'Arts', 'Behavior', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'CASP6 gene', 'Carbon', 'Categories', 'Cellular biology', 'Cereals', 'Chemistry', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computers', 'Consensus', 'Crystallography', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Drug Design', 'Ensure', 'Enzymes', 'Evaluation', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'High Performance Computing', 'Homology Modeling', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'International', 'Internet', 'Investments', 'Iowa', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Medal', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Monsters', 'Motion', 'Numbers', 'Organism', 'Peptide Sequence Determination', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physics', 'Polishes', 'Principal Investigator', 'Procedures', 'Protein Structure Initiative', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Purpose', 'Range', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Score', 'Site', 'Solutions', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Structural Models', 'Structural Protein', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Torsion', 'Universities', 'Ursidae Family', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Wisconsin', 'Work', 'base', 'comparative', 'computer science', 'data mining', 'experience', 'improved', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'member', 'method development', 'molecular mechanics', 'molecular modeling', 'network models', 'novel strategies', 'numb protein', 'programs', 'protein structure', 'protein structure prediction', 'quantum', 'quantum chemistry', 'reconstruction', 'research study', 'restraint', 'scaffold', 'simulation', 'size', 'software development', 'structural biology', 'theories', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool']",NIGMS,IOWA STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2008,231555,0.0918069176864812

As the cell lines are created, high-resolution fluorescence microscope images will be collected using fluorescence microscopy and the gene and protein tagged in each cell line will be determined by high-throughput molecular analysis methods. The images will be subjected to automated, computerized image analysis to group proteins with statistically indistinguishable patterns. The determined location for each protein will be compared to whatever information is available from protein databases, journal articles and location predictors. Each assigned location will be accompanied by a confidence estimate derived from combining these sources. In addition, the images for each protein group will be used to build generative models that can synthesize new protein distributions statistically equivalent to the original images.

"Optimization of Stuctures and Networks of Proteins    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application has three major aims that exploit the use of mathematical programming tools for biophysically motivated problems. The first goal is the refinement of protein structures that are obtained from homology. Structures based on homology are rarely of atomic resolution; a resolution which is necessary for detailed modeling of protein function, and for the design of drug molecules. Based on mathematical programming approach a new class of energy functions, suitable for the refinement problem, will be designed. The second goal is to investigate a new type of network; the network of sequence flow between protein structures. We examine the process in which new sequences, generated by point mutations, remain in the current fold, or switch to other stable structures (we exclude sequences with no stable fold). The adjustments to the structure are accepted or rejected based on stability criterion. The net. work defines a master equation which makes it possible to investigate past (ancient) folds, and future structures that serve as attractors. The third aim examines the network of protein-protein (physical) interactions and will be examined with bioinformatics and biophysical approaches. Comparison will be made between the network of sequence flow and the network of protein-protein interactions to better understand the evolution of biological mechanisms and recognition.

"Analysis of the Functional Impact of Coding region SNPs    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       During the current grant period, we have developed two models of the impact of missense SNPs on protein function in vivo. Through this work, and that of others, we now have a clearer understanding of the molecular mechanisms that lead to monogenic disease. We have also developed a web resource which integrates our results with a large range of other information relevant to disease. Goals for next phase fall into three categories: (1) Exploiting the present results to address basic questions concerning the relationship between genetic variation and disease. Specifically: What is the distribution of mechanisms by which mis-sense SNPs influence protein function; how common are epistatic (non-linear) interactions between SNPs with the same protein molecule and across protein-protein interfaces; what are the characteristics of the approximately 1500 proteins involved in monogenic disease, versus all the others; which SNPs are most significant in directly and indirectly affecting particular biological processes and susceptibility to common diseases? (2) Improving and extending SNP analysis methods, both to obtain a more extensive and reliable set of deleterious mis-sense SNPs, and to include analysis of SNPs that influence disease susceptibility through other processes. New models will be developed for effects on transcription, message processing and translation. Available database information will be augmented by a combination of literature analysis and   soliciting input from appropriate members of the scientific community. (3) Maintain and enhance the web resource to increase its utility to the research community. Functionality will be extended to allow users to input their own SNPs and receive a real time analysis from both models; a user annotation interface will be developed, to capture knowledge on the role of amino acids altered mis-sense SNPs, as well as which genes are most relevant to disease, and what buffering mechanisms shield the phenotype from particular deleterious SNPs; additional information sources will be incorporated, including SNP analysis by others.    Relevance to public health: Many common human diseases, such as heart attack, Alzheimer, asthma and diabetes, are partly inherited, through specific DNA features. At present, there is no common disease for which these inheritance mechanisms are understood. This work will provide specific insight into a number of diseases, and improved understanding of the inheritance process.              n/a",Analysis of the Functional Impact of Coding region SNPs,7383901,R01LM007174,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amino Acids', 'Asthma', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Process', 'Buffers', 'Catalysis', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Code', 'Communities', 'DNA', 'Databases', 'Depth', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Disease Association', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Ensure', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Ligand Binding', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molting', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Numbers', 'Online Systems', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Range', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Set protein', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Time', 'Translation Process', 'Work', 'base', 'falls', 'human disease', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'member', 'mutant', 'programs', 'protein function', 'protein structure function']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF MD BIOTECHNOLOGY INSTITUTE,R01,2008,285166,0.0712782267952105
"Accurate Protein Identification using Peptide Separation Information and Tandem M    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A significant problem currently hindering proteomics studies is the identification of peptides and proteins from mass spectral data. This problem is manifest in the difficulty to establish confidence limits of protein and peptide identifications. A serious concern is the tendency for the occurrence of false positive assignments. The development of an integrated protein identification platform will greatly reduce the risk of such assignments. This will allow Predictive Physiology and Medicine, Inc. (PPM) to produce unrivaled characterizations of the proteins in human plasma. With this capability, PPM will be able to perform the population studies necessary to create the protein profiles associated with health and disease, termed Addressable Digital Array Maps (ADAM). The ability to distinguish healthy and disease ADAMs will greatly enhance the competitiveness of PPM in the field of personalized medicine. Additionally, the platform itself will be marketable.       The integrated protein identification platform will be created using information that is generally discarded in typical liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry experiments (LC-MS). Algorithms will be developed aimed at predicting peptide separation profiles for two-dimensional (2D) ion mobility spectrometry (IMS, a technology currently only utilized by PPM for proteomics studies). The predicted profiles can be used to decrease protein database sizes which decrease the identity thresholds for assignments; effectively this increases the confidence of peptide assignments as well as increases the number of confident assignments. Additionally, algorithms will be developed to allow the use of multiple protein database search programs.

"Proteomic Phosphopeptide Chip Technology for Protein Profiling    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   This R21/R33 grant application is in response to NIH/NCI RFA-CA-07-005 for ""Advanced Proteomic Platforms and Computational Sciences for the NCI Clinical Proteomic Technologies Initiative"". Cancers are malignant growths caused by misregulated and uncontrolled cell division; these abnormal cellular activities are typically accompanied by unusual protein expression profiles1. Existing proteomics technologies cannot meet the demand of reliable, sensitive, accurate determinations of these disease-related molecular profiles; to achieve reproducible quality, high throughput, and affordable proteomic analyses, many challenging technological hurdles must first be addressed. We propose developing a proteomic phosphopeptide (PPEP) microchip technology platform that profiles proteins carrying phosphopeptide binding domains (PPBDs); using profiles generated in these experiments, along with predicative computational modeling based on both experimental data and a comprehensive PPEP and PPBD interaction database, we will demonstrate specific and quantitative measurements related to protein functions for proteins of significant biological importance. The strength of our proposed work lies in the integration of an already established array technology and a highly promising bioinformatics platform. The methods developed will enable many researchers to rapidly and vigorously develop peptide arrays for quantitative measurement of the proteins in the biological systems of their own interest or to use standard domain-optimized peptide arrays to systematically profile biological samples of basic research or clinical importance. Over the long term, the methods we develop will be used to establish domain-recognition systems for other types of domain-carrying proteins measurements. These capabilities of reliable measurement of proteins as a function of disease states are essential for cancer research, diagnosis and treatment.             n/a",Proteomic Phosphopeptide Chip Technology for Protein Profiling,7622959,R33CA126209,"['Address', 'Antibodies', 'Applications Grants', 'Basic Science', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biochemical Reaction', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Cell division', 'Clinical', 'Computational Science', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease regression', 'Ensure', 'Epitopes', 'Experimental Designs', 'Facility Construction Funding Category', 'Growth', 'Information Resources', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microfluidic Microchips', 'Microfluidics', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Numbers', 'PTPN11 gene', 'Peptide Mapping', 'Peptide Signal Sequences', 'Peptides', 'Phase', 'Phosphopeptides', 'Phosphorylation Site', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Process', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Kinase', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Publishing', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Informatics', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'Staging', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'Writing', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'database design', 'density', 'design', 'interest', 'microchip', 'novel', 'programs', 'protein aminoacid sequence', 'protein expression', 'protein function', 'research study', 'response', 'software development', 'src Homology Region 2 Domain', 'technology development', 'tool', 'web-accessible']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF HOUSTON,R33,2008,536748,0.046788178496557364
"Modeling of Protein Complexes and Missense Mutations Amino acid mutations in human proteins are often associated with inherited predispositions to specific diseases. Yet most observed missense polymorphisms, those involving a single nucleotide change leading to a changed amino acid, have not been characterized in terms of their effects on protein structure and function. We hypothesize that many of the most deleterious missense mutations affect protein function in one of two ways: 1) by altering interaction of proteins with other molecules, including other proteins, DMA, and small ligands; or 2) by altering stability of the protein. Both of these mechanisms depend primarily on the location of the mutation and its physical properties: changes in protein interactions are usually caused by mutations in or very near to a binding site; changes in stability are usually caused by mutations of buried hydrophobic residues. The aim of this proposal is to develop a computational system for predicting the functional effects of missense mutations through homology modeling of protein complexes. New functional data on 1000 random mutations in two dimeric enzyme systems will be obtained to train and test the model. The primary application of this computational system will be to genes associated with the development of cancer. Cancer is usually linked to a number of genetic changes, some inherited and others somatic. These include loss of DNA-damage repair, breakdown of cell-cycle checkpoints, and resistance to apoptosis. Each of these processes requires many protein interactions, often in large protein complexes. These interactions may be compromised by missense mutations that alter individual interactions between molecules or mutations that lower protein stability. n/a",Modeling of Protein Complexes and Missense Mutations,7369808,R01GM073784,"['Affect', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Amino Acids', 'Apoptosis', 'Bayesian Method', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Cancer Genome Anatomy Project', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoint', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cystathionine beta-Synthase', 'DNA Repair', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Association', 'Enzymes', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Goals', 'HIV Protease', 'Homologous Gene', 'Homology Modeling', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Ions', 'Lac Repressors', 'Ligands', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Methods', 'Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (NADPH)', 'Missense Mutation', 'Modeling', 'Muramidase', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutation', 'Nucleotides', 'Numbers', 'Online Mendelian Inheritance In Man', 'Peptide Sequence Determination', 'Peptides', 'Phenotype', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Potential Energy', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Rest', 'Scheme', 'Scientist', 'Side', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Tertiary Protein Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'base', 'dimer', 'graphical user interface', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'interest', 'loss of function', 'monomer', 'open source', 'physical property', 'programs', 'protein folding', 'protein function', 'protein protein interaction', 'protein structure', 'protein structure function']",NIGMS,RESEARCH INST OF FOX CHASE CAN CTR,R01,2008,307176,0.1033099265470973
"Algorithms for protein superfamily classification and function prediction    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  I am a postdoctoral scholar associated with Steven Brenner's lab at Berkeley, working on structural biology and computational genomics. My long-term vision is to develop new algorithms for inferring protein evolution and function from sequence and structure. Currently I am working on algorithms that can automatically classify a protein into its proper superfamily. The long-term goal of this project is to improve the accuracy of protein structure classification and function prediction.      The superfamily defines ancient protein homology. Protein superfamily classification remains a challenging task, even when 3D structure is available. Currently this task still requires experts' manual work. We believe that the classification of protein superfamilies relies on the integration of sequence information and structure information. We will employ recent breakthroughs in kernel-based machine learning approaches for combining different sources of information. We will also develop structure-based discriminative profile models for protein superfamilies. We expect these algorithmic developments will not only result in a practical tool for superfamily classification, but they will also improve our understanding of the interplay of sequence and structure on defining very remote homology.      We will extend our structure-based discriminative profile models for protein classification to function prediction. We will develop new methods for the identification of structure-sequence signatures of protein functioin. In addition, we will extend the graph theoretical models for multiple sequence alignment I developed during my Ph.D. study to meet the challenge of domain annotation for large new sequence set.      The advancement of medical research is partly based on our detailed understanding of the functions of genes and proteins. My research will improve our understanding of protein evolution and function at the molecular level.

"Automatic Literature-based Protein Annotation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Knowledge of protein function serves as a corner stone for biomedical research, which is fundamental for understanding biologic systems, the mechanism of disease and ultimately the human health. Decades of biomedical research has accumulated a great wealth of such knowledge available in the form of biomedical literatures. An important task of biomedical informatics is to acquire and represent the knowledge from free text of literatures and transform it to languages that are understandable by computational agents, so that the knowledge can be stored, retrieved and used for knowledge discovery. Currently, all protein annotations are assigned manually which, unfortunately, is extremely labor-intense and cannot keep up the pace of the growth of information. Indeed, with the completion of genome sequences of several model organisms, manual annotation of proteins has already become a major bottleneck between large number of proteins and exploding amount information in biomedical literatures. In this application, we propose to develop methods to facilitate automatic annotation of protein functions based on the functional information buried in the biomedical literature. The proposed methods adapt and extend the state of art probabilistic semantic analysis, information retrieval and machine learning methodologies, which serve as principled approaches to modeling uncertainties in natural language text. The project will develop algorithmic building blocks for a future automatic annotation system such that, when given a brief description of a protein (e.g., a protein name and symbol), it will be capable of retrieving relevant literature articles about the protein, extracting biological concepts from the articles and mapping the concept to a controlled vocabulary. We envision that achieving these goals will result in advances with broader impact which not only facilitate automatic protein annotation but also for biomedical literature indexing-one of the important area of biomedical informatics. The efficient knowledge acquisition and management will enhance biomedical research regarding the mechanisms of diseases and drug discovery.          n/a",Automatic Literature-based Protein Annotation,7260682,R01LM009153,"['Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Area', 'Arts', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Research', 'Body of uterus', 'Calculi', 'Classification', 'Controlled Vocabulary', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Human', 'Information Retrieval', 'Information Theory', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge acquisition', 'Language', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Names', 'Ontology', 'Organism', 'Performance', 'Proteins', 'Rate', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Semantics', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'concept', 'drug discovery', 'genome sequencing', 'human disease', 'improved', 'indexing', 'knowledge of results', 'markov model', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'numb protein', 'programs', 'protein function']",NLM,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,R01,2007,291350,0.09907649869786908
"Alignment-independent Classification of Proteins    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Human Genome project and related genome projects have stirred great hopes for improving our understanding and treatment of diseases. Central to this process is the automated detection of functional motifs and classification of protein sequences into families and/or subfamilies. Conventional approaches for protein sequence classification usually employ sequence alignment methods; other methods depend on the choice of the features included in the training sets, and on accuracy and availability of data. We propose an alignment-independent classification approach based on a search engine technology that had been successfully used in classifying medical records. Each protein is represented by a multidimensional vector, the elements of which refer to the protein's most discriminative eta-grams (sequences of eta amino acids). Preliminary studies on G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) showed that a simple Naive Bayes classifier using straightforward eta-gram feature   selection in its preprocessing, can outperform existing classifiers including support vector machines on previously investigated, standardized GPCR sequence data subsets. Jackknife tests applied to the Protein Information Resource (PIR) Protein Sequence Database PSD and to the Pfam database (DB) of protein families showed that approximately 70% of the protein sequences are classified correctly.  More significantly, the most discriminative eta-grams in a given protein family appear to have a functional or structural role, as suggested by their comparison with the sequence motifs known to be conserved or active in existing DBs and by the examination of the three-dimensional structure of representative members of the family. Encouraged by these results, we propose to pursue the following specific aims:   (1) develop a new computational tool for protein sequence analysis and protein classification based on eta-gram distributions, (2) build a comprehensive DB of protein families based on eta-gram distributions and investigate the relationships between this DB and the leading protein classification DBs, (3) determine the functional significance of the top-ranking n-grams, and (4) develop a Java based toolkit that will provide easy-to-use, yet flexible, web interface to researchers from various background. The expected deliverables are the methodology and software for classification without alignment (CWA); a new database of classified proteins, based on CWA; and an on-line server and GUI that will deliver the database and data mining tools to the scientific community in a user-friendly environment.         n/a",Alignment-independent Classification of Proteins,7237368,R01LM007994,"['3-Dimensional', 'Accounting', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Amino Acid Sequence Databases', 'Amino Acids', 'Biological', 'Case Study', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Drops', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Family', 'Family member', 'G-Protein-Coupled Receptors', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Recombination', 'Genome', 'Homologous Gene', 'Human', 'Human Genome Project', 'Information Resources', 'International', 'Internet', 'Java', 'Kindling (Neurology)', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Medical Records', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Numbers', 'Peptide Sequence Determination', 'Pilot Projects', 'Printing', 'Probability', 'Probability Theory', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protein Databases', 'Protein Family', 'Protein Sequence Analysis', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Public Domains', 'Randomized', 'Rate', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Score', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Structure', 'SwissProt', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'data mining', 'graphical user interface', 'improved', 'interest', 'markov model', 'member', 'novel strategies', 'programs', 'stem', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'vector', 'web interface']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2007,264180,0.13661635718846674
"Optimization of Folding and Threading Proteins    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Determining protein structure and function from genomic sequences and protein classification remains one of the most significant challenges in modern computational biology.  Significant enhancement to the capacity of algorithms to predict protein shapes from sequences is proposed, focusing on major bottlenecks; e.g., the folding energy and the ability of making approximate matches.  Algorithms to determine protein shapes from sequences have two major components: The first component (sampling) generates a set of plausible protein shapes; at least one of the sampled shapes is expected to be similar to the correct fold.  The second component scores the different structures and decides on the best model.  The radius of convergence of the energy function must be sufficiently large so that approximate matches will be detected as well (in threading approximate matches may include deletions and insertion).  It is therefore clear that poor scoring functions (or energies), which are unable to identify the correct fold, are likely to diminish the capacity of the folding algorithm.  At present, it is easy to generate a set of decoy (wrong) structures that will confuse existing energy functions.  Mathematical programming and machine learning techniques (Support Vector Machines) will design enhanced folding and threading potentials.  The training by these methods is automated and will lead to monotonic improvement in recognition as a function of the data size.  To more effectively cover protein space, the goal is to learn 100 million data points in a single consistent potential with (at most) 10,000 parameters.  The automated large scale learning is crucial at times in which the information on sequences and structures grows rapidly.

"Protein Packing Defects as Functional Markers and Drug Targets DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Our preliminary structure-based investigations show that water exclusion from deficiently packed hydrogen bonds and other pre-formed electrostatic interactions constitutes a driving factor conferring high specificity to protein association. Thus, an evolutionary conserved feature, the under-dehydrated hydrogen bond, termed dehydron, appears to be a structural marker for interactivity. Dehydrons were experimentally and statistically shown to constitute sticky spots on the protein surface and to be abundant at protein-protein interfaces, especially at those that cannot be understood in terms of standard interactions. The dehydron distribution on the surface of soluble proteins constitutes a determinant of the propensity for association and aberrant aggregation. The identification of dehydrons has relied so far on detailed structural information, a limitation precluding a proteomic analysis. This proposal is geared at introducing a sequence-based predictive method to establish the biological relevance of dehydrons and their potential as markers for drugable targets. Thus, we intend to introduce a powerful unsupervised scanning technology to detect signals of interactivity and drugability at a genomic scale. This goal requires constructing a machine-learning discriminator trained on a structural database. The over-all aim is to develop a sequence-based multi-purpose tool to expand the universe of drugable targets, diagnose propensity for aberrant aggregation and make interactomic inferences. The efficacy of our predictor will be tested on five grounds: a) Assaying for amino-acid variability and determining whether residues predicted solely from sequence to be engaged in dehydrons are actually conserved, b) Using a redundancy-free curated PDB sample as training set, we shall determine the accuracy and precision of the sequence-based predictor using a nonhomologous PDB complement set and annotated SwissProt entries as testing sets, c) Contrasting our results with an alternative dehydron predictor based on a reliable sequence-based predictor of native disorder (PONDR(r)). This dehydron predictor is based on a correlation found between the extent of hydrogen-bond packing and the score of structural disorder, d) Contrasting sequence-based diagnosis of amyloidogenic aggregation with SwissProt annotations and other annotated disease-related sequence repositories; e) Contrasting compiled drug-target quality assessments and structural data and screening profiles for protein-ligand associations with the predicted dehydron patterns.

The expertise ranges from quantum chemistry to machine learning, and from data-mining to high performance computing. Input from collaborators in NMR and crystallography will be essential for validating the protein models. Improving abilities to model proteins can impact public health in important ways by enhancing our basic understanding of protein behavior and by facilitating a more efficient selection of protein targets for drug design.      The overall goal is to improve a wide range of protein modeling approaches, both by developing new approaches and by combining those previously been developed. The specific aims are to: (1) improve existing comparative (homology) modeling and (2) improve models obtained by fold recognition and ab initio procedures to make them useful for molecular replacement. There will be some new methods development. Efforts are in four areas--databases, interaction potentials, conformational sampling, and optimization for combining approaches. We will develop ways to include constraints mined from sub-atomic resolution protein structures using a new HIRES database (to include structures with resolution <0.85 A). These will include a structure fragment database, as well as short-range distance distributions. These data can be used to compare modeled structures against the collected data. Uses of the high resolution data will include selecting higher quality fragments to replace poor quality segments in the models, for mining interaction potentials, and as a source of a variety of other high quality information regarding protein structures.       Better assessments of protein structural models will be developed, including the assessment of the quality of individual segments within a protein structure; the new metrics developed will be used for assessing the quality of computer-built models, crystal structures and NMR structures, and provide indicators of the expected quality of whole protein models as well as of their segments. New ways to sample protein motions will be pursued. Combining diverse methods will lead to significant gains in the computer modeling of protein structures.

"Computational methods for the analysis of protein flexibility.    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Protein flexibility, manifested by local and global changes in conformation, is an essential component of protein function. Conformational flexibility is involved in fundamental biological activities, such as intermolecular interactions, and in a variety of human diseases, such as transmissible encephalopathies and synucleinopathies. Our long-term goal is to incorporate the dynamic properties of proteins into computational analyses of functional sites and disease-related conformational transitions. However, progress in the important area of protein flexibility has long been hampered by the absence of reliable and efficient computational methodology that could be used to perform systematic large-scale studies of flexible protein segments. The main goal of this proposal is to circumvent this problem by developing accurate high-throughput computational methods for predicting dynamic properties of protein segments using their sequence properties. Protein flexibility can be classified into two broad categories: (1) disordered flexibility observed in disordered segments that completely lack detectable structure and (2) ordered flexibility observed in segments that undergo conformational transition from one detectable ordered structure to another. We will address the least studied category of ordered flexibility.

"Analysis of the Functional Impact of Coding region SNPs    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       During the current grant period, we have developed two models of the impact of missense SNPs on protein function in vivo. Through this work, and that of others, we now have a clearer understanding of the molecular mechanisms that lead to monogenic disease. We have also developed a web resource which integrates our results with a large range of other information relevant to disease. Goals for next phase fall into three categories: (1) Exploiting the present results to address basic questions concerning the relationship between genetic variation and disease. Specifically: What is the distribution of mechanisms by which mis-sense SNPs influence protein function; how common are epistatic (non-linear) interactions between SNPs with the same protein molecule and across protein-protein interfaces; what are the characteristics of the approximately 1500 proteins involved in monogenic disease, versus all the others; which SNPs are most significant in directly and indirectly affecting particular biological processes and susceptibility to common diseases? (2) Improving and extending SNP analysis methods, both to obtain a more extensive and reliable set of deleterious mis-sense SNPs, and to include analysis of SNPs that influence disease susceptibility through other processes. New models will be developed for effects on transcription, message processing and translation. Available database information will be augmented by a combination of literature analysis and   soliciting input from appropriate members of the scientific community. (3) Maintain and enhance the web resource to increase its utility to the research community. Functionality will be extended to allow users to input their own SNPs and receive a real time analysis from both models; a user annotation interface will be developed, to capture knowledge on the role of amino acids altered mis-sense SNPs, as well as which genes are most relevant to disease, and what buffering mechanisms shield the phenotype from particular deleterious SNPs; additional information sources will be incorporated, including SNP analysis by others.    Relevance to public health: Many common human diseases, such as heart attack, Alzheimer, asthma and diabetes, are partly inherited, through specific DNA features. At present, there is no common disease for which these inheritance mechanisms are understood. This work will provide specific insight into a number of diseases, and improved understanding of the inheritance process.              n/a",Analysis of the Functional Impact of Coding region SNPs,7214011,R01LM007174,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amino Acids', 'Asthma', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Process', 'Buffers', 'Catalysis', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Code', 'Communities', 'DNA', 'Databases', 'Depth', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Disease Association', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Ensure', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Ligand Binding', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molting', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Numbers', 'Online Systems', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Range', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Set protein', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Time', 'Translation Process', 'Work', 'base', 'falls', 'human disease', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'member', 'mutant', 'programs', 'protein function', 'protein structure function']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF MD BIOTECHNOLOGY INSTITUTE,R01,2007,312439,0.0712782267952105
"Modeling of Protein Complexes and Missense Mutations    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Amino acid mutations in human proteins are often associated with inherited predispositions to specific diseases. Yet most observed missense polymorphisms, those involving a single nucleotide change leading to a changed amino acid, have not been characterized in terms of their effects on protein structure and function. We hypothesize that many of the most deleterious missense mutations affect protein function in one of two ways: 1) by altering interaction of proteins with other molecules, including other proteins, DMA, and small ligands; or 2) by altering stability of the protein. Both of these mechanisms depend primarily on the location of the mutation and its physical properties: changes in protein interactions are usually caused by mutations in or very near to a binding site; changes in stability are usually caused by mutations of buried hydrophobic residues. The aim of this proposal is to develop a computational system for predicting the functional effects of missense mutations through homology modeling of protein complexes. New functional data on 1000 random mutations in two dimeric enzyme systems will be obtained to train and test the model. The primary application of this computational system will be to genes associated with the development of   cancer. Cancer is usually linked to a number of genetic changes, some inherited and others somatic. These include loss of DNA-damage repair, breakdown of cell-cycle checkpoints, and resistance to apoptosis. Each of these processes requires many protein interactions, often in large protein complexes. These interactions may be compromised by missense mutations that alter individual interactions between molecules or mutations that lower protein stability.    n/a",Modeling of Protein Complexes and Missense Mutations,7189836,R01GM073784,"['Affect', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Amino Acids', 'Apoptosis', 'Bayesian Method', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Cancer Genome Anatomy Project', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoint', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cystathionine beta-Synthase', 'DNA Repair', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Association', 'Enzymes', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Goals', 'HIV Protease', 'Homologous Gene', 'Homology Modeling', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Ions', 'Lac Repressors', 'Ligands', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Methods', 'Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (NADPH)', 'Missense Mutation', 'Modeling', 'Muramidase', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutation', 'Nucleotides', 'Numbers', 'Online Mendelian Inheritance In Man', 'Peptide Sequence Determination', 'Peptides', 'Phenotype', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Potential Energy', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Rest', 'Scheme', 'Scientist', 'Side', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Tertiary Protein Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'base', 'dimer', 'graphical user interface', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'interest', 'loss of function', 'monomer', 'open source', 'physical property', 'programs', 'protein folding', 'protein function', 'protein protein interaction', 'protein structure', 'protein structure function']",NIGMS,RESEARCH INST OF FOX CHASE CAN CTR,R01,2007,307176,0.10288779278083336
"Comparison of Protein Sequences and Structures    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goals of our research are: (a) to develop more sensitive and reliable methods for exploiting sequence and structure information through similarity searching; and (b) to understand better the biophysical constraints on protein folding that can be identified from protein sequence information. Although similarity searching is now routinely used to characterize sequences and annotate genomes, the most widely used methods focus on speed at the expense of sensitivity and statistical accuracy. We believe that more flexible algorithms, with more accurate statistical estimates, can provide new biological insights about the structure, function, and evolutionary history of protein and DMA sequences. Over the next five years, our specific aims are: (1) To improve the FASTA programs by: providing better performance on parallel (Beowulf) clusters; using vector-parallel instruction sets, and providing more accurate statistics. (2) To develop evolutionary calibrated DMA sequence comparison algorithms using rapid initial seeding, followed by extension using context dependent scoring matrices. The goal is to develop heuristic approaches with well understood evolutionary horizons. (3) To develop improved strategies for identifying repeated sequences in proteins by combining optimal local alignment strategies with appropriate scoring matrices and gap penalties, (4) To develop accurate statistical estimates for profile: sequence and profile: profile similarity searches. Profile: profile comparison programs with accurate statistical estimates should substantially reduce the sensitivity gap between sequence and structure comparison. Profile: profile comparisons will both be far more useful, and allow us to explore fundamental questions about how easy it is for new protein families to emerge. (5) We will examine local sequence constraints in proteins, using each family as an independent observation. We believe that much of the literature on the global properties of protein sequences fails to distinguish between correlations that reflect genuine biophysical constraints, and correlations that reflect shared evolutionary history. We will also search for clear examples of convergent evolution-similar functions carried out by clearly non-homologous proteins. Accurate statistical estimates for searches with real protein sequences, and profiles from real protein families, can change fundamentally the inference of homology from statistically significant similarity. Because of inaccurate statistical estimates, similarity searching is often considered a tool for generating hypotheses about homology, which must be confirmed experimentally. When the statistical estimates are highly accurate, it may become possible to define homology in terms of statistically significant similarity.           n/a",Comparison of Protein Sequences and Structures,7096765,R01LM004969,"['artificial intelligence', 'biochemical evolution', 'chemical information system', 'computer assisted sequence analysis', 'protein sequence', 'protein structure', 'statistics /biometry']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA CHARLOTTESVILLE,R01,2006,333081,0.05754166555452556
"Alignment-independent Classification of Proteins    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Human Genome project and related genome projects have stirred great hopes for improving our understanding and treatment of diseases. Central to this process is the automated detection of functional motifs and classification of protein sequences into families and/or subfamilies. Conventional approaches for protein sequence classification usually employ sequence alignment methods; other methods depend on the choice of the features included in the training sets, and on accuracy and availability of data. We propose an alignment-independent classification approach based on a search engine technology that had been successfully used in classifying medical records. Each protein is represented by a multidimensional vector, the elements of which refer to the protein's most discriminative eta-grams (sequences of eta amino acids). Preliminary studies on G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) showed that a simple Naive Bayes classifier using straightforward eta-gram feature   selection in its preprocessing, can outperform existing classifiers including support vector machines on previously investigated, standardized GPCR sequence data subsets. Jackknife tests applied to the Protein Information Resource (PIR) Protein Sequence Database PSD and to the Pfam database (DB) of protein families showed that approximately 70% of the protein sequences are classified correctly.  More significantly, the most discriminative eta-grams in a given protein family appear to have a functional or structural role, as suggested by their comparison with the sequence motifs known to be conserved or active in existing DBs and by the examination of the three-dimensional structure of representative members of the family. Encouraged by these results, we propose to pursue the following specific aims:   (1) develop a new computational tool for protein sequence analysis and protein classification based on eta-gram distributions, (2) build a comprehensive DB of protein families based on eta-gram distributions and investigate the relationships between this DB and the leading protein classification DBs, (3) determine the functional significance of the top-ranking n-grams, and (4) develop a Java based toolkit that will provide easy-to-use, yet flexible, web interface to researchers from various background. The expected deliverables are the methodology and software for classification without alignment (CWA); a new database of classified proteins, based on CWA; and an on-line server and GUI that will deliver the database and data mining tools to the scientific community in a user-friendly environment.         n/a",Alignment-independent Classification of Proteins,7050072,R01LM007994,"['Internet', 'classification', 'computer assisted sequence analysis', 'computer human interaction', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'molecular biology information system', 'molecular probes', 'protein localization', 'protein protein interaction', 'protein purification', 'protein sequence', 'protein structure function', 'technology /technique development']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2006,272070,0.13661635718846674

"Optimization of Folding and Threading Proteins    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Determining protein structure and function from genomic sequences and protein classification remains one of the most significant challenges in modern computational biology.  Significant enhancement to the capacity of algorithms to predict protein shapes from sequences is proposed, focusing on major bottlenecks; e.g., the folding energy and the ability of making approximate matches.  Algorithms to determine protein shapes from sequences have two major components: The first component (sampling) generates a set of plausible protein shapes; at least one of the sampled shapes is expected to be similar to the correct fold.  The second component scores the different structures and decides on the best model.  The radius of convergence of the energy function must be sufficiently large so that approximate matches will be detected as well (in threading approximate matches may include deletions and insertion).  It is therefore clear that poor scoring functions (or energies), which are unable to identify the correct fold, are likely to diminish the capacity of the folding algorithm.  At present, it is easy to generate a set of decoy (wrong) structures that will confuse existing energy functions.  Mathematical programming and machine learning techniques (Support Vector Machines) will design enhanced folding and threading potentials.  The training by these methods is automated and will lead to monotonic improvement in recognition as a function of the data size.  To more effectively cover protein space, the goal is to learn 100 million data points in a single consistent potential with (at most) 10,000 parameters.  The automated large scale learning is crucial at times in which the information on sequences and structures grows rapidly.

"Integration and analysis tools for protein interaction networks    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The growing size and diversity of biological databases has necessitated the design of new scalable tools that can search across multiple databases and integrate information from multiple data sources. We propose to develop software for integrating and understanding protein-protein interactions, a fundamental problem in biology. A set of tools will be developed for constructing large-scale probabilistic networks of protein interactions using data sources such as microarrays, bioimages, GO annotations, genomic data, literature, and experimental data. The techniques will be based on Bayesian networks (BN) and Support Vector Machines (SVM), and will be made scalable to large datasets. The second goal is to develop tools for analyzing interaction networks for pathway discovery, motif finding, and function identification. These tools will be based on current research in the areas of graph algorithms, bioinformatics, machine learning, and databases. We will target two model organisms: S. cerevisiae (yeast) and C. elegans (worm). The quality of the constructed networks will be evaluated with known protein interactions for these species. Scalability tests will be performed with the worm interactome that is about ten times larger than the yeast interactome. The developed tools will be compatible with current standards and integrated into a database backend. The resulting software will enable assimilation of heterogeneous biological data with the ultimate goal of increased understanding of fundamental processes in molecular biology. The goal of this Phase I project is to prove the feasibility of constructing and analyzing probabilistic protein interaction networks in a scalable manner using new algorithms. The integration of diverse data sources such as microarrays, genomics, literature, and high-throughput experiments into pathways will facilitate the study the biological processes behind human diseases. The understanding of protein interactions within a pathway and interactions between pathways will lead to the selection of appropriate targets for therapeutic intervention, and eventually to cheaper and faster drug discovery.             n/a",Integration and analysis tools for protein interaction networks,7155257,R43RR022659,"['information systems', 'model', 'protein protein interaction', 'proteins']",NCRR,"ACELOT, INC.",R43,2006,199950,0.08152512010097902
"Protein Packing Defects as Functional Markers and Drug Targets DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Our preliminary structure-based investigations show that water exclusion from deficiently packed hydrogen bonds and other pre-formed electrostatic interactions constitutes a driving factor conferring high specificity to protein association. Thus, an evolutionary conserved feature, the under-dehydrated hydrogen bond, termed dehydron, appears to be a structural marker for interactivity. Dehydrons were experimentally and statistically shown to constitute sticky spots on the protein surface and to be abundant at protein-protein interfaces, especially at those that cannot be understood in terms of standard interactions. The dehydron distribution on the surface of soluble proteins constitutes a determinant of the propensity for association and aberrant aggregation. The identification of dehydrons has relied so far on detailed structural information, a limitation precluding a proteomic analysis. This proposal is geared at introducing a sequence-based predictive method to establish the biological relevance of dehydrons and their potential as markers for drugable targets. Thus, we intend to introduce a powerful unsupervised scanning technology to detect signals of interactivity and drugability at a genomic scale. This goal requires constructing a machine-learning discriminator trained on a structural database. The over-all aim is to develop a sequence-based multi-purpose tool to expand the universe of drugable targets, diagnose propensity for aberrant aggregation and make interactomic inferences. The efficacy of our predictor will be tested on five grounds: a) Assaying for amino-acid variability and determining whether residues predicted solely from sequence to be engaged in dehydrons are actually conserved, b) Using a redundancy-free curated PDB sample as training set, we shall determine the accuracy and precision of the sequence-based predictor using a nonhomologous PDB complement set and annotated SwissProt entries as testing sets, c) Contrasting our results with an alternative dehydron predictor based on a reliable sequence-based predictor of native disorder (PONDR(r)). This dehydron predictor is based on a correlation found between the extent of hydrogen-bond packing and the score of structural disorder, d) Contrasting sequence-based diagnosis of amyloidogenic aggregation with SwissProt annotations and other annotated disease-related sequence repositories; e) Contrasting compiled drug-target quality assessments and structural data and screening profiles for protein-ligand associations with the predicted dehydron patterns. Thus, the novel design concept of ""drug inhibitor as a wrapper of functional packing defects"" will be explored and validated. n/a",Protein Packing Defects as Functional Markers and Drug Targets,7118204,R01GM072614,"['aminoacid', 'amyloid proteins', 'bioinformatics', 'biomarker', 'chemical genetics', 'computational biology', 'computer program /software', 'hydrogen bond', 'information systems', 'method development', 'pharmacogenetics', 'protein sequence', 'protein structure function', 'proteomics']",NIGMS,RICE UNIVERSITY,R01,2006,294217,0.07141720640013509
"A Bioinformatic Approach to Inferring Protein Contacts DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In response to the increased awareness for Bio-defense and the possibility of the spread of new emerging infectious pathogens, I propose to investigate the feasibility of predicting amino acid contacts for the three proteins of the replication/transcription complex of the order Mononegavirales (e.g. Ebola, Rabies, measles etc.). The large size of the replication/transcription complex is beyond the limits of current structural determination methods such as X-ray crystallography or NMR spectroscopy; therefore, an approach that correlates results from both laboratory and Bio-informatic analyses is a logical course of action. The proposed Bio-informatic studies will proceed along three paths: prediction of disorder; determination of compensatory mutation; and assessment of evolutionary dynamics. Correlating the data obtained from these methods and experimental data from the published literature will maximize the chances of identifying the protein: protein contact points both within and between the P, N, and L proteins of the replication/transcription complex. However, this poses the challenge of integrating the findings from the different methods in a meaningful and comprehensive way. A traditional joint probability distribution approach would require a space of O(2^n) to represent the data, with n being the number of data sets. Given the vast amount of information to be incorporated, this method is beyond current computational feasibility. Instead, a method from the field of artificial intelligence, Bayesian Networks (also known as Belief Networks) will be utilized to correlate the results. Several experimental laboratories have agreed to test the residue contact predictions resulting from these studies for Ebola, VSV and measles. n/a",A Bioinformatic Approach to Inferring Protein Contacts,6953781,R21AI063510,"['Mononegavirales', 'artificial intelligence', 'biochemical evolution', 'bioinformatics', 'biotechnology', 'computational biology', 'gene mutation', 'protein protein interaction', 'protein sequence', 'proteomics', 'virus protein']",NIAID,MONTANA STATE UNIVERSITY - BOZEMAN,R21,2005,166500,0.046158352226207164
"Urine protein markers of disease in lupus nephritis DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Lupus nephritis (LN) affects up to 65% of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients and results in renal failure in up to 42% of patients after five years. Renal failure rates can vary up to eight fold over five years in aggressive LN despite use of the same treatment protocol. A more reliable means of determining prognosis is therefore required. The long-term objective of this proposal is to identify noninvasive urine protein markers of disease that are predictive of renal compromise. Previous studies in this area have resulted in the identification of a limited number of candidate proteins that correlate with disease type and glomerular inflammatory activity. To develop models of prognostic indicators in a heterogeneous disorder such as LN, the candidate protein approach has limited power. The Specific Aims of this proposal are to determine: 1) differentially expressed proteins in the urine of LN subjects (revealed by proteomic techniques and artificial neural network (ANN) technology) as surrogate markers of the WHO class, activity, and chronicity of glomerular lesions on renal biopsy and 2) the feasibility of a larger study designed to examine these urine protein markers as predictors of renal outcome in LN. To address these aims, urine from 1) LN subjects undergoing renal biopsy and 2) subjects with either LN or SLE without LN will be analyzed using proteomic techniques. All subjects will be followed prospectively for renal outcomes. Urine proteins will be concentrated and resolved by 2D-gel electrophoresis. Spots will be identified by location and removed for identification by matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry and peptide mass fingerprinting. Data from these procedures will be analyzed using ANN modeling to determine surrogate urine protein markers of WHO class, activity, and chronicity of LN renal biopsies. ANN will be used to determine surrogate markers that predict compromise in renal function due to LN. These markers will be compared to renal biopsy and traditional laboratory and clinical indices of disease as predictors of renal outcome. Within the two years of this study, surrogate urine protein markers of biopsy findings should be identified, and the feasibility of a long-term outcome study should be determined. The ultimate results of this study could revolutionize the manner in which treatment for LN is determined. Due to the power of proteomic and ANN techniques, novel mediators of disease activity and damage should be identified and thus contribute to the development of more targeted therapies for LN. n/a",Urine protein markers of disease in lupus nephritis,6951552,R21AR051719,"['artificial intelligence', 'biomarker', 'clinical research', 'diagnosis design /evaluation', 'human subject', 'kidney disorder diagnosis', 'lupus nephritis', 'mass spectrometry', 'matrix assisted laser desorption ionization', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'patient oriented research', 'prognosis', 'protein purification', 'proteomics', 'two dimensional gel electrophoresis', 'urinalysis']",NIAMS,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,R21,2005,63000,0.06552582209234367

The dehydron distribution on the surface of soluble proteins constitutes a determinant of the propensity for association and aberrant aggregation. The identification of dehydrons has relied so far on detailed structural information, a limitation precluding a proteomic analysis. This proposal is geared at introducing a sequence-based predictive method to establish the biological relevance of dehydrons and their potential as markers for drugable targets. Thus, we intend to introduce a powerful unsupervised scanning technology to detect signals of interactivity and drugability at a genomic scale. This goal requires constructing a machine-learning discriminator trained on a structural database. The over-all aim is to develop a sequence-based multi-purpose tool to expand the universe of drugable targets, diagnose propensity for aberrant aggregation and make interactomic inferences. The efficacy of our predictor will be tested on five grounds: a) Assaying for amino-acid variability and determining whether residues predicted solely from sequence to be engaged in dehydrons are actually conserved, b) Using a redundancy-free curated PDB sample as training set, we shall determine the accuracy and precision of the sequence-based predictor using a nonhomologous PDB complement set and annotated SwissProt entries as testing sets, c) Contrasting our results with an alternative dehydron predictor based on a reliable sequence-based predictor of native disorder (PONDR(r)). This dehydron predictor is based on a correlation found between the extent of hydrogen-bond packing and the score of structural disorder, d) Contrasting sequence-based diagnosis of amyloidogenic aggregation with SwissProt annotations and other annotated disease-related sequence repositories; e) Contrasting compiled drug-target quality assessments and structural data and screening profiles for protein-ligand associations with the predicted dehydron patterns. Thus, the novel design concept of ""drug inhibitor as a wrapper of functional packing defects"" will be explored and validated. n/a",Protein Packing Defects as Functional Markers and Drug Targets,6965896,R01GM072614,"['aminoacid', 'amyloid proteins', 'bioinformatics', 'biomarker', 'chemical genetics', 'computational biology', 'computer program /software', 'hydrogen bond', 'information systems', 'method development', 'pharmacogenetics', 'protein sequence', 'protein structure function', 'proteomics']",NIGMS,RICE UNIVERSITY,R01,2005,309178,0.07141720640013509
"A Bioinformatic Approach to Inferring Protein Contacts DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In response to the increased awareness for Bio-defense and the possibility of the spread of new emerging infectious pathogens, I propose to investigate the feasibility of predicting amino acid contacts for the three proteins of the replication/transcription complex of the order Mononegavirales (e.g. Ebola, Rabies, measles etc.). The large size of the replication/transcription complex is beyond the limits of current structural determination methods such as X-ray crystallography or NMR spectroscopy; therefore, an approach that correlates results from both laboratory and Bio-informatic analyses is a logical course of action. The proposed Bio-informatic studies will proceed along three paths: prediction of disorder; determination of compensatory mutation; and assessment of evolutionary dynamics. Correlating the data obtained from these methods and experimental data from the published literature will maximize the chances of identifying the protein: protein contact points both within and between the P, N, and L proteins of the replication/transcription complex. However, this poses the challenge of integrating the findings from the different methods in a meaningful and comprehensive way. A traditional joint probability distribution approach would require a space of O(2^n) to represent the data, with n being the number of data sets. Given the vast amount of information to be incorporated, this method is beyond current computational feasibility. Instead, a method from the field of artificial intelligence, Bayesian Networks (also known as Belief Networks) will be utilized to correlate the results. Several experimental laboratories have agreed to test the residue contact predictions resulting from these studies for Ebola, VSV and measles. n/a",A Bioinformatic Approach to Inferring Protein Contacts,6814915,R21AI063510,"['Mononegavirales', 'artificial intelligence', 'biochemical evolution', 'bioinformatics', 'biotechnology', 'computational biology', 'gene mutation', 'protein protein interaction', 'protein sequence', 'proteomics', 'virus protein']",NIAID,MONTANA STATE UNIVERSITY (BOZEMAN),R21,2004,203950,0.046158352226207164
"COMPARISON OF PROTEIN SEQUENCES & STRUCTURES   DESCRIPTION (adapted from the Abstract):                                                                                                                                  The long-term goal of our research is the development of better methods for          identifying distantly related protein and DNA sequences, and to exploit our          ability to detect distant homologies to explore the duplication, fusion, and         other processes responsible for increases in protein diversity.  Although            similarity searching is now a routine first step in the characterization of          newly determined sequences, we believe that additional improvements in               similarity searching methods will allow investigators to look back more deeply       in evolutionary time.  Moreover, as complete protein sequence sets become            available for more organisms, sequence information can be exploited more             effectively for functional genomics and traditional biochemical problems.  The       availability of complete genome sequences, combined with reliable and                sensitive sequence comparison algorithms, also allows us to test hypotheses          about the possible emergence of novel proteins over the past 200-1,200 million       years.  Over the next five years, our specific aims are: (1) To extend the           average look-back time provided by protein sequence similarity searching.  We        propose improvements to the scoring methods and statistics analysis of               similarity scores that seek to push back the protein similarity-search horizon       from 1.5-2-fold, to more than 2,000 million years for most protein families.         (2) To develop a higher performance, more flexible and user-friendly FASTA           package.  (3) To study repeated domains in proteins.  We will develop more           quantitative methods for identifying both simple sequence and long-period            repeats in proteins.  We will characterize the fraction of repeat-containing         proteins in proteomes, characterize the fraction of domain-structured proteins       that are not internally repetitive, and ask whether these proteins duplicate         or diverge with patterns that differ from ""normal"" single domain proteins.           (4) To explore genome-scale protein evolution and to identify potential              ""novel"" or ""young"" protein families or domains.  Over the next 2-4 years, more       than six genomes that have diverged in the last 400 million years - an               evolutionary distance sufficiently short that we should be able to identify          all protein homologs - will become available.  We will compare complete              genomes searching for newly emergent sequences.  (5) We will develop and             characterize unified methods for the simultaneous construction of alignments         and phylogenies over multiple sequences.

"PREDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS FOR STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A central challenge in bioinformatics today is developing computational methods for predicting a protein's structure, function, and biologically relevant partners at the whole-genome level. The first two problems are well-studied, but research on determining partners for given protein sequences is just beginning. The long-term goal is to create an automated system for predicting protein-protein interactions at the whole-genome level. This proposal focuses on the coiled coil motif, whose regular and repeating structure makes it an ideal model for computational detection. Also, advances in predicting coiled coil formation have important biological and medical consequences, since the coiled coil is widespread in sequence databases (3-5%), appearing in proteins that participate in transcription, oncogenesis, cell structure, and cell fusion events. The proposed method combines experimental data, coiled coil sequence information, and statistical information from protein sequences and 3-D structures to determine partner specificity between individual helices. The method is general enough to be extended to other protein domains and thus predict other protein-protein interactions and extract functional information.   n/a",PREDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS FOR STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES,6908827,F31GM066377,"['artificial intelligence', 'computer simulation', 'mathematical model', 'model design /development', 'molecular biology information system', 'predoctoral investigator', 'protein protein interaction', 'protein sequence', 'statistics /biometry']",NIGMS,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,F31,2004,18979,0.12141009924133872
"Urine protein markers of disease in lupus nephritis DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Lupus nephritis (LN) affects up to 65% of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients and results in renal failure in up to 42% of patients after five years. Renal failure rates can vary up to eight fold over five years in aggressive LN despite use of the same treatment protocol. A more reliable means of determining prognosis is therefore required. The long-term objective of this proposal is to identify noninvasive urine protein markers of disease that are predictive of renal compromise. Previous studies in this area have resulted in the identification of a limited number of candidate proteins that correlate with disease type and glomerular inflammatory activity. To develop models of prognostic indicators in a heterogeneous disorder such as LN, the candidate protein approach has limited power. The Specific Aims of this proposal are to determine: 1) differentially expressed proteins in the urine of LN subjects (revealed by proteomic techniques and artificial neural network (ANN) technology) as surrogate markers of the WHO class, activity, and chronicity of glomerular lesions on renal biopsy and 2) the feasibility of a larger study designed to examine these urine protein markers as predictors of renal outcome in LN. To address these aims, urine from 1) LN subjects undergoing renal biopsy and 2) subjects with either LN or SLE without LN will be analyzed using proteomic techniques. All subjects will be followed prospectively for renal outcomes. Urine proteins will be concentrated and resolved by 2D-gel electrophoresis. Spots will be identified by location and removed for identification by matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry and peptide mass fingerprinting. Data from these procedures will be analyzed using ANN modeling to determine surrogate urine protein markers of WHO class, activity, and chronicity of LN renal biopsies. ANN will be used to determine surrogate markers that predict compromise in renal function due to LN. These markers will be compared to renal biopsy and traditional laboratory and clinical indices of disease as predictors of renal outcome. Within the two years of this study, surrogate urine protein markers of biopsy findings should be identified, and the feasibility of a long-term outcome study should be determined. The ultimate results of this study could revolutionize the manner in which treatment for LN is determined. Due to the power of proteomic and ANN techniques, novel mediators of disease activity and damage should be identified and thus contribute to the development of more targeted therapies for LN. n/a",Urine protein markers of disease in lupus nephritis,6838455,R21AR051719,"['artificial intelligence', 'biomarker', 'clinical research', 'diagnosis design /evaluation', 'human subject', 'kidney disorder diagnosis', 'lupus nephritis', 'mass spectrometry', 'matrix assisted laser desorption ionization', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'patient oriented research', 'prognosis', 'protein purification', 'proteomics', 'two dimensional gel electrophoresis', 'urinalysis']",NIAMS,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,R21,2004,63000,0.06552582209234367
"Alignment-independent Classification of Proteins    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Human Genome project and related genome projects have stirred great hopes for improving our understanding and treatment of diseases. Central to this process is the automated detection of functional motifs and classification of protein sequences into families and/or subfamilies. Conventional approaches for protein sequence classification usually employ sequence alignment methods; other methods depend on the choice of the features included in the training sets, and on accuracy and availability of data. We propose an alignment-independent classification approach based on a search engine technology that had been successfully used in classifying medical records. Each protein is represented by a multidimensional vector, the elements of which refer to the protein's most discriminative eta-grams (sequences of eta amino acids). Preliminary studies on G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) showed that a simple Naive Bayes classifier using straightforward eta-gram feature   selection in its preprocessing, can outperform existing classifiers including support vector machines on previously investigated, standardized GPCR sequence data subsets. Jackknife tests applied to the Protein Information Resource (PIR) Protein Sequence Database PSD and to the Pfam database (DB) of protein families showed that approximately 70% of the protein sequences are classified correctly.  More significantly, the most discriminative eta-grams in a given protein family appear to have a functional or structural role, as suggested by their comparison with the sequence motifs known to be conserved or active in existing DBs and by the examination of the three-dimensional structure of representative members of the family. Encouraged by these results, we propose to pursue the following specific aims:   (1) develop a new computational tool for protein sequence analysis and protein classification based on eta-gram distributions, (2) build a comprehensive DB of protein families based on eta-gram distributions and investigate the relationships between this DB and the leading protein classification DBs, (3) determine the functional significance of the top-ranking n-grams, and (4) develop a Java based toolkit that will provide easy-to-use, yet flexible, web interface to researchers from various background. The expected deliverables are the methodology and software for classification without alignment (CWA); a new database of classified proteins, based on CWA; and an on-line server and GUI that will deliver the database and data mining tools to the scientific community in a user-friendly environment.         n/a",Alignment-independent Classification of Proteins,6777359,R01LM007994,"['Internet', 'classification', 'computer assisted sequence analysis', 'computer human interaction', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'molecular biology information system', 'molecular probes', 'protein localization', 'protein protein interaction', 'protein purification', 'protein sequence', 'protein structure function', 'technology /technique development']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2004,278711,0.13661635718846674
"Optimization of Folding and Threading Proteins    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Determining protein structure and function from genomic sequences and protein classification remains one of the most significant challenges in modern computational biology.  Significant enhancement to the capacity of algorithms to predict protein shapes from sequences is proposed, focusing on major bottlenecks; e.g., the folding energy and the ability of making approximate matches.  Algorithms to determine protein shapes from sequences have two major components: The first component (sampling) generates a set of plausible protein shapes; at least one of the sampled shapes is expected to be similar to the correct fold.  The second component scores the different structures and decides on the best model.  The radius of convergence of the energy function must be sufficiently large so that approximate matches will be detected as well (in threading approximate matches may include deletions and insertion).  It is therefore clear that poor scoring functions (or energies), which are unable to identify the correct fold, are likely to diminish the capacity of the folding algorithm.  At present, it is easy to generate a set of decoy (wrong) structures that will confuse existing energy functions.  Mathematical programming and machine learning techniques (Support Vector Machines) will design enhanced folding and threading potentials.  The training by these methods is automated and will lead to monotonic improvement in recognition as a function of the data size.  To more effectively cover protein space, the goal is to learn 100 million data points in a single consistent potential with (at most) 10,000 parameters.  The automated large scale learning is crucial at times in which the information on sequences and structures grows rapidly.  A threading prediction server, based on the old and the new potentials, is and will be available, to the community at http://ser-loopp.tc.cornell.edu/Ioopp.html         n/a",Optimization of Folding and Threading Proteins,6727166,R01GM067823,"['bioinformatics', 'chemical models', 'computational biology', 'molecular shape', 'protein folding', 'protein sequence']",NIGMS,CORNELL UNIVERSITY ITHACA,R01,2004,261122,0.08032020509088034

"COMPUTER ANALYSIS AND PREDICTION OF PROTEIN STRUCTURE The amino acid sequence of a protein uniquely determines its tertiary structure.  Deciphering this relationship, the protein folding problem has become increasingly important to molecular biologists.  With the dramatic progress of the genome initiatives within the public and private sector and the push for a structural genomics initiative in the post-genomic era, the need for computational strategies to relate protein sequence to protein structure become even more profound.  This proposal describes new directions in our effort to improve the accuracy of protein secondary structure and to use these results and others to improve the results of threading algorithms that map new sequences onto existing structures.  We continue to be impressed by the information inherent in a family of protein sequences, especially when viewed from an evolutionary perspective.  A study of the ligand binding domain and the corresponding ligands of intranuclear hormone receptors is planned.  This effort will link computation, molecular biology and synthetic chemistry efforts to better understand this pharmacologically exciting group of molecules.

"Flexible NLP system for MEDLINE information extraction DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Small Business Innovation and Research Phase I project focuses on the development of the fully automatic system for extraction of the protein function information from MEDLINE abstracts and conversion it into a form of a conceptual graph. All existent protein function databases depend on human experts who cannot keep up with the exponential growth of protein function information freely available in MEDLINE. There is an urgent need for an automatic system capable of extracting protein function information from literature. The system we proposed will be based on advanced natural language processing (NLP) technologies, and uses it as a fast and reliable way to extract information about protein function from human readable sources. To this end, we have developed and tested MedScan - a prototype of such system that parses scientific abstracts and converts protein function information into a form of a conceptual graph. It consists of a preprocessor module selecting candidate sentences from MEDLINE, an NLP module utilizing proprietary linguistic model to parse the selected sentences, and an information extraction module utilizing developed ontology to extract and validate protein function information. The results of MedScan evaluation indicate that it is a feasible candidate for a proposed task. In Phase II, the software system will be developed to assist the researchers to quickly access, search and navigate through the MEDLINE content, and to visualize and analyze the large volumes of protein function data.

"PREDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS FOR STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A central challenge in bioinformatics today is developing computational methods for predicting a protein's structure, function, and biologically relevant partners at the whole-genome level. The first two problems are well-studied, but research on determining partners for given protein sequences is just beginning. The long-term goal is to create an automated system for predicting protein-protein interactions at the whole-genome level. This proposal focuses on the coiled coil motif, whose regular and repeating structure makes it an ideal model for computational detection. Also, advances in predicting coiled coil formation have important biological and medical consequences, since the coiled coil is widespread in sequence databases (3-5%), appearing in proteins that participate in transcription, oncogenesis, cell structure, and cell fusion events. The proposed method combines experimental data, coiled coil sequence information, and statistical information from protein sequences and 3-D structures to determine partner specificity between individual helices. The method is general enough to be extended to other protein domains and thus predict other protein-protein interactions and extract functional information.   n/a",PREDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS FOR STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES,6546956,F31GM066377,"['artificial intelligence', ' computer simulation', ' mathematical model', ' model design /development', ' molecular biology information system', ' predoctoral investigator', ' protein protein interaction', ' protein sequence', ' statistics /biometry']",NIGMS,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,F31,2002,38804,0.12141009924133872

"Advancing Protein Engineering Using Artificial Intelligence and the ProtaBank Mutation Database PROJECT SUMMARY Therapeutic antibodies, specialized enzymes for drug manufacturing, small molecule drug screening agents, and other proteins have been instrumental in advancing biotechnology and medicine. Protein therapeutics alone represents a rapidly growing $100+ billion market with broad applications in the treatment of cancer, inflammatory and metabolic diseases, and numerous other disorders. Most of the antibodies and other protein therapeutics developed in the last several years have been engineered, leading to improvements in important properties such as efficacy, binding affinity, expression, stability, and immunogenicity. However, improving protein properties through sequence modification remains a challenging task. Artificial intelligence (AI), which has been enormously successful in several fields (e.g., image recognition, self-driving cars, natural language processing), is now being applied to protein engineering and has the potential to transform this field as well. AI and machine learning (ML) can take advantage of large and diverse datasets to identify correlations, predict beneficial mutations, and explore novel protein sequences in ways that are not possible using other techniques. Other advantages include the ability to simultaneously optimize multiple protein properties and explore sequence space more efficiently. In Phases I and II of this project, we developed the ProtaBank database as a central repository to store, organize, and annotate protein mutation data spanning a broad range of properties. ProtaBank is the largest and only database actively collecting such a comprehensive set of sequence mutation data and is growing rapidly due to the wealth of data being generated with advanced automation and next-generation sequencing techniques. ProtaBank's depth and breadth makes it an ideal data source to train ML models. This proposal aims to create the ProtaBank AI Platform to enable the use of AI and ML tools to apply the data in ProtaBank to engineer proteins. The platform will provide fully customizable computational tools and will invoke protein-specific knowledge to properly prepare data for use with ML models. An interface to popular ML frameworks will be provided so that scientists can use these techniques to discover new predictive algorithms and enhance their ability to design proteins with the desired properties. Specific aims include: (1) integrating peer validated ML methods and proprietary technology for protein engineering into the ProtaBank AI Platform, (2) developing dynamic ML dataset creation tools, (3) expanding and improving the ProtaBank database by reaching out to scientists to contribute data, (4) enhancing our data deposition tools, and (5) integrating ProtaBank with the Protein Data Bank structure database and other databases. ! Project Narrative Protein engineering has enabled significant advances in health care by playing a key role in the development of antibodies and other protein therapeutics (e.g., for the treatment of cancer, inflammatory and metabolic diseases, and other disorders), highly selective enzymes for drug manufacturing, and novel proteins for use in diagnostics and the identification of new small molecule drugs. This project will enable the power of artificial intelligence (AI) to be applied to accelerate the engineering of proteins with new and improved properties. AI approaches can capitalize on the large amounts of protein mutation data being generated and stored in our recently developed ProtaBank protein mutation database to transform the way in which protein therapeutics and reagents are discovered and developed.!",Advancing Protein Engineering Using Artificial Intelligence and the ProtaBank Mutation Database,9994932,R44GM117961,"['Affinity', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antibodies', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automation', 'Automobile Driving', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Biotechnology', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Drug Screening', 'Engineering', 'Enzymes', 'Generations', 'Healthcare', 'Image', 'Inflammatory', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Meteor', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Mutation', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Preparation', 'Property', 'Protein Engineering', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reagent', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic antibodies', 'Training', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'computerized tools', 'data submission', 'data warehouse', 'database structure', 'deep learning', 'design', 'flexibility', 'immunogenicity', 'improved', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning method', 'multitask', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'peer', 'prediction algorithm', 'protein structure', 'repository', 'small molecule', 'therapeutic protein', 'tool']",NIGMS,"PROTABIT, LLC",R44,2020,495160,0.12595532413868368
"Synergistic integration of topology and machine learning for the predictions of protein-ligand binding affinities and mutation impacts Project Summary Fundamental challenges that hinder the current understanding of biomolecular systems are their tremendous complexity, high dimensionality and excessively large data sets associated with their geometric modeling and simulations. These challenges call for innovative strategies for handling massive biomolecular datasets. Topology, in contrast to geometry, provides a unique tool for dimensionality reduction and data simplification. However, traditional topology typically incurs with excessive reduction in geometric information. Persistent homology is a new branch of topology that is able to bridge traditional topology and geometry, but suffers from neglecting biological information. Built upon PI’s recent work in the topological data analysis of biomolecules, this project will explore how to integrate topological data analysis and machine learning to significantly improve the current state-of-the-art predictions of protein-ligand binding and mutation impact established in the PI’s preliminary studies. These improvements will be achieved through developing physics-embedded topological methodologies and advanced deep learning architectures for tackling heterogeneous biomolecular data sets arising from a variety of physical and biological considerations.

"Towards a comprehensive multiscale 3D human interactome network PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Almost all proteins function through interacting with other proteins. On average, a protein interacts with ~5 other protein partners in the current human interactome. Therefore, it is of great importance to accurately determine the interface of each interaction, in order to understand how each protein works with different partners to carry out different functions. In our previous Nature Biotechnology study, we implemented a proteome-scale homology modeling approach to generate the first 3D human structural interactome: the interface for each interaction in this network was determined at atomic resolution through co-crystal structures and homology models. Using our 3D interactome, we found that, among >1,800 known disease genes associated with two or more clinically distinctly disorders, pairs of mutations on the same gene but in different interfaces with different partners are significantly more likely to cause distinct diseases. However, only 4,150 human protein interactions have co-crystal structures and 2,921 have high-quality homology models. ~50,000 interactions (87% of the current human interactome) are not amenable to current structural modeling methods. Here, we propose to develop a big-data-driven machine-learning approach integrating biophysiochemical, evolutionary, structural, and population genetic features to identify interaction- specific interfaces for the whole human interactome. Because several key features are unavailable for many proteins and interactions, we propose an innovative approach to use an ensemble of random forest classifiers, named Ensemble Protein Interface Classifier (EPIC), to address this large-scale non-random missing data problem (Aim 1). The high throughput of our massively parallel Clone-seq and INtegrated PrOtein INteractome perTurbation screening (InPOINT) pipeline! uniquely enables us to perform real-time experimental parameter optimization (in Years 2-4 we will clone ~1,500 mutations and examine their impact on ~2,500 interactions every year to iteratively evaluate and refine EPIC; Aim 2). Finally, we will construct a comprehensive multiscale 3D interactome for all known human protein-protein interactions: we will collect/generate atomic- resolution structural models for interactions whenever possible (co-crystal structures and homology models); we will accurately determine interaction-specific interface residues and domains for the whole human interactome. We will deploy an interactive web portal to disseminate our results and allow functional genomic inference in the context of our structural interactome (Aim 3). Our comprehensive multiscale 3D human interactome and the accompanying web portal will greatly reduce the barrier-to-entry for performing systematic structural analysis on a large number of proteins and their interactions, and open the flood gates for such analyses in genomic studies. NARRATIVE Almost all proteins function through interacting with other proteins and the structural details of these interaction interfaces are key in understanding protein function. However, the interfaces for vast majority of human protein interactions are currently unknown. Here, we propose to establish an innovative ensemble classifier approach and implement an unprecedented large-scale computational-experimental iterative learning scheme to predict interfaces for the whole human interactome, in anticipation that our predicted interfaces will help dissect functional sites of disease mutations and be useful for rational drug design to target these sites.",Towards a comprehensive multiscale 3D human interactome network,9963288,R01GM124559,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Big Data', 'Binding', 'Biotechnology', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Crystallization', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Drug Design', 'Evolution', 'Floods', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Homology Modeling', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Missense Mutation', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Names', 'Nature', 'Population Genetics', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Publishing', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Scheme', 'Site', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'Study models', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Work', 'biological research', 'functional genomics', 'human interactome', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'protein function', 'protein protein interaction', 'random forest', 'screening', 'three dimensional structure', 'user-friendly', 'web portal', 'web-accessible']",NIGMS,CORNELL UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,384165,0.07834322588325304
"Unsupervised optimization of protein therapeutics using closed-loop in vitro synthesis, nanosensing, and deep-learning Project Summary Overview of research: The Reuel Group at Iowa State University (founded Fall 2016) seeks to develop new materials, methods, and measurement devices for biomanufacturing, biotherapeutics, and biosensors. We have active work-streams in 1) optical nanosensors for protein binding, enzymatic activity, and cell membrane disruption, 2) scalable and reliable cell free protein synthesis (CFPS) methods for protein prototyping (extract and genetic template improvements), 3) microfluidics for droplet generation and measurement of CFPS products, interrogated by nanosensors, 4) algorithms for `big data' generated from nanosensors (machine learning and deep learning methods), 5) engineered endospores for time-delayed synthetic biology circuits, and 6) resonant radio frequency sensors for biomanufacturing, wound healing, and water quality. The overall vision of the research program is to simplify and improve the design and manufacturing of biological products (cells and proteins) for applications in therapies, advanced materials, and bio-electronics. Protein based therapies have demonstrated in clinic to be a potent tool in the treatment of many diseases. In recent years, the design, build, and test cycle to find therapies for new disease targets has improved dramatically using techniques such as surface display coupled to evolutionary selection. However, these mutagenic approaches have a few limitations, namely: 1) they require a suitable, naturally occurring sequence as a starting point, 2) they frequently optimize solely on a single desired feature, and 3) they operate as a `black box', meaning that generalizable design rules for in silico prediction of future products is not possible. It is the purpose of this MIRA for ESI research plan to design a closed-loop system that allows for unsupervised design and discovery of protein therapeutics that overcomes these limitations. Over the next five years we will build and integrate the system components which include enzymatic DNA synthesis coupled to cell free protein synthesis to rapidly prototype libraries of custom proteins in micro-droplet reactors. These proteins will then be characterized in the micro-droplets using optical nanosensors, to test for desired features such as stability, binding affinity, selectivity, hydrolytic activity, and/or membrane penetration. This will produce a large labeled data set (tying sequence to phenotypic properties) that can be used to train a deep learning neural network to self-determine sequence patterns for specific properties. Once the tuning coefficients of the network are found, the algorithm will then predict next best sequences which will be synthesized, tested, etc. such that the design loop progresses unsupervised until optimization criteria are met. This new approach will result in faster development of protein therapies that are optimized based on multiple criteria and not tied to existing, natural sequences. For patients this translates to more efficacious therapies with less side effects and a potential for reduced cost (due to shortened design timeline). At the end of the five-year project we will seek to translate this technology, via NIH SBIR funding, such that the new technology can make an impact on actual therapies. Project Narrative This project seeks to develop advanced tools to enable faster discovery and design of protein-based drugs for new disease targets. These tools would enable optimization of multiple parameters simultaneously, creating more potent therapies with less side effects. Thanks to speeding up the development cycle and reducing the time to market, these tools also have the potential to reduce end cost to patients.","Unsupervised optimization of protein therapeutics using closed-loop in vitro synthesis, nanosensing, and deep-learning",10028304,R35GM138265,"['Affinity', 'Algorithms', 'Big Data', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biological Products', 'Biological Response Modifier Therapy', 'Biomanufacturing', 'Biosensor', 'Cell membrane', 'Cells', 'Clinic', 'Coupled', 'Custom', 'DNA biosynthesis', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Electronics', 'Engineering', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genetic Template', 'In Vitro', 'Iowa', 'Label', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Membrane', 'Methods', 'Microfluidics', 'Optics', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Penetration', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Property', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Protein Engineering', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Speed', 'Stream', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Uses', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'falls', 'improved', 'in silico', 'learning strategy', 'nanosensors', 'new technology', 'novel strategies', 'programs', 'prototype', 'radio frequency', 'sensor', 'side effect', 'synthetic biology', 'therapeutic protein', 'tool', 'treatment optimization', 'water quality', 'wound healing']",NIGMS,IOWA STATE UNIVERSITY,R35,2020,327666,0.08588043499641042
"Accelerating Site-specific Characterization of Protein Therapeutics with Novel Machine Learning Methods PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Title: Accelerating Site-specific Characterization of Protein Therapeutics with Novel Machine Learning Methods The project seeks to improve reliability and speed up the development of life-saving and life-enhancing, precision, protein therapeutics and magnify the positive impact of biomedical research and education worldwide, leading to a quantum leap in our understanding of the molecular and cellular pathways and mechanisms involved in healthy and diseased biological systems. The development of biologics is bottlenecked across the entire drug development process, from discovery to early stage candidate selection, process development and manufacturing, due to manual intervention in the mass spectrometry data analysis pipeline. Similarly, the proteomics research community is hindered as it moves from analysis of complex mixtures to more in-depth characterization of proteins and their modifications. Novel machine learning methods will be added to MassMatrix’s (LC-MS/MS software) proven analytical engine and visualization platform to minimize the loss of true positive peptide spectral matches. An innovative approach for efficient accountability of experimental data at the chromatogram level will also be researched, developed and added. The latter providing for easy traceability of each peak’s status in the chromatogram as soon as possible, thus providing convenient high-level assessment. Together, these aims are expected to improve the reliability and accuracy of results as well as to significantly reduce the mass spec bottleneck for the pharmaceutical industry and the research community. Deeper understanding and better decision making will follow, both having a potentially dramatic positive impact on downstream processes and resource deployment, including improved drug safety and efficacy.

"Quantifying molecular consequences of human missense variants with large-scale interactome perturbation studies Almost all proteins function through interacting with other proteins. Previous studies have shown that the vast majority of damaging single amino acid mutations in proteins disrupt only a subset of specific protein-protein interactions, and that mutations in the same protein that disrupt different interactions tend to cause clinically distinct disorders. Therefore, it is of great importance to determine interaction-specific disruptions caused by each mutation. Furthermore, rapid advances in sequencing technologies have enabled the identification of tens of millions of single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in the human population, driving an urgent need to understand the impact of each SNV on the human interactome network. Unfortunately, there is currently no method that is capable of predicting the specific impact of a large fraction of these SNVs on individual protein-protein interactions. To address this issue, we propose to leverage our massively-parallel site-directed mutagenesis pipeline, Clone-seq, to generate clones for ~6,000 coding SNVs in the human population: ~4,000 from gnomAD and ~2,000 to be submitted by the international human genetics community. We will then experimentally examine the impact on protein stability and individual protein-protein interactions for every variant using high-throughput DUAL-FLUO and InPOINT (integrating PCA, LUMIER, Y2H, and wNAPPA) assays. This proposal brings together three groups with complementary expertise in high-throughput interactome experiments and network analysis from the Yu lab, in genomic and population genetic studies from the Clark lab, and in comprehensive biophysical and structural modeling of mutation’s impact on binding free energy of protein interactions from the Alexov lab. Out of the ~6,000 SNVs, we expect to identify ~1,200 disruptive SNVs and ~4,000 different SNV-interaction pairs where the SNV disrupt that specific interaction. The data produced by our project will increase the available experimental information by >140× in number of human proteins and >500× in number of interactions, allowing us for the first time to comprehensively assess the relationships between the impact of SNVs on interactions and their various population genetic attributes (including, but not limited to, allele frequency and flanking haplotype, inter-population differentiation, local rate of recombination, allele age, modes of selection). Finally, we will establish a computational-experimental- integrated iterative learning scheme to build a multi-layer random-forest-based framework, SIMPACT, which can accurately predict specific impacts on all individual protein-protein interactions for all missense SNVs. Our proposed work will fuel hypothesis-driven research, will significantly improve our functional understanding of variants, and will likely fundamentally change the experimental design and data interpretation for whole genome/exome studies going forward. The dramatic increase of DNA variants discovered through advances in sequencing technologies has been inadequately translated into therapeutic successes. Although many of these variants are related to human disorders, the overwhelming number of non-functional variants makes the assessment of functional significance a steep challenge. In this study, we aim to develop a high-throughput pipeline to quickly clone and directly test a large number of coding variants for their impact on the human interactome network and use the results to build a machine learning pipeline to predict functional impact of all coding variants, in anticipation that both our experimental data and computational pipeline will lead to broad clinical and therapeutic applications.",Quantifying molecular consequences of human missense variants with large-scale interactome perturbation studies,9872026,R01GM125639,"['Address', 'Age', 'Alleles', 'Amino Acids', 'Automobile Driving', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Assay', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Coupling', 'Crystallization', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Experimental Designs', 'Free Energy', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genes', 'Genetic Recombination', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Haplotypes', 'Homology Modeling', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Individual', 'International', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Output', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Population Genetics', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Scheme', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Site-Directed Mutagenesis', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'biological research', 'biophysical model', 'biophysical techniques', 'computational pipelines', 'data pipeline', 'exome', 'experimental study', 'human interactome', 'improved', 'interest', 'molecular phenotype', 'mutant', 'next generation sequencing', 'protein function', 'protein protein interaction', 'random forest', 'screening', 'success', 'web portal', 'whole genome']",NIGMS,CORNELL UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,563248,0.11112636184956917
"Computational modulator design and machine learning to target protein-protein interactions Abstract The overall goal of my research program is to develop and apply computational tools to facilitate the rational design of modulators of important cellular pathways for therapeutic use. Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are central factors in cellular signaling and gene regulation networks. Their misregulation is associated with a variety of diseases, including cancer, neurodegenerative disease, autoimmune disease, and diabetes. Inevitably, many PPIs are biologically compelling targets for drug discovery. But despite a few notable successes, most PPIs have not been successfully targeted and remain undruggable. The fundamental challenge derives from their intrinsic structural features: the binding surfaces of many PPIs are generally large in area, flat, and dynamic. PPIs are often transient and involve multivalent contacts. Currently, one most promising PPI inhibitor discovery strategy is to use miniature protein domain mimetics (PDMs) to reproduce the key interface contacts utilized by nature. PDMs are advantageous as medium-sized molecules with high surface complementarity and a broader set of contact points than typical small molecules, but are still limited because—by definition—only a portion of the total PPI binding energy is captured in the interaction. The binding affinity of the synthetic domains is often lower than the cognate full-length proteins. On the other hand, targeted covalent inhibition is an orthogonal therapeutic approach fit to overcome the fundamental binding limitations at PPIs, but has a well-known drawback: the high reactivity of typical covalent warheads leads to nonspecific inhibition, and toxicity. Here we aim to develop computational methods for a new design strategy that will leverage the strengths of these two methods—PDMs and covalent inhibition—while simultaneously mitigating their respective limitations. The focus of the effort is to rationally discover potent inhibitors that will non-covalently recognize and then covalently target protein-protein binding interfaces with exquisite specificity. Furthermore, our development of robust scoring functions by integrating multitask machine learning and molecular modeling would significantly accelerate the rational drug discovery process. The planned work builds on our recent advances in three state-of-the-art computational approaches: AlphaSpace for fragment- centric topographical mapping of PPI interfaces; ab initio QM/MM molecular dynamics for modeling covalent inhibition; and a novel delta-machine learning strategy to simultaneously improve scoring, docking and screening performance of a protein-ligand scoring function. Our design efforts will result in highly specific and potent modulators of a variety of therapeutically important but previously undruggable PPI interfaces, providing new leads for drug development. Project Narrative Our computational methodology development work will lead to powerful computational tools for rational design of covalent and non-covalent inhibitors, which would significantly accelerate the drug discovery process. Our computational modulator design would result in highly specific and potent inhibitors of a variety of therapeutic targets, which can be used as tools for studying cell signaling and gene regulation, and as new leads for drug development.",Computational modulator design and machine learning to target protein-protein interactions,9926115,R35GM127040,"['Affinity', 'Area', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biological', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Drug Targeting', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Goals', 'Length', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Tertiary Protein Structure', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Uses', 'Toxic effect', 'Work', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'improved', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'learning strategy', 'mimetics', 'molecular dynamics', 'molecular modeling', 'multitask', 'novel', 'programs', 'protein protein interaction', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'success', 'therapeutic target', 'tool']",NIGMS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R35,2020,491993,0.04129744766653498
"Structure based Prediction of the interactome The interactions of small molecules with proteins is not only omnipresent throughout cellular processes, but also of fundamental importance to drug design and disease treatment. Much like with protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions, high-throughput (HTP) experimental methods have led to the generation of enormous volumes of protein-small molecule and related data. However, in addition to sheer scale, high degrees of heterogeneity in these data, combined with proprietary ownership concerns when originating from within industry, present significant challenges to the sharing and full use of this data in basic research and therapeutic development. This proposal aims to develop new mathematical methods that can address not only interpreting the data itself, but also the collaborative and generative process through which researchers work: new cryptographic tools can enable unprecedented forms of secure sharing and collaboration between industry and the public, and deep learning of structural features can reduce the dependence of researchers on prior assumptions as to important predictors of drug-target interactions (DTI).  In our previous granting period, we successfully developed methods for structure-based prediction and HTP data analysis of protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions, uncovering novel biology (e.g., for neurodegenerative diseases). In this renewal, we aim to: 1) develop scalable methods for multi-party computation and differential privacy to enable the secure sharing of large proprietary drug-target interaction databases among industry and public researchers; 2) develop novel integrative machine learning approaches for identifying drug-target interactions based on interactome, molecular structure and chemogenomic data (in collaboration with co-I Jian Peng); and 3) establish innovative collaborations with industry, academia and the scientific community to drive use and adoption of these computational tools and technologies among practicing biomedical researchers.  Successful completion of these aims will provide both public and private research communities with scalable access to technologies for secure sharing of proprietary drug screening data as well as flexible, accurate tools for predicting drug-target interactions. All developed software will be made available via publicly accessible web-based portals under open source software licenses. Collaborations with research partners will validate the relevance of these tools to human health and disease, while the dissemination aim will ensure research communities convenient and ongoing access to these innovations. Narrative The interactions of small molecules with proteins are omnipresent throughout cellular processes and of fundamental importance to drug design and disease treatment, yet the task of predicting these interactions brings major challenges because of the heterogeneity and proprietary nature of the data.

"Distance-based ab initio protein structure prediction Project Summary Predicting the three-dimensional structures of proteins without using known structures from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) as templates (ab initio) remains a grand challenge of computational biology. Whereas template-based modeling is now a mature field, ab initio modeling is a comparatively nascent one, especially for large proteins with complex topologies and multiple domains. The need for advances in ab initio modeling is evident. A lot of protein sequences do not have (recognizable) templates in the PDB, and the pace of experimental structure determination is incommensurate with the scale of the problem. Herein, we propose a new approach to ab initio modeling that consists of novel deep learning architectures to predict inter- residue distances and domain boundaries as well as robust, iterative optimization methods to construct tertiary structures from the predicted distances. This project builds on the success of our current R01, particularly the outstanding performance of the Cheng group in the 2018 worldwide protein structure prediction experiment – CASP13 – where our MULTICOM suite ranked among the top three tertiary structure predictors, alongside Google DeepMind’s AlphaFold. The methods will be implemented as open-source tools for the emerging field of distance-based ab initio protein structure modeling. We will apply the methods to study protein homo-oligomers and self-assemblies, based on our novel discovery that the quaternary structure contacts within homo-oligomers can be predicted by deep learning methods from the co-evolutionary signals embedded in multiple sequence alignments of protein monomers. Furthermore, we will apply the methods to predict the folds, functional sites, superfamilies, and protein-protein interactions of proteins that contain “essential Domains of Unknown Function” (eDUFs), a group of evolutionarily conserved, essential proteins that represents an important uncharted region of protein function/fold space. The predictions for a diverse and representative subset of eDUFs will be experimentally validated through a unique collaboration with the structural biology group of Dr. Tanner. Project Narrative Three-dimensional protein structure information is indispensable in modern biomedical research, but experimental techniques will only resolve a small fraction of known proteins due to the considerable cost. This project will develop cutting-edge computational methods based on modern artificial intelligence (AI) technology to reliably predict protein structures from sequence information alone.

"Mass Spectrometry Measurements for Complex PTMs Abstract:  Recombinant protein expression technology has revolutionized human health research, enabling scientists to generate large quantities of protein for small-molecule drug discovery campaigns, for the development of protein-based drugs, and for studying protein structure and function. Yet while researchers are adept at producing proteins with known genetic sequences, they possess entirely inadequate knowledge about the protein's post-translational modifications, both during recombinant expression and when the proteins are isolated from endogenous sources. Alterations in a protein's post-translational modifications can change the protein from an active enzyme to a dead one; they can change a protein-based drug from a life-saving molecule to one that is either ineffective or worse, dangerously immunogenic; these seemingly simple “add- ons” to proteins can be the defining features that determine whether the protein functions as designed or not. Characterizing proteins' PTMs is a necessary prerequisite for identifying disease states, modulating protein binding and function, and producing safe and effective protein-based drugs and vaccines. The long term goals of my research program are to expedite the analysis of post-translational modifications (PTMs) on proteins, to use these analytical tools to answer critical health-related challenges, and to widely distribute the technology. We are pursuing both near-term advancements, such as developing a robust solution to quantifying aberrant disulfide bonds in recombinant proteins, as well as long-range, revolutionary changes in the way proteins are analyzed, by laying the foundational infrastructure needed to bring artificial intelligence solutions to the field of PTM analysis. We will develop and launch these technologies in the context of meaningful biological problems where field advancements cannot be made without information about proteins' PTMs. Solutions in the fields of HIV vaccine design, cancer treatment, and antibody therapy will be targeted first. Project Narrative:  Rapid, precision tools are needed to assess and quantify proteins' post-translational modifications (PTMs); such tools will drive the production of optimal proteins and enable the detection of disease biomarkers.

"NMR Fingerprinting: Leveraging optimal control pulse design, tailored isotope labeling, and machine learning to study intractable proteins Project summary Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is essential for the study structure, dynamics and function of proteins in near-native conditions. NMR studies have vital implications for therapeutic development. However, as the number of amino acids in the protein increases, NMR signals decay (relax) faster, yielding lower sensitivity and resolution, while the spectrum becomes more crowded. In these cases it is challenging to match observed signals to specific nuclei in the protein (called `resonance assignment') in order to meaningfully interpret NMR data. The overarching goal of our research is to push the boundaries of NMR enabling valuable insight about the dynamics and functions of currently intractable proteins. The objective of this project is to design an NMR platform consisting of coordinated, next-generation biochemical, biophysical, mathematical, and computational techniques. Our platform is built around an original approach to NMR spectroscopy in which new information about the local environment of each nucleus is encoded in the shape and pattern of its NMR signal. The rationale is that these patterns are a `fingerprint' – an intricate and unique signature that encodes key information about which atom is responsible for each resonance peak in the NMR spectrum. We will design and realize fingerprint patterns using two innovative approaches: 1) biochemically, by selectively introducing NMR-active isotopes into carefully chosen positions in the protein samples, and biophysically, and 2) by using specialized radiofrequency pulses to accurately control the quantum interactions that determine the NMR spectrum. The resulting fingerprints will be decoded using established algorithmic structures from machine learning, notably artificial neural networks. This will facilitate automated analyses that are accessible to non-NMR specialists. Our approach to spectroscopy holds promise in the study of therapeutically important proteins expressed in eukaryotic expression systems (e.g. G-protein coupled receptors and glycosylated proteins). Current NMR data from such proteins shows clear dynamics and interactions with other proteins, but cannot yet be properly interpreted because of the difficulty of relating each NMR peak to an amino acid in the protein sequence. Our platform will deliver two significant outcomes: 1) NMR resonance assignment for meaningful analyses of previously intractable systems. 2) Enable non-NMR specialists, to easily proceed from expressing their protein sample to using NMR to study dynamics and interactions via assigned spectra. This will have a positive impact on protein science and medical research. To support our mission we have assembled a team of leading experts to test our platform with their own protein systems. Project Narrative Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is used to study the structure, function, interactions, and dynamics of proteins, with important implications for therapeutic development. However, interpreting NMR information is extremely challenging and labor intensive, especially for large proteins, which produce many overlapping, weak NMR signals. We are developing next-generation methods in which key information is more clearly visible and accessible in the NMR data, using a highly coordinated platform of emerging biochemical, biophysical, mathematical, and computational techniques.","NMR Fingerprinting: Leveraging optimal control pulse design, tailored isotope labeling, and machine learning to study intractable proteins",9942654,R01GM136859,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Amino Acids', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Models', 'Biophysics', 'COSY', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Chemicals', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer software', 'Coupling', 'Crowding', 'Cryoelectron Microscopy', 'Data', 'Drug Design', 'Environment', 'Fingerprint', 'Frequencies', 'G-Protein-Coupled Receptors', 'Goals', 'HMQC', 'Hour', 'Investigation', 'Isotope Labeling', 'Isotopes', 'Label', 'Machine Learning', 'Mainstreaming', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Research', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modernization', 'Molecular Weight', 'NMR Spectroscopy', 'Nuclear', 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Protein Dynamics', 'Proteins', 'Pyruvate', 'Relaxation', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Science', 'Shapes', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specialist', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Structural Protein', 'Structure', 'System', 'TOCSY', 'Testing', 'Textbooks', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Studies', 'Time', 'Training', 'Vertebral column', 'X-Ray Crystallography', 'artificial neural network', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'control theory', 'cost', 'design', 'experimental study', 'innovation', 'insight', 'instrument', 'methyl group', 'next generation', 'nonlinear regression', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'nuclear power', 'protein function', 'quantum', 'radio frequency', 'reconstruction', 'therapeutic development']",NIGMS,DANA-FARBER CANCER INST,R01,2020,495502,0.06668707164647143
"Structure prediction and in silico screening of protein-peptide interactions Protein-peptide interactions are prevalent in many cellular processes, such as signal transduction, transcription regulation, and immune response. Peptide-based therapeutics have attracted much attention in recent years, and a significantly growing number of peptide-based medicines have been designed and approved for a variety of diseases. Therefore, studying protein-peptide interactions is of great significance for mechanistic investigation of many biological processes and for peptide therapeutic development. However, because of the difficulties and cost for determining such structures by X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy, currently there are only a limited number of protein-peptide complex structures in the Protein Data Bank. Thus, the ability to predict protein- peptide complex structures will have a far-reaching impact on understanding important biological processes and on designing therapeutic interventions. However, structure prediction for protein-peptide complexes is challenging, particularly due to peptide flexibility. In this project, we will address this challenging issue by innovative integration of bioinformatics and physical modeling approaches. Specifically, we propose to achieve four goals: Goal #1: We will develop novel deep-learning models for protein-peptide structure prediction. Despite successful application of deep learning to protein structure prediction and protein-ligand interaction, deep learning has not been applied to protein-peptide structure prediction yet, due to the flexibility and the resulting large degrees of freedom in peptides. Goal #2: We will develop the first in silico screening method for the search of peptide-based inhibitors, and will construct novel peptide libraries for screening. Our in silico method will be an attractive complement to valuable experimental technologies such as phage display and yeast two-hybrid system for rapid peptide screening at much lower cost. Goal #3: We will convert our computational algorithms into a modular, extensible, open-source software package that can be disseminated to the computational modeling community at no cost. Goal #4. As a proof-of-concept application of our in silico screening method, we will screen for novel peptide leads by targeting β-lactamase to combat antibiotic resistance, in collaboration with my experimental collaborator whose expertise is in molecular biology, biochemistry and microbiology. The ability to predict protein-peptide complex structures will have a far-reaching impact on understanding important biological processes and on designing therapeutic interventions. We propose to tackle the challenge of protein- peptide structure prediction, including developing the first in silico peptide screening method to dramatically save cost and time. We will screen for peptide inhibitors by targeting β-lactamase to combat antibiotic resistance.",Structure prediction and in silico screening of protein-peptide interactions,9932088,R35GM136409,"['Address', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Attention', 'Biochemistry', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Process', 'Cell physiology', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Models', 'Computer software', 'Disease', 'Freedom', 'Goals', 'Immune response', 'Investigation', 'Ligands', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Biology', 'NMR Spectroscopy', 'Peptide Library', 'Peptides', 'Phage Display', 'Proteins', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'X-Ray Crystallography', 'base', 'beta-Lactamase', 'combat', 'cost', 'data warehouse', 'deep learning', 'design', 'flexibility', 'in silico', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'novel', 'open source', 'peptide drug', 'peptide structure', 'physical model', 'protein structure prediction', 'screening', 'therapeutic development', 'yeast two hybrid system']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI-COLUMBIA,R35,2020,391207,0.08180466954254405
"High-throughput discovery of protein energy landscapes in natural and designed proteomes Project Summary All folded proteins continuously fluctuate between their low-energy native structures and higher-energy “hidden” conformations that can be partially or fully unfolded. Although each protein molecule passes through its high- energy conformations only a small fraction of the time, these states have major physiological consequences. Partially-folded states of natural proteins can lead to protein aggregation, organ failure, and death. Partially- folded states of therapeutic proteins can induce dangerous anti-drug antibodies. The energetic balance between the native, folded state and these diverse higher-energy states – in other words, the overall “energy landscape” – is thus critically important in protein aggregation and immunogenicity, as well as in allostery, signaling, off- target drug interactions and numerous other phenomena. Despite decades of research into energy landscapes our overall understanding is very limited: few proteins have been characterized in depth, accurate computational predictions are very challenging, and experimental measurements are expensive, slow, and labor-intensive. We propose a transformational approach to understand protein energy landscapes by integrating a new massively parallel experimental method, machine learning, and protein design. First, we are developing a new high-throughput assay using hydrogen exchange mass spectrometry to measure energy landscapes for thousands of proteins in parallel. This method finally brings the study of protein energy landscapes into the “omics” age. Critically, these experiments reveal both the overall folding stability and the energies of conformational fluctuations in each protein. For a subset of proteins (tens to hundreds), these parallel experiments reveal the specific sites of conformational fluctuations as well. Using this approach, we will measure the energy landscapes of thousands of natural proteins and tens of thousands of computationally designed proteins custom-built to systematically probe how specific properties affect energy landscapes. We will then train machine learning models to predict energy landscapes from sequence and structure, as well as optimize physical force fields to accurately model high-energy protein states. We will also catalyze advances in modeling throughout the community by organizing large-scale competitions at blind prediction of energy landscapes. Finally, with these new predictive models in hand, we will pursue a unique application: the development of energetically-optimized screening libraries for therapeutic protein and biological probe discovery. This overcomes a major challenge in drug and probe development. In sum, this study provides the experimental and computational tools to bring hidden protein states to light quantitatively on a massive scale. This fundamentally shifts our perspective: instead of examining energy landscapes only when they cause problems, we can make energy landscape analysis a central tool in biology and bioengineering. Project Narrative All proteins continuously move between their folded state and “hidden” higher-energy states that can be partially or fully unfolded. These hidden states have an important impact on how proteins interact, how they become activated, and whether they aggregate. Here, we combine protein design with a totally new high-throughput experimental approach to reveal these high-energy states for thousands of proteins in parallel, and apply these advances to build a new generation of computational models of protein energetics.",High-throughput discovery of protein energy landscapes in natural and designed proteomes,10002881,DP2GM140927,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Antibodies', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Cessation of life', 'Communities', 'Computer Models', 'Custom', 'Dangerousness', 'Development', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Targeting', 'Equilibrium', 'Generations', 'Hand', 'Hydrogen', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Organ failure', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Property', 'Protein Engineering', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Research', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Time', 'Training', 'blind', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'experimental study', 'high throughput screening', 'immunogenicity', 'predictive modeling', 'protein aggregation', 'protein folding', 'screening', 'therapeutic protein', 'tool']",NIGMS,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,DP2,2020,2347906,0.09910151755622365
"A predictive model of mRNA stability and translation for variant interpretation and mRNA therapeutics The leading and trailing untranslated regions (UTRs) of an mRNA, along with the coding sequence (CDS), control protein production by modulating translation and mRNA stability. However, although we have identified a vast number of regulatory features in these regions, we are still far from being able to predict, for example, whether and how a sequence variant affects the levels of protein being made. Here, we propose to combine high-throughput experimental characterization of protein expression in synthetic libraries with machine learning to create predictive models of translation and mRNA stability, addressing an urgent need. Recent progress in machine vision, voice recognition and other fields of computer science has been driven by the availability of enormous data sets on which to train models. Machine learning approaches have also had remarkable impact in biology, but biological data sets often are comparatively small, limiting the quality of models that can be learned. For example, there are only around 20,000 genes in the human genome, a restrictively small set of examples for training a predictive model that captures the full extent of the genome’s “regulatory code.” In this proposal, we aim to overcome this data size limitation by training predictive models of protein expression on data from millions of synthetic constructs -- a data set several orders of magnitude larger than the number of genes in the genome. Specifically, we will create libraries of in vitro transcribed mRNA with targeted variation in the UTRs and CDS and will assay protein expression of each library member by performing high-throughput polysome profiling, ribosome profiling, and mRNA stability assays. We will then use neural network approaches to learn predictive models of the relationship between mRNA sequence and levels of protein production. We will apply our models to three applications of practical importance: first, we expect to uncover novel biology, for example identifying regulatory sequence elements and interactions between them. Second, we will validate our models through the de novo design and experimental testing of sequences that result in higher levels or protein production than any of the millions of randomly generated members of the original library or than the endogenous UTR sequences currently used in biotechnology. Such stable and highly translating mRNA constructs would be of particular value for the field or mRNA therapeutics. Third, we will predict the functional consequences of genetic variation in UTRs on protein production and we will validate these predictions experimentally. We are far from understanding which genetic variants compromise gene regulatory function in ways that may contribute to disease, making such a comprehensive and quantitative analysis of variants valuable. This research project aims to use machine learning to build predictive models of translation and mRNA stability. Models are trained on data obtained by measuring protein production for millions of synthetic RNA constructs. Models will then be applied for understanding the consequences of genetic variation in humans and for the design of mRNA therapeutics.",A predictive model of mRNA stability and translation for variant interpretation and mRNA therapeutics,9894822,R01HG009892,"['3&apos', ' Untranslated Regions', '5&apos', ' Untranslated Regions', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Biotechnology', 'Code', 'Computational Technique', 'DNA Library', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Expression Library', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Programming', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Translation', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Human', 'Human Engineering', 'Human Genetics', 'Human Genome', 'Image', 'In Vitro', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Performance', 'Polyribosomes', 'Production', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'RNA Splicing', 'RNA Stability', 'RNA-Binding Proteins', 'Randomized', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Ribosomes', 'Role', 'Site', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Thiouridine', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Untranslated Regions', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'comparative', 'computer science', 'convolutional neural network', 'design', 'experimental study', 'genetic variant', 'mRNA Stability', 'machine vision', 'member', 'neural network', 'novel', 'polysome profiling', 'practical application', 'predictive modeling', 'protein expression', 'ribosome profiling', 'screening', 'stable cell line', 'statistical learning', 'synthetic construct', 'voice recognition']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2020,473065,0.04824304586488791
"Coupling a multifunctional tag to scalable endogenous tagging technology for improved genome-wide perturbation screens Project Summary  Characterizing the functions of protein-coding genes is an important goal in the post-genomic era. While proteins are the ultimate effectors of most cellular functions, including those mis-regulated in disease, we have an extremely limited understanding of the roles of the majority of proteins in the human proteome. Though powerful, existing technologies for the high-throughput interrogation of protein-coding genes, including CRISPR/Cas9-based approaches and RNA interference, require extended periods of time to effect changes in protein levels, and thus suffer two critical shortcomings. First, they are unable to detect the contribution of growth- essential genes to any cellular process other than viability, as any cell carrying a perturbation in such a gene would fail to propagate. Second, compensatory and adaptive effects have ample opportunity to manifest, thus convoluting screen results by ameliorating the effect of the perturbation, or by generating a novel, unrelated effect. To address these critical limitations, I propose to develop a new screening technology that will minimize the time between perturbation and screen readout by inducibly and rapidly degrading endogenous proteins. This is made possible by a readily scalable endogenous tagging technology that harnesses homology-independent targeted integration to insert a synthetic exon into the intron of a protein-coding gene at the site of a double strand break. The synthetic exon will encode a multifunctional ligand-binding protein that depending on the ligand, will lead to fluorescence or rapid degradation. Pooled libraries of sgRNAs targeting different introns allows for the creation of custom libraries of cells, where each cell carries this multifunctional tag on a different protein. The utility of this approach will be established aims 1 and 2 by testing (1) whether cells that have undergone rapid depletion of growth-essential proteins are maintained in the cell library at the end of the short perturbation window and (2) whether rapid depletion and CRISPR knockout at the same protein produce different effects on a well-established phenotype, due to the distorting effects of adaptation events in the knockout. Aim 3 witnesses the use of a machine learning approach and the data from thousands of attempted tagging events to identify how the features of a potential tag site dictate the likelihood that a functional protein carrying the multifunctional tag will be produced. The resulting model will be unleashed on the protein-coding genome to predict high-quality tag sites for as many protein-coding genes as possible. This will establish an improved screening paradigm that will allow for the pooled interrogation of the contributions of thousands of proteins to a phenotype of interest, will thus accelerate the rate at which we come to understand the poorly understood elements of the protein-coding genome. These efforts will be well supported by the outstanding resources for experimentation and mentorship at both the University of Pennsylvania and the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, and will provide excellent training in experimental techniques for protein perturbation and characterization, as well computational literacy in the broadly useful field of machine learning. Project Narrative  Proteins are the ultimate effectors of most cellular functions in health and disease. Yet, the functions of the majority proteins encoded by the human genome are very poorly understood.

"Data-driven Computational Modeling and Refinement of Protein Structures on Genomic Scales PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: A key remaining gap in our understanding of biological systems at the molecular level is how to structurally annotate the “dark” protein families—the portion of protein families unsolved by experimental structure determination techniques and inaccessible to homology modeling. Nearly a quarter of protein families are currently dark, where molecular conformation is completely unknown and this gap is likely to expand further with the rapid accumulation of new protein sequences without annotated structures. The key challenge is now how to bridge this gap to gain a comprehensive understanding of biology and disease, thereby paving the way to structure-based drug design at genomic scale. Computational protein modeling plays a key role in this effort due to its scalability and genome-wide applicability. My laboratory focuses on the development and application of novel data-driven computational modeling and refinement methods to increase accuracy and coverage of protein structure prediction on genomic scale irrespective of homology. Future research focuses on improving homology-free protein folding using multiscale de novo modeling driven by deep learning-based inter-residue interactions, enhancing low-homology threading or fold recognition by formulating new algorithms for remote template identification despite low evolutionary relatedness, and developing methods for high-resolution restrained structure refinement guided by generalized ensemble search for driving computational models to near-experimental accuracy. Proteome-wide computational modeling and refinement effort will be conducted, leveraging our unique access to large-scale supercomputing infrastructure, to build high-confidence models covering the dark protein families, which will be organized in a database for public access. This comprehensive database of structural annotations will shed light on the structures, functions, and interactions of the dark proteome, with broad implications in drug discovery and human health. Software and web servers will be freely disseminated to help worldwide community of biomedical researchers to apply these methods to their specific research problems, thus multiplying the impact of computational modeling on basic research in biology and medicine. My research program will involve close collaborations with other NIGMS-supported investigators, create training opportunities for the next generation of researchers including members from underrepresented groups, and foster future research advances in structural bioinformatics and computational biology. PROJECT NARRATIVE: A comprehensive atomic-level annotation of protein structures is essential for understanding the molecular basis of complex diseases and facilitating structure-based drug design. Lack of structural annotation of a major fraction protein universe, the so-called dark families, is a key gap in our understanding of molecular biology and diseases.

"Unraveling molecular and system-level mechanisms of human disease-associated protein mutations Project Summary Although a quickly expanding catalogue of protein mutations have been discovered, including those that cause human diseases or confer drug resistance, mechanistic understanding and prediction of functional consequences of these mutations remain rather limited. There is a critical need to develop novel, multiscale computational frameworks that are rigorous and generalizable to help close the ever-increasing gap between phenotypic data and mechanistic knowledge about the mutations and to develop effective therapeutic strategies.  My long-term research goals are two folds: (1) to unravel how a change in protein sequence ripples through various aspects of molecular and system-levels to a change in cellular function and cause human diseases or confer drug resistance; and (2) to translate learned mechanistic knowledge to effective drug-design strategies for human diseases and drug resistance. Toward these goals I propose to advance and combine the strengths of computational molecular biology (structural modeling and design for proteins or protein interactions) and computational systems biology (pathway/network-level topology and dynamics) and follow a novel, formal paradigm to develop methods that systematically identify mechanisms underlying various stages of consequence propagation (from conformation, molecular and system-level variables, to cellular functions, where intermediates can be skipped if necessary). In the forward direction of propagating consequences, I will determine, explain and understand mutational consequences at various levels with machine learning, causal analysis, and combinatorial optimization, starting with known or modelled changes at various levels. In the inverse direction of designing consequences, I will follow known or learned mechanistic hypotheses and develop efficient combinatorial optimization methods to design mutagenesis experiments or screen / design ligands for desired perturbations at various levels, which would test and refine corresponding hypotheses directly and translate mechanistic hypotheses to therapeutic strategies. Mechanisms underlying distal (potentially allosteric) mutations, multiple mutations within a protein or across proteins as well as systems pharmacology strategies will also be rigorously determined in the process.  The expected outcomes from the innovative project will include two main components. The first will be both biophysical principles of proteins and integrative understanding of biomedical systems, which will be organized in a database for public access. The second will be translating mechanistic insights into therapeutic intervention strategies to treat diseases. In particular, targeted experiments (mutagenesis or ligand-binding) will be designed following known or discovered mechanistic hypotheses. This project will involve close collaboration with structural biologists and clinician-scientists who are active collaborators of the PI. Project Narrative Genetic mutations, many of which lead to protein mutations, are often associated with human diseases: they often directly cause diseases or contribute to their progressions.

"Understanding membrane proteins’ allosteric modulation with cryo-EM Project Summary/Abstract My laboratory's research is focused on understanding the molecular mechanisms key to the regulation of membrane protein function and to the modulation of their output signaling. We use cryo-EM and advanced classification methods, such as manifold embedding, combined with modeling and molecular dynamics to study how ligands produce shifts in conformation equilibria and bias signaling output. We are currently studying two systems that allow us to study how different types of ligands influence the gating of ion channels. We are studying the role of lipids in triggering gating of mechanosensitive channels of the MscS family, a model system of membrane tension-sensing which can yield important information about the fundamental principles governing ion channel gating and the role that lipid-protein interactions play in this process. We have a longstanding interest in the mechanism and modulation of the ryanodine receptor (RyR), a calcium release channel fundamental to heart and skeletal function. We are using manifold embedding, a machine learning-based method to analyze cryo-EM images, to better understand how small molecules and ions such as calcium and ATP affect the conformational energy landscape of the channel. We aim to shed light on the gating mechanism of this very large ion channel, a prerequisite to understanding of its modulation by protein ligands, post-translational modifications and drugs. Our approach to these fundamental problems is to use a commbination of cryo-electron microscopy, advanced image classification techniques, modelling and molecular dynamics simulations to delineate allosteric pathways mechanistically and then test proposed models with biophysical methods such as single-channel measurements, HDX-MS and mutagenesis. Our ultimate aim is to greatly increase our molecular understanding of the gating and allosteric modulation of ion channels. Progress towards such knowledge has the potential to open the way for the design of small molecule allosteric modulators with very well controlled effects on their targets, aiding the development of drugs with limited side effects. A longer-term aim is to further develp and use our tools towards gaining a better understanding of allosteric modulation in other classes of membrane proteins of therapeutic importance. In particular, G protein-coupled receptor ligands can induce the selective binding of different transducers in a process called biased signaling. The molecular mechanisms at play in this process are still poorly understood despite their fundamental importance for the development of safer drugs. Project Narrative Ion channels are involved in a large number of vital processes, such as heart and muscle function for the ryanodine receptor and function of kidneys and regulation of blood pressure for mechanosensitive channels. This work focuses on understanding the function and regulation of ion channels. Better understanding of small ligand and lipid-protein interactions in these channels can lead more generally to a better understanding of ion channels function and to the design of drugs treating the numerous diseases associated with their malfunction.",Understanding membrane proteins’ allosteric modulation with cryo-EM,9985149,R35GM133598,"['Affect', 'Binding', 'Biological Models', 'Calcium', 'Classification', 'Cryoelectron Microscopy', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Design', 'Family', 'G-Protein-Coupled Receptors', 'Heart', 'Image', 'Ion Channel', 'Ion Channel Gating', 'Ions', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratory Research', 'Lead', 'Ligands', 'Light', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Membrane', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Muscle function', 'Mutagenesis', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Regulation', 'Renal function', 'Role', 'Ryanodine Receptor Calcium Release Channel', 'Signal Transduction', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Transducers', 'Work', 'base', 'biophysical techniques', 'blood pressure regulation', 'design', 'drug development', 'heart function', 'interest', 'molecular dynamics', 'protein function', 'side effect', 'skeletal', 'small molecule', 'therapeutic protein', 'tool']",NIGMS,ADVANCED SCIENCE RESEARCH CENTER,R35,2020,392500,0.053966430574987435
"Altering Hepatitis B Virus assembly through pharmacological intervention Project Summary/Abstract Viruses are one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide, with Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) being one of the most infectious and prevalent among them. Roughly 250 million people worldwide suffer from chronic HBV infection, including 1-2 million in the United States. Of those infected, approximately 15-25% will develop se- rious liver problems, including cirrhosis, cancer, and ultimately failure, leading to 600,000 deaths annually. While therapies exist to manage chronic HBV infection, all target viral genomic processes such as reverse transcription and DNA replication, and none provide a cure due to viral persistence and resistance. A promising orthogonal approach to eliminating infection is to target HBV's capsid, the protein shell that encapsulates the viral genome. The Finn laboratory has previously developed compounds that induce the misdirected assembly of non-functional HBV capsids, showing that small molecules have the power to affect the structures of these large multi-protein assemblies. While much is known about the structures of the intermolecular interactions with these compounds identiﬁed after the fact, little about the dynamics of such interactions has been explored, and a predictive under- standing of functional (antiviral) binding has yet to be developed. Both deﬁciencies will begin to be addressed in this program. Using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations coupled with in vitro experiments on HepAD38 cells, the PIs have identiﬁed seven compounds based on motifs previously unknown to interact with HBV that target the capsid assembly process. These compounds bind in a known pocket at the interface of two capsid-protein (Cp) dimers, possess moderate antiviral activity, and low toxicity. In the ﬁrst aim, using docking, free-energy perturba- tion, and synthetic chemistry, the PIs will optimize the lead compound to improve its efﬁcacy against HBV. In the second aim, using molecular dynamics simulations, advanced free-energy calculations, and experimental assays on different HBV protein oligomers, up to and including the whole virus capsid, the PIs will determine how small molecules interfere with capsid assembly. Both aims will beneﬁt from using a machine-learning-based classiﬁ- cation scheme as well as novel enhanced sampling methods. The lessons learned here concerning how small molecules can re-direct the assembly pathway into unproductive conformations can be generalized for application to other viruses. Project Narrative In spite of the dramatic increase in our understanding of the structure and properties of hepatitis B virus (HBV), this pathogen remains a major threat to human health. That knowledge also makes HBV an important test case for new antiviral strategies. This project aims to limit the impact of HBV by using computer simulations and synthetic chemistry to develop an improved understanding of the assembly process of HBV as well as new drugs that can eliminate HBV infection in ways that may be generalized to other pathogenic viruses.",Altering Hepatitis B Virus assembly through pharmacological intervention,10051923,R01AI148740,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Capsid', 'Capsid Proteins', 'Cations', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic Hepatitis B', 'Cirrhosis', 'Classification', 'Classification Scheme', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Coupled', 'Cryoelectron Microscopy', 'DNA biosynthesis', 'Development', 'Docking', 'Encapsulated', 'Equilibrium', 'Failure', 'Free Energy', 'Goals', 'HIV-1', 'Health', 'Hepatitis B Virus', 'Human', 'Image', 'In Vitro', 'Infection', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Liver', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmacology', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protein Conformation', 'Protein Dynamics', 'Resistance', 'Reverse Transcription', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Structure', 'Synthesis Chemistry', 'Testing', 'Toxic effect', 'United States', 'Viral', 'Viral Genome', 'Virus', 'Virus Assembly', 'Virus Diseases', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'design', 'dimer', 'drug development', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'intermolecular interaction', 'lead optimization', 'molecular dynamics', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic virus', 'programs', 'protein oligomer', 'protein protein interaction', 'protein structure', 'simulation', 'small molecule', 'success', 'viral genomics']",NIAID,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2020,407510,0.034149041017949626
"Integrative approach to studying LncRNA functions ABSTRACT  Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play regulatory roles in biological cell process and disease development. It has been emerging as a key regulator of diverse cellular processes. Great efforts have been made towards investigation of lncRNA functions with both experimental determination and theoretical modeling, leading to a rudimentary understanding of this class of RNAs. However, all of these cannot keep pace with the fast growth of diverse genetic data and urgent request of individual lncRNA function annotation, which is inhibited by the tremendous amount of lncRNAs and expensive experimental cost. This propose aim to address this issue by providing efficient and user-friendly tools for key lncRNA discovery and lncRNA function annotation. To do so, we will develop a unique bioinformatics and Systems Biology integrated approach, ISSNLncFA system, which enables the integration of all sorts of omics data and a comprehensive understanding of lncRNA functions.  We propose three specific aims for the ultimate lncRNA function annotation: (1) To develop a novel Co- Modules-based LncRNA Function Annotation (CoMoLncFA) model to detect key lncRNAs and to annotate lncRNA functions at post transcription level as lncRNA-PCG co-modules, lncRNA-pathways association network and lncRNA’s triplets (lncRNA-miRNA/TF-PCG) by considering the expression profiles of lncRNA, protein coding genes and miRNAs and transcript factors, and integrating the curated protein-protein interactions and biological pathways. (2) To develop a novel Structure-based LncRNA-protein Function Annotation (STRULncFA) model to characterize lncRNAs identified from Aim 1 by using their primary sequences and secondary structures for detecting lncRNA-protein functional relations; and to further reveal the regulatory roles and mechanism of these lncRNAs by determining the binding sites in both lncRNA and protein. (3) To experimentally validate the identified abnormal lncRNAs and their cellular products, to validate the identified lncRNA-protein interacting pairs and the predicted binding sites, and to develop software tools and an environment for functional annotation of lncRNAs, use these tools to evaluate the overall proposed approach, and apply them to identify lncRNA functions that may be involved in cell states, species, diseases and cancers and build lncRNA function databases.  We believe that we will build the models, tools and databases, and make them available to the public in a timely fashion. Our achievements will lead to a complete understanding of lncRNA functions and regulatory roles in cell and disease states. Moreover, our models and tools will be feasibly transformed to other function annotation tasks and disease studies with appropriate changes, and thus will move forward the general function annotation community and disease-related drug or therapy development. Project Narrative The ISSNLncFA software package will allow the investigators to characterize the LncRNA functions by integrating RNA-Seq, micorRNA-Seq, and together with protein and RNA structure data with systems biology approaches. As a prototype to test our system, we aim to use this system to study myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs). Although MDS is used as the prototype of disease for this proposal, the system developed will be applicable to multiple diseases with complex phenotypes.",Integrative approach to studying LncRNA functions,9983714,R01GM123037,"['3-Dimensional', 'Achievement', 'Address', 'Architecture', 'Binding Sites', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Breast', 'CD34 gene', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Chronic Disease', 'Code', 'Colorectal', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dysmyelopoietic Syndromes', 'Embryonic Development', 'Environment', 'Enzymes', 'Evaluation', 'Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomic Imprinting', 'Growth', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hematopoietic stem cells', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Liver', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Network-based', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'Transcript', 'Triplet Multiple Birth', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Work', 'X Chromosome', 'base', 'chromatin modification', 'chromatin remodeling', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'gene function', 'genomic data', 'high throughput technology', 'learning network', 'next generation', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'protein function', 'protein protein interaction', 'prototype', 'scaffold', 'software development', 'structured data', 'support vector machine', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'tool development', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'user-friendly']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R01,2020,302225,0.05682798971377806
"Advanced approaches to protein structure prediction Abstract The success of genome sequencing over the last four decades has resulted in a rapidly increasing gap between the number of known protein sequences and the number of known protein structures and functions. Because protein sequence on its own cannot tell us what each molecule does in cells, the large-scale absence of protein structure and function information severely hinders the progress of contemporary biological and medical studies. These gaps in understanding strongly call for efficient computational approaches for automated, yet highly accurate protein structure prediction and function annotation. The PI’s lab has a successful track record in developing and disseminating high-quality structural bioinformatics methods which have been widely used by the global community. In this project, the lab seeks to develop new advanced methods for both tertiary and quaternary protein structure prediction. Built on the tools and databases previously developed in the PI’s lab, new deep neural-network based techniques will be extended to residue-level intra- and inter-chain contact- and distance-map predictions. These predictions will then be used to constrain the conformational searching space of threading-based fragment assembly simulations, with the aim to significantly improve the accuracy and success rate of structure modeling of monomeric proteins and protein-protein interactions (PPIs), especially for the difficult targets that lack homologous templates in the Protein Data Bank. Next, the structure and PPI network information will be used to help elucidate multiple levels of biological and biomedical functions for protein molecules, including mutation-induced changes in protein stability and human disease predictions. The long- term goals of this project are to significantly improve the state of the art of protein structure prediction and to narrow the gap between the abundance of protein sequence information and the dearth of protein structure and function data, thus significantly enhancing the usefulness and impact of structural bioinformatics. Success in this project will also help reveal the general principles governing the fundamental relations across sequence, structure and function of protein molecules. Relevance Researchers in contemporary drug industry need to use the knowledge of 3-dimensional structure of protein molecules for designing synthetic compounds to fight against human diseases. But many pharmaceutically important proteins do not have experimentally solved structures. This project seeks to develop advanced computer methods for high-quality protein structure prediction that can be used to function annotation and compound screening; these should have an important and general impact on drug discovery and human health.",Advanced approaches to protein structure prediction,9932039,R35GM136422,"['ART protein', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Cells', 'Communities', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Drug Industry', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Induced Mutation', 'Information Networks', 'Knowledge', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Network-based', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Proteins', 'Quaternary Protein Structure', 'Research Personnel', 'Structural Models', 'Structural Protein', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'base', 'data warehouse', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'fight against', 'genome sequencing', 'human disease', 'improved', 'protein function', 'protein protein interaction', 'protein structure function', 'protein structure prediction', 'screening', 'simulation', 'success', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R35,2020,431776,0.09471470039681647
"MELD: accelerating MD modeling of proteins using Bayesian inference PROJECT SUMMARY This proposal is to develop MELD, a computational Bayesian accelerator that “melds” together molecular dynamics simulations with external knowledge. It is novel in harnessing information that has not been usable before – because it is too sparse, noisy, ambiguous, combinatoric, or too corrupted for traditional approaches. In contrast to the high-certainty restraints traditionally used in MD simulations, MELD leverages a much broader range of real-world high-uncertainty restraints. The first specific aim is to incorporate such information in protein structure determination, in several collaboration projects with experimentalists who perform solution x-ray scattering, ESR, and high-throughput alanine scanning structures of peptide protein complexes. The second aim is to also harness information about processes, trajectories, and dynamic routes to speed the identification of protein states. MELD promises to extend physics-based simulations for determining larger protein structures, for folding larger proteins, for binding more flexible ligands, and for exploring larger mechanistic actions, than current MD simulation methods can handle. PROJECT NARRATIVE Biomedical research and pharmaceutics depend on detailed understanding of the structures and motions of proteins. Molecular dynamics simulations provide the most detailed descriptions possible, however they cannot yet describe average to large sized protein structures or motions within a reasonable time frame. We propose to develop a new physics-based computational accelerator for Molecular Dynamics, called MELD, which incorporates many types of relevant external information that was too vague and difficult to compute to have been practically useful before.",MELD: accelerating MD modeling of proteins using Bayesian inference,9848587,R01GM125813,"['Affinity', 'Alanine', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Bayesian Method', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biomedical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Combinatorics', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Crystallization', 'Data', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Homology Modeling', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laws', 'Learning', 'Ligands', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Computations', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Motion', 'Pharmacy (field)', 'Physics', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Resolution', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Route', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Supercomputing', 'System', 'TP53 gene', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Virginia', 'base', 'blind', 'deep learning', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'insight', 'molecular dynamics', 'novel', 'peptide structure', 'protein complex', 'protein structure', 'protein structure prediction', 'restraint', 'scale up', 'simulation']",NIGMS,STATE UNIVERSITY NEW YORK STONY BROOK,R01,2020,317007,0.0638746949207735
"Reshaping Immunogenicity of Proteins Abstract Immune responses to therapeutic proteins can pose enormous problems for the patient causing either adverse events or loss of efficacy. As therapeutic proteins represent one of the fastest-growing class of pharmaceuticals, it is vital to evaluate whether a protein is likely immunogenic early in the drug development stage and also to have methods available to re-design potential leads to eliminate immune response-causing epitopes. Equally important—yet demanding the opposite effect—is the design of broadly specific vaccines, where increased immunogenicity of subdominant conserved immunogens is desired. The adaptive immune response entails formation of a complex between a T-cell receptor (TCR) and a “foreign” peptide bound to a major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecule that is presented on an antigen presenting cell - a crucial step for the induction of high-titer IgG responses if CD4+ T helper cells become activated. De-immunization efforts of therapeutic proteins have mostly relied on experimental characterization of a large number of point mutants followed by laborious single peptide analysis assays. Data on of over 330,000 experimentally verified T-cell immuno-reactive peptides has been integration and used to predict new epitopes and to bias the computational re-design of a protein to eliminate T-cell epitopes. While this represents a promising strategy, improvements are still needed and no design approach to date is available to systematically incorporate optimized T-cell epitopes to increase immunogenicity. We propose to develop a novel computational design approach capable of reducing immunogenicity of therapeutic proteins or alternatively increasing immunogenicity of vaccine immunogens without disrupting proper folding or function. As proof of concept, we will demonstrate the ability of this approach to 1) reduce immunogenicity of a novel influenza protein therapeutic and 2) increase immunogenicity of influenza's hemagglutinin's stem-region. Finally, we will establish an in vitro high-throughput strategy to evaluate tiled peptide arrays derived from the re-designed proteins or viral surface proteins for the following characteristics: (a) immuno-reactivity, as defined by their ability to form a MHC-peptide complex and (b) ability to activate T-cells. Our approach will take advantage of oligonucleotide-chip technology and next-generation sequencing, enabling the screening of thousands of peptides in parallel. If successful, this strategy will provide a general computational protein design pipeline for reshaping the immunogenicity of proteins and immunogens as well as a two-level experimental verification platform for T-cell epitopes. Narrative The objective of this proposal is to establish a robust platform using both experimental and computational methods that enables the quick and facile identification, verification and re-design immune-reactive epitopes with the goal to either eliminate or introduce T-cell stimulating epitopes. The latter is applicable for the development of either therapeutics or immunogens for vaccination.

"Integrating experiment and theory for predicting protein folding pathways and structure Project Summary/Abstract  Protein folding and dynamics are integral to many biological activities, including chaperone action, degradation, amyloid diseases and aging. Our goal is to combine experimental and computational studies to produce a predictive understanding of protein dynamics through the development of methods capable of simulating folding and dynamics just using physio-chemical principles. Our past studies have focused on single domain proteins. Our efforts have expanded to more complicated systems including the snow flea anti-freeze protein (sfAFP) and TonB-dependent transporters (TBDT) that are relevant to iron sequestration in pathogenic bacteria. Tying these studies together is our new molecular dynamics (MD) package, Upside, which can reversibly fold some proteins up to 97 AA to under 4 Å Cα-RMSD in cpu-days without the use of fragments, homology or evolution. Upside utilizes a number of unique features, including rapid side chain packing that enables simulations using only 3 backbone atoms while retaining considerable detail and avoiding side chain “rattling”, which slows all-atom methods. We will improve Upside and implement enhanced sampling methods to increase our accuracy and size range, and study protein dynamics as monitored by hydrogen exchange.  sfAFP's unique structure challenges conventional wisdom regarding cooperative folding and stability. Lacking a hydrophobic core to promote folding, other factors must contribute to sfAFP's stability. We will test our quantum calculations that sfAFP's H-bonds are unusually stable by measuring amide H/D fractionation factors and NMR J-couplings. We will evaluate whether intrinsic biases in backbone dihedral angles for the PP2 basin in the unfolded state are another major stabilizing factor. This information will be used to improve the Upside simulations. Finally, we will apply our standard folding tools to characterize the folding pathway and compare it to the behavior we expect based on principles derived from proteins with hydrophobic cores.  Many aspects of the transport cycle in TBDT remain unknown despite protracted study, including the conformational rearrangement of the plug domain during transport. We will provide the first structure of the plug domain outside the barrel, and so answer whether this structure matches the crystal structure in the barrel. Additionally, the study of Nakamoto's V10C-S120C variant of the BtuB plug enables the investigation of a possible folding or transport intermediate. We will characterize the plug's dynamics while it is in the barrel using HX to observe possible transport-competent states. The mechanism of plug folding and insertion into the barrel will be investigated, with comparative studies for FhuA, a TBDT whose plug domain is intrinsically disordered in solution. These studies represent an exciting combination of protein folding and function, at the interface between soluble and membrane folding, using experiments and complementary folding simulations. Project Narrative We are combining experimental and computational approaches to produce a predictive understanding of protein folding and dynamics. Our focus has expanded to more complicated systems, including an anti-freeze protein and the plug domain of the TonB-dependent transporters involved in pathogenic bacterial iron sequestration.

"Tissue-specific protein interactome mapping in a vertebrate embryo Abstract Proteins rarely act in isolation, but rather function in multi-protein complexes. Accordingly, protein-protein interactomes are exceptionally valuable resources that provide deep mechanistic insights and generate myriad hypotheses. Current methods for interactome mapping, such as affinity purification mass-spectrometry (APMS), are extremely difficult to deploy in vivo, so little comprehensive interactome data yet exists for developing embryos and even less for specific tissues within embryos. This fact poses an especially acute problem for understanding highly dynamic processes in which post-transcriptional controls dominate, for example collective cell movements. Here, we will use tissue engaged in convergent extension, a crucial collective movement that elongates the axis of animal embryos, to test the efficacy of new label-free interactome mapping approaches. Successful completion of the project will therefore be significant both for developing broadly applicable new methods and also for providing systems-level insights into a disease- relevant, vertebrate collective cell movement. Project Narrative: This study centers on developing novel methods for systematically identifying protein-protein interactions in embryos. To explore the utility of the method, we focus our efforts on proteins involved in collective cell movements called convergent extension, which are governed by the planar cell polarity (or PCP) proteins. These experiments will be significant because defects in PCP proteins or convergent extension lead to “neural tube defects” such as spina bifida and anencephaly, as well as congenital skeletal dysplasias.",Tissue-specific protein interactome mapping in a vertebrate embryo,10104048,R21HD103882,"['Actomyosin', 'Acute', 'Adhesions', 'Affinity Chromatography', 'Amphibia', 'Anencephaly and spina bifida X linked', 'Animals', 'Biological', 'Cadherins', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Defect', 'Developmental Biology', 'Developmental Process', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Embryo', 'Fractionation', 'Genetic', 'In Vitro', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Mesoderm', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Movement', 'Multiprotein Complexes', 'Neural Tube Closure', 'Neural Tube Defects', 'Post-Transcriptional Regulation', 'Process', 'Protein Interaction Mapping', 'Protein-Protein Interaction Map', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Rana', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Spectrometry', 'System', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Vertebrates', 'Work', 'Xenopus', 'base', 'cell motility', 'convergent extension', 'data integration', 'efficacy testing', 'embryo tissue', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'novel', 'planar cell polarity', 'protein complex', 'protein protein interaction', 'skeletal dysplasia', 'success', 'vertebrate embryos']",NICHD,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",R21,2020,237750,0.09342244311242967
"Determining the scope of prenylatable protein sequences PROJECT SUMMARY This study investigates the specificity of farnesyl transferase (FTase) that isoprenylates CaaX proteins. Studies probing the in vivo activity of the FTase have historically used reporters (e.g. Ras GTPases) that undergo complex multi-step post-translational modification (PTM), involving initial farnesylation followed by CaaX proteolysis and carboxyl methylation. This study takes advantage of Hsp40 Ydj1, a farnesylation-only reporter for which we have developed a range of methods to monitor its PTM status. Its use reveals that farnesylation is not necessarily coupled to subsequent PTMs as has been generally accepted for CaaX proteins, and that FTase specificity is significantly more promiscuous than anticipated. These findings challenge the conventional paradigm for how farnesylated proteins are modified and which proteins are targeted by FTase. We will extend our studies to fully resolve the specificity of FTase using a combination of genetic, biochemical, bioinformatic, and biophysical studies. We bring to bear on our investigations an exceptionally strong set of preliminary findings, the complementary expertise of several research groups, and a comprehensive molecular toolbox for the study of farnesylated proteins and other enzymes associated with this post-translational modification pathway. PROJECT NARRATIVE Farnesylated proteins are intimately involved in disease. This project investigates the target specificity of the farnesyl transferase that mediates protein farnesylation.

"UniProt: A centralized protein sequence and function resource Project summary The mission of the Universal Protein Resource (UniProt) is to support biomedical research by providing a freely available, stable, comprehensive, richly and accurately annotated protein sequence knowledgebase (www.uniprot.org). UniProt integrates, interprets and standardizes data from a multitude of sources to achieve the most comprehensive catalog of protein sequences and functional annotation available to date, providing information from hundreds of thousands of publications for tens of millions of proteins from tens of thousands of species. The activities proposed here will increase the utility of UniProt for biomedical research and precision medicine. The expert curated functional information provided by UniProt is widely acknowledged to be of exceptional quality and is continuously updated as new knowledge becomes available. Our first aim will be to continue to curate the scientific literature to ensure UniProt remains up to date. We will also work with the text-mining community to continue to improve curation efficiency. The curated records (0.5 million) are complemented by the (80 million) records for uncharacterized proteins. To ensure their usefulness for the community we will continue to develop our automatic annotation systems to annotate these proteins based on the knowledge of characterized proteins. Our third aim is to connect to and integrate protein data from resources around the world to make UniProt the worldwide global hub of protein information. The integration of clinical variation data as well as metabolomics information with proteins will help to support the multi-omics approaches of precision medicine. Our fourth aim describes the production of the resource to ensure that our data is freely available according to the FAIR principles. UniProt forms a foundation for hundreds of life sciences data resources. Continuous software development is needed to ensure delivery of this key component of the life science infrastructure. The UniProt website is used by hundreds of thousands of scientists every month. The final aim describes how we will enable this community to make best use of UniProt, through user training, outreach and improved user interfaces, driven by user testing.

"Functional Determinants in G-Protein-Coupled Receptors FUNCTIONAL DETERMINANTS OF G PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTORS PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The long-term goal of this work is to rationally manipulate G protein-coupled receptor (GPCRs) activation with the hope to develop novel therapeutic approaches in this major family of transmembrane receptors and drug targets. Our hypothesis is that evolutionary divergence patterns can reveal the roles that GPCR sequence positions play, individually or together, in order to mediate ligand binding, allosteric conformational switching, and finally ligand-biased activation of efferent signaling pathways, which can be G protein-dependent or independent. In the past funding period, computational analysis of such evolutionary patterns revealed: Intramolecular allosteric communication in the transmembrane domain of dopamine D2R receptor; Modular components of an allosteric switch controlling B2AR functional selectivity; A new non-canonical cAMP- independent signaling pathway in that same receptor; and Ligand specificity determinants in the extracellular domain of metabotropic glutamate receptors (MGluR). Technical progress led to: increased accuracy to assess the impact of coding mutations in proteins through a first-principle equation for the evolutionary variations of genotype and phenotype; The generalization of our analyses of evolutionary divergence to consider co-varying residues; and new methods to unravel complex simultaneous assay readouts to stratify drug effects on GPCRs. Together these and other data support new aims that combine biological and algorithmic goals: 1. To titrate mutationally the signaling bias of bioamine receptors. 2. To uncover allosteric mediators in metabotropic glutamate receptors. 3. To identify a systematic role of GPCR mutations in cancer. The outcome should reveal new aspects of the molecular basis of signaling in an important family of pharmaceutical targets. It will also link sequence and structure genomics databases to the molecular basis of function and to the rational re- design of protein function–key steps towards manipulating cellular pathways. FUNCTIONAL DETERMINANTS OF G PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTORS Narrative of the project G protein-coupled receptors account for nearly half of all current medications, yet so far relatively few have been successfully targeted by drugs. One of the difficulties is that we have limited knowledge of their mechanisms at a detailed level. This proposal attempts to uncover the mechanisms of these proteins so that in the longer term we can design new drugs that block their role in diseases, including in cancer.",Functional Determinants in G-Protein-Coupled Receptors,9994912,R01GM066099,"['ADRB2 gene', 'Adrenergic Receptor', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Arrestins', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Calcium', 'Cancer Family', 'Cancer Patient', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Coupled', 'Coupling', 'Cyclic AMP', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Distant', 'Dopamine', 'Dopamine D2 Receptor', 'Dopamine Receptor', 'Drug Targeting', 'Equation', 'Extracellular Domain', 'Family', 'Funding', 'G Protein-Coupled Receptor Signaling', 'G-Protein-Coupled Receptors', 'GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits, Gs', 'GTP-Binding Proteins', 'Genotype', 'Glutamate Receptor', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Ligand Binding', 'Ligand Binding Domain', 'Ligands', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manipulative Therapies', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Metabotropic Glutamate Receptors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Mus', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Neoplastic Cell Transformation', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phenotype', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Play', 'Point Mutation', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Protein Engineering', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Receptor Activation', 'Receptor Signaling', 'Recording of previous events', 'Role', 'Serotonin', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Stretching', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Titrations', 'Transmembrane Domain', 'Variant', 'Venus Flytrap', 'Work', 'beta-arrestin', 'cancer cell', 'design', 'experimental study', 'fitness', 'interest', 'metabotropic glutamate receptor 4', 'novel marker', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient stratification', 'protein function', 'protein structure prediction', 'prototype', 'receptor', 'receptor function', 'response', 'structural genomics', 'tumor', 'web server']",NIGMS,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2020,472000,0.08775343956277215
