"Functional characterization of genetic and post-transcriptional variation using machine learning methods The goal of this research proposal is to develop new in-silico approaches for accurate functional annotation of genetic and post-transcriptional variants. The rapid growth of Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) and high- throughput -omics data have brought us one step closer towards mechanistic understanding of the complex genetic disease, such as cancer, neurological disorders, diabetes, and others at the molecular level. In particular, these data revealed that complex diseases commonly manifest changes at the genetic and post- transcriptional levels. Bot of these types of changes often affect structure and function of the corresponding genes and their products. Understanding the functional implications of the genetic and post-transcriptional variation is an important task as it can provide critical insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the disease. Here, we propose to leverage novel machine learning paradigms to design computational methods for predicting the effect of genetic and alternative splicing variants on the macromolecular interactions. Macromolecular interactions underlie many cellular functions in a healthy organism. The disease-induced changes in the genes, such as single nucleotide variations (SNVs) and alternative splicing variations (ASVs) have been recently reported to cause the protein-protein interaction network rewiring. Unfortunately, the experimental high-throughput techniques that characterize the large-scale effects of SNVs or ASVs on PPIs are expensive, time-consuming, and far from being comprehensive. The current in-silico methods either suffer from the limited applicability, or are less accurate when compared with the experimental methods. To overcome these challenges, we will use two recent machine learning paradigms, learning under privileged information (LUPI) and semi-supervised learning. If successful, we expect for the proposed methods to provide the critical advancement in the two main challenges of the current computational approaches, the limited coverage and lower than the experimental accuracy. The methods will be freely available to the community as the stand-alone tools as well as web- servers. The goal of this proposal is to build computational tools that discover the links  between the disease-associated mutations as well as alternatively spliced protein isoforms  and the protein-protein interactions mediated by the disease proteins. The tools use advanced  machine learning methods to find such links in a fast and inexpensive way. These tools  will be useful in elucidating the molecular mechanisms implicated in the complex genetic disorders.",Functional characterization of genetic and post-transcriptional variation using machine learning methods,9730612,R21LM012772,"['Adopted', 'Affect', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Cell physiology', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consumption', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Annotation', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Homology Modeling', 'Human Genome', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Nucleotides', 'One-Step dentin bonding system', 'Organism', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'RNA', 'RNA Splicing', 'RNA-Protein Interaction', 'Reporting', 'Research Proposals', 'Role', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Work', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'gene function', 'gene product', 'genetic variant', 'human interactome', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'nervous system disorder', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'preservation', 'protein protein interaction', 'random forest', 'rapid growth', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'web server']",NLM,WORCESTER POLYTECHNIC INSTITUTE,R21,2019,193732,-0.03486530022474691
"Deep learning methods to predict the function of genetic variants in orofacial clefts Project Summary  Orofacial clefts (OFCs) comprise a significant fraction of human birth defects in all populations (ranging between 1/500 to 1/2500 live births) and represent a major public health challenge. Individuals born with OFCs require surgical, nutritional, dental, speech, medical and behavioral interventions, imposing a substantial economic and personal burden. There has been convincing evidence that non-syndromic OFCs represent human complex disorders with a multifactorial etiology including genetic risk factors, environmental exposures, and their complex interactions. So far, there have been ~10 genome-wide association studies (GWAS) conducted for non-syndromic CL/P (NSCL/P) and >15 genomic loci reported with compelling statistical support, including genes such as IRF6, PAX7, and ABCA4 and the 8q24 locus. In addition, next-generation sequencing (NGS) as well as exome array have been conducted with extra depth of genotyping that enable detection of rare variants associated with OFCs. However, gaps exist in how to interpret these variants and how to identify novel variants from the large volume of data, with high expectations for new methods and new models for “second- analysis” of the genome-wide data. In this proposal, we propose two complementary aims to carry out deep and second-analysis of genome-wide data for OFCs. In Aim 1, we propose a deep learning method to build in silico models that can predict the effect of genetic variants in the context of rich craniofacial epigenomic features. With substantial fine map of sequence patterns, ad hoc motifs will be revealed and variants that disturb these motifs will provide mechanistic insights on OFCs. In Aim 2, we shift our focus to the gene level and propose a network assisted method to discover sensibly combined genes in spatial and temporal points that are critical to orofacial development. We target on all forms of OFCs, with particular interest in NSCL/P. To guarantee the success of this proposal, we form a multi-disciplinary team and local computational infrastructure equipped with GPUs for the implementation of both aims. Our aims are non-overlapping; rather, they are integrated and strongly focused on our fundamental question of interest: how genetic variants function to cause OFCs. The successful completion of our proposal will lead to deep understanding of genetic components in OFCs. Project Narrative Orofacial clefts (OFCs) comprise a significant fraction of human birth defects in all populations and represent a major public health challenge. Substantial progress has been made to identify genes and variants for OFCs through recent genome-wide association studies and next- generation sequencing projects. In this proposal, we aim to develop computational methods to comprehensively fine map and interpret the effects of these genetics variants, which will eventually lead to understanding of the mechanisms and new therapies for OFCs.",Deep learning methods to predict the function of genetic variants in orofacial clefts,9764346,R03DE027711,"['8q24', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Process', 'Cleft Lip', 'Cleft lip with or without cleft palate', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Consensus', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Dental', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Economics', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Etiology', 'Explosion', 'Expression Profiling', 'FaceBase', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Live Birth', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Nutritional', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'PAX7 gene', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'RNA', 'RNA Binding', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Site', 'Speech', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'computer infrastructure', 'craniofacial', 'craniofacial development', 'deep learning', 'epigenomics', 'exome', 'expectation', 'genetic risk factor', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genome-wide analysis', 'insight', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'multidimensional data', 'multidisciplinary', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'orofacial', 'orofacial cleft', 'orofacial development', 'rare variant', 'risk variant', 'sequence learning', 'spatiotemporal', 'success', 'trait']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R03,2019,154000,-0.05331748864007556
"A Multivariate Mediation and Deep Learning Framework for Genome-Connectome -Substance Use Research Substance use and addiction are complex biopsychosocial disorders influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. A key challenge in addiction genetics research is to understand how multiple genetic variants interactively influence addiction traits through impacting the central nervous system. To address this challenge, we propose a large-scale mediation analysis framework to identify addiction-related gene-brain circuitry pathways, using nicotine addiction as the targeted disorder, although the platform will be readily applicable for other addiction-related disorders and phenotypes. We will fully leverage the complex and interactive interdependent relationships between the imaging-genetics data and perform multivariate statistical inference with simultaneously increased statistical power and reduce false positive rates. The results will precisely identify multiple sets of genetic variants that interactively alter brain functional and structural circuitries, and then influence nicotine addiction. We will further supplement the mediation results with deep learning algorithms to study how genetic variants non-linearly and interactively coordinate to influence nicotine addiction and explain the phenotypic variance. Novel network topology based convolutional and pooling functions will be developed to achieve optimal prediction accuracy of addiction traits using genome-connectome pathways. All models and findings will be carefully validated through multiple independent large-sample data sets of imaging-genetics studies for nicotine addiction for ensuring the replicability and reliability of our findings derived from this framework. We plan to produce a freely available and user-friendly software incorporating the mediation analysis framework and deep learning algorithms enabling the complex whole genome - connectome analysis for addiction genetics research. Nicotine addiction is a worldwide public health priority and imposing health and economic burden on millions of individuals and families. This proposal seeks to identify how multiple genetic variants interactively influence the nicotine addiction through impacting brain circuitries. The improved understanding of genome-connectome pathways of addiction could lead to more effective treatment and prevention.",A Multivariate Mediation and Deep Learning Framework for Genome-Connectome -Substance Use Research,9810163,DP1DA048968,"['Address', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Brain', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Economic Burden', 'Ensure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Family', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Research', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Mediation', 'Modeling', 'Neuraxis', 'Nicotine Dependence', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Prevention', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Structure', 'Substance Addiction', 'addiction', 'base', 'biopsychosocial', 'brain circuitry', 'connectome', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'effective therapy', 'genetic variant', 'health economics', 'imaging genetics', 'improved', 'nicotine use', 'novel', 'public health priorities', 'trait', 'user friendly software', 'whole genome']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,DP1,2019,463500,0.001731557230838351
"Integrating Machine Learning and Genomic Approaches to Understand Cerebral Small Vessel Disease Pathogenesis from White Matter Hyperintensity Patterns PROJECT SUMMARY  As a neurointensivist and neurologist at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis (WUSM), my career goal is to develop an independent research program as a computational biologist capable of using advanced bioinformatics and statistical methods to integrate analysis of large-scale neuroimaging and genetic data, with the aim of deepening understanding of the biological mechanisms influencing cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) and identifying new targets for therapeutic development. As a first step towards this goal, I have designed an innovative proposal that combine machine-learning (ML) methods and integrated imaging genetic analyses of large-scale neuroimaging and genetic data to improve characterization of SVD disease mechanisms.  The clinical, imaging, and etiologic heterogeneity of SVD have impeded efforts to uncover the pathophysiology of this common and debilitating neurological disease. White matter hyperintensities (WMH), a major imaging endpoint of SVD, are comprised of multiple SVD pathologic processes. Growing evidence suggests location-specific vulnerability of brain parenchyma to different underlying SVD pathologic processes, in which spatially localized WMH patterns may reflect distinct SVD etiologies. Characterizing WMH spatial pattern variations in SVD will not only provide insights into underlying pathogenesis, such as vascular amyloid deposition, arteriolosclerosis, and other less well defined or as-yet unknown disease mechanisms, but also lead to creation of novel imaging biomarkers of these SVD pathologic processes. This proposal addresses a key inadequacy, as existing WMH pattern definitions are determined empirically and cannot distinguish overlapping SVD etiologies and risk factors. In this proposal, I aim to capture WMH spatial pattern variations that reflect distinct SVD etiologies in an unbiased manner, by applying clustering analysis/ML methods to structural MRI data to create novel etiology-specific SVD imaging phenotypes. Moreover, given that genetics influence the variance of WMH, I will integrate genetic analyses of these WMH patterns to uncover novel mechanisms that influence SVD pathogenesis. My preliminary data demonstrate the feasibility of identifying data-driven WMH spatial pattern variations, which are specific to distinct SVD etiologies, and allow detection of genetic risk variants that may help inform SVD pathologic processes.  My career plan leverages the extensive resources and exceptional environments at WUSM, under the guidance of a multidisciplinary mentorship team with expertise across diverse fields including cerebrovascular physiology, neuroimaging, informatics, genetics, and machine learning (Drs. Jin-Moo Lee, Daniel Marcus, Carlos Cruchaga and Yasheng Chen). In this Career Development Award, I propose to: 1) determine distinct WMH spatial patterns that can discriminate underlying SVD pathology and/or risk factors by applying pattern analysis ML methods to structural MRI data from three unique cohorts (n=2,710) enriched for different SVD pathologies (Aim 1a), and examining if the ML-defined WMH patterns segregate individuals by well-defined SVD risk factors as biologic validation (Aim 1b), and 2) identify genetic variants (Aim 2a) associated with WMH patterns that reflect diverse pathologic processes influencing SVD using genome wide association and gene-based analyses; replicate the top variants (Aim 2b) in an independent population-based cohort (n=21,708); and use advanced bioinformatics tools to uncover new biologic pathways associated with WMH spatial patterns (Aim 2c).  This research proposal and accompanying development plan with focused training in machine learning, neuroimaging, and multivariate methods for integrated imaging genetics analysis, will build on my background in genetics towards a career investigating cerebrovascular disorders using translational bioinformatics. This Award will provide me with the necessary training to evolve into an independent investigator with a computational research program that can integrate large imaging and genetics datasets to derive results that are highly relevant to the prevention and treatment of cerebrovascular disease in my clinical patient population. PROJECT NARRATIVE Cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) is one of the most prevalent neurological conditions in older adults, and a leading cause of stroke and cognitive impairment, for which existing treatment and preventative options have been limited or lack efficacy. This project’s goal is to enhance our knowledge of the complex disease processes underlying SVD using machine learning and integrating individual imaging and genetic data from over 20,000 adults. By understanding these disease processes, we can design novel methods to more effectively treat and prevent stroke and dementia.",Integrating Machine Learning and Genomic Approaches to Understand Cerebral Small Vessel Disease Pathogenesis from White Matter Hyperintensity Patterns,9886424,K23NS110927,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amyloid deposition', 'Archives', 'Arteries', 'Award', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy', 'Cerebral hemisphere hemorrhage', 'Cerebral small vessel disease', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders', 'Cerebrovascular Physiology', 'Clinical', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Distal', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Failure', 'Functional disorder', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomic approach', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hypertension', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Lobar', 'Location', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Microvascular Dysfunction', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologist', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathologic', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stroke', 'Stroke prevention', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Washington', 'White Matter Hyperintensity', 'arteriole', 'base', 'biobank', 'bioinformatics tool', 'brain parenchyma', 'career', 'cohort', 'design', 'disorder subtype', 'effective therapy', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic association', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'hypertension control', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging genetics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'learning strategy', 'medical schools', 'multidisciplinary', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'patient population', 'population based', 'programs', 'racial and ethnic', 'risk variant', 'serial imaging', 'stroke therapy', 'success', 'therapeutic development', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'unsupervised learning']",NINDS,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,K23,2019,179997,0.012802764731123724
"Deep Learning Based Genetic Risk Prediction for Type 1 Diabetes Project Summary Type I diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disease of childhood caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. In a subset of individuals with a genetic predisposition to T1D, environmental triggers instigate an autoimmune response which targets and damages pancreatic islets, leading to pre-diabetes and ultimately diabetes. A critical barrier in T1D prevention research is to identify and directly enroll children with a strong genetic predisposition for developing T1D into prevention trials. A robust genetic risk score (GRS) would allow for the identification of children at high-risk of T1D, their recruitment into T1D prevention trials, and subsequent testing of novel interventions. I aim to 1) optimize a multi-layer feedforward neural network genetic risk predictor that can be used to enroll newborns directly into T1D prevention trials; and 2) identify putative, novel T1D-causing SNPs, and their interactions. Completion of aim 1 would provide a better GRS to the T1D research community, which can be used to identify children with higher genetic risk of T1D development, increasing the statistical power of future T1D prevention clinical trials. Completion of aim 2 will provide a deeper biological understanding of the molecular drivers of T1D development, and potential new therapeutic targets for T1D prevention trials. Successful completion of this project will both help understand the genetic causes of type 1 diabetes and help prevent the disease.

"Bioinformatics Strategies for Genome Wide Association Studies The promise of precision medicine is to edit a patient’s DNA and/or administer therapeutics targeting etiologic molecules that prevent or reverse the disease process using a tailored design. All of this happens at the level of the individual and requires precision knowledge of that patient’s biology. In stark contrast, much of the knowledge we possess about genomic risk factors comes from statistical measures of association from human populations. The conceptual and practical disconnect between the populations we study and the individuals we want to treat is a major source of confusion about how to move forward in an era driven by genome technology. The primary goal of this proposal is to develop novel informatics methodology and software to facilitate precision medicine by connecting population and individual genomic phenomena. We propose here a Virtual Genomic Medicine (VGMed) workbench where clinicians can carry out thought experiments about the treatment of individual patients using models of disease risk derived from population-level studies. This will be accomplished by first developing a novel Genomics-guided Automated Machine Learning (GAML) algorithm for deriving risk models from real data that is accessible to clinicians (AIM 1). We will then develop a novel simulation approach that is able to generate artificial data that preserves the distribution of genetic effects observed in the real data while maintaining other characteristics such as genotype frequencies (AIM 2). This will generate open data allowing anyone to perform virtual interventions on patients derived from a population- level risk distribution. The workbench will allow editing of individual genotypes and simulate the administration of drugs by editing machine learning parameters in the simulation model (AIM 3). The change in risk and disease status for the specific patient will be tracked in real time. Finally, we provide a feature in the workbench that will allow the clinician to generate specific hypotheses about individual genetic variants that can then be validated using integrated knowledge sources that include databases such as PubMed and ClinVar thus giving the user immediate feedback (AIM 4). All methods and software will be provided as open-source (AIM 5). Most genetic studies of common human diseases result in statistical summaries of risk derived from human populations. These statistical summaries are not that helpful for determining the health of an individual. This proposal will create new computer algorithms and software help clinicians and researchers connect population- level statistics with individual level genetic effects to advance our understanding of how to treat patients based on their own unique genetic makeup.",Bioinformatics Strategies for Genome Wide Association Studies,9661406,R01LM010098,"['Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Characteristics', 'Community Medicine', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Confusion', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Etiology', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Genetic', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Information Resources', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Online Systems', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Population Analysis', 'Population Study', 'Process', 'PubMed', 'Pythons', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Source', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Validation', 'base', 'design', 'disorder risk', 'experimental study', 'genetic makeup', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'human disease', 'individual patient', 'machine learning algorithm', 'models and simulation', 'novel', 'open data', 'open source', 'phenotypic data', 'precision medicine', 'preservation', 'prevent', 'simulation', 'statistics', 'therapeutic target', 'virtual']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2019,404309,0.014468930546597111
"Inferring Molecular Mechanisms of Complex Disease by Integrating Patterns of Epistasis with Functional Genomic Networks The goal of this proposal is to develop computational methods that will identify genes driving epistasis between quantitative trait loci. Genetic association studies in both humans and model organisms have been increasingly able to detect interactions among genetic variants that influence disease risk and pathogenesis. However, identifying which genes are represented by individual variants is a major challenge. Many variants influencing disease are situated between genes, and even those that are in genes may be representing an effect from a neighboring gene. In model organism studies the situation is even more problematic. In breeding experiments, genetic associations with phenotypes typically encompass large regions of DNA with many genes, and experimental follow-up to identify the genes responsible for the association is resource-intensive. To address this problem, we are developing computational tools to prioritize putative gene interactions in interacting genomic regions for biological follow-up. We use machine learning classifiers trained on functional gene-gene interaction networks and combinatorial optimization to identify likely candidate gene-gene interactions responsible for epistatic interactions between genomic regions. Our methods sift through enormous spaces of candidate interactions, retaining only those whose functional interactions identify as plausible for supporting the epistatic interaction. These tools hold promise to dramatically limit the resource-intensity of biological follow up of putative epistasis and to clarify the genetic architecture of complex disease. Genetic studies in humans and model organisms are critical to understanding how genes interact to influence disease. Standard association studies, however, do not identify individual genes, but rather large genetic regions containing many genes, and determining individual genes responsible for phenotypic effects requires resource-intensive biological follow-up experiments. We are developing computational methods to prioritize genes in these regions for biological follow-up, with the ultimate goal of speeding the discovery of novel roles of genes in disease.",Inferring Molecular Mechanisms of Complex Disease by Integrating Patterns of Epistasis with Functional Genomic Networks,9712956,R21LM012615,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease model', 'Animal Model', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bacteria', 'Base Pairing', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Breeding', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Combinatorial Optimization', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Copy Number Polymorphism', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Epistasis', 'Genetic study', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Individual', 'Knock-out', 'Letters', 'Lower Organism', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Ontology', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Proteins', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Source', 'Speed', 'System', 'Systemic Scleroderma', 'Testing', 'The Jackson Laboratory', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Training Support', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Yeasts', 'combinatorial', 'computerized tools', 'disorder risk', 'experimental study', 'follow-up', 'functional genomics', 'gene function', 'gene interaction', 'genetic architecture', 'genetic association', 'genetic variant', 'genomic biomarker', 'genomic data', 'human disease', 'human model', 'interest', 'learning algorithm', 'learning strategy', 'mouse model', 'multidimensional data', 'mutant', 'novel', 'supervised learning', 'systemic autoimmune disease', 'tool', 'trait']",NLM,JACKSON LABORATORY,R21,2019,223200,-0.007031874091103249
"Statistical Modeling of Multiparental and Genetic Reference Populations PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Genetic crosses in model organisms play an essential role in understanding how heritable factors affect medically relevant traits. Such crosses have traditionally tended to be on a small scale with limited power to detect genetic effects, limited ability to localize causal variants, and limited options for replication. In the last decade, however, the emergence of larger-scale interdisciplinary research, cheaper genotyping and parallel advances in human genetics, has spurred the development of more sophisticated and powerful experimental designs. Foremost are those that incorporate two modern genetic design concepts: the multiparental population (MPP), whereby each subject is descended from a small, well-characterized set of genetically diverse inbred strains, with the goal of efficiently exploring a wide genetic landscape; and the genetic reference population (GRP), whereby subjects are drawn from a large and genetically diverse set of inbred strains, with the goal that the study population, and thereby the studies themselves, can be infinitely replicated. Their combination, the multiparental genetic reference population (MP-GRP), represents the state-of-the-art in complex trait genetics and has been implemented in a number of model organisms, including plants, flies, and rodents.  The proposed program of research focuses on the development of statistical and computational tools to advance the design and analysis of studies using MPPs, GRPs and MP-GRPs. It centers around addressing three interconnected questions.  1) How to take advantage of biological replicates in a genetically varying population? Directions considered include: more stable methods to detect genetically-induced phenotypic outliers; use of genetically-induced heteroskedasticity to improve statistical power and find variance-controlling genes; and more rigorous and expansive characterization of gene-by-treatment effects by using principles from causal inference.  2) How to navigate the complex design space of MP-GRPs and their derived crosses? Directions considered include: use of decision theory applied to Bayesian analysis of pilot data; incorporation of variance heterogeneity to control likely reproducibility.  3) How to approach quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis in MPPs and MP-GRPs? Directions considered include: making haplotype-based association more robust to uncertainty in haplotype state; combining haplotype- based with variant-based mapping; adaptive modeling of QTL complexity; machine learning of the allelic series; familywise error rate control through descent-based permutation.  Progress on these fronts will not only fill significant gaps in studies using MPPs, GRPs and MP-GRPs, but will also provide tools and insights that will allow these designs to be used in new and more powerful ways. PROJECT NARRATIVE (RELEVANCE) The proposed research will lead to improvements in the analysis and design of genetic studies on experimental models of human disease. Because the project focuses on statistical methodology applied to experimental model organism populations (including mouse, rats and Drosophila) the scientific output of the project is expected to be applicable to basic research focusing on any medical condition that can be studied in model organisms.",Statistical Modeling of Multiparental and Genetic Reference Populations,9672510,R35GM127000,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Alleles', 'Animal Model', 'Basic Science', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Biological', 'Complex', 'Complex Genetic Trait', 'Data', 'Decision Theory', 'Development', 'Drosophila genus', 'Experimental Designs', 'Experimental Models', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Crosses', 'Genetic study', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Haplotypes', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human Genetics', 'Inbred Strain', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Mus', 'Output', 'Phenotype', 'Plants', 'Play', 'Population', 'Population Genetics', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Rattus', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Series', 'Statistical Models', 'Uncertainty', 'Variant', 'base', 'causal variant', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'fly', 'human disease', 'improved', 'insight', 'programs', 'study population', 'tool', 'trait', 'treatment effect']",NIGMS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R35,2019,336445,0.02520464712001771
"Optimizing imputation for diverse populations in a distributed framework The NHGRI Genome Sequencing Program (GSP) will identify genomic variants relevant to health and disease by genome sequencing over 225,000 participants across a multitude of diseases. The GSP will also serve as a pilot for the Precision Medicine Initiative that aims to enroll and sequence more than a million people representative of U.S. ethnic diversity. Here, we propose a GSP analysis center focused on Multi- and Trans- ethnic Mapping of Mendelian and Complex Diseases. There is a growing recognition of the substantial scientific advantages, as well as public health importance, of conducting biomedical research across ethnically diverse cohorts. We propose to develop scalable methods that incorporate ancestry to optimize medical genomic study design and improve power for uncovering the role of common and rare variants in disease. Achieving this goal requires expertise across diverse domains of knowledge including: medical and population genomics, algorithm development for complex disease mapping, and expertise in management of large-scale databases. Here, we have assembled a world-class team of medical and population geneticists, computer scientists, statisticians and clinicians, with leading expertise in the development of novel and scalable strategies for characterizing sequence variants and their role in disease. Importantly, our group has been at the forefront of development of resources, study designs and methods to enable genomic research in U.S. minority populations. Our project has three main objectives. First, we will develop an Automated Scalable Ancestry Pipeline (ASAP) for common disease mapping in diverse populations. ASAP will improve the computational efficiency of existing state-of-the-art methods for ancestry inference and develop important extensions to linear mixed models (LMMs) and other mapping strategies leveraging local and global ancestry. We will also develop methods to refine phenotypes and identify common controls for disease studies and define endpoints. Secondly, we will develop tools and resources for trans- and multi-population rare variant discovery that incorporate patterns of local and sub-continental ancestry. We will also develop machine-learning tools for variant annotation that leverage ancestral information, patterns of sequence evolution, and protein structure in a unified framework. Furthermore, we will incorporate population-specific patterns of cellular phenotypes to improve functional prediction algorithms for non-coding and coding variants. Lastly, we will disseminate our results through web-based resource that empower the biomedical research community. We will augment existing resources including ClinGen by annotating and characterizing pathogenic variants across diverse populations.

"Identification of gene-gene interactions in relation to risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma and Barrett's esophagus PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Esophageal adenocarcinoma (EA) is an often lethal cancer and a significant public health concern in the U.S. Several risk factors have been identified for EA and its precursor, Barrett's esophagus (BE), including symptomatic gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), central adiposity, smoking, male sex, and European ancestry, but our understanding of the molecular/genetic determinants that govern why most people with reflux never develop BE, and most with BE never progress to EA, remains limited. Inherited genetics represents another likely contributor to disease susceptibility, and recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) within the Barrett's and Esophageal Adenocarcinoma Consortium (BEACON) have identified multiple novel germline genetic variants associated with altered risk of BE/EA. As observed for other cancers and complex diseases, however, the majority of estimated heritability for BE and EA appears unexplained. One plausible source for this “missing heritability” lies in the joint effects of multiple loci acting in combination. We seek to identify novel gene-gene interactions (G×G) in relation to risk of BE/EA, using a novel fusion of advanced analytical approaches aimed at overcoming technical limitations often encountered in the conduct of large-scale G×G (e.g. computational complexity and low statistical power). In a discovery scan (Aim 1), we initially will use two complementary knowledge-guided filtering methods to reduce the dimensionality of the G×G search space: first, we select ~500 genes with known or hypothesized relationships to BE/EA etiology and pathogenesis based on findings from GWAS, TCGA, and related studies; second, we select ~50,000 gene-gene pairs with highest-likelihood annotated biological relationships based on an integrated knowledge resource of pathways, processes, and interactions (Biofiler). Using existing germline genetic data on 2515 EA patients, 3295 BE patients, and 3207 controls from BEACON, we next will adopt a recently-described `hierarchical group-lasso' machine learning framework to select, in a joint model, ~1000 candidate pairwise SNP-SNP interactions most predictive of case status. These interactions are then evaluated using an independent validation dataset of 1609 EA cases, 1037 BE cases, and 3537 controls (Aim 2), using standard logistic regression models. In exploratory work, we will perform stratified analyses by sex or smoking history. The proposed studies are anticipated to expand our basic understanding of key biological pathways and mechanisms underlying the emergence of BE/EA; generate new leads and possible candidate targets for interventional strategies; and expand the foundation for future collaborative initiatives to integrate genetic, epidemiologic, and clinical data into robust disease models and novel predictive tools for BE/EA risk assessment and precision prevention. PROJECT NARRATIVE (PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE) Esophageal adenocarcinoma (EA) is an often lethal cancer that represents a significant public health burden in the U.S. In this proposal, we capitalize on the availability of large-scale existing datasets derived from expensive multi-year international collaborations, and perform new analyses to improve our understanding of how inherited gene variants interact to influence susceptibility to EA and its precursor, Barrett's esophagus (BE). Findings from this study will expand our basic understanding of key biological pathways underlying this cancer and ultimately help advance the development of better strategies for prevention and treatment.",Identification of gene-gene interactions in relation to risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma and Barrett's esophagus,9746654,R03CA223731,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Advanced Development', 'Barrett Esophagus', 'Biological', 'Chronic', 'Clinical Data', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Esophageal Adenocarcinoma', 'Etiology', 'European', 'Evaluation', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gastroesophageal reflux disease', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genotype', 'Heritability', 'Incidence', 'Inflammation', 'Informatics', 'Information Resources', 'Inherited', 'Intercept', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Lasso', 'Lesion', 'Life Style', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Metaplastic', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Molecular Target', 'Obesity', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Plant Roots', 'Predisposition', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Reflux', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smoking', 'Smoking History', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Subgroup', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Upper digestive tract structure', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'clinically actionable', 'disorder risk', 'epidemiologic data', 'gene interaction', 'genetic architecture', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'individualized prevention', 'insight', 'knowledge base', 'male', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'predictive tools', 'protein protein interaction', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'sex', 'supervised learning', 'text searching', 'tool']",NCI,ROSWELL PARK CANCER INSTITUTE CORP,R03,2019,93591,-0.03300380934089699
"Integrating Neuroimaging, Multi-omics, and Clinical Data in Complex Disease ABSTRACT Rapid progress in biomedical informatics has generated massive high-dimensional data sets (“big data”), ranging from clinical information and medical imaging to genomic sequence data. The scale and complexity of these data sets hold great promise, yet present substantial challenges. To fully exploit the potential informativeness of big data, there is an urgent need to find effective ways to integrate diverse data from different levels of informatics technologies. Existing approaches and methods for data integration to date have several important limitations. In this project, we propose novel statistical methods and strategies to integrate neuroimaging, multi-omics, and clinical/behavioral data sets. To increase power for association analysis compared to existing methods, we propose a novel multi-phenotype multi-variant association method that can evaluate the cumulative effect of common and rare variants in genes or regions of interest, incorporate prior biological knowledge on the multiple phenotype structure, identify associated phenotypes among multiple phenotypes, and be computationally efficient for high-dimensional phenotypes. To improve the prediction of clinical outcomes, we propose a novel machine learning strategy that can integrate multimodal neuroimaging and multi-omics data into a mathematical model and can incorporate prior biological knowledge to identify genomic interactions associated with clinical outcomes. The ongoing Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and Indiana Memory and Aging Study (IMAS) projects as a test bed provide a unique opportunity to evaluate/validate the proposed methods. Specific Aims: Aim 1: to develop powerful statistical methods for multivariate tests of associations between multiple phenotypes and a single genetic variant or set of variants (common and rare) in regions of interest, and to develop methods for mediation analysis to integrate neuroimaging, genetic, and clinical data to test for direct and indirect genetic effects mediated through neuroimaging phenotypes on clinical outcomes; Aim 2: to develop a novel multivariate model that combines multi-omics and neuroimaging data using a machine learning strategy to predict individuals with disease or those at high-risk for developing disease, and to develop a novel multivariate model incorporating prior biological knowledge to identify genomic interactions associated with clinical outcomes; Aim 3: to evaluate and validate the proposed methods using real data from the ADNI and IMAS cohorts; and Aim 4: to disseminate and support publicly available user-friendly software that efficiently implements the proposed methods. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH: Alzheimer's disease (AD) as an exemplar is an increasingly common progressive neurodegenerative condition with no validated disease modifying treatment. The proposed multivariate methods are likely to help identify novel diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for AD. Identifying new susceptibility loci/biomarkers for AD has important implications for gaining greater insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying AD. NARRATIVE In this project, we propose novel statistical methods and strategies to integrate high-dimensional neuroimaging, multi-omics, and clinical/behavioral data sets, which aim to increase detection power for association analysis and improve the prediction of clinical outcomes. The development of an advanced integrative analysis platform will provide more comprehensive and integrated approaches to answering complex biological questions. The proposed multivariate analysis methods have a high potential impact on and important implications for gaining greater insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying complex diseases, as well as helping the development of earlier diagnostic tests and novel therapeutic targets.","Integrating Neuroimaging, Multi-omics, and Clinical Data in Complex Disease",9694279,R01LM012535,"['Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer’s disease biomarker', 'Beds', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Evaluation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Indiana', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Medical Imaging', 'Memory', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multiomic Data', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Outcome', 'Phenotype', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Science', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'cohort', 'data integration', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'disease classification', 'endophenotype', 'epigenomics', 'genetic association', 'genetic variant', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'mathematical model', 'metabolomics', 'multidimensional data', 'multimodality', 'multiple omics', 'neuroimaging', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'predict clinical outcome', 'rare variant', 'risk variant', 'therapeutic target', 'transcriptomics', 'user friendly software']",NLM,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,R01,2019,341691,-0.03741748555384108
"Direct measurement of gene-environment interactions by high-throughput precision genome editing Abstract  Modern genetics has identified many genetic variants that affect traits such as height, but most phenotypic variation still cannot be explained by these variants alone. Importantly, differences in environment often result in individual variation of traits—including disease risk and drug response—for different genotypes. These relationships are known as genotype by environment (GxE) interactions. For example, the sickle cell allele of hemoglobin S causes sickle cell anemia, but also provides a fitness advantage in the presence of malaria by conferring resistance to infection. However, there are few examples where the exact causal variants are known. Therefore, we need to develop new methodology for identifying more of these GxE interactions, to improve prediction of disease risk and treatment outcomes.  In this study, I will fill in the gap of knowledge in GxE interactions by establishing an experimental framework for identifying hundreds of causal GxE variants in parallel, providing the first comprehensive view of GxE causal variant landscape. Specifically, I will study how thousands of genetic variants between a laboratory yeast strain (BY) and a vineyard strain (RM) lead to their differences in growth upon stress and drug treatments, as one form of GxE interaction. In Aim 1, I will use a novel gene-editing technology that can detect the fitness effects of thousands of variants in one experiment, as shown in a pilot experiment. Using this method, I will be able to map hundreds of casual variants that contribute to growth differences under various conditions, such as carbon source, oxidative stress and drug treatment. In Aim 2, I will measure allele-specific mRNA expression (ASE) from BYxRM F1 hybrids in above-mentioned conditions and associate the mapped causal GxE variants, to identify GxE variants that influence growth rate through gene expression. Then, I will apply a machine learning model to predict causal GxE genes using the molecular features found in this study. By mapping causal GxE variants, linking them to gene expression and predicting causal genes through gene expression, I will establish a complete framework for accelerating the discovery of GxE interactions. Public Health Relevance The recent explosion of precision medicine based on genotype and mutations has enabled personalized treatment of diseases. However, how environmental factors influence the outcome of such treatments is not clear. By establishing a framework to study general principles and underlying molecular mechanisms of these gene-by-environment interactions, we will be able to integrate such knowledge in disease risk prediction and personalized treatment.",Direct measurement of gene-environment interactions by high-throughput precision genome editing,9678678,F31ES030282,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Alleles', 'Biological Models', 'Carbon', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Explosion', 'Exposure to', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Height', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Human Cell Line', 'Hybrid Cells', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lactase', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malaria', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Meiotic Recombination', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Nucleotides', 'Outcome', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Polygenic Traits', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Research', 'Resistance to infection', 'Resolution', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Scientist', 'Sickle Cell', 'Sickle Cell Anemia', 'Sickle Hemoglobin', 'Source', 'Stress', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Yeasts', 'career', 'causal variant', 'disorder risk', 'experimental study', 'fitness', 'gene environment interaction', 'genetic variant', 'genome editing', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'individual variation', 'mRNA Expression', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'personalized medicine', 'precise genome editing', 'precision medicine', 'promoter', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'segregation', 'skills', 'trait', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NIEHS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,F31,2019,29016,-0.007315842020280445

"Approaches to Genetic Heterogeneity of Obstructive Sleep Apnea ABSTRACT  Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is recognized as an extremely common disorder that results in excessive daytime sleepiness and an increased risk of automobile crashes. It is also an independent risk factor for insulin resistance, hypertension, cardiovascular events, increased cancer rates and cancer mortality, and accelerates the progression of neurodegenerative disorders. OSA is a systemic disorder and the cyclical intermittent hypoxia that occurs during sleep affects every organ system. OSA is heritable, with first degree relatives of individuals with OSA having a two-fold increased risk of the disorder. Although this has been known for over two decades, there are very limited data on gene variants conferring risk or protection for OSA. This is likely the result of underpowered studies and GENETIC HETEROGENEITY. There are multiple pathways to OSA. Obesity is a major risk factor, as are craniofacial dimensions. The relative risk of these different risk factors varies by ethnic group. There are also neuronal mechanisms and other physiological risk factors. This proposal seeks to directly address the issue of genetic heterogeneity using a very large sample of patients and state-of- the-art analysis techniques. Towards this end, we have assembled by far the largest sample of well characterized and genotyped patients with OSA. This is the result of collaboration with key sites in the eMERGE Network [Geisinger, Vanderbilt, Mayo Clinic, Northwestern], Kaiser Permanente Southern California, and the University of Pennsylvania. We propose to carry out a robust genome-wide association studies (GWAS) using an electronic health record (EHR) derived case definition and quantitative trait analysis of OSA severity. We will use novel machine learning approaches to specifically address genetic heterogeneity. The GWAS approach will be complimented by a PheWAS strategy as another approach to identifying common variants and related clinical phenotypes. Specifically, we will look for variants that associate with OSA and other clinical diagnoses in the EHR. It is likely that gene variants for OSA will have pleiotropic effects. Gene variants identified from GWAS and/or PheWAS will be further assessed. First, we will use available whole exome sequencing data to see if there are relevant rare variants in these genes, as well as to perform exploratory discovery analyses to look for novel rare variation. The functional role of the genes identified will be studied by functional network analysis. Finally, we will assess associations with quantitative data on intermediate traits identified by high throughput craniofacial and intra-oral photography. These data are currently available within the Sleep Apnea Global Interdisciplinary Consortium (SAGIC). Future directions will assess the function of the genes identified in model systems and the clinical utility of utilizing variants as part of risk stratification for OSA. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common disorder with multiple adverse consequences. It is known that OSA has a genetic basis, but to date no convincing gene variants have been identified. This study uses state of the art approaches to identifying relevant genes based on a very large sample of patients with OSA obtained from multiple institutions in the United States.

"Searching for missing heritability for cardiometabolic outcomes by race ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiometabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) are common global health conditions that carry a great public health burden for chronic disability and early death. African Americans are more likely to be disproportionately affected than Whites. Our proposed project will have an important impact because it has great potential to explain, 1) A measure of the genetic susceptibility of these cardiometabolic diseases and mortality, and 2) Interaction and mediation of a genetic risk score (GRS) with a low diet quality score and low physical activity levels on these adverse health outcomes. There are published reports of interaction (effect modification) but not mediation (indirectly through an intervening variable) of a GRS with nutritional factors and low physical activity levels on cardiometabolic conditions; however, these studies involving interaction were performed predominantly in Whites. Most of the genetic susceptibility for these outcomes remains unexplained for African Americans. Studies are lacking on the role of these lifestyle factors in terms of interaction and especially mediation with a GRS to increase risk for cardiometabolic outcomes among Whites and African Americans. Thus, several questions remain regarding the influence environmental factors have with genes to increase disease risk and mortality among different race/ethnic groups. To address our questions, we will use the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute Candidate Gene Association Resource dataset of about 50,000 subjects, including 13,000 African Americans. To account for a measure of the genetic susceptibility, we will capture multiplicative single nucleotide polymorphism effects by the re-weighted random forest statistical method to compute a disease-and-race-specific GRS. We will include functional reduction- oxidation and metabolic disruptive single nucleotide polymorphisms that are involved in the inflammation and nutrient-signaling pathways. We will then investigate interaction and mediation of a GRS with a low diet quality score and low physical activity levels on T2DM, CVD, and mortality at baseline and over time by performing a meta-analysis. Our data include information on genetic polymorphisms, cross-sectional and longitudinal measurements on phenotypes for T2DM, CVD, and mortality, as well as dietary intake, physical activity, and relevant covariates. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The purpose of the study is to find a measure of the genetic susceptibility for type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and mortality in Whites and especially African Americans. Our study will examine interaction and mediation of a genetic risk score with a low diet quality score and low physical activity levels on these cardiometabolic outcomes at baseline and over time by performing a meta-analysis.

"Algorithms to identify non-coding mutational burden and disease-relevant pathways PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) is a disease with complex, polygenic etiology with numerous contributing mechanisms. To devise new therapeutics to combat this epidemic, we need to identify causal genes and variants for T2D and related, cardiometabolic traits implicated by human genetic association. Recently, large- scale DNA biobanks attached to electronic health records have facilitated extensive phenotyping in surprising large sample sizes (>500,000 subjects), importantly in diverse ancestries. These data have enabled a dramatic expansion of the number of bona-fide associations for T2D and related traits. While the increase in statistical power is certainly welcome, new opportunities for how to use these data require new computational methods and analytical pipelines. In this renewal, we focus on three areas for new methods development, which we will create and subsequently deploy to accelerate the genetic dissection for cardiometabolic disease. First, the number of associated loci now available permit the opportunity to learn directly from the data, which non- coding sequences functionally relate to T2D risk. We propose to utilize techniques in machine learning to make predictions for T2D and related causal traits, used to identify and prioritize causal variants and functional elements that are disease-predictive. A second challenge is that the quantity and pace at which this data is being produced is outstripping the rate at which even highly expert quantitative scientists can explore and extract novel insights from the data. To combat this problem, we propose to develop an informatics toolkit with apps to perform compute-intensive, important analyses and visualization with these data, tethered to cloud- based or local computation infrastructure. Finally, one key observation that follows biobank-based data analysis is that, at each physically distinct associated locus, numerous additional conditionally independent associations segregate nearby. This series of alleles can be identified through existing methods, but their use in causal inference approaches (i.e., Mendelian Randomization) has not been extensively explored. Here, we will evaluate their utility and develop statistical pipelines to use this spectrum of variation to perform new causal inference studies. PROJECT NARRATIVE Identification of causal variants and genes underlying type-2 diabetes (T2D) and related cardiometabolic trait associations are key challenge impeding biological understand and therapeutic developments. New, large- scale data sets from DNA biobanks are poised to help overcome these challenges but require the development of new informatics and statistical methods to take full advantage of the data. In this renewal application, we will develop new methods, machine learning applications, informatics tools, and causal inference statistical approaches to identify pinpoint casual variants and genes contributing to T2D and related traits.",Algorithms to identify non-coding mutational burden and disease-relevant pathways,10007107,R56DK101478,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Area', 'Base Pairing', 'Biological', 'Catalogs', 'Cloud Computing', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coupled', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Epidemic', 'Etiology', 'Exposure to', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Grant', 'Human Genetics', 'Imagery', 'Informatics', 'Infrastructure', 'Investigation', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Randomized', 'Reporting', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sample Size', 'Scheme', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Statistical Methods', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Uncertainty', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'base', 'biobank', 'burden of illness', 'cardiometabolism', 'causal variant', 'cloud based', 'cluster computing', 'combat', 'computer infrastructure', 'experimental study', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'functional genomics', 'genetic association', 'genetic variant', 'genome analysis', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide analysis', 'informatics\xa0tool', 'insight', 'instrument', 'method development', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'parallelization', 'power analysis', 'task analysis', 'therapeutic development', 'trait']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R56,2019,272474,-0.010521512669373442
"Genetic determinants of puberty and later life health outcomes My long-term objective is to build on my existing track record in understanding the genetic mechanisms that influence differences in pubertal developmental timing and how they impact associated adverse health outcomes. Puberty is a key adolescent developmental milestone that is strongly associated with later life health outcomes, such as poor cardiometabolic health, type 2 diabetes, cancer, and osteoporosis. Hundreds of genetic variants across the genome are known to affect the timing of puberty (assessed by age at menarche in girls and age at voice break in boys), but the sex-specific impact of this genetic variation on health outcomes in adolescence and adulthood remain poorly characterized, particularly for boys. Furthermore, another key puberty trait, the pubertal height growth spurt, is less well characterized genetically, but reflects influences from pubertal timing, height growth potential, and body mass, and deeper investigation may reveal novel insights into the links between puberty and health outcomes. During the mentored K99 phase of this proposal, I will use a machine learning approach to choose the best variants across the genome that predict pubertal timing to build optimized polygenic scores (Aim 1a). These male and female-specific polygenic scores will then be tested for association across hundreds of clinical outcomes in biobanks composed of electronic health records (EHR) in tens of thousands of children and adults (Aim 1b). Subsequently, in the independent R00 phase, I will use causal inference analyses to understand the causal impact of genetically determined pubertal timing on identified health outcomes (Aim 1c). Meanwhile, I will combine what I have learned during Aim 1 with my previous expertise to lead a genome-wide association study of the pubertal height growth spurt in the Early Growth Genetics (EGG) consortium, combining longitudinal data from ~35,000 children across multiple cohorts, followed by trans-ethnic fine-mapping (Aim 2a). Finally, I will apply the pipeline developed in Aim 1 to derive PGS for pubertal growth and determine clinically relevant health outcomes linked to differences in pubertal growth trajectories (Aims 2b-d). In this Pathway to Independence proposal, I will complete training in computational and biomedical informatics techniques to capitalize on large-scale data resources, including linked genetic and EHR data from medical and population-based biobanks and longitudinal adolescent cohorts in the EGG consortium. My mentorship committee is composed of a team of world-renowned experts in genomics, informatics, and computational approaches, who have a strong track record in transitioning postdoctoral fellows into independent researchers. Combining my previous expertise with the proposed research and training objectives, together with a strong mentorship team, the securing of EGG leadership in this phenotypic area, and career development activities, I will be uniquely poised to achieve my goal of transitioning to an independent researcher with the skills needed to advance our understanding of the genetic underpinnings of pubertal development and its linked adult outcomes. This research will reveal novel understanding of the sex-specific molecular regulation of pubertal timing and how differences in pubertal timing are related to adverse adult health outcomes. This work will ultimately lead to studies that identify key areas where early interventions may mitigate the negative health effects of earlier or later than average pubertal timing, which serves the NICHD’s mission of ensuring that all children achieve their full potential for healthy lives.",Genetic determinants of puberty and later life health outcomes,9805815,K99HD099330,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Age at Menarche', 'Area', 'Award', 'Bioinformatics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Etiology', 'Female', 'Foundations', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Height', 'Heritability', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Menarche', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Onset of illness', 'Osteoporosis', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Prevention strategy', 'Puberty', 'Public Health', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Risk Factors', 'Secure', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speed', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Traction', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Variant', 'Voice', 'Work', 'biobank', 'biomedical informatics', 'boys', 'cardiometabolism', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical care', 'clinical risk', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'data resource', 'experience', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'girls', 'informatics training', 'insight', 'longitudinal analysis', 'male', 'men', 'novel', 'phenome', 'population based', 'pubertal timing', 'sex', 'sexual dimorphism', 'skills', 'tool', 'trait', 'virtual']",NICHD,CHILDREN'S HOSP OF PHILADELPHIA,K99,2019,131733,0.0020980550229057877
"ADPKD: Disease Spectrum & Genotype-Phenotype Correlations Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is a common monoallelic disorder associated with progressive cyst development and resulting in end stage renal failure (ESRD) in 50% of patients by 60y. However, there is considerable phenotypic variability, extending from in utero onset to patients with adequate renal function into old age. Autosomal dominant polycystic liver disease (ADPLD), as traditionally defined, results in PLD with minimal renal cysts. Classically there have been considered two ADPKD genes, PKD1 and PKD2, encoding PC1 and PC2, and two ADPLD genes, PRKCSH and SEC63, but in the past few years greater genetic heterogeneity has been described, with nine genes now implicated overall. Recent data also indicates an overlap in etiology and pathogenesis associated with ADPKD and ADPLD, with the efficient biogenesis and localization of the PC-complex central to both disorders. During the last funding period we identified a novel gene, GANAB, which is associated with both disorders, where the encoded protein, GII is involved in the maturation and trafficking of PC1.  In this proposal we will take advantage of advances in next generation sequencing (NGS) methodologies, and large populations of ADPKD and ADPLD patients that have been assembled and screened for the classic genes, to hunt for novel genes for these disorders (Aim 1). The phenotype associated with these genes will be characterized (Aim 3) along with their mechanism of action (Aim 2). NGS methods will be perfected to screen the segmentally duplicated locus, PKD1, and to identify missed mutations at the known loci, including those present in just some cells due to mosaicism (Aim 1). The significance of many PKD1 nontruncating variants has been difficult to evaluate (classed as variants of unknown significance; VUS), but recently evidence that some are incompletely penetrant alleles partially explains phenotypic variability in PKD1 populations. In Aim 2 improved in silico predictions, in combination with machine learning, will improve the understanding of the pathogenicity and penetrance of VUS. A cellular assay of the biogenesis and trafficking of this PC-complex will also be employed to quantify the penetrance of VUS. The mechanism of pathogenesis will be explored in animal models with ultralow penetrant (ULP) Pkd1 or Pkd2 alleles. Employing the large clinically, imaging, and genetically well-defined populations phenotypic groupings of patients will be defined that will then be compared to the genic and PKD1 allelic groups (Aim 3). This iterative process will allow the Variant Score (VS) associated with each PKD1 VUS to be refined. In a separate population the revised VS, alone and in combination with clinical, functional, and imaging data, will be employed to generate a comprehensive, predictive algorithm for ADPKD (Aim 3). Disease modifiers to severe disease, via biallelic ADPKD, and due to alleles at other loci will also be identified and characterized in the cellular assay and in vivo in combination with the Pkd1 hypomorphic, RC model. The final aim will exploit the newly identified information that some PKD1 and PKD2 VUS are rescuable, folding mutations that in a maturation-fostering environment can traffic and function appropriately. A screening scheme based on the level of cell surface PC1 will be improved and new chaperone drugs specific for the PC complex will be sought in collaboration with Sanford Burnham Prebys. A second mutation group that will be explored therapeutically are nonsense mutations. A cellular assay for readthrough efficiency is being developed and will be used for screening. Identified chaperone or readthrough drugs will be tested in available mouse models. Overall this proposal will better explain the etiology and the genetic causes of phenotypic variability in ADPKD/ADPLD, develop better prognostic tools for individual selection of patients for treatment that are now becoming available, and explore allele based treatments for ADPKD. ADPKD and ADPLD are genetic diseases associated with cyst development and loss of function in the kidney and liver cysts, where the disease severity varies greatly between patients. Here we will identify new genes that cause these disorders and evaluate mutations in silico, in a cellular assay, and in whole animals to better predict the disease course in each patient. Treatment options associated with the type of individual patient mutations will also be explored, bringing individualized medicine to these diseases.",ADPKD: Disease Spectrum & Genotype-Phenotype Correlations,9778816,R01DK058816,"['Age', 'Alleles', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney', 'Biochemical', 'Biogenesis', 'Biological', 'Budgets', 'Cell surface', 'Cells', 'Cellular Assay', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Cyst', 'Cystic kidney', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'End stage renal failure', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Family', 'Fostering', 'Functional Imaging', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genotype', 'Germ-Line Mutation', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Hepatic', 'Hepatic Cyst', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Kidney', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Chaperones', 'Mosaicism', 'Mutation', 'Nonsense Mutation', 'Other Genetics', 'PRKCSH protein', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patient Selection', 'Patients', 'Penetrance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Process', 'Proprotein Convertase 1', 'Proprotein Convertase 2', 'Proteins', 'Renal function', 'Role', 'Scheme', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Signal Transduction', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Variant', 'base', 'disease phenotype', 'dosage', 'early onset', 'exome sequencing', 'improved', 'in utero', 'in vitro Assay', 'in vivo', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'insight', 'loss of function', 'molecular diagnostics', 'mouse model', 'mutant', 'mutation screening', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'polycystic liver disease', 'prediction algorithm', 'prognostic', 'prognostic tool', 'protein folding', 'screening', 'therapy development', 'trafficking', 'variant of unknown significance']",NIDDK,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2019,510292,0.0010117646538758773
"Statistical methods for early disease prediction and treatment strategy estimation using biomarker signatures Neuropsychiatric disorders pose an immense burden on patients, families, and health care systems, thus underscoring the urgent need to develop disease-modifying treatment. Research on neuropsychiatric disorders (e.g., Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease) faces unique challenges, including the fact that these disorders typically have a late onset and slow progression, the diagnostic criteria are based on subjective clinical symptoms, and there is substantial disease and subject heterogeneity. In the proposed work, we aim to tackle these challenges by leveraging complementary contributions from multiple biomarkers, including genome-wide polymorphisms, whole brain neuroimaging, biofluids, and comprehensive neuropsychiatric assessments. We develop sophisticated analytic tools with higher resolution and improved accuracy by accounting for biological mechanisms of disease, synthesizing dynamic system-wide information, and integrating multiple sources of biomarkers. These methods are applied to clinical data collected by the investigative team or available from large international consortia in order to model the earliest pathological changes of neurodegenerative disease, assess treatment responses, and inform the design of early-intervention clinical trials and the discovery of optimal personalized therapies. Specifically, in Aim 1, we develop efficient methods for multi-level semiparametric transformation models to estimate and test the risk of genetic variants on various types of complex phenotypes to inform genetic counseling and improve clinical trial efficiency. Our methods do not rely on full pedigree genotyping and provide family-specific substructure, in addition to population substructure, to better control confounding and reduce false discovery rates in genome-wide association studies. In Aim 2, we develop large-scale nonlinear dynamic systems through ordinary differential equations with random inflections to understand early pathological changes and identify subjects with preclinical signs. Our method provides multi-domain integration of ensembles of biomarker dynamics. In Aim 3, we develop dynamic hazards models and incorporate dynamic network structures to estimate biomarker profiles that evolve smoothly with disease progression for earlier disease diagnosis. We account for irregularly measured biomarkers and biological network dependence among biomarkers. In Aim 4, we develop doubly robust and efficient machine learning methods to identify predictive markers, estimate optimal individualized therapies, and identify subgroups who may receive the greatest benefit from therapy, with minimal risk. In each aim, we will validate the proposed methods through extensive simulation studies and demonstrate their practical value via application to real-world clinical studies. We establish theoretical properties of the proposed methods using modern empirical process theory and statistical learning theory. Together, the state-of-the-art analytic methods proposed here will substantially improve analytic accuracy, and our combined statistical and clinical expertise will ensure that our methods are translated directly back to the clinical and translational research community. Project Narrative:  The ultimate goal of neuropsychiatric research is to develop experimental therapeutics to delay disease on- set, slow disease progression, and provide effective treatment at each stage of disease. This proposal aims to develop new statistical approaches to integrate complementary sources of information from genomic measures, brain imaging biomarkers, and early clinical signs to characterize disease mechanism, progression, and treatment responses, and thereby inform the design of clinical trials and the discovery of optimal personalized therapies.",Statistical methods for early disease prediction and treatment strategy estimation using biomarker signatures,9694287,R01NS073671,"['Accounting', 'Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Back', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Differential Equation', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Ensure', 'Equilibrium', 'Event', 'Face', 'Family', 'Family health status', 'Family member', 'First Degree Relative', 'Funding', 'Genetic Counseling', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Hazard Models', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heterogeneity', 'Impact evaluation', 'Individual', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Investigational Therapies', 'Late-Onset Disorder', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Non-linear Models', 'Nonlinear Dynamics', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Radiation exposure', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Safety', 'Source', 'Spinal Puncture', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'dynamic system', 'effective therapy', 'genetic pedigree', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'learning strategy', 'minimal risk', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'randomized trial', 'semiparametric', 'simulation', 'theories', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'validation studies']",NINDS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2019,340259,-0.004080722632460401
"Exploring Statin Pleiotropic Effects within a Very Large EHR Cohort Statins among the most widely prescribed agents worldwide for prevention of cardiovascular diseases, produce substantial pleiotropic effects. Pleiotropic effects are unanticipated outcomes other than those for which the drug was originally developed, either therapeutic (beneficial) or detrimental (adverse drug reactions). Statin pleiotropic effects are unanticipatedly broad, including increasing the risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus and cataract, decreasing cancer-related mortality, and reducing dementia. Many effects are still not determined. In addition, individual responses to statins are highly variable. Genetics studies have identified loci that are significantly associated with statin response. However, it is unclear if either of the genetic variants within these regions is also associated with statin pleiotropic effects. We propose to investigate statin pleiotropic effects using whole de-identified electronic health records (EHRs) of >2.5 million individuals at Vanderbilt, including >110,000 statin exposure individuals. By linking this cohort to BioVU, the Vanderbilt de-identified DNA biobank, >10,000 of these statin exposure individuals have extant genome-wide genotyping. We argue that 1) previous inconclusive results are largely caused by inconsistent phenotype definitions, and 2) using the EHR to develop a novel, drug-based phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS) provides an ideal approach to discover unknown statin effects. The still-growing Vanderbilt de-identified EHRs allow large amounts of individuals' clinical data shared to support validation of known pleiotropic effects and to enable novel discoveries. Our previous work demonstrated our ability to develop consistent EHR-based phenotype definitions that can be deployed across multiple EHRs and institutions. We have expertise leveraging state-of-the-art informatics techniques, including natural language processing and ontologies, for pharmacogenetic studies, including for statins. We first described the PheWAS approach to not only replicate genetic associations but also discover novel, pleiotropic associations. Our informatics expertise combined with an ideal EHR/DNA population, will enable us to validate and discover statin pleiotropic effects. Accordingly, we propose the following three aims: 1. develop and test EHR-based phenotype algorithms for four controversial statin pleiotropic effects, 2. conduct a PheWAS to discover unknown statin pleiotropic effects, and 3. evaluate and discover genetic predictors of statin pleiotropic effects. Project Narrative Statins (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors), among the most widely prescribed agents worldwide for prevention of cardiovascular diseases, produce substantial pleiotropic effects. Statin pleiotropic effects are unanticipatedly broad and the genetic variants associated with statin pleiotropic effects remain unclear.

"Integrated Clinical and Transcriptomic Profiling to Characterize Disease Phenotype PROJECT SUMMARY Exome and whole-genome sequencing are becoming increasingly routine approaches in cancer[1], common disease[2]and rare disease diagnosis.[3] Despite their success, our ability to fully interpret the clinical relevance of personal genome variation remains a significant gap[4-6]. Considering this, the most crucial need is more genotype-phenotype data that link genetic variation with disease causation. The objective of this proposal is to improve the clinical interpretation of genetic variation; in particular, by developing integrative approaches that predict the effect of genetic variation on clinical phenotype. This proposal addresses the hypothesis, supported by preliminary data, that combining patient transcriptomic data with genotypic and clinical data (as opposed to each alone) offers a better mechanistic understanding of disease natural history, from initial presentation to progression. The specific aims are designed such that each independently add substantial functional genomic information, over and above previously available patient genetic data, to further resolve the clinical phenotype. Aim 1 establishes a comprehensive and widely-shared dataset of patient transcriptomic (and genetic) variation across multiple cancer, cardiovascular and thrombosis/bleeding phenotypes, in patients with somatically-acquired myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) and select other rare heritable blood diseases (HBD). Aim 2 methodically determines differential RNA expression and processing between clinically-relevant subgroups of MPN and HBD patients. Aim 3 brings these elements together – and applies two integrative Bayesian and machine learning approaches, RIVER[24] (RNA-informed variant effect on regulation) and LASSO[25] (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator), to resolve the functional and clinical relevance of rare variants; and identify signatures most predictive of disease risk or progression. Completion of these aims will contribute new scientific knowledge on how integrating transcriptomic data improves clinical genomic analyses in other genetic (and rare) diseases. In addition, this project will enable the Principal Investigator to develop expertise in the informatics and data science aspects of genomic medicine that complement her current background in biophysics, biochemistry and translational hematology. Combined with additional informatics training at Stanford University through coursework, seminars, one-on-one advising from project mentors, and interactions with the wider statistics, bioinformatics and genomics communities, this project will prepare the Principal Investigator to launch an independent academic career in genomic medicine. PROJECT NARRATIVE Accurate clinical interpretation of genetic variation in personal genome data is an essential component of personalized medicine approaches and the precise genetic diagnosis toward achieving improved public health. This project will integrate genetic and clinical modifiers with functional genomic information (RNA sequencing) from adequately-powered, disease-relevant cells; and provide direct insight into transcriptional perturbations caused by genetic variation.",Integrated Clinical and Transcriptomic Profiling to Characterize Disease Phenotype,9786811,K08HG010061,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Alleles', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Bayesian learning', 'Biochemistry', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Biophysics', 'Blood', 'Blood Cells', 'Blood Platelets', 'Blood specimen', 'Body mass index', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Demographic Factors', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease stratification', 'Elements', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Fusion', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Hematological Disease', 'Hematology', 'Hemorrhage', 'Heritability', 'Informatics', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lasso', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical Genetics', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Myeloproliferative disease', 'Other Genetics', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Public Health', 'RNA', 'RNA Processing', 'Rare Diseases', 'Reference Standards', 'Regulation', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Rivers', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Thrombosis', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Whole Blood', 'actionable mutation', 'base', 'biobank', 'career', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'data integration', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'disease natural history', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder risk', 'exome', 'experience', 'functional genomics', 'genetic disorder diagnosis', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'informatics training', 'insight', 'knowledge base', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient stratification', 'personalized medicine', 'phenotypic data', 'prediction algorithm', 'prospective', 'rare cancer', 'rare variant', 'regression algorithm', 'statistics', 'success', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'variant of unknown significance', 'whole genome']",NHGRI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K08,2019,190941,0.019500625837389988
"An Integrative Radiogenomic Approach to Design Genetically-Informed Image Biomarker for Characterizing COPD ! Abstract  Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is one of the leading causes of death worldwide with a devastating socio-economic burden impacting more than three million individuals per year in the US. The primary environmental risk factor in the susceptible population is smoking, which causes an exaggerated inflammatory response. However, many factors including several genetic risk variants substantially influence the susceptibility. Twin-based studies show that families with emphysema have a higher risk for the disease. The two different major phenotypes of COPD are small airway remodeling (airway disease) and alveolar destruction (emphysema). Although these two major phenotypes result in a similar deficiency in global lung function, the relationship between them is complicated and likely involves feedback mechanisms. Developing an objective method to characterize lung phenotypes is critical since treatment candidates vary based on phenotype. Measurements from High-Resolution Computed Tomography (HRCT) images are increasingly used to describe COPD since they can quantitatively describe the contribution of the phenotypes. To discover the genetic risk variants, Genome-Association Studies (GWAS) have focused on either the physiological lung function or a simple threshold-based measurement from lung CT, neither of which fully characterizes phenotypic subtypes or the distribution pattern of disease. The proposed studies will take advantage of the rich image and genetic data jointly to build a genetically-informed imaging biomarker to characterize each patient. For each patient, our method summarizes the CT image to a vector representation that accurately describes the severity of the disease. Also, a method to link the representation back to the genetic risk variants will be developed. If successful, these methods can be used to monitor the efficacy of treatment or progression of the disease using imaging data. Successful execution of the second aim will result in better understanding of the etiology of different disease subtypes and discovery of novel genetic pathways that could be used as potential drug targets. Furthermore, the patient representation enables the use of image data to construct a more powerful model to predict the so-called acute exacerbation event. Predicting the exacerbations is clinically important since they cause further damage to the lung.  In Aim 1, we develop and implement a novel image biomarker that is mutually informed by imaging and genetic data from each patient. Our statistical method in Aim 2 elucidates the underlying genetic pathways behind the abnormal anatomical variations explained by the biomarker. We validate our method on data from 10,300 patients in the COPDGene dataset. !

"Overall NIDA Core ""Center of Excellence"" in Transcriptomics, Systems Genetics and the Addictome Addiction is a highly complex disease with risk factors that include genetic variants and differences in development, sex, and environment. The long term potential of precision medicine to improve drug treatment and prevention depends on gaining a much better understanding how genetics, drugs, brain cells, and neuronal circuitry interact to influence behavior. There are serious technical barriers that prevent researchers and clinicians from incorporating more powerful computational and predictive methods in addiction research. The purpose of the NIDA P30 Core Center of Excellence in Omics, Systems Genetics, and the Addictome is to empower and train researchers supported by NIH, NIDA, NIAAA, and other federal and state institutions to use more quantitative and testable ways to analyze genetic, epigenetic, and the environmental factors that influence drug abuse risk and treatment. In the Transcriptome Informatics and Mechanisms research core we assemble and upgrade hundreds of large genome (DNA) and transcriptome (RNA) datasets for experimental rodent (rat) models of addiction. In the Systems Analytics and Modeling research core, we are using innovative systems genetics methods (gene mapping) to understand the linkage between DNA differences, environmental risks such as stress, and the differential risk of drug abuse and relapse. Our Pilot core is catalyzing new collaborations among young investigator in the field of addiction research. In sum the Center is a national resource for more reproducible research in addiction. We are centralizing, archiving, distributing, analyzing and integrating high quality data, metadata, using open software systems in collaboration with many other teams of researchers. Our goal is to help build toward an NIDA Addictome Portal that will include all genomic research relevant to addiction research. PROJECT NARRATIVE The NIDA Core Center of Excellence in Omics, Systems Genetics, and the Addictome (OSGA) provides genomic and computational support to a large number of research scientists working on mechanisms and treatment of addiction. The two main research cores of OSGA are providing support for transcriptome, epigenome, and metagenome studies of rat models of addiction at many levels of analysis. We are also creating open access tools and a powerful web portal to catalyze more effective and replicable use of massive datasets generated by programs in addiction biology and treatment.","Overall NIDA Core ""Center of Excellence"" in Transcriptomics, Systems Genetics and the Addictome",9716628,P30DA044223,"['Archives', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Cellular Assay', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consult', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug abuse', 'Educational workshop', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Joints', 'Leadership', 'Machine Learning', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Proteome', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Quantitative Genetics', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'RNA', 'Rattus', 'Relapse', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Models', 'Stress', 'Sum', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translations', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'Variant', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'behavior influence', 'brain cell', 'career', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'computing resources', 'data archive', 'data integration', 'data modeling', 'data warehouse', 'deep learning', 'digital imaging', 'drug relapse', 'epigenome', 'experience', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic variant', 'genomic variation', 'graphical user interface', 'health record', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'metagenome', 'mouse model', 'multiple omics', 'neurogenomics', 'neuronal circuitry', 'novel', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'programs', 'ranpirnase', 'rat genome', 'repository', 'sex', 'single cell analysis', 'software systems', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'web portal']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE HEALTH SCI CTR,P30,2019,763474,0.008990599639354498
"Neurovirulent HSV-1 Recombinants for vQTL Analysis Abstract Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) is a significant human pathogen and is the leading cause of sporadic encephalitis in the USA. Strains of virus display virulence phenotypes ranging from avirulent to highly pathogenic. There are indications that the virulence of a given strain of virus is actually determined by the “constellation” of genes carried by the virus and how they interact with each other; a phenomenon termed epistasis. Traditional methods for analyzing the function of viral genes are difficult to apply to studying epistatic interactions in virulence. Recently we described a novel approach, vQTLmap, that has allowed us to identify contributions of multiple genes to peripheral disease phenotypes. To date we have analyzed four quantitative phenotypes, blepharitis, stromal keratitis, corneal neovascularization, and weight loss. Surprisingly, there are distinct differences in the viral genes that appear to be driving each of these phenotypes. In order to carry out vQTLmap using quantitative measures of neurovirulence, we need to isolate additional neurovirulent recombinants between the OD4 and CJ994 parental viruses. The goals of this proposal are to generate the reagents (e.g., neurovirulent recombinants) needed to analyze neurovirulence genes driving HSV-1 encephalitis and identify epistatic interactions and carry out vQTLmap analysis of percent mortality, percent ataxia, percent head tilt, and percent limb paralysis. At the completion of this project, we will be able to submit an R01 application to carry out vQTLmap on features such as percent mortality, brain titers of virus, localization of the infection in the brain, and neuroinvasiveness. A better understanding of how viral genes work together to promote disease has the potential to identify novel targets that could assist antiviral drug or vaccine development efforts. Narrative The role played by viral genes in determining the outcome of infection is poorly understood, particularly for Herpes simplex virus, which is an important pathogen. We have validated a novel approach involving generating recombinant viruses, determining the sequence of their genomes, and using novel statistical methods to map viral genes that affect the severity of the infection. In order to extend the analysis to neurovirulence (encephalitis), we need to isolate more neurovirulent recombinants. The goal of this application is to isolate additional HSV-1 recombinants so we can identify genetic drivers of encephalitis in the HSV-1 genome. The project ultimately has the potential to identify novel therapeutic targets for drug or vaccine development.",Neurovirulent HSV-1 Recombinants for vQTL Analysis,9666459,R21AI137280,"['Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Ataxia', 'Automobile Driving', 'Blepharitis', 'Blindness', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Brain', 'Central Nervous System Infections', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Corneal Neovascularization', 'Corneal Ulcer', 'Data', 'Digestion', 'Disease', 'Encephalitis', 'Eye Infections', 'Female', 'Focal Infection', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Epistasis', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Herpesvirus 1', 'Infection', 'Keratitis', 'Limb structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Paralysed', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Probability', 'Publishing', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Reagent', 'Recombinants', 'Role', 'Severities', 'Simplexvirus', 'Statistical Methods', 'Testing', 'Vero Cells', 'Viral Genes', 'Viral Physiology', 'Virulence', 'Virus', 'Work', 'disease phenotype', 'drug development', 'human pathogen', 'innovation', 'male', 'mortality', 'neurovirulence', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'pathogen', 'recombinant virus', 'vaccine development']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R21,2019,191250,0.0004818130506394393
"Genomic and Phenomic Architecture of Heart Failure The overarching goal of this project is to improve care for patients with heart failure (HF). HF, whether with reduced (HFrEF) or preserved (HFpEF) ejection fraction, is associated with significant morbidity, mortality, and cost. In the U.S. alone, HF affects over 5 million adults, and the prevalence is projected to exceed 8 million by 2030. HF is the most frequent cause of hospitalization among Medicare recipients and results in over $30 billion in health care expenditures each year. Advances in management, especially for HFrEF, have modestly reduced death rates over time, but mortality continues to be high, with approximately half of patients dying within 5 years of diagnosis. Moreover, the pace of drug discovery has been slow, and there are no proven therapies for patients suffering with HFpEF. Among patients with established HF there is substantial variation in illness severity, degree of cardiac remodeling, disease progression, and response to therapy. These observations highlight the heterogeneity of the HF syndrome and suggest existence of subtypes with differing clinical and potentially genetic profiles, with subsequent differences in downstream disease mechanisms, overall risk, and therapeutic response. However, the understanding of the phenotypic, genetic, and pathophysiological heterogeneity of HF is incomplete. This project investigates the phenotypic substructure and genetic architecture of HF by leveraging a unique collection of interrelated datasets from Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC), including the de- identified electronic health record (EHR) and BioVU, a linked DNA biobank. The EHR contains ~2.6 million patients, including ~35,000 with HF, and BioVU currently houses >225,000 DNA samples. Dense genotype data are available in >28,000 subjects and an institutional genotyping project will increase this to >125,000 by mid- 2017; this includes >13,000 subjects with HF. The proposed research will: 1) identify HF subtypes from dense clinical data alone using advanced, unbiased, deep learning algorithms (Aim 1), 2) define the genetic architecture of HF and HF subtypes by using inferred gene expression, general linear mixed models, genetic risk scores, and traditional association testing to quantify heritability of and genetic correlations among HF subtypes, define the contribution of established risk factors to HF subtypes, and 3) discover subtype-specific genetic risk factors (Aim 2), and discover HF subtype-specific clinical outcomes, disease associations, and drug response phenotypes using advanced phenome scanning and network analysis (Aim 3). Heart failure (HF) is a complex, debilitating syndrome associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The heterogeneity of HF has limited success of prior efforts to understand HF pathobiology and develop effective interventions. By defining clinical and genetic modifiers of HF risk, disease course, and treatment response for clinically recognized and novel, data-driven HF subtypes, results from this work could result in a more sophisticated HF classification system based on underlying biology, and ultimately facilitate precision risk stratification, tailoring of therapeutic strategies, and rational HF clinical trials.",Genomic and Phenomic Architecture of Heart Failure,9625162,R01HL140074,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Architecture', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiomyopathies', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Death Rate', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'EFRAC', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Failure', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health Expenditures', 'Heart failure', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Link', 'Measures', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medical', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medicare', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial dysfunction', 'Natural History', 'Outcome', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Severity of illness', 'Subgroup', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'biobank', 'cohort', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'defined contribution', 'disease phenotype', 'drug discovery', 'effective intervention', 'genetic architecture', 'genetic association', 'genetic profiling', 'genetic risk factor', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'mortality', 'novel', 'phenome', 'phenomics', 'preservation', 'response', 'risk variant', 'success', 'treatment response']",NHLBI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2019,395000,0.022141210963339247
"Whole Genome Sequencing in Irish Multiplex Schizophrenia Families Project Summary: Although affected members of multiplex schizophrenia pedigrees have substantially elevated recurrence risk compared to singleton cases, the mean polygenic risk scores between these groups do not differ, suggesting that one source of this higher familial recurrence risk is rare, higher impact variation. We will collect whole genome sequence (WGS) from 600 affected members of multiplex schizophrenia pedigrees to identify rare variation shared by affected individuals within and between pedigrees potentially accounting for the increased recurrence risk, and reducing the `variant space' under consideration. After QC and calling in our existing pipeline, a) familial sequence variants in the exome will be directly analyzed in 2000 Irish cases and 2000 Irish controls with 30X exome sequence data in production currently, and b) variants outside the exome will be imputed into 3600 Irish singleton schizophrenia or bipolar disorder cases and 3000 Irish population controls with GWAS framework data; 3781 additional UK10K controls with 10X WGS are available to increase analysis power. This imputed dataset will be analyzed using recently developed methods for kernel-based tests of variation aggregated over a defined interval (such as a gene) that avoid the inflation of type-1 error. We use multiple sources of genomic information to develop weights for each position in the genome (indexing the prior probability that a change at the site has functional consequence) and each variant detected (indexing the probability that observed changes have functional consequence), and we propose to improve the existing genomic information sources for this weighting in a number of ways. In aim 3, prioritized variants from aim 2a/2b will be directly genotyped in the case/control samples by custom microarray; individual genes or genesets showing enrichment of variation in cases (if any are observed) will be resequenced in the case/control sample. In Aim 4, the directly assessed genotypic and sequence data from aim 3 will be analyzed using standard methods to identify individual associated variants, and variant-enriched genes, genesets or other functional sequences. We seek to unambiguously identify 1) individual variants that are significantly more common in cases, or 2) individual genes or other functional sequences or 3) gene- or functional sequence sets enriched for variation in cases to provide critical information about the brain systems perturbed in schizophrenia, and the mechanisms by which such alleles increase risk. Project Narrative Rare sequence variation has been implicated in many human complex traits, incuding schizophrenia, and has been studied in unrelated cases and controls and parent:offspring trios, but remains unstudied in multiplex families. Sequencing the genomes of such families will allow conprehensive identification of variation in protein coding genes, non-coding expressed loci, regulatory sequences, and evolutionarily conserved regions, as well as detection of structural variation, and testing these alleles in a large case/control series of the same ethnic and geographic origin offers significant advantages over prior study designs, and has the potential to identify individual alleles, variant enriched genes, variant enriched non-genic sequences, and/or variant enriched genesets contributing to SCH risk in the Irish population. Such variants offer great potential for understanding the functional impact of risk alleles and improving mechanistic understanding of schizophrenia and related disorders.",Whole Genome Sequencing in Irish Multiplex Schizophrenia Families,9749268,R01MH114593,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'Alleles', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Face', 'Family', 'Genes', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Ireland', 'LGALS3BP gene', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Nucleotides', 'Parents', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Population Control', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Principal Investigator', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Recurrence', 'Research Design', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Source', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'base', 'case control', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'exome', 'genetic pedigree', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'indexing', 'member', 'offspring', 'power analysis', 'programs', 'risk variant', 'sample collection', 'trait', 'whole genome', 'working group']",NIMH,VIRGINIA COMMONWEALTH UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,430191,-0.024263109522332744
"Biomedical Computing and Informatics Strategies for Infectious Disease Research ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): An important goal of infectious disease research is to develop genetic predictors of susceptibility. Our success in this endeavor will depend critically on the informatics methods and software that are available for making sense of high-dimensional genetic and genomic data. The goal of this research program is to develop, evaluate, distribute and support new and novel biomedical computing algorithms and open-source software for identifying combinations of genetic predictors of clinically important infectious disease outcomes. This application will target the growing body of rare genetic variants identified by high-throughput DNA sequencing. Our clinical application will focus on the prediction of antiretroviral response in clinical trials for HIV/AIDS. We propose here a highly innovative Hierarchical Rare Variant Collapsing Machine (HRVCM) algorithm for identifying and collapsing combinations of rare variants across gene regions (AIM 1). We will then integrate these new collapsed HRVCM variables into our popular Multifactor Dimensionality Reduction (MDR) method that will assess them in combination with common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from genome-wide association studies or GWAS (AIM 2). Our novel HRVCM-MDR approach will, for the first time, make it possible to assess non-additive interactions among sets of rare and common variants simultaneously in genetic studies of infectious diseases. We will apply these new and novel methods to approximately 13 million rare and common variants from nearly 3000 subjects that participated in an AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) study to evaluate risk for virologic failure with efavirenz-containing antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimens (AIM 3). Finally, we will release all methods as open source to the biomedical research community through our freely available MDR software package (AIM 4). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The overall goal of this application is to develop innovative new computational methods for the genetic analysis of infectious diseases. We will focus on the development of methods that are able to detect synergistic effects of multiple genetic variants regardless of whether they are rare of common in human populations.

"Modulation of Lung Disease by Genetic/Epigenetic Profiling Project Summary/Abstract Therapeutic management of lung disorders hallmarked by the loss-of-function of the Cystic Fibrosis (CF) Transmembrane conductance Regulator (CFTR) leading to CF are challenged by genetic and epigenetic diversity found in the CF population. Given the Precision Medicine Initiative (All of Us for You (https://allofus.nih.gov/) and the large amount of genomic and phenomic diversity found in patients, it is now generally recognized that we must find new approaches to address the complexity in CF presentation in the clinic. This will require an understanding of fundamental principles dictating disease onset at birth, defined by familial genetic variation, and its progression, influenced by epigenetic programs, both unique to the individual. This proposal is about understanding the role of genetic and epigenetic diversity in CF in response to Histone DeACetylase (HDAC) activity. We have shown these relationships to be responsive to the activity of HDACs, proteins that manage the acetylation/deacetylation balance of the genome and the proteome (the epigenome) to integrate the complex functions linking the genome to the proteome and phenome. Based on the premise that the genome and epigenome are sensitive to manipulation(s) that will favor increased functionality of the CFTR variant fold, the objective of this proposal is to mechanistically define the impact of HDAC modulation on CFTR function observed at the bench and the bedside. We hypothesize that CF can be best understood based on the rationale that disease can be defined by the collective of variation found in the CF population that alters CFTR sequence-to-function-to-structure relationships in the individual as now described using Variation Spatial Profiling (VSP) and the new principle of Spatial CoVariance (SCV) (Wang and Balch, 2018, In press). It is the objective of this proposal to apply VSP/SCV to analysis of the role of the epigenome in CF. Key goals to be achieved in this proposal are to 1) define molecular, cellular and physiological states that 2) describe the role of genetic/epigenetic/proteomic diversity in the CF population to 3) provide a sequence-to-function-to-structure characterization of disease in the individual. Aim 1 will explore the impact of HDAC inhibitors (HDACi) to define, from a biochemical/genetic diversity perspective, how variation across the entire CF population will respond to rebalancing of acetylation/deacetylation dynamics. Aim 2 will focus on the role of HDAC7 in the management of CF genetic diversity using molecular, biochemical and cellular approaches. Aim 3 will analyze the role of select HDAC7-sensitive CFTR interactors to address their role in the management of CF variation from an epigenetic perspective. We hypothesize that the completion of these Aims will describe relationships in the population that define the epigenome-linked genome features that impact progression of CF in the individual. Our integrated genome/epigenome/proteome platform will advance our understanding of the contribution of genetic diversity in the progression and management of CF as a complex disease. Project Narrative CF is a complex loss-of-function disease caused by genetic and epigenetic variation in the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane conductance Regulator (CFTR). We will focus on understanding spatial relationships defined by genetic diversity across the CF population that are sensitive to Histone DeACetylase (HDAC) activity to understand the role of the acetylation/deacetylation balance in facilitating function in the individual. We will use a combination of genomic/epigenomic/proteomic approaches based on the principles of Variation Spatial Profiling (VSP) and Spatial CoVariance (SCV) to dissect the role of HDAC in integrated pathways that affect CFTR variant synthesis, folding, trafficking and stability/function at the cell surface that may be responsive to chemical and/or biological manipulation of the epigenome.",Modulation of Lung Disease by Genetic/Epigenetic Profiling,9739114,R01HL095524,"['Acetylation', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Amino Acids', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Genetics', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Birth', 'Cell Death', 'Cell surface', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Cystic Fibrosis', 'Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator', 'Deacetylation', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Environment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Equilibrium', 'Fibrosis', 'Funding', 'Gaussian model', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'HDAC7 histone deacetylase', 'Health', 'Histone Deacetylase', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitor', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Membrane', 'Mendelian disorder', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Mucous body substance', 'Onset of illness', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Publications', 'Role', 'Structure', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Variant', 'base', 'bench to bedside', 'cystic fibrosis patients', 'epigenetic profiling', 'epigenetic variation', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'genomic platform', 'healthspan', 'insight', 'loss of function', 'novel strategies', 'phenome', 'phenomics', 'programs', 'response', 'spatial relationship', 'success', 'trafficking', 'transcription factor']",NHLBI,SCRIPPS RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2019,483750,-0.013291853667922172
"Statistical Tests for Mapping Genetic Determinants of Complex Traits ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Genotyping and emerging sequencing technologies have enabled comprehensive interrogation of genetic variation across the human genome, thereby facilitating a study's ability to map genetic variants that influence phenotypes of interes. Nevertheless, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and next-generation sequencing (NGS) projects have uncovered only a limited number of trait-influencing loci. While large increases in sample size will improve power to detect such variation, the ascertainment and sequencing/genotyping of such samples are costly and inefficient. Therefore, it is desirable to increase power to detect such variants without requiring additional sample collection. We propose novel methods for improved gene mapping of common and rare susceptibility variants that move beyond standard strategies typically applied to GWAS and NGS studies of complex traits. The first topic we consider is pleiotropic or cross- phenotype effects of genetic variants. Empirical studies have suggested that pleiotropy is widespread throughout the genome and that leveraging this additional information for gene mapping yields a more powerful analysis than an analysis that ignores such information. In Aim 1, we propose novel statistical methods for genetic analysis of high-dimensional phenotype data using an innovative kernel distance-covariance (KDC) framework that allows for an arbitrary number of phenotypes both continuous and/or categorical in nature, as well as an arbitrary number of genotypes (permitting gene-based testing of both rare and common variants). We will use the KDC framework to implement tests of pleiotropy as well as tests of mediation. The second topic we consider is the mapping of rare susceptibility variants using affected pedigrees, which provide many attractive features for rare-variant testing that case-control studies lack. In Aim 2, we propose a series of powerful statistical methods for rare-variant association testing in affected pedigrees that are based on a framework (recently published in AJHG) for rare-variant association testing in affected sibships. The existing framework compares rare-variant burden in a region by an affected sib pair to the number of regions that pairs shares identical by descent. We have shown the method is more powerful than case-control association testing given fixed sample size and further is robust to population stratification. In this proposal, we will extend the framework to handle affected pedigrees of arbitrary size and structure (rather than just affected sib pairs) and devise a powerful two-stage screening and validation strategy for rare-variant mapping that first compares familial cases in the pedigrees to external controls and then follows up the most interesting findings using an independent test based on our identity-by-descent sharing statistic among the affected relatives used in the first stage. We will apply the methods in Aims 1-2 to relevant data from genetic studies of complex traits in which we are directly involved. We also will implement the methods in public user-friendly software (Aim 3). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this project is to develop a set of statistical approaches to investigate two important topics in gene- mapping studies of complex human traits. First, we will develop techniques for identifying genes that have pleiotropic effects on phenotypes of possibly high dimension and further assess whether such genes have direct effects on such phenotypes or indirect effects through other possible factors. Second, we will develop tools to facilitate identification of rare polymorphic variation that increase risk for complex disease using data from affected pedigrees of arbitrary size and structure. We will evaluate these methods using simulated data and illustrate their value by applying them to genetic projects of complex traits in which we are actively involved. Application of the proposed methods to these datasets should improve our understanding of the genetic origins of various complex traits.",Statistical Tests for Mapping Genetic Determinants of Complex Traits,9616870,R01GM117946,"['Affect', 'Applied Genetics', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Categories', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Family', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genetic study', 'Genets', 'Genome', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mediation', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Nature', 'Phenotype', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Siblings', 'Signal Transduction', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'case control', 'cost', 'design', 'flexibility', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic association', 'genetic pedigree', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genome-wide analysis', 'high dimensionality', 'human disease', 'identity by descent', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'novel sequencing technology', 'phenotypic data', 'pleiotropism', 'population stratification', 'public health relevance', 'rare variant', 'risk variant', 'sample collection', 'screening', 'tool', 'trait', 'user friendly software']",NIGMS,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,297373,-0.03120673911339873
"Genetic neuroscience: How human genes and alleles shape neuronal phenotypes Genetic studies have identified many specific loci with significant associations to psychiatric disorders. However, unless we can develop useful approaches for systematically turning genetic information into neurobiological insights about brain disorders, there is a danger that costly and hard-won genetic findings will not be exploitable to understand pathophysiology and generate important therapeutic hypotheses. The goal of our collaborative, interdisciplinary effort is to develop powerful, generalizable approaches for discovering how risk variants for psychiatric disorders shape neurobiological processes at multiple levels of analysis, and to identify the processes whose dysregulation underlies disease. To do this, we propose to develop new experimental and inferential systems to bridge a longstanding gap between human genetics and experimental biology. We aim to identify biological causes and effects that span the genetic, molecular, and cellular levels of the nervous system. Our interdisciplinary team will develop new experimental systems that measure genetic influences across levels of analysis (RNA, proteins, and cellular function including physiology) in precise, scalable, well- controlled ways. We will make use of emerging cellular systems including three-dimensional cortical spheroids and organoids, and radically novel “population in a dish” experimental systems that collect data on cells from hundreds of donors in a shared environment, inferring donor identity at the time of phenotypic readout. The analysis of such systems in turn requires sophisticated inferential strategies and new ideas from computer science. We propose to develop and widely share experimental and computational resources, including cell lines, methods, datasets, and analytic tools. The successful completion of this work will identify key neurobiological processes for multiple psychiatric disorders, and fortify many other scientists in making such connections in their own work. We hope in so doing to create a new kind of interdisciplinary science that – by combining the strengths of data-driven, unbiased human genetics with the power of emerging experimental systems – transforms the rate at which human- genetic leads lead to insights about disease mechanisms. To better understand common, severe psychiatric illnesses and develop improved treatments for them, we need to understand what specific aspects of brain biology give rise to each disorder. Here a team of scientists with diverse areas of expertise – from neuroscience to computer science to psychiatry to human genetics to stem cell biology – come together to develop a set of next-generation scientific approaches to this important problem, and to generate new methods and data sets that we will widely share. Our team will work to understand how aspects of brain biology at many levels – genes, molecules, and cells – act upon one another to create vulnerability to psychiatric illness.",Genetic neuroscience: How human genes and alleles shape neuronal phenotypes,9757833,U01MH115727,"['Affect', 'Alleles', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Awareness', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'California', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell Line', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Communities', 'Computer Analysis', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Experimental Models', 'Functional disorder', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic study', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Investments', 'Ion Channel', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Microglia', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Mutation', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Organoids', 'Penetrance', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Psychiatry', 'RNA', 'Regenerative Medicine', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Shapes', 'System', 'Technology', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'cell type', 'computer science', 'computing resources', 'cost', 'cytokine', 'excitatory neuron', 'experimental study', 'genetic information', 'human data', 'improved', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'inhibitory neuron', 'innovation', 'insight', 'loss of function mutation', 'multidimensional data', 'neurophysiology', 'next generation', 'novel', 'protein expression', 'protein function', 'rare variant', 'response', 'risk variant', 'stem cell biology', 'translational neuroscience', 'whole genome']",NIMH,"BROAD INSTITUTE, INC.",U01,2019,4129117,0.019422575516076096
"Overlap in genetic and learning-based mechanisms for alcohol use disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder Project Summary  Alcohol use disorder (AUD) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are common outcomes following trauma that are frequently comorbid, and this comorbidity is associated with greater symptom severity and poorer prognosis. Thus, efforts to better understand the etiology of these conditions is important for decreasing negative outcomes and improving prevention and treatment efforts, as much is still unknown regarding the etiology and mechanisms involved in their co-occurrence. Recent research has found that in addition to both phenotypes being moderately heritable, there is a modest degree of overlap in their latent genetic risk. Moreover, there is reason to suggest that fear-learning mechanisms frequently associated with PTSD may also be associated with AUD. Areas in need of further research include identification of molecular variation responsible for AUD/PTSD comorbidity, and extension of fear-learning models to AUD and comorbid AUD/PTSD populations. Developments in statistical procedures have afforded the ability to leverage genome- wide association data to answer key questions about these shared molecular underpinnings. The overarching goals of this K01 proposal are threefold. First, the study aims to use existing large-scale genome-wide data from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC; PTSD and Substance Use Disorders workgroups) to examine the molecular overlap via bivariate single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based heritability models, and determine if the polygenic risk score (PRS) from each disorder predicts case status in the other dataset. Second, a clinical laboratory study will be conducted using fear-conditioning paradigms in a trauma-exposed sample of diagnosis free controls, AUD, PTSD, and comorbid AUD/PTSD diagnostic groups to determine if deficits in learning are shared. Finally, an exploratory aim will use the PRS scores from the PGC data to generate risk scores in the lab sample to examine if there is a genetic association with conditioning deficits.  To achieve these aims, the candidate and multidisciplinary mentorship team have developed a comprehensive training plan that delineates a series of training and research goals. These goals will incorporate training in the epidemiology and genetics of AUD and PTSD, molecular and statistical genetics techniques, and conduct of clinical laboratory paradigms using genetic and psychophysiological measures. This training and resultant findings will capitalize on existing expertise and provide additional, focused training to allow for the development of a multimodal research program that uses large-scale genetic association findings to develop mechanism-focused laboratory studies that inform upon the development and maintenance of this complex presentation. The proposed research represents an important contribution towards advancing our understanding of the complicated and frequently comorbid phenotypes of AUD and PTSD. The institutional environment is ideal for the candidate's goal of developing an independent research line that ultimately aims to decrease the burden of alcohol-related problems, consistent with NIAAA research priority. Project Narrative Alcohol use disorder (AUD) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) commonly co-occur, and some of the genetic risk for these conditions is shared. This project aims to elucidate the shared molecular genetic risk and examine potential learning-based mechanisms common to both disorders, by linking large-scale genome-wide data with a clinical laboratory study. This K01 award will provide the candidate with the training necessary to pursue a multimodal program of research that aims to synthesize genetically informed research with laboratory studies of mechanism to inform upon the shared underpinnings of AUD and PTSD and advance work aimed at improving prevention and treatment efforts.",Overlap in genetic and learning-based mechanisms for alcohol use disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder,9689882,K01AA025692,"['Address', 'Alcohol Phenotype', 'Alcohols', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Clinical', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Extinction (Psychology)', 'Fright', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Techniques', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Glean', 'Goals', 'Heritability', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Study', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Outcome', 'Phenotype', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prevention', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychophysiology', 'Research', 'Research Priority', 'Research Support', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Symptoms', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Trauma', 'Twin Studies', 'Variant', 'Work', 'addiction', 'alcohol comorbidity', 'alcohol related problem', 'alcohol use disorder', 'base', 'conditioned fear', 'conditioning', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'genetic association', 'genetic epidemiology', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'interest', 'laboratory experiment', 'molecular scale', 'multidisciplinary', 'multimodality', 'outcome forecast', 'programs', 'psychogenetics', 'responsible alcohol use', 'risk sharing', 'skills', 'trait', 'trauma exposure']",NIAAA,VIRGINIA COMMONWEALTH UNIVERSITY,K01,2019,172364,-0.01953380451795247
"Systems Biology Analysis of Cardiac Electrical Activity and Arrhythmias. Cardiac arrhythmias are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. Abnormalities in heart rate, cardiac conduction (PR and QRS) and repolarization (QT) measured on the ECG predispose to the clinically important cardiac arrhythmias of atrial fibrillation (AF) and ventricular fibrillation (VF) / sudden cardiac death (SCD). We examine the genomic basis of these ECG endophenotypes in order to deconstruct arrhythmias into more proximate traits and discrete components, allowing us to better understand underlying mechanisms, provide insight into arrhythmia generation, and help target development of novel therapies.  The molecular architecture of cardiac electrical activity and arrhythmias is not fully understood, but likely involves genomic, epigenomic, and environmental influences. Over the past 10 years, we have identified numerous common loci associated with cardiac electrical activity and arrhythmias, yet these common variants account for only a portion of the heritability of electrophysiologic and arrhythmic phenotypes. The agnostic examination of genotype-phenotype associations employed in genome- wide association studies (GWAS) does not incorporate knowledge of functional genomic regions or important biologic relationships. Additionally, we currently lack an understanding of the molecular mechanisms connecting mostly intergenic and intronic GWAS signals to phenotype. We therefore hypothesize that a systems biology approach integrating genetic sequence variation with omic data (epigenomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data) will uncover novel associations and elucidate biologic mechanisms associated with arrhythmia-related phenotypes. We further hypothesize that examining the simultaneous association between sequence variation and multiple cardiac electrophysiologic phenotypes will help uncover additional novel mechanisms associated with cardiac electrical activity and arrhythmias.  TOPMed's combination of rich phenotype data, with whole genome sequence (WGS), epigenomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data, provides a unique opportunity to more comprehensively explore these hypotheses. We leverage sequence, omic, and phenotype data from multiple cohort studies to efficiently and cost-effectively examine and dissect association of omic factors with cardiac electrophysiology and arrhythmia risk. Our application is an ambitious yet eminently feasible effort that integrates clinical, genetic, and systems biology expertise. We aim to discover associations using omics data (Aims 1 and 2) and elucidate specific genes and biologic pathways underlying these associations (Aims 3 and 4). Our ultimate goal is to identify pathways, genes, and genetic variation that are clinically relevant, and therefore potentially the target of new therapies, diagnostics, or risk predictions. Narrative Cardiac arrhythmias are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. This proposal aims to use genomic, epigenomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data, combined with complex systems biology and pleiotropic analyses, to better understand the underlying pathways and genes involved in normal electrophysiology and arrhythmia formation. The identification of biologic factors that influence cardiac electrical activity and arrhythmias will provide insight into the mechanisms of arrhythmia generation, and perhaps identify better targets for drug development and prevention.",Systems Biology Analysis of Cardiac Electrical Activity and Arrhythmias.,9737693,R01HL141989,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Architecture', 'Arrhythmia', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Biological', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Process', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Electrophysiologic Techniques', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Drug Targeting', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Genotype-Tissue Expression Project', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Heart', 'Heart Rate', 'Heritability', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Medical Genetics', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multiomic Data', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Regulator Genes', 'Risk', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Ventricular Fibrillation', 'base', 'causal variant', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinically relevant', 'cost', 'drug development', 'endophenotype', 'epigenomics', 'functional genomics', 'genome wide association study', 'heart electrical activity', 'insight', 'mortality', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'phenotypic data', 'pleiotropism', 'rare variant', 'sudden cardiac death', 'trait', 'transcriptomics', 'whole genome']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2019,490901,-0.03524369669702168
"Integrate gene expression data to characterize the contribution of rare genetic risk factors to structural birth defects Project Summary  We aim to maximize discovery of new risk genes and elucidate the genetic architecture of structural birth defects. To achieve that, we propose cross-disease genetic analysis of both protein-coding and noncoding variants and integration of gene expression data to prioritize candidate risk genes.  Better understanding of the genetic basis of structural birth defects will lead to new insights into human developmental biology and will provide targets for medical intervention and treatment. Recent large-scale genome and exome sequencing studies of birth defects have identified new risk genes, especially through the analysis of de novo variants in protein coding regions. However, we are still far from complete understanding of the genetic causes of birth defects. Estimates are that there are 400- 800 risk genes of large effect size for birth defects such as congenital heart disease, and the vast majority of these genes are unknown. This is primarily due to the lack of statistical power. While increasing sample size is essential and is part of the core deliverables of the Gabriella Miller Kids First (GMKF) programs, we also need to develop and apply new analytical methods that improve power and maximize the utility of the available genetic data by using other types of data and biological knowledge. In addition, in most prior studies, the analysis of rare genetic variation has been focused on small variants in the coding regions or large copy number variants (CNV). The data and methods to interrogate the contribution of rare noncoding variants is rudimentary, limiting our understanding of genetic architecture of these diseases. In this study, we propose two aims to address these questions by leverage GMKF cross-disease whole genome sequencing data sets: Specific Aim 1. Elucidate genetic architecture by cross-disease analysis of rare coding and non-coding variants. Specific Aim 2. Integrate gene expression with genome sequencing data to improve discovery and biological interpretation of risk genes of structural birth defects.  The proposed study will maximize the genetic discovery potential of the GMKF WGS data sets for birth defects and improve our understanding of the pleiotropic effects and tissue specificity of risk genes and variants. The analytical approaches developed in this study will be applicable to genetic data of birth defects and developmental disorders from future GMKF cohorts and other programs.

"PiNDA - Fully integrated software platform for Preimplantation Genetic Testing - Aneuploidy (PGT-A) PROJECT SUMMARY  Since its inception 40 years ago, in vitro fertilization (IVF) has resulted in the birth of more than 1 million babies in the United States, and has revolutionized the field of reproductive medicine. Unfortunately, the success rate of IVF is still exceedingly low, especially for women >40 years old, with only 15.5% of implanted embryos resulting in pregnancy. This is partly due to the cytological method used for pre-implantation screening, which cannot detect the most common genetic defect during IVF, aneuploidy (i.e. chromosomal copy-number variation). Aneuploidy is linked to higher rates of miscarriage, and occurs more often in women >40 years of age; thus, aneuploidy has been a frequent target for genetic screening to improve IVF outcomes.  Pre-implantation genetic testing for aneuploidy (PGT-A) refers to a variety of techniques aimed at detecting changes in chromosomal copy number, with the goal of identifying high-quality euploid embryos for implantation. Recent advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have made it possible to screen embryos at higher levels of precision, and across a wider range of genetic defects, including mosaicism, triploidy and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Despite these remarkable advances, there are still significant challenges with PGT-A sequencing. Indeed, the most commonly implemented software for PGT-A (i.e. BlueFuse® ) are bundled with specific sequencing platforms (i.e. VeriSeq®), and are only designed to test for aneuploidy. Furthermore, existing pipelines are not user-friendly or customizable, which is a serious obstacle prohibiting the use of NGS by clinicians / embryologists. A more accessible bioinformatics platform is desperately needed that will bridge the gap between PGT-A sequencing and IVF outcomes.  Basepair™ is an innovator in efficient, user-friendly, web-based NGS analysis systems, with fully automated ChIP-, RNA-, ATAC-, and DNA-Seq bioinformatics pipelines available online. Here, Basepair will deliver PiNDA™, the first fully integrated software solution for comprehensive PGT-A analysis. In Aim 1, we will develop modules to test for specific chromosomal abnormalities, including mosaicism and triploidy, and validate each model with training data derived from somatic cell lines with known chromosomal aberrations. In Aim 2, we will integrate our modules into the PiNDA software system, creating a user-friendly, web-based interface that will perform full data analysis (raw data to full summary report) in <15 minutes, with no manual input required. Final data will be accessible via Basepair’s online portal, facilitating rapid data transfer from embryologists to physicians, and supporting the integration of NGS tests in IVF. Our innovative bioinformatics platform will accelerate NGS analysis for IVF, improving rates of pregnancy and advancing research in the success of IVF procedures. PROJECT NARRATIVE  In vitro fertilization (IVF) methods have begun to leverage next-generation sequencing technologies for pre-implantation genetic testing of aneuploidy (PGT-A), expanding the array of chromosomal abnormalities that can be accurately detected. However, the vast majority of software can only distinguish one type of genetic defect (i.e. aneuploidy), are difficult to use, and are tied to distinct sequencing platforms, limiting the clinical utility of resulting analyses. Basepair™ Inc. is a pioneer in user-friendly, web-based bioinformatics pipelines, providing comprehensive services for a wide range of sequencing projects. Here, Basepair will develop an inclusive suite of software for PGT-A, compatible with sequencing data from multiple platforms.

"High-resolution map of human germline mutation patterns and inference of mutagenic mechanisms ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mutations are the ultimate source of genetic variation and one of the driving forces of evolution. Both the absolute mutation rate and the relative rate among mutation subtypes fluctuate along the genome, affected by adjacent nucleotide motifs and local features such as GC content and replication timing. Characterizing regional variation of mutation patterns is critical for understanding genome evolution and to identify variants causing genetic diseases. However, mutation rate and molecular spectrum are difficult to measure at high resolution, genomewide, and in an unbiased fashion. Estimates based on common variants and between- species substitutions are confounded by natural selection, population demographic history, and biased gene conversion (BGC). Methods relying on incidence rates of monogenic diseases or finding de novo variants by trio sequencing can inform global trends, but do not provide sufficient data to assess fine-scale local parameters. This study will overcome these limitations by using the extremely rare variants (ERVs) as a new data source to characterize patterns of recent germline variation in humans. ERVs, defined in this study as singletons in 30,000 samples, are becoming available via large-scale whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of population samples. Unlike common variants or substitutions, ERVs arose very recently and are largely unaffected by selection, BGC, etc. We will analyze 200-300 million singleton variants observed in 30,000 subjects at 20-30X coverage. The regional distribution of ERV subtypes will establish a quantitative atlas of the rate and spectrum of human germline mutations mostly unaltered by selection. We will share this resource with the research community and apply it to determine the impact of local genomic features and epigenomic attributes. We will use the systematic departures between ERVs and variants of higher frequencies (polymorphisms and substitutions) to infer local effects of selection, and this may uncover hitherto unknown functional regions of the genome. By comparing mutation signatures in ERVs with those in somatic variations observed in diverse cancers we will attribute distinct mutational signatures to known biochemical processes and thus infer the major contributors to new germline mutations in the human genome. This subtype-specific atlas will also be used to predict the probability of observing every possible single-base mutation in the genome, thus facilitating the interpretation of candidate causal variants of human diseases. We will assess mutation pattern differences among European Americans, African Americans and Latinos, and seek to discover genetic modifiers of germline mutation rate by finding functionally damaging mutations that show increased ERV counts in the surrounding genomic region, potentially identifying both known and previous unknown ""mutator"" genes that play a role in transmission fidelity in humans. This research will provide an essential resource to study the genesis and maintenance of germline mutations in humans. Understanding such a fundamental process will be the basis for a deeper understanding of human evolution and diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We will study the patterns of inherited mutations in humans using approximately 250 million extremely rare DNA variants in human populations. Our results will allow the prediction of the rate of new mutations at every site in the genome based on features of the surrounding DNA sequence, thus providing a common resource to study the arrival and maintenance of mutations in humans. Understanding such a basic process is important for answering fundamental questions in human evolution, the cause of inherited diseases, and the role of DNA abnormality in cancer and aging.",High-resolution map of human germline mutation patterns and inference of mutagenic mechanisms,9702844,R01GM118928,"['Address', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'American', 'Atlases', 'Biochemical Process', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Child', 'Chromatin', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Demographic Factors', 'Dependence', 'Disease', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'European', 'Evolution', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Gene Conversion', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Recombination', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Germ-Line Mutation', 'Guanine + Cytosine Composition', 'Hereditary Disease', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Human Genome', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Latino', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mendelian disorder', 'Methods', 'Mismatch Repair', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutation', 'Natural Selections', 'Nucleotides', 'Parents', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resource Sharing', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Selection Bias', 'Site', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Source', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Tissues', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'actionable mutation', 'base', 'causal variant', 'data sharing', 'density', 'driving force', 'epigenomics', 'genetic analysis', 'genome sequencing', 'genome-wide', 'human disease', 'human model', 'improved', 'next generation sequencing', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'rare variant', 'repository', 'transmission process', 'trend', 'web server', 'whole genome']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2019,300191,-0.002496027609216873
"Massively parallel functional analyses of human PTEN variants Project Summary  We are now able to routinely sequence human genomes at single-base resolution. However, our ability to interpret the functional consequences of detected mutations has lagged behind. Computational approaches scale well but have poor accuracy, whereas retrospective analysis of detected variants has high accuracy but does not scale well. In order to solve this problem, a new experimental paradigm has emerged to empirically characterize the effects of mutations with high accuracy at scale. This approach takes advantage of recent and ongoing improvements in DNA synthesis and sequencing, and has the potential to offer unprecedented insight into protein biochemistry and human disease. We believe these insights will prove to be critical for unlocking the potential of genomic medicine.  In this project we seek to comprehensively assess multiple molecular effects of PTEN mutations on protein function, and assess the utility of this data as a predictor for human clinical phenotype. The PTEN protein is a tumor suppressor that is frequently mutated in diverse human cancers and in the germline of some individuals with overgrowth disorders, cancer predisposition syndromes, or autism. Currently, it is impossible to predict the effects of the vast majority of PTEN germline mutations. Since the phenotypic spectrum of PTEN mutation carriers is broad, it would be highly valuable to understand the ways in which phenotypic outcomes arise from PTEN mutation genotypes.  In Aim 1, we will first employ a yeast-based screen to assess the effects all PTEN single amino acid mutations on lipid phosphatase activity, the primary biochemical function of PTEN protein. It is known that several pathogenic variants are destabilized. Therefore, in Aim 2, we will perform a second, independent screen to assess the steady state protein stability of all PTEN single amino acid mutations. In Aim 3, we will use the data derived from this study as well as publically available biochemical information to train a classifier model to predict the relationship between the mutation genotypes and clinical phenotypes observed in humans. These data will increase our fundamental understanding of PTEN function and the role of mutations in diverse disorders, and could provide a valuable clinical tool that would increase the quality of life for PTEN mutation carriers. Project Narrative  Mutations in the gene PTEN are causal for a diverse set of clinical disorders ranging from cancer to autism spectrum disorder. Here, we seek to gain new fundamental insights into the functional relationships between PTEN mutations and clinical presentations by prospectively characterizing the effects of all single amino acid PTEN mutations in parallel. These data will allow the creation of new models that can predict risk of specific PTEN mutations for different clinical outcomes and potentially lead to personalized therapies, early interventions, and optimal outcomes for PTEN mutation carriers.",Massively parallel functional analyses of human PTEN variants,9794010,F31HD095571,"['Affect', 'Amino Acids', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Biophysics', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Cell Separation', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Coupling', 'DNA biosynthesis', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Deletion Mutation', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'FRAP1 gene', 'Fluorescence', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Germ-Line Mutation', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Metabolism', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Outcome', 'PTEN gene', 'PTEN protein', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphatidylinositols', 'Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases', 'Play', 'Predisposition', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Protein Biochemistry', 'Proteins', 'Pythons', 'Quality of life', 'Reaction', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Training', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Ubiquitination', 'Variant', 'Yeast Model System', 'Yeasts', 'accurate diagnosis', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'clinical phenotype', 'experimental study', 'fitness', 'genomic signature', 'genomic variation', 'high throughput technology', 'human disease', 'improved', 'insight', 'mutation carrier', 'next generation', 'novel', 'open source', 'personalized medicine', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'protein function', 'screening', 'synthetic biology', 'tool', 'tumorigenic']",NICHD,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,F31,2019,45016,-0.036924785431860244
"Discovering Novel Structural Genomic Rearrangements Using Deep Neural Networks Abstract Accurately detecting structural variation in the genome is a challenging task. Many approaches have been developed over the last few decades, yet it is estimated that tens of thousands of variants are still being missed in a given sample. Many of these variants are missed due to the limitations of using short-read sequencing to identify large variants. Although many of these missed variants are located within complex regions of the genome, it has been shown that some still have clinical relevance making their discovery important. New platforms have been developed for sequencing the genome using long-reads and show promise for overcoming many of these limitations creating the ability to identify the full spectrum of simple and complex structural variants. Because this technology is relatively young, new computational approaches to support the analysis of long-read sequencing data can aid in the discovery of these variants which are still being missed. In addition to detecting novel variation in samples with long-read sequencing data, computational approaches can be developed to leverage these novel variant calls to reanalyze the hundreds of thousands of short-read datasets currently available. In this proposal, we plan to develop new computational approaches to identify novel structural variation in the genome. In Aim 1, we will apply a recurrence approach to analyze long read sequencing datasets utilizing deep neural networks. In Aim 2, we will develop a tool to derive profiles of structural variants predicted in long- reads which can be used to identify and genotype structural variants calls in short read data-sets. Together, these approaches will allow researchers to accurately characterize structural variation in both long and short- read datasets. Narrative Structural variation has been implicated in numerous human diseases but there are still tens of thousands of variants being overlooked in the genome. The proposed research aims to detect novel variation by developing new computational tools to analyze data generated by state-of-the-art sequencing methods. These tools will aid in the discovery of variants associated with human health.",Discovering Novel Structural Genomic Rearrangements Using Deep Neural Networks,9755117,F31HG010569,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Sciences', 'Categories', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA', 'DNA Resequencing', 'DNA Sequence Rearrangement', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Future', 'Genome', 'Genotype', 'Haplotypes', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Label', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Computations', 'Pattern', 'Process', 'Recurrence', 'Repetitive Sequence', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'comparative', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'genome sequencing', 'human disease', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'new technology', 'novel', 'reference genome', 'structural genomics', 'tool']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,F31,2019,37153,-0.016625118733071615
"Molecular Characterization of Joubert Syndrome Project Summary Congenital ataxia presents in early childhood with non-progressive hypotonia, gross motor, fine motor and cognitive delays. These disorders are distinct from the progressive ataxias because of the presence of congenital cerebellar malformations and because they are typically inherited recessively. Joubert Syndrome and Related Disorders (JSRD) constitute a major subset of these conditions, consisting of a cerebellar midline (vermis) malformation, a nearly pathognomonic Molar Tooth sign on brain Imaging (MTI) and co-existent oculomotor apraxia and episodic breathing dysrhythmias. In our published data, we have: 1] Identified ten unique genetic causes of JSRD (nearly half of the published causes), 2] Generated genotype-phenotype correlations involving cerebellar, retinal, renal, hepatic, digit, and cerebral manifestations. 3] Identified common founder mutations that allow for population-based screening. 4] Discovered that JSRD encoded proteins frequently localize to the cilium. 5] Identified ciliary transition zone (TZ) defects in cells with JSRD mutations. 6] Performed siRNA cell-based screens for defective ciliogenesis to prioritize candidate JSRD genes. 7] Generated and characterized multiple zebrafish, mouse and human cell culture models for JSRD. 8] Defined the concept of ‘Ciliary localization’ model, in which one JSRD gene is required for ciliary localization of other JSRD proteins. In our unpublished data we have: 1] Recruited an additional 200 JSRD patients without molecular diagnosis. 2] Performed whole exome (WES) and whole genome sequencing (WGS) on an additional 100 JSRD families. 3] Identified an additional 12 novel likely JSRD candidate genes. 4] Generated IPSCs and cerebellar organoids from mutation-positive and negative families to aid in functional analysis and gene discovery using RNAseq. 5] Begun functional validation of the putative mutations. 6] Developed methods to interrogate ciliary structure in a high-throughput fashion with electron microscopy (EM). The goal of this competing renewal is to identify the remaining ‘discoverable’ genes that lead to JSRD when lost, functionally validate mutations within the pathogenetic framework, and test the hypothesis that mutations in JSRD genes lead to collapse of the ciliary TZ. Because the majority of patients still have unknown cause of disease, this renewal aims to advance knowledge through molecular characterization of new genes, using newly evolving high-throughput techniques, integrated bioinformatics, and a unique resource of consanguineous families recruited world-wide. We further aim to validate these mutations in patient cells, within a mechanistic framework that JSRD genes are required for essential ciliary structural components during cerebellar development. Project Narrative Joubert syndrome is a genetically and phenotypically heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorder unified by defects of the cellular primary cilium.

"Optimizing Genetic Testing for Deafness for Clinical Diagnostics Project Summary  Hearing loss is the most common sensory deficit in humans. It is diagnosed in 1 in 500 newborns and affects half of all octogenarians. Although causality is multifactorial, in developed countries a large fraction of hearing loss is genetic and non-syndromic, i.e. not associated with other phenotypes.  During the prior granting period, we implemented and integrated comprehensive genetic testing as a cornerstone in the evaluation of the deaf and hard-of-hearing person. The American College of Medical Genetics has recognized the merit of this approach, and in 2014 included comprehensive genetic testing for the evaluation of deafness in their newest treatment guidelines. In the largest study to date to corroborate this decision, we found an underlying genetic cause for hearing loss in 440 (39%) of 1119 sequentially accrued patients chosen without exclusion criteria. Pathogenic variants were present in 49 genes and included missense variants (49%), copy number changes (18%), indels (18%), nonsense variants (8%), splice-site alterations (6%) and promoter variants (<1%), making comprehensive genetic testing the single best test to order in the diagnosis of hearing loss after an audiogram.  In this competitive renewal, we will build on these accomplishments by completing the following aims: • Specific Aim 1: To optimize phenotype-genotype integration in the analysis of hereditary hearing loss  by refining the use of hierarchical surface clustering and audioprofile surface analysis to determine  which types of genetic hearing loss are associated with clinically meaningful sub-clusters • Specific Aim 2: To validate and integrate physics-based protein modeling as a tool within the Deafness  Variation Database to predict variant effect and the molecular and patient phenotype • Specific Aim 3: To identify genetic modifiers of specific deafness-causing genes predicted by  hierarchical surface clustering and validated by physics-based potential free-energy modeling  The successful completion of this grant will improve the clinical care of persons with hearing loss by enhancing phenome-genome integration and by making variant interpretation more robust. Knowledge gained from this proposal will also lay the foundation for refined studies focused on the identification of genetic modifiers – both positive and negative – associated with complex phenotypes such as noise- induced and age-related hearing loss. This competitive renewal addresses the increasingly daunting challenge of variant interpretation. We will seamlessly integrate AudioGene into the OtoSCOPE® pipeline, explore hierarchical surfaces clustering at all loci, enhance the utility of the Deafness Variation Database by adding physics-based potential free-energy modeling, and using these tools, identify genetic modifiers of select types of genetic hearing loss. The completion of these aims will lay the foundation for more refined studies focused on the identification of genetic modifiers – both positive and negative – associated with complex hearing loss phenotypes including noise-induced and age-related hearing loss.",Optimizing Genetic Testing for Deafness for Clinical Diagnostics,9593020,R01DC012049,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Area', 'Biology', 'Case Study', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cochlear implant procedure', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Cystic Fibrosis', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Trees', 'Developed Countries', 'Developing Countries', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Duchenne muscular dystrophy', 'Enrollment', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Exclusion Criteria', 'Foundations', 'Free Energy', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Hearing', 'Hearing Tests', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Infrastructure', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Massive Parallel Sequencing', 'Medical Genetics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Newborn Infant', 'Noise', 'Octogenarian', 'Otoscopes', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Physics', 'Presbycusis', 'Proteins', 'RNA Splicing', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Scientist', 'Sensory', 'Site', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Variant', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinical implementation', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinically significant', 'cohort', 'deaf', 'deafness', 'design', 'evaluation/testing', 'falls', 'gene therapy', 'genetic disorder diagnosis', 'hard of hearing', 'hearing impairment', 'hearing loss phenotype', 'hearing preservation', 'hearing threshold', 'hereditary hearing loss', 'improved', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'medical schools', 'novel', 'phenome', 'precision genetics', 'prognostic', 'promoter', 'research clinical testing', 'software systems', 'tool', 'treatment guidelines']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R01,2019,480576,0.03222727074181328
"Dissecting the pathogenesis and outcomes of PSC using multi-omics by studying the exposome and genome PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The major goal of this RC2 proposal is to generate the first, multi-omics translational study capturing the sum of environmental exposures (i.e. the exposome) and comprehensive data resource for Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC), a chronic, progressive liver disease without effective medical therapy. PSC shortens survival, is associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and strongly predisposes to cholangiocarcinoma (i.e. bile duct cancer) and colon cancer. Our recent genome wide association studies (GWAS) revealed the significant role of genetic variation in PSC, while also re-emphasizing the importance of environmental factors and gene-environment interactions in PSC pathogenesis. To further elucidate the role of exposures from our external environment and lifestyle (e.g., diet, stress, toxins, drugs, microbes), we have assembled a world-class, multi-disciplinary team that synergizes expertise and resources across four institutions: Mayo Clinic, Emory University, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), and University of Oslo, Norway. Our collaborative team will leverage large clinical databases and biorepositories, as well as expertise in PSC and related conditions, exposomics, metabolomics, methylomics, transcriptomics, metagenomics, genomics, and data analytics to develop the PSC Scientific Community Resource for hypothesis-generating science and simultaneously uncover factors contributing to PSC.  We now seek to define the bigger-picture cellular networks, rather than individual genes, driving disease processes. To do so, we will use unbiased network-based approaches designed to integrate multiple layers of omics data. Our proposal is predicated on the hypothesis that multi-omics analyses of data capturing environmental exposures and the associated biological responses, including the effect on the genome, will reveal networks or pathways influencing PSC pathogenesis and outcomes. To test this hypothesis, we will perform a series of sophisticated analyses to identify PSC-associated changes in and across the exposome, metabolome, methylome, and transcriptome in blood as well as the gut metagenome, exposome and metabolome.  Our collaboration and data generation are already underway with pilot studies demonstrating differences in blood exposomes and metabolomes and stool metagenomes between PSC patients and controls. Using a suite of bioinformatic tools and available genetic variation data, we aim to discover stable, detectable, omics-based disease signatures in blood (Aim 1) and stool (Aim 2) that when integrated with clinical data (Aim 3) will reveal biological pathways driving disease pathogenesis and outcomes. All data, residual specimens, and analytical details will be made freely available to the research community in accordance with NIDDK's mission. Furthermore, this effort responds to the NIDDK's call “to better understand the role of the microbiome, genetics, and exposome.” PROJECT NARRATIVE We seek to generate the first, multi-omics translational study and comprehensive data resource for Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC), a chronic, progressive liver disease without medical therapy. We will define the bigger-picture cellular networks and gene-environment interactions driving PSC by integrating multiple layers of -omics data. In so doing, we will identify molecular disease signatures, including environmental toxins, metabolism-related chemicals and gut bacteria, unique to PSC patients.",Dissecting the pathogenesis and outcomes of PSC using multi-omics by studying the exposome and genome,9773075,RC2DK118619,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Age', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bile duct carcinoma', 'Biological', 'Blood', 'Chemical Exposure', 'Chemicals', 'Childhood', 'Cholangiocarcinoma', 'Cholestasis', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collaborations', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Communities', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Feces', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'High Performance Computing', 'Illinois', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Inflammatory disease of the intestine', 'Institution', 'Life Style', 'Light', 'Link', 'Liver diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Medical', 'Metagenomics', 'Microbe', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Disease', 'Multiomic Data', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Network-based', 'Norway', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pesticides', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Research', 'Residual state', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Science', 'Series', 'Shotguns', 'Specimen', 'Stress', 'Sum', 'Systems Biology', 'Taxonomy', 'Testing', 'Toxic Environmental Substances', 'Toxin', 'Universities', 'base', 'biobank', 'bioinformatics tool', 'clinical database', 'data integration', 'data resource', 'design', 'gene environment interaction', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic data', 'gut bacteria', 'gut metagenome', 'gut microbiota', 'improved', 'innovation', 'liver transplantation', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'metagenome', 'methylation pattern', 'methylome', 'methylomics', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple omics', 'novel', 'patient population', 'peripheral blood', 'personalized approach', 'pollutant', 'primary outcome', 'primary sclerosing cholangitis', 'programs', 'response', 'sex', 'toxin metabolism', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'translational study']",NIDDK,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,RC2,2019,1566059,-0.015080428358440992
"Modeling Dimensionality and Genetic Heterogeneity in Schizophrenia ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Schizophrenia (SZ) represents a significant and costly public health burden. Recently, we have witnessed the emergence of the first molecular insights into the etiopathogenic mechanisms of SZ, via the first genome-wide association studies (GWAS) with sufficient case-control sample sizes to detect allelic effects. Importantly, a polygenic signature, which includes genome-wide significant common genetic variants of small effect, has been clearly demonstrated to influence SZ risk. The availability of well-defined risk factors makes it possible, for the first time, to address several critical questions about the genetic architecture of SZ and its component phenotypes and endophenotypes. The overarching goals of this K01 proposal are 1) to test polygenic risk score prediction of dimensional SZ and schizotypy phenotypes across large case, high-density SZ pedigree, and prodromal-aged GWAS samples, and 2) to develop and test, with leaders of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, innovative statistical methods to identify and characterize ""genetic subtypes"" of SZ.  This proposal delineates a series of training and research goals for the candidate that incorporates strengths from phenotypic assessment, statistical genetics, and molecular genetics and combines samples reflecting a broad range of genetic risk. The candidate will capitalize on previously established expertise in schizotypy and clinical risk assessment, as well as expertise in the familial transmission of dimensional traits, to establish a program of translational research wherein the application of statistical genetic/bioinformatic techniques to genetic subtyping analyses will be used to generate promising candidates for further exploration in human genomic data. Empirically-based genetic subtyping methods will be developed and tested in the largest SZ case sample to date, and subtypes will be characterized with respect to dimensional phenotypic traits. Top loci hits in subtype analyses of dimensional symptoms will be validated in secondary analyses of differential gene expression in post-mortem SZ brain. This will allow for a detailed analysis of function at both the SNP and gene levels, and will provide the candidate with substantive training in both statistical and molecular genetics methods. The institutional environment is ideal for the candidate's goal of developing a comprehensive program in SZ research, and the proposed research represents an important contribution toward advancing the understanding of SZ through a combination of clinical, statistical, molecular, and translational methods, consistent with the mission of the NIMH. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Mental illnesses such as schizophrenia constitute 13% of the global burden of disease and schizophrenia, although relatively rare, is highly heritable (80%) and one of the most severe mental disorders. This project aims to elucidate the influence of genetic factors and gene function on dimensional schizophrenia and schizotypy symptoms with multiple measures, across multiple samples of varying genetic risk.

"Gene-Environment Interactions in Glaucoma Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is the leading cause of chronic optic neuropathy and a major source of ocular morbidity worldwide. Understanding preclinical events, early phase disease and disease heterogeneity represent key objectives in early disease detection, prevention and treatment of POAG. In this study, we propose 4 specific aims. 1) We will perform both targeted and untargeted metabolome-wide association studies (MWAS) for POAG using pre-clinical serum from a large case-control group (500 cases and 500 controls) nested within ongoing prospective studies of the Nurses' Health Study (NHS), NHS2, and Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS) to advance our understanding of the biochemical events that precede POAG diagnosis (blood was collected ~ 10 years prior to disease diagnosis). Prior studies suggest that nitric oxide metabolites represent genetically informed markers and will form the basis for targeted profiling. 2) While considerable discoveries have been made of POAG genes, more work is needed to leverage genome-wide information to inform POAG etiology. Thus, we will create a genome-wide genetic correlation matrix between POAG and complex traits previously linked to POAG, using data from the NEIGHBORHOOD (National Eye Institute Glaucoma Human Genetics Collaboration Heritable Overall Operational Database; 3800 POAG cases) consortium and publicly available summary genome-wide association study data. An assessment of the shared heritability between POAG and these traits as well as the relation between the genetic risk scores for these traits and POAG will lead to new etiologic insights. 3) New-onset POAG is clinically heterogeneous with variable visual field (VF) loss patterns that may reflect different etiologies. We will apply archetype analysis, which objectively quantifies a patient's VF loss pattern to 16 existing clinically validated archetypes (ATs), 9 of which are glaucomatous in nature. Each POAG case (n=1250 from NHS, NHS2 and HPFS) and10 matched controls will be assigned 16 weighted coefficients that add up to 1, with each value representing how consistent his / her VF loss pattern is with each glaucomatous AT. We will evaluate the differential relation between established POAG risk factors and the values on the 16 ATs, to identify unique risk factors for homogeneous incident POAG subtypes. 4) A carbohydrate-restricted diet may meet the energy requirement in the non-myelinated retinal ganglion cell axon segment of the optic nerve and reduce risk of POAG. We will conduct a prospective evaluation of this exposure in relation to POAG and POAG subtypes in the 3 cohorts (n=2100 cases). By integrating MWAS, genomics with prospective environmental exposure data and AT analysis, this proposal addresses a number of important knowledge gaps—in particular, it will shed light on how genetic and pre-diagnostic risk factors influence POAG and POAG heterogeneity. Linking specific exposures with POAG subtypes will provide important mechanistic understanding as well as evidence of causality, which will contribute to discovering precision medicine approaches for this condition. Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is an intraocular pressure-related chronic optic nerve disease that produces characteristic visual loss patterns. In this proposal we will study a host of genes, plasma metabolites and environmental factors in relation to POAG overall as well as it's objectively determined subtypes based on visual loss pattern. Understanding how these various exposures relate to POAG and it's subtypes will highlight disease prevention strategies and precision medical treatment options for this potentially blinding disease that requires lifetime management.",Gene-Environment Interactions in Glaucoma,9788096,R01EY015473,"['Acetyl Coenzyme A', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Archives', 'Arginine', 'Axon', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biogenesis', 'Blindness', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Carbohydrates', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Citrulline', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Family', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genomics', 'Glaucoma', 'Health Professional', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human Genetics', 'Impairment', 'Knowledge', 'Life Style', 'Light', 'Link', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Metabolism', 'Mitochondria', 'Modification', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Eye Institute', 'Nature', 'Neighborhoods', 'Nested Case-Control Study', 'Nitric Oxide', 'Nitric Oxide Pathway', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Nurses&apos', ' Health Study', 'Optic Nerve', 'Ornithine', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral', 'Phase', 'Physiologic Intraocular Pressure', 'Plasma', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive', 'Primary Open Angle Glaucoma', 'Prospective Studies', 'Prospective cohort', 'Recording of previous events', 'Retinal Ganglion Cells', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Thinness', 'Visual', 'Visual Fields', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'beta-Hydroxybutyrate', 'case control', 'cohort', 'common treatment', 'dietary restriction', 'disability', 'disease diagnosis', 'disease heterogeneity', 'disorder prevention', 'follow-up', 'gene environment interaction', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'insight', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'mitochondrial dysfunction', 'novel', 'optic nerve disorder', 'pre-clinical', 'precision medicine', 'prospective', 'secondary analysis', 'targeted treatment', 'time interval', 'trait']",NEI,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2019,528837,0.0007110439357201051
"Tinnitus: Audiological measures and genetic susceptibility PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Tinnitus, the phantom perception of sound in absence of an external sound source, is a prevalent hearing disorder. To date, the exact neural and molecular mechanisms underlying tinnitus are not known. Tinnitus is associated with a number of otological diseases and clinical conditions; however, almost 50% of tinnitus cases are not attributable to any known cause (Stouffer & Tyler, 1990). There is likely a genetic component to tinnitus (Sand et al, 2007). A critical gap in the knowledge base is how to clinically identify those who are genetically predisposed to tinnitus well before they acquire this hearing health issue. The short-term goal of this R21 Early Career Research PAR 16-057 application, entitled “Tinnitus: Audiological measures and genetic susceptibility,” is to identify detailed phenotypic and genotypic profiles of chronic tinnitus in young adults. The application is proposed by a team of researchers: The PI is Ishan Bhatt, Ph.D. in audiology (CCC-A, FAAA), who is working with Co-PI’s Jason Wilder, Ph.D. in genetics, Jin Wang, Ph.D. in statistics, and Raquel Dias, Ph.D. in Bioinformatics. This project will fill the gap in knowledge by identifying the critical variables associated with a genetic predisposition to CT. This investigation will include college-aged young participants to control for age- related confounding variables such as systemic diseases and hearing loss. According to the PI’s pilot study (Bhatt, 2017a), the estimated prevalence of chronic tinnitus (CT), acute tinnitus (AT) and no tinnitus (NT) is around 8%, 13% and 79%, respectively. To accomplish our short-term goal, we will conduct a case-control- control exonic genome-wide association study (GWAS) (N = 300) in which subjects will be divided into three groups: those with (1) CT (tinnitus for > 1 year; n=100), (2) AT (tinnitus for ≤ 1 year, presumably due to acute environmental exposure; n=100); and (3) NT (no experience of tinnitus in a lifetime; n=100). The Specific Aims are: (1) to identify associations between exonic Single Nucleotide Polymorhisms (SNPs) and tinnitus phenotype. Based on the criteria laid out in the preliminary studies (Bhatt, 2017a; Bhatt et al., 2016; Phillip et al., 2015), our working hypothesis is that causal SNPs will exhibit a higher frequency of a specific genotype for subjects with CT compared to subjects with AT and NT. (2) To identify association between selected SNPs in a candidate set of genes and audiologic measures among subjects with CT, AT and NT, Based on our preliminary studies (Bhatt et al., 2016, Phillips et al., 2015), our working hypothesis is that subjects with causal alleles for CT will exhibit pathophysiological variation in the audiometric measures. Significance: Successful completion of this project will enable us to identify phenotypic and genotypic profiles of CT. This will help us to achieve our long term goal, which is to develop a genetic Risk Profile that can be used by health-care providers, and educators (e.g., health professionals, music and industrial arts teachers) to identify individuals genetically at risk for CT. Project Narrative Tinnitus, the phantom perception of sound in absence of an external sound source, is a prevalent hearing disorder. The short-term goal of this study is to identify detailed phenotypic and genotypic profiles of chronic tinnitus in college-aged young adults. The relevance of the project to public health is reflected in the long-term goal, which is to construct a genetic risk profile which can be used by health-care providers and educators to identify individuals genetically at risk for chronic tinnitus.",Tinnitus: Audiological measures and genetic susceptibility,9655203,R21DC016704,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Age', 'Aging', 'American', 'Anxiety', 'Audiology', 'Auditory Evoked Potentials', 'Auditory Perception', 'Bioinformatics', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Education', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Family', 'Financial compensation', 'Frequencies', 'General Population', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genetic study', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Policy', 'Health Professional', 'Hearing', 'Hearing problem', 'Human', 'Hyperacusis', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Industrial Arts', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Military Personnel', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Music', 'Noise', 'Nucleotides', 'Otitis Media', 'PTGS1 gene', 'PTGS2 gene', 'Participant', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Pilot Projects', 'Policy Maker', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthase', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Serotonin', 'Silicon Dioxide', 'Sleeplessness', 'Smoking', 'Sodium', 'Source', 'Systemic disease', 'Testing', 'Tinnitus', 'Variant', 'Veterans', 'age related', 'aged', 'aging population', 'base', 'career', 'case control', 'causal variant', 'clinical development', 'college', 'experience', 'gene environment interaction', 'genetic association', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'hearing impairment', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'insight', 'knowledge base', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'otoacoustic emission', 'relating to nervous system', 'serotonin receptor', 'serotonin transporter', 'sound', 'statistics', 'teacher', 'trait', 'treatment strategy', 'voltage gated channel', 'young adult']",NIDCD,NORTHERN ARIZONA UNIVERSITY,R21,2019,151994,4.6045949748529676e-05
"Statistical Genetics and Genomics for Epidemiologic Research Project Summary/Abstract Genome-wide association studies have identified an unprecedented number of genetic variants associated with disease risk, yet molecular mechanisms and clinical implications of genetic risk alleles are largely unknown. Epidemiologic research is extending its reach to more translational and mechanistic studies, integrating genetic risk variants with environmental exposures, interventions, gene expression and epigenetics. Motivated by population-based studies for prostate cancer research, we will develop statistical methods for emerging translational topics: how to search for genotypes that predict individual and subgroup intervention effects? how to identify epigenetic alterations that may be an interface of the environment and the genome? how to assess causal mediation effect of a modifiable risk factor or a molecular alteration in relation to disease outcomes? These topics present unmet statistical challenges because of high dimensionality and complex modeling. Specific statistical methods to be developed include high-dimensional gene- treatment interaction, multi-locus regional association, mediation analyses, instrumental variable analyses, Mendelian randomization, and shrinkage and regularization.  The methodological research in this project is driven primarily by prostate cancer, the most common noncutaneous cancer and the second leading cause of cancer death in American men, a ecting one in six in his lifetime. This project nests in highly-accomplished consortium studies (PCPT/SELECT/PRACTICAL/PCPS), all of which have generated far-reaching impact on prostate cancer research. The unique feature of this project is that methodological development will be seamlessly integrated with ongoing analyses, ensuring immediate translation. Our transdisciplinary research team has been actively engaged in statistical genetics and genomics, and conducting molecular epidemiological studies. The PI brings a wealth of expertise in high-dimensional methods, molecular biomarkers, and genetic epidemiology. This project will have a far-reaching impact on methodologies in cancer etiology, prevention, and treatment outcomes. Project Narrative In this project we will develop a suite of statistical methodologies for dissecting the multi-faceted role of genetics and genomics in modern epidemiology, and perform innovative analyses in well-characterized extant populations for prostate cancer research.

"Pharmacogenomics of Statin Therapy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall objective of the Center ""Pharmacogenomics of Statin Therapy"" (POST) is to apply genomic, transcriptomic, and metabolomic analyses, together with studies in cellular and animal models, and innovative informatic tools, to identify and validate biomarkers for efficacy of statin drugs in reducing riskof cardiovascular disease (CVD), and for adverse effects of statins, specifically myopathy and type 2 diabetes. This multidisciplinary approach is enabled by a team of investigators with expertise in genomics (human, mouse, and molecular), statistics and informatics, and clinical medicine and pharmacology. The Center is comprised of three Projects, two Research Cores, and an Administrative Core. A major aim of Project 1 is the identification of cellular transcriptomic and metabolomic markers for clinical efficacy and adverse effects of statins. This will be accomplished by analyses in statin-exposed lymphoblast cell lines derived from patients with major adverse coronary events, or onset of myopathy or type 2 diabetes on statin treatment, compared with unaffected statin- treated controls. In addition, using genome wide genotypes from these patients, DNA variants will be identified that are associated with statin-induced changes in the transcripts and metabolites that most strongly discriminate affected patients and controls. Project 2 will use a unique, well-characterized panel of 100 inbred mouse strains to discover genetic variation associated with statin-induced myopathy and dysglycemia. Mechanisms underlying these effects will be investigated, with emphasis on the role of dysregulation of autophagy by statin treatment. Projects 1 and 2 will also use relevant cellular and mouse models, respectively, to perform functional studies to validate effects of genes identified in all POST projects as strong candidates for modulating statin efficacy or adverse effects. In Project 3, information derived from genome-wide genotypes, electronic health records, and pharmacy data in a very large and diverse population-based patient cohort will be leveraged to identify and replicate genetic associations with statin efficacy (lipid lowering and CVD event reduction) and adverse effects (myopathy and type 2 diabetes), as well as to assess the overall heritability of these responses. The Clinical Core, based in Kaiser Permanente of Northern California, will provide the clinical information and biologic materials for both Projects1 and 3. Investigators in the Informatics Core will optimize data analysis and integration of results across all projects. The Administrative Core will provide scientific leadership and management of the Center, and foster scientific interactions and training opportunities. Overall, the research program of this Center provides an innovative model for a ""systems"" approach to pharmacogenomics that incorporates complementary investigative tools to discover and validate genetically influenced determinants of drug response. Moreover, the findings have the potential for guiding more effective use of statins for reducing CVD risk and minimizing adverse effects, and identifying biomarkers of pathways that modulate the multiple actions of this widely used class of drugs.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Coronary heart disease and stroke are the leading causes of death and disability in the United States, and statins are the most widely prescribed class of drugs to prevent these conditions. There is however, considerable interindividual variation in efficacy of statins for reducing disease risk, as well as in susceptibility to the most common adverse statin effects, myopathy and type 2 diabetes. The goal of the Center ""Pharmacogenomics of Statin Therapy"" (POST) is to apply complementary investigative approaches and multidisciplinary expertise for discovering and validating the genetic and metabolic factors responsible for this variability. This information has the potential for optimizig use of statins in clinical practice, and for identifying new pathways that underlie the diverse biologic actions of this drug class.              ",Pharmacogenomics of Statin Therapy,9772486,P50GM115318,"['Adverse effects', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Autophagocytosis', 'Biocompatible Materials', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'California', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Line', 'Cell model', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Markers', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Pharmacology', 'Collaborations', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease Outcome', 'Drug effect disorder', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Ethnic group', 'Event', 'Fostering', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Hybrids', 'Hyperglycemia', 'In Vitro', 'Inbred Strains Mice', 'Informatics', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Metabolic', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Muscle function', 'Myopathy', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Predisposition', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Recombinants', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Residual state', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Simvastatin', 'Stroke', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Transcript', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Visualization software', 'adverse outcome', 'alternative treatment', 'base', 'biological systems', 'biomarker identification', 'blood glucose regulation', 'candidate validation', 'cardiovascular disorder prevention', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'clinical efficacy', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'coronary event', 'data integration', 'data visualization', 'design', 'disability', 'disorder risk', 'exome', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic association', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genotyped patients', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'informatics\xa0tool', 'innovation', 'inter-individual variation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'lymphoblast', 'lymphoblastoid cell line', 'metabolomics', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'novel strategies', 'population based', 'predictive marker', 'prevent', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'risk minimization', 'side effect', 'statistics', 'tool', 'training opportunity', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment strategy']",NIGMS,CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL & RES CTR AT OAKLAND,P50,2019,1524688,0.009096673486966115
"Identifying Genetic Drivers of Expression Networks Causing Insulin Resistance Reduced insulin sensitivity or insulin resistance (IR) is a forerunner of Type 2 diabetes (T2D). Differences in the prevalence of IR among ethnic groups suggest its genetic etiology. However, recent studies implementing genetic association approaches were only nominally successful in defining the genetically-regulated molecular and cellular mechanisms of IR. Our physiologic and genomic studies suggest that (a) IR results from derangement in expression of thousands of genes in tissues involved in glucose homeostasis, and (b) genetic variants, such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), determine the expression level of a subset of IR-associated genes. Thus, transcript levels are key molecular phenotypes associated with IR and are proximal to the action of genetic variants. A subset of genetically-regulated transcript subnetworks that operate within the large highly interconnected global expression networks in disease-relevant tissues can cause IR, but remain poorly understood. We hypothesize that, regulatory SNPs in expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) determine transcript levels of key driver genes, configure the expression subnetworks in adipose and muscle tissue, and are causal determinants for IR. The genetic architecture of eQTLs determines the heterogeneity in causal mechanisms of IR. Our preliminary data support the concept of causal genetic regulators of subnetworks in modulating insulin sensitivity. Challenging the current paradigms, our Aim 1 is to implement our cutting-edge Multiscale Network Modelling Approach to integrate measures of glucose homeostasis (SI and Matsuda index from FSIVGT and OGTT, respectively); adipose and muscle tissue transcript profiles; eSNP data from African American participants in the AAGMEx cohort (N=260); and genetic and epigenetic regulation data from knowledge bases to discover subnetworks and genetic drivers that are causally linked to IR. In Aim 2, we will validate insulin sensitivity-associated genetically-regulated subnetworks, and determine common and ethnically-predominant genetic regulatory mechanisms of IR, using multi-omics data from similarly phenotyped European ancestry individuals from the METSIM (N=770) and AREA (N=99) cohorts. These results will be compared with those from the AAGMEx cohort. Key driver genes of insulin sensitivity-associated genetically regulated adipose and muscle tissue subnetworks from Aims 1-2 will then be prioritized based on statistical ranking to validate their regulatory roles. In Aim 3, we will focus on understanding molecular and cellular mechanisms modulated by 10 selected putative key regulatory genes. Using in vitro genetic perturbation experiments in relevant human cell models we have already established, we will modulate the expression of these genes, identify target pathways, and examine IR-determining cellular mechanisms (e.g. metabolism, signal transduction, differentiation, inflammation, cell-cell interaction) regulated by these genes. Our study will be among the first to define the genetic regulatory networks of IR, a key step towards development of novel therapeutic options for prevention of IR and subsequent T2D. Deciphering the underlying molecular defects and genetic regulatory mechanisms of insulin sensitivity is an unmet need to develop novel and safe therapeutic options to prevent insulin resistance and progression to type 2 diabetes and other diseases of major public health importance. Building on our success in recruiting cohorts of metabolically well-characterized and molecularly profiled non-diabetic African and European Ancestry individuals, and creating a data resource that is suitably powered to conduct integrative multi-omics analysis, we will implement a novel computational approach to discover fat and muscle tissue gene regulatory networks and driver genes that are causally linked to insulin resistance. Leveraging expertise of our multidisciplinary research team in cell and molecular biological studies this project will define mechanistic roles for the computationally predicted key regulatory genes in determining insulin resistance and thus help inform new strategies to treat and even prevent the rapidly growing public-health challenge of type 2 diabetes, particularly among African Americans.",Identifying Genetic Drivers of Expression Networks Causing Insulin Resistance,9728964,R01DK118243,"['Adipose tissue', 'African', 'African American', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell model', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Down-Regulation', 'Dyslipidemias', 'Ethnic group', 'European', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Glucose', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Multiomic Data', 'Muscle', 'Network-based', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'OGTT', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Regulator Genes', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Transcript', 'base', 'blood glucose regulation', 'causal model', 'causal variant', 'cohort', 'data resource', 'density', 'epigenetic regulation', 'experimental study', 'genetic architecture', 'genetic association', 'genetic variant', 'genome-wide', 'indexing', 'insulin sensitivity', 'knowledge base', 'metabolic phenotype', 'molecular phenotype', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple omics', 'network models', 'non-diabetic', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'overexpression', 'preservation', 'prevent', 'promoter', 'random forest', 'reconstruction', 'recruit', 'small hairpin RNA', 'success', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NIDDK,WAKE FOREST UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2019,347047,-0.03736204572992073
"Epi25 Clinical Phenotyping R03 PROJECT SUMMARY Clinical genetic data suggests that specific categories of epilepsy have genetic contributors, and there may be some overlap between categories. The Epi25 Collaborative was formed among more than 40 cohorts from around the world to sequence as many as 25,000 genomes or exomes. As of 2017, the collaborative has sequenced more than 13,000 exomes and clinical data has been collected for more than 8,000 cases. This project will complete the collection and review of the clinical data for each sample in the Epi25 collection to facilitate the translation of genomic and clinical discoveries into improved care for patients. The clinical and genomic data from Epi25 will be a global resource, shared with the research community for years to come. Epi25's governance structure, membership, and other information are available online at www.epi-25.org. In this project, clinical data is entered by contributors into Red Cap forms or uploaded directly into the Epi25 database. The clinical data is then checked by a computer algorithm that looks for key eligibility criteria for each participant. Errors and missing data are sent to the Phenotyping Coordinator to review and resolve, with the help of the contributing site. PROJECT NARRATIVE In 2014, collaborators from around the world created the Epi25 Collaborative to exome sequence as many as 25,000 patients with epilepsy. The collaborative has more than 6,200 exomes generated in year 2016, an additional 7,500 on sequencers in 2017, and more than 1,000 ready for sequencing in 2018.

"Genetic Modulators of Glaucoma Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness in the world. While elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) is a major risk factor, damage and death of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) underlies visual field loss. However, a thorough understanding of this disease is a major challenge because its genetic basis is heterogeneous and it represents a family of age-related disorders resulting from intersecting gene-regulated pathophysiologic networks. We propose to continue to use the BXD (C57BL/6 x DBA/2J) family of recombinant inbred (RI) lines of mice as a genetic reference panel (GRP) and to combine our work with human genome wide association studies (GWAS), to uncover and clarify the genetic heterogeneity that underlies optic nerve (ON) damage. We have had recent success using this combined approach in the regulation of intraocular pressure (IOP). We are very well positioned to take the next step and apply this approach to define cellular targets of RGC damage and death. We propose to uncover phenotypic diversities of glaucoma-related ON damage and uncover common underlying mechanisms that are shared with IOP modulation. Our long-term research goal is to identify disease mechanisms and develop neuroprotective therapies to preserve retinal health in patients at risk for glaucoma. Our overall objective is to identify novel gene products and related mechanisms that lead to glaucomatous endophenotypes using multi-dimensional genetic analyses, cross-species comparisons (mouse, rat and human) and validation using novel murine glaucoma models. Our central hypothesis is that molecular processes leading to glaucoma associated-endophenotypes, such as elevated IOP and ON damage, are shared across species, and that species comparisons can uncover common underlying mechanisms, and efficient testing of targeted glaucoma therapeutics. In the current investigation, we perform a systematic analysis of ON damage, and an additional species—rat. We will mine the extensive databases of IOP and ON damage that we are generating for more than 70 BXD strains across five age cohorts with the goal of defining new models of glaucoma. An overall strength of this proposal is the combination of cutting-edge systems genetics methods, species comparisons of glaucoma phenotypes, and a strong interdisciplinary team that includes investigators with extensive experience in systems genetics, glaucoma, GWAS in human and rats, and advanced computational methods. To test our hypothesis, we will perform the following thress studies: 1) Identify the candidate gene on chromosome 12 that modulates ON damage; 2) Determine if modulation of IOP and/or ON damage is shared across rodent species; and 3) Identify novel spontaneous glaucoma models through a comprehensive analysis of our enlarged BXD GRP of 100 or more BXD strains. The outcomes of these studies will define novel genes and molecular networks that underlie glaucoma-associated phenotypes and also provide unique glaucoma models for future analysis. These results are expected to fundamentally advance the field of glaucoma disease mechanisms and enable targeted therapeutic development. Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness in the world and a thorough understanding of this disease is a major challenge because its genetic basis is heterogeneous, and it likely represents a family of disorders resulting from intersecting gene-regulated pathophysiologic pathways. Our goals are to: identify candidate gene(s) that modulate optic nerve damage; determine if regulation of intraocular pressure and/or optic nerve damage are shared across species; and identify novel spontaneous glaucoma models.

"Identify, Analyze, and Evaluate Potential Risk Factors for Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) - 2018 ABSTRACT ALS is a devastating and fatal neurodegenerative disease for which there is no cure or effective treatment. The causes of ALS likely involve interaction of environmental and genetic susceptibility factors. Exposure to the damaging environmental stressors likely occurs at particularly susceptible time-periods, and for a prolonged period. We will investigate the époques during which environmental exposures carry the greatest risk for later development of ALS. We will use questionnaire data, residential history, and DNA samples from our on-going epidemiologic studies in Northern New England and Ohio, the existing environmental and genetic variant data from the National ALS Registry for ALS patients nationwide, and both clinic- and random population-based controls. We will use geospatial algorithms to estimate residential exposures in years extending backwards for ~30 years derived from our databases of time-linked contents of sources of environmental toxins (cyanobacteria) and toxicants (landfills, municipal incinerators, Superfund and Brownfield sites, pesticide applications). We also propose to identify genetic risk factors for ALS that manifest effects specifically in the presence of an environmental stressor. We will use the existing Illumina NeuroChip data covering 500,000 genetic variants implicated in neurodegenerative illness on the National ALS Biorepository participants, and propose to assay our epidemiologic study DNA samples on the same panel to construct a large, pooled genotype dataset. Genetic imputation will allow genome-wide coverage for identification of novel variants. We will employ the machine- learning methods to identify gene x environment interactions, the genetic variants that synergize with environmental stressors to increase disease risk. This project has the potential to identify the environmental and genetic risk factors in periods of temporal susceptibility that will lead to disease prevention through exposure mitigation, early-identification, and development of interventions to block disease progression. PROJECT NARRATIVE/RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH The prevention and cure of ALS require identification of susceptibility genes and the most important environmental risk factors, their most sensitive period of exposure, and the implementation of steps to mitigate these exposures. We propose to use residential history to estimate exposures to waterbody cyanobacteria, pesticides, and polluted sites in ALS patients compared to healthy controls using time-linked databases. We expect these studies to reveal genetic variants that raise ALS susceptibility, and determine the periods of life that carry the greatest risk for developing ALS from exposures to environmental stressors.","Identify, Analyze, and Evaluate Potential Risk Factors for Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) - 2018",9918209,R01TS000288,[' '],ATSDR,DARTMOUTH-HITCHCOCK CLINIC,R01,2019,500000,0.025711471795514904
"Joint patterns of multi-genetic/epigenetic factors via non-parametric clustering and their association with allergic disease Ray PA-16-162 Project Summary Eczema is a chronic skin inflammatory disease infecting 10-30% of children and 2-10% of adults and increasing. Researchers have struggled to understand the genetic and environmental factors that appear to play a role in eczema's increasing prevalence. The majority of current studies focus on one or two specific types of Genome-wide data in association with eczema such as SNPS, DNA methylation levels, or gene expression levels. Current statistical methods have forced this limitation as none exist, to our knowledge that allow clustering of subjects across multi-dimensional and multi-faceted variables. Therefore, in this project we aim to introduce a novel clustering approach that will cluster subjects across genes which contain SNP information, DNA methylation levels, and gene expression levels. Summarized clusters will then tested for associated risk of eczema or any allergic disease. Genetic patterns associated with eczema will then be further explored to better identify the behavior genetic data and it's uniqueness. The method will be built in R Gui as a free downloadable package making it accessible and easy to use. We will apply the proposed method to the third generation Isle of Wight cohort data. The third generation cohort data consist of children born (2010-current time) from the original cohort of children born between 1989 and 1990 on the Isle of Wight in the UK and contains Genome-wide datasets, disease and exposure status, and allergy information across multiple follow-ups. The implications of this study not only impact the statistical field with a new clustering approach but the eczema and allergy field as well as no other studies have been able to analyze three Genome-wide datasets in concert associated with the risk of allergic diseases. Ray PA-16-162 Project Narrative The prevalence of eczema is increasing world-wide and infecting between 10-30% of children. The complete underlying cause of eczema is unknown but thought to be mixture of genetic and environmental factors. This project aims to incorporate genetic and epigenetic data in concert using a novel statistical approach in hopes of identifying patterns associated with eczema risk, allowing researchers to better understand the biological mechanisms.",Joint patterns of multi-genetic/epigenetic factors via non-parametric clustering and their association with allergic disease,9629655,R03AI128227,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Allergic Disease', 'Behavioral Genetics', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Birth', 'Blood specimen', 'Categories', 'Child', 'Chronic', 'Complex', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Eczema', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Health', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Location', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Prevalence', 'Public Health', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Skin', 'Statistical Methods', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Umbilical Cord Blood', 'Work', 'base', 'chronic inflammatory skin', 'cohort', 'flexibility', 'genetic variant', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'infancy', 'multidimensional data', 'novel', 'screening', 'unsupervised learning', 'user-friendly', 'vector']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF MEMPHIS,R03,2019,69485,-0.04710510467245417
"Enhancing molecular diagnosis in children with multiple congenital anomalies using clinically focused splicing prediction algorithms The training included in this career development award promotes the applicant's development as a physician-scientist during his the PhD phase of his MD/PhD training in transdisciplinary computational genomics. The applicant has previously completed a Master's Degree in Mathematics, and has had extensive instruction in general computational biology. This unique melding of high-level computational expertise and interest in applied genomics has led to the development of this innovative project. He is now being co-mentored by Drs. Barash and Bhoj to gain complementary practical training in predictive algorithm development and molecular genetics. In both his clinical and research interests he is dedicated to improving the rate of molecular diagnosis for children with rare Mendelian disorders. His short-term goals include developing and refining his skills in RNA splicing prediction and human genetic variation analysis in exome and genome data. In addition, he will gain new insight into experimental design, data interpretation, and scientific communication skills to ensure his successful post-doctoral transition. His co-mentors for the proposal are Drs. Yoseph Barash and Elizabeth Bhoj, international leaders in computational genomics and molecular genetics. In addition he will be supported by outstanding resources of the MSTP at Penn, which has an extensive proven track record of successful previous awardees.  The applicant has been pursuing work in creating an improved computational pipeline for the analysis of variants from exome and genome data. Specifically he is capturing the intronic and synonymous variants that are generally removed from the analysis pipeline because of the difficulty in determining the pathogenicity of such variants. As there are many intronic and synonymous variants that are known to cause Mendelain disorders, this clearly leads to missed diagnoses. In Aim 1 he will generate an interpretable algorithm for prioritizing general splicing variants that guides functional validation. In Aim 2 he will identify novel variants and genes for mechanistic evaluation in the pathogenesis of congenital anomalies. This algorithm will be generally applicable, significantly enhancing our ability to provide molecular diagnoses for all patients with suspected Mendelian disorders. In addition, this proposal will allow the candidate to gain experience, knowledge, and new skills to successfully lay the foundation as a physician-scientist in computational genomics. Many children who are born with multiple medical issues have a genetic cause for their differences, but even the best tests cannot identify the genetic cause. This project will develop new computer technology to do a more complete analysis of their genetic testing information to help diagnose more of these children.",Enhancing molecular diagnosis in children with multiple congenital anomalies using clinically focused splicing prediction algorithms,9760051,F30HD098803,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Benchmarking', 'Cells', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Computational Biology', 'Computational Molecular Biology', 'Computers', 'Critical Thinking', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Exhibits', 'Exons', 'Experimental Designs', 'Foundations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype-Tissue Expression Project', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Instruction', 'International', 'Introns', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Libraries', 'Manuals', 'Master&apos', 's Degree', 'Mathematics', 'Medical', 'Mendelian disorder', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Messenger RNA', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Diagnosis', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Protein Isoforms', 'RNA Splicing', 'Regulation', 'Resources', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Syndrome', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analysis pipeline', 'career', 'causal variant', 'clinical application', 'cohort', 'congenital anomaly', 'deep learning', 'exome', 'exome sequencing', 'experience', 'genetic variant', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'novel', 'prediction algorithm', 'reference genome', 'skills', 'standard of care', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,F30,2019,50016,0.0011759256031527148
"Center for Genetic Studies of Drug Abuse in Outbred Rats Project Summary (Overall)  The purpose of this renewal application is to continue the successful activities of our center, which uses quantitative genetic techniques to study the genetic basis of drug abuse-related behaviors in outbred rats. When our center was initially funded in June 2014, our goal was to develop outbred N/NIH heterogeneous stock (HS) rats as a platform for genetic studies of behaviors that were difficult or impossible to study in mice. The first four years of funding have allowed us to establish a vibrant community of investigators using HS rats to study drug abuse and other traits, which we refer to as an ecosystem. This ecosystem includes both the investigators who are directly involved in this renewal application and many others who have obtained separate funding, some from NIDA, and some from other sources. The growth of this ecosystem reflects one of the ways that our center has served as national resource. We are proposing three projects that involved phenotyping HS rats for a variety of traits, including intravenous cocaine and nicotine self-administration, response to novelty, social behavior, reaction time, and delay discounting. Two of those projects are continuations from the prior funding period and are designed to increase our sample size from 1,600 to 3,200 rats per phenotype. We present data showing that such an increase produces an exponential increase in the number of significant findings. This approach parallels human genetics studies of SUD, which have also benefited tremendously from larger sample sizes. We will use these data to conduct genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and a suite of related techniques. In addition, we will measure gene expression in behaviorally naïve rats using RNASeq and use those data to identify expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs). We will then integrate GWAS and eQTL data in an effort to identify specific genes that influence the behavioral phenotypes. Many of the behavioral domains being studied are known to be sexually dimorphic; our study will use both male and female rats, which will allow us to identify sex differences and sex by genotype interactions. We will also study genetic correlations, perform phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS), transcriptome wide association studies (TWAS) and explore a novel strategy called polygenic transcriptomic risk scores (PTRS), that is intended to allow translation of polygenic signals across species. Project 4 will use a network-based approach to extend our GWAS to account for known biological networks. This proposed renewal also includes a pilot project core to support new directions and take advantage of unforeseen opportunities. Finally we propose an administrative core that supports many activities of the center, including educational, career development and public outreach. The results of these studies will enhance our understanding of the role of genes in a range of psychologically complex behaviors and will provide novel biological insights that may support future efforts at preventing or treating drug abuse. Project Narrative (Overall)  Using powerful genetic, molecular and statistical techniques, we will study the genetic basis of traits that have well-established relevance to drug abuse. We expect that these studies will enhance our understanding of drug abuse and lead to the identification of specific genes and pathways. These discoveries will improve our understanding of genetic susceptibility to drug abuse in humans and may identify new opportunities to treat psychiatric disorders including but not limited to addiction.",Center for Genetic Studies of Drug Abuse in Outbred Rats,9793600,P50DA037844,"['Adolescent', 'Animal Model', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Brain region', 'Breeding', 'Cancer Grant Supplements (P30)', 'Cessation of life', 'Cocaine', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Crime', 'Cues', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Drug abuse', 'Ecosystem', 'Education', 'Esthesia', 'Female', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Recombination', 'Genetic Techniques', 'Genetic study', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Healthcare', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Human Genome', 'Impulsivity', 'Inbred Strains Rats', 'Individual', 'Intravenous', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Network-based', 'Nicotine', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Productivity', 'Quantitative Genetics', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Rattus', 'Reaction Time', 'Regulation', 'Relapse', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Self Administration', 'Sex Differences', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Reinforcement', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Translations', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'addiction', 'behavior influence', 'behavioral study', 'career development', 'cocaine use', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'design', 'discount', 'discounting', 'drug abuse related behavior', 'effective therapy', 'genetic analysis', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'insight', 'male', 'nicotine use', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'outreach', 'phenome', 'phenotypic data', 'premature', 'preservation', 'prevent', 'psychologic', 'response', 'sex', 'sexual dimorphism', 'success', 'sustained attention', 'tool', 'trait', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'virtual', 'web site']",NIDA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",P50,2019,2949105,-0.042316647242394055
"Understanding modifiers of mendelian mutation penetrance using familial hypercholesterolemia as a model PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Rare monogenic forms of common diseases have provided key fundamental insights about common disease. However, genetic, environmental, and stochastic elements influence risk for disease. Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), an autosomal dominant disorder afflicting 1 in 250 linked to severe increases in LDL cholesterol and premature coronary heart disease (CHD) risk, is an ideal model to characterize modifiers of disease. Despite the presence of a strong genetic driver of hypercholesterolemia from FH mutations, we recently observed that half do not have the expected severe hypercholesterolemia. In this proposal, we outline several methods to discover and dissect the genetic and non-genetic factors influencing CHD risk conferred by FH mutations in humans and determine whether knowledge of these factors can improve risk discrimination among those with FH mutations. Our approach harnesses several multi-dimensional datasets: whole genome sequences, metabolomics, and cross-sectional and longitudinal cardiovascular phenotypes. In Aim 1, we will aggregate and curate 75,000 deep (30X) whole genome sequences and cardiovascular phenotypes. In Aim 2, we will discover genetic and non-genetic modifiers of LDL cholesterol and CHD risk in FH and evaluate their metabolomic consequences. In Aim 3, we will develop a method incorporating genetics and longitudinal non- genetic exposures for CHD risk stratification among ~4,000 with FH mutations in the Million Veteran Program. In addition to the proposed Aims, this five-year proposal outlines a comprehensive strategy for the principal investigator's (PI's) scientific and professional development in academic cardiovascular medicine. The research strategy builds upon the PI's prior research experience and clinical training. In addition to an undergraduate degree in Molecular Biology and master's degree in Biomedical Informatics, he completed post- graduate medical training in Internal Medicine and Cardiovascular Medicine. He recently developed a new preventive/genetic cardiology clinic focusing on the evaluation and management of those with or a family history of premature CHD, including those with FH, at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH). This proposal now focuses on expanding his scientific skills in human genetics and genomics into new domains: integrative genomics, statistical genetics, clinical informatics, and risk modeling. The career development goals will be at achieved through a multi-faceted approach involving mentorship, collaboration, didactic coursework, conferences, and scientific investigation. This work will take place in a unique training environment comprised of MGH and the Broad Institute. Successful completion of this career development award will result in improved fundamental understanding of the determinants of CHD, result in the PI's transition to an independent physician-scientist, and provide a solid foundation from which he will apply for R01-level funding. PROJECT NARRATIVE / PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Cardiovascular disease, largely due to coronary heart disease (CHD), remains the leading cause of death in the United States and now worldwide despite current advances. Familial hypercholesterolemia is a relative common genetic disorder characterized by severe hypercholesterolemia and premature CHD but many carrying these mutations do not develop these consequences. This proposal seeks to define and characterize the factors modifying CHD risk among those with FH mutations; success has the potential to broadly identify new mechanisms of CHD and novel strategies for prevention.",Understanding modifiers of mendelian mutation penetrance using familial hypercholesterolemia as a model,9609507,K08HL140203,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'African', 'Amish', 'Bachelor&apos', 's Degree', 'Biochemical', 'Cardiology', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Catalogs', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Cloud Computing', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Simulation', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary heart disease', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Disease Pathway', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Ethnic Origin', 'European', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Familial Hypercholesterolemia', 'Family history of', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Gene Mutation', 'General Hospitals', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Counseling', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Internal Medicine', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'LDL Cholesterol Lipoproteins', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Low-Density Lipoproteins', 'Massachusetts', 'Master&apos', 's Degree', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mendelian disorder', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Biology', 'Mutation', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Network-based', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Penetrance', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive', 'Preventive therapy', 'Principal Investigator', 'Quality Control', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Scientist', 'Solid', 'Statistical Models', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Veterans', 'Work', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomedical informatics', 'career development', 'cloud based', 'cohort', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'genetic analysis', 'genome sequencing', 'genomic variation', 'heart disease risk', 'high risk', 'human disease', 'human genomics', 'hypercholesterolemia', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'lifestyle factors', 'machine learning algorithm', 'metabolomics', 'next generation', 'non-genetic', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'precision medicine', 'premature', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'risk prediction model', 'skills', 'success', 'symposium', 'trait', 'whole genome']",NHLBI,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K08,2019,170003,0.03456191097276575

"Functional characterization of genetic and post-transcriptional variation using machine learning methods The goal of this research proposal is to develop new in-silico approaches for accurate functional annotation of genetic and post-transcriptional variants. The rapid growth of Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) and high- throughput -omics data have brought us one step closer towards mechanistic understanding of the complex genetic disease, such as cancer, neurological disorders, diabetes, and others at the molecular level. In particular, these data revealed that complex diseases commonly manifest changes at the genetic and post- transcriptional levels. Bot of these types of changes often affect structure and function of the corresponding genes and their products. Understanding the functional implications of the genetic and post-transcriptional variation is an important task as it can provide critical insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the disease. Here, we propose to leverage novel machine learning paradigms to design computational methods for predicting the effect of genetic and alternative splicing variants on the macromolecular interactions. Macromolecular interactions underlie many cellular functions in a healthy organism. The disease-induced changes in the genes, such as single nucleotide variations (SNVs) and alternative splicing variations (ASVs) have been recently reported to cause the protein-protein interaction network rewiring. Unfortunately, the experimental high-throughput techniques that characterize the large-scale effects of SNVs or ASVs on PPIs are expensive, time-consuming, and far from being comprehensive. The current in-silico methods either suffer from the limited applicability, or are less accurate when compared with the experimental methods. To overcome these challenges, we will use two recent machine learning paradigms, learning under privileged information (LUPI) and semi-supervised learning. If successful, we expect for the proposed methods to provide the critical advancement in the two main challenges of the current computational approaches, the limited coverage and lower than the experimental accuracy. The methods will be freely available to the community as the stand-alone tools as well as web- servers. The goal of this proposal is to build computational tools that discover the links  between the disease-associated mutations as well as alternatively spliced protein isoforms  and the protein-protein interactions mediated by the disease proteins. The tools use advanced  machine learning methods to find such links in a fast and inexpensive way. These tools  will be useful in elucidating the molecular mechanisms implicated in the complex genetic disorders.",Functional characterization of genetic and post-transcriptional variation using machine learning methods,9601437,R21LM012772,"['Adopted', 'Affect', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Cell physiology', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Annotation', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Homology Modeling', 'Human Genome', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Nucleotides', 'One-Step dentin bonding system', 'Organism', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'RNA', 'RNA Splicing', 'RNA-Protein Interaction', 'Reporting', 'Research Proposals', 'Role', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Work', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'forest', 'gene function', 'gene product', 'genetic variant', 'human interactome', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'nervous system disorder', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'protein protein interaction', 'rapid growth', 'tool', 'transcriptomics']",NLM,WORCESTER POLYTECHNIC INSTITUTE,R21,2018,159669,-0.03486530022474691
"Deep learning methods to predict the function of genetic variants in orofacial clefts Project Summary  Orofacial clefts (OFCs) comprise a significant fraction of human birth defects in all populations (ranging between 1/500 to 1/2500 live births) and represent a major public health challenge. Individuals born with OFCs require surgical, nutritional, dental, speech, medical and behavioral interventions, imposing a substantial economic and personal burden. There has been convincing evidence that non-syndromic OFCs represent human complex disorders with a multifactorial etiology including genetic risk factors, environmental exposures, and their complex interactions. So far, there have been ~10 genome-wide association studies (GWAS) conducted for non-syndromic CL/P (NSCL/P) and >15 genomic loci reported with compelling statistical support, including genes such as IRF6, PAX7, and ABCA4 and the 8q24 locus. In addition, next-generation sequencing (NGS) as well as exome array have been conducted with extra depth of genotyping that enable detection of rare variants associated with OFCs. However, gaps exist in how to interpret these variants and how to identify novel variants from the large volume of data, with high expectations for new methods and new models for “second- analysis” of the genome-wide data. In this proposal, we propose two complementary aims to carry out deep and second-analysis of genome-wide data for OFCs. In Aim 1, we propose a deep learning method to build in silico models that can predict the effect of genetic variants in the context of rich craniofacial epigenomic features. With substantial fine map of sequence patterns, ad hoc motifs will be revealed and variants that disturb these motifs will provide mechanistic insights on OFCs. In Aim 2, we shift our focus to the gene level and propose a network assisted method to discover sensibly combined genes in spatial and temporal points that are critical to orofacial development. We target on all forms of OFCs, with particular interest in NSCL/P. To guarantee the success of this proposal, we form a multi-disciplinary team and local computational infrastructure equipped with GPUs for the implementation of both aims. Our aims are non-overlapping; rather, they are integrated and strongly focused on our fundamental question of interest: how genetic variants function to cause OFCs. The successful completion of our proposal will lead to deep understanding of genetic components in OFCs. Project Narrative Orofacial clefts (OFCs) comprise a significant fraction of human birth defects in all populations and represent a major public health challenge. Substantial progress has been made to identify genes and variants for OFCs through recent genome-wide association studies and next- generation sequencing projects.

"Statistical Modeling of Multiparental and Genetic Reference Populations PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Genetic crosses in model organisms play an essential role in understanding how heritable factors affect medically relevant traits. Such crosses have traditionally tended to be on a small scale with limited power to detect genetic effects, limited ability to localize causal variants, and limited options for replication. In the last decade, however, the emergence of larger-scale interdisciplinary research, cheaper genotyping and parallel advances in human genetics, has spurred the development of more sophisticated and powerful experimental designs. Foremost are those that incorporate two modern genetic design concepts: the multiparental population (MPP), whereby each subject is descended from a small, well-characterized set of genetically diverse inbred strains, with the goal of efﬁciently exploring a wide genetic landscape; and the genetic reference population (GRP), whereby subjects are drawn from a large and genetically diverse set of inbred strains, with the goal that the study population, and thereby the studies themselves, can be inﬁnitely replicated. Their combination, the multiparental genetic refer- ence population (MP-GRP), represents the state-of-the-art in complex trait genetics and has been implemented in a number of model organisms, including plants, ﬂies, and rodents.  The proposed program of research focuses on the development of statistical and computational tools to advance the design and analysis of studies using MPPs, GRPs and MP-GRPs. It centers around addressing three interconnected questions.  1) How to take advantage of biological replicates in a genetically varying population? Directions consid- ered include: more stable methods to detect genetically-induced phenotypic outliers; use of genetically-induced heteroskedasticity to improve statistical power and ﬁnd variance-controlling genes; and more rigorous and ex- pansive characterization of gene-by-treatment effects by using principles from causal inference.  2) How to navigate the complex design space of MP-GRPs and their derived crosses? Directions considered include: use of decision theory applied to Bayesian analysis of pilot data; incorporation of variance heterogeneity to control likely reproducibility.  3) How to approach quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis in MPPs and MP-GRPs? Directions considered in- clude: making haplotype-based association more robust to uncertainty in haplotype state; combining haplotype- based with variant-based mapping; adaptive modeling of QTL complexity; machine learning of the allelic series; familywise error rate control through descent-based permutation.  Progress on these fronts will not only ﬁll signiﬁcant gaps in studies using MPPs, GRPs and MP-GRPs, but will also provide tools and insights that will allow these designs to be used in new and more powerful ways. PROJECT NARRATIVE (RELEVANCE) The proposed research will lead to improvements in the analysis and design of genetic studies on experimental models of human disease. Because the project focuses on statistical methodology applied to experimental model organism populations (including mouse, rats and Drosophila) the scientiﬁc output of the project is expected to be applicable to basic research focusing on any medical condition that can be studied in model organisms.",Statistical Modeling of Multiparental and Genetic Reference Populations,9485688,R35GM127000,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Alleles', 'Animal Model', 'Basic Science', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Biological', 'Complex', 'Complex Genetic Trait', 'Data', 'Decision Theory', 'Development', 'Drosophila genus', 'Experimental Designs', 'Experimental Models', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Crosses', 'Genetic study', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Haplotypes', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human Genetics', 'Inbred Strain', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Mus', 'Output', 'Phenotype', 'Plants', 'Play', 'Population', 'Population Genetics', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Rattus', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Series', 'Statistical Models', 'Uncertainty', 'Variant', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'human disease', 'improved', 'insight', 'programs', 'study population', 'tool', 'trait', 'treatment effect']",NIGMS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R35,2018,336445,0.025127733321948505
"Inferring Molecular Mechanisms of Complex Disease by Integrating Patterns of Epistasis with Functional Genomic Networks The goal of this proposal is to develop computational methods that will identify genes driving epistasis between quantitative trait loci. Genetic association studies in both humans and model organisms have been increasingly able to detect interactions among genetic variants that influence disease risk and pathogenesis. However, identifying which genes are represented by individual variants is a major challenge. Many variants influencing disease are situated between genes, and even those that are in genes may be representing an effect from a neighboring gene. In model organism studies the situation is even more problematic. In breeding experiments, genetic associations with phenotypes typically encompass large regions of DNA with many genes, and experimental follow-up to identify the genes responsible for the association is resource-intensive. To address this problem, we are developing computational tools to prioritize putative gene interactions in interacting genomic regions for biological follow-up. We use machine learning classifiers trained on functional gene-gene interaction networks and combinatorial optimization to identify likely candidate gene-gene interactions responsible for epistatic interactions between genomic regions. Our methods sift through enormous spaces of candidate interactions, retaining only those whose functional interactions identify as plausible for supporting the epistatic interaction. These tools hold promise to dramatically limit the resource-intensity of biological follow up of putative epistasis and to clarify the genetic architecture of complex disease. Genetic studies in humans and model organisms are critical to understanding how genes interact to influence disease. Standard association studies, however, do not identify individual genes, but rather large genetic regions containing many genes, and determining individual genes responsible for phenotypic effects requires resource-intensive biological follow-up experiments. We are developing computational methods to prioritize genes in these regions for biological follow-up, with the ultimate goal of speeding the discovery of novel roles of genes in disease.",Inferring Molecular Mechanisms of Complex Disease by Integrating Patterns of Epistasis with Functional Genomic Networks,9528022,R21LM012615,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease model', 'Animal Model', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bacteria', 'Base Pairing', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Breeding', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Combinatorial Optimization', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Copy Number Polymorphism', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Epistasis', 'Genetic study', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Individual', 'Knock-out', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Lower Organism', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Ontology', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Proteins', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Systemic Scleroderma', 'Testing', 'The Jackson Laboratory', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Training Support', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Yeasts', 'combinatorial', 'computerized tools', 'disorder risk', 'experimental study', 'follow-up', 'functional genomics', 'gene function', 'gene interaction', 'genetic architecture', 'genetic association', 'genetic variant', 'genomic biomarker', 'genomic data', 'high dimensionality', 'human disease', 'human model', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'mouse model', 'mutant', 'novel', 'systemic autoimmune disease', 'tool', 'trait']",NLM,JACKSON LABORATORY,R21,2018,200175,-0.007031874091103249
"Integrating Neuroimaging, Multi-omics, and Clinical Data in Complex Disease ABSTRACT Rapid progress in biomedical informatics has generated massive high-dimensional data sets (“big data”), ranging from clinical information and medical imaging to genomic sequence data. The scale and complexity of these data sets hold great promise, yet present substantial challenges. To fully exploit the potential informativeness of big data, there is an urgent need to find effective ways to integrate diverse data from different levels of informatics technologies. Existing approaches and methods for data integration to date have several important limitations. In this project, we propose novel statistical methods and strategies to integrate neuroimaging, multi-omics, and clinical/behavioral data sets. To increase power for association analysis compared to existing methods, we propose a novel multi-phenotype multi-variant association method that can evaluate the cumulative effect of common and rare variants in genes or regions of interest, incorporate prior biological knowledge on the multiple phenotype structure, identify associated phenotypes among multiple phenotypes, and be computationally efficient for high-dimensional phenotypes. To improve the prediction of clinical outcomes, we propose a novel machine learning strategy that can integrate multimodal neuroimaging and multi-omics data into a mathematical model and can incorporate prior biological knowledge to identify genomic interactions associated with clinical outcomes. The ongoing Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and Indiana Memory and Aging Study (IMAS) projects as a test bed provide a unique opportunity to evaluate/validate the proposed methods. Specific Aims: Aim 1: to develop powerful statistical methods for multivariate tests of associations between multiple phenotypes and a single genetic variant or set of variants (common and rare) in regions of interest, and to develop methods for mediation analysis to integrate neuroimaging, genetic, and clinical data to test for direct and indirect genetic effects mediated through neuroimaging phenotypes on clinical outcomes; Aim 2: to develop a novel multivariate model that combines multi-omics and neuroimaging data using a machine learning strategy to predict individuals with disease or those at high-risk for developing disease, and to develop a novel multivariate model incorporating prior biological knowledge to identify genomic interactions associated with clinical outcomes; Aim 3: to evaluate and validate the proposed methods using real data from the ADNI and IMAS cohorts; and Aim 4: to disseminate and support publicly available user-friendly software that efficiently implements the proposed methods. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH: Alzheimer's disease (AD) as an exemplar is an increasingly common progressive neurodegenerative condition with no validated disease modifying treatment. The proposed multivariate methods are likely to help identify novel diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for AD. Identifying new susceptibility loci/biomarkers for AD has important implications for gaining greater insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying AD. NARRATIVE In this project, we propose novel statistical methods and strategies to integrate high-dimensional neuroimaging, multi-omics, and clinical/behavioral data sets, which aim to increase detection power for association analysis and improve the prediction of clinical outcomes. The development of an advanced integrative analysis platform will provide more comprehensive and integrated approaches to answering complex biological questions. The proposed multivariate analysis methods have a high potential impact on and important implications for gaining greater insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying complex diseases, as well as helping the development of earlier diagnostic tests and novel therapeutic targets.","Integrating Neuroimaging, Multi-omics, and Clinical Data in Complex Disease",9515964,R01LM012535,"['Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Beds', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Evaluation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Indiana', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Medical Imaging', 'Memory', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Outcome', 'Phenotype', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Science', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'cohort', 'data integration', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'disease classification', 'endophenotype', 'epigenomics', 'genetic association', 'genetic variant', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'mathematical model', 'metabolomics', 'multimodality', 'multiple omics', 'neuroimaging', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'predict clinical outcome', 'rare variant', 'risk variant', 'therapeutic target', 'transcriptomics', 'user friendly software']",NLM,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,R01,2018,341899,-0.03741748555384108
"Center for Multi- and Trans-ethnic Mapping of Mendelian and Complex Diseases ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The NHGRI Genome Sequencing Program (GSP) will identify genomic variants relevant to health and disease by genome sequencing over 225,000 participants across a multitude of diseases. The GSP will also serve as a pilot for the Precision Medicine Initiative that aims to enroll and sequence more than a million people representative of U.S. ethnic diversity. Here, we propose a GSP analysis center focused on Multi- and Trans- ethnic Mapping of Mendelian and Complex Diseases. There is a growing recognition of the substantial scientific advantages, as well as public health importance, of conducting biomedical research across ethnically diverse cohorts. We propose to develop scalable methods that incorporate ancestry to optimize medical genomic study design and improve power for uncovering the role of common and rare variants in disease. Achieving this goal requires expertise across diverse domains of knowledge including: medical and population genomics, algorithm development for complex disease mapping, and expertise in management of large-scale databases. Here, we have assembled a world-class team of medical and population geneticists, computer scientists, statisticians and clinicians, with leading expertise in the development of novel and scalable strategies for characterizing sequence variants and their role in disease. Importantly, our group has been at the forefront of development of resources, study designs and methods to enable genomic research in U.S. minority populations. Our project has three main objectives. First, we will develop an Automated Scalable Ancestry Pipeline (ASAP) for common disease mapping in diverse populations. ASAP will improve the computational efficiency of existing state-of-the-art methods for ancestry inference and develop important extensions to linear mixed models (LMMs) and other mapping strategies leveraging local and global ancestry. We will also develop methods to refine phenotypes and identify common controls for disease studies and define endpoints. Secondly, we will develop tools and resources for trans- and multi-population rare variant discovery that incorporate patterns of local and sub-continental ancestry. We will also develop machine-learning tools for variant annotation that leverage ancestral information, patterns of sequence evolution, and protein structure in a unified framework. Furthermore, we will incorporate population-specific patterns of cellular phenotypes to improve functional prediction algorithms for non-coding and coding variants. Lastly, we will disseminate our results through web-based resource that empower the biomedical research community. We will augment existing resources including ClinGen by annotating and characterizing pathogenic variants across diverse populations. We will develop a secure web-server that allows sharing of summary statistics and analysis pipelines to enable discovery, fine-mapping and functional prediction of genetic variants.

"UNDERSTANDING THE FUNCTIONAL IMPACTS OF GENETIC VARIANTS IN MENTAL DISORDERS ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the US, 46% are afflicted with a mental illness at some point of life. The management and treatment of mental disorders pose significant economical and social burden to the society. Many rare and common genetic variants, including SNPs and CNVs, are reported to be associated with mental disorders, yet more remain to be discovered. However, despite the large amount of high-throughput genomics data, there is a lack of integrative methods to systematically prioritize variants that confer susceptibility to mental disorders; additionally, despite the presence of many candidate variants for mental disorders, their disease-contributory mechanism remains elusive, so appropriate functional follow-up experiments cannot be designed. Altogether, these problems resulted in a large gap between the copious amount of data about genetic variation and our understanding of their functional impacts on mental diseases, which ultimately delays the development of targeted therapeutic approaches. To address these problems, we propose to develop a suite of novel bioinformatics approaches: (1) NeuroComplex, an information integration approach that leverages phenotype information and multiple sources of prior biological knowledge to rank genes by their likelihood of contributing to specific phenotypic presentations. (2) integrated MEntal-disorder GEnome Score (iMEGES), which leverages a two-layer strategy to predict the impacts of variants in personal genomes on mental disorders. The first layer uses machine learning algorithm to build variant deleteriousness scores for coding, non-coding and structural variants; the second layer integrates variant scores and NeuroComplex to assign pathogenicity scores. (3) a hierarchical model called CombOmics that incorporates cross-omics information to characterizes how variants confers disease risk, in order to help formulate hypothesis of pathogenicity and facilitate the design of functional follow-up experiments. (4) we will develop user-friendly software tools and web applications that implement all the aforementioned bioinformatics approaches, and continuously release and maintain these tools to ensure the maximum benefits to the scientific community. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We will develop novel informatics approaches to understand how genetic variation impacts various mental disorders, such as schizophrenia and autism. These tools help clarify the genetic cause of mental diseases, characterize individual disease risks and develop individualized treatment strategies.",UNDERSTANDING THE FUNCTIONAL IMPACTS OF GENETIC VARIANTS IN MENTAL DISORDERS,9645863,R01MH108728,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Benchmarking', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Ensure', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Family', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Proteins', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Annotation', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patient Selection', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Predisposition', 'Procedures', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychiatry', 'Reporting', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Societies', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Uncertainty', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'cohort', 'design', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder risk', 'experimental study', 'follow-up', 'genetic information', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic data', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'knowledge integration', 'novel', 'personalized predictions', 'personalized therapeutic', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'skills', 'social', 'success', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'user friendly software', 'user-friendly', 'web app']",NIMH,CHILDREN'S HOSP OF PHILADELPHIA,R01,2018,430000,-0.002004316109607414
"Identification of gene-gene interactions in relation to risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma and Barrett's esophagus PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Esophageal adenocarcinoma (EA) is an often lethal cancer and a significant public health concern in the U.S. Several risk factors have been identified for EA and its precursor, Barrett's esophagus (BE), including symptomatic gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), central adiposity, smoking, male sex, and European ancestry, but our understanding of the molecular/genetic determinants that govern why most people with reflux never develop BE, and most with BE never progress to EA, remains limited. Inherited genetics represents another likely contributor to disease susceptibility, and recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) within the Barrett's and Esophageal Adenocarcinoma Consortium (BEACON) have identified multiple novel germline genetic variants associated with altered risk of BE/EA. As observed for other cancers and complex diseases, however, the majority of estimated heritability for BE and EA appears unexplained. One plausible source for this “missing heritability” lies in the joint effects of multiple loci acting in combination. We seek to identify novel gene-gene interactions (G×G) in relation to risk of BE/EA, using a novel fusion of advanced analytical approaches aimed at overcoming technical limitations often encountered in the conduct of large-scale G×G (e.g. computational complexity and low statistical power). In a discovery scan (Aim 1), we initially will use two complementary knowledge-guided filtering methods to reduce the dimensionality of the G×G search space: first, we select ~500 genes with known or hypothesized relationships to BE/EA etiology and pathogenesis based on findings from GWAS, TCGA, and related studies; second, we select ~50,000 gene-gene pairs with highest-likelihood annotated biological relationships based on an integrated knowledge resource of pathways, processes, and interactions (Biofiler). Using existing germline genetic data on 2515 EA patients, 3295 BE patients, and 3207 controls from BEACON, we next will adopt a recently-described `hierarchical group-lasso' machine learning framework to select, in a joint model, ~1000 candidate pairwise SNP-SNP interactions most predictive of case status. These interactions are then evaluated using an independent validation dataset of 1609 EA cases, 1037 BE cases, and 3537 controls (Aim 2), using standard logistic regression models. In exploratory work, we will perform stratified analyses by sex or smoking history. The proposed studies are anticipated to expand our basic understanding of key biological pathways and mechanisms underlying the emergence of BE/EA; generate new leads and possible candidate targets for interventional strategies; and expand the foundation for future collaborative initiatives to integrate genetic, epidemiologic, and clinical data into robust disease models and novel predictive tools for BE/EA risk assessment and precision prevention. PROJECT NARRATIVE (PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE) Esophageal adenocarcinoma (EA) is an often lethal cancer that represents a significant public health burden in the U.S. In this proposal, we capitalize on the availability of large-scale existing datasets derived from expensive multi-year international collaborations, and perform new analyses to improve our understanding of how inherited gene variants interact to influence susceptibility to EA and its precursor, Barrett's esophagus (BE). Findings from this study will expand our basic understanding of key biological pathways underlying this cancer and ultimately help advance the development of better strategies for prevention and treatment.",Identification of gene-gene interactions in relation to risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma and Barrett's esophagus,9590939,R03CA223731,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Advanced Development', 'Barrett Esophagus', 'Biological', 'Chronic', 'Clinical Data', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Esophageal Adenocarcinoma', 'Etiology', 'European', 'Evaluation', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gastroesophageal reflux disease', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genotype', 'Heritability', 'Incidence', 'Inflammation', 'Informatics', 'Information Resources', 'Inherited', 'Intercept', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Lasso', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Life Style', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Metaplastic', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Molecular Target', 'Obesity', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Plant Roots', 'Predisposition', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Reflux', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smoking', 'Smoking History', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Subgroup', 'Supervision', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Upper digestive tract structure', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'clinically actionable', 'disorder risk', 'epidemiologic data', 'gene interaction', 'genetic architecture', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'individualized prevention', 'insight', 'knowledge base', 'male', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'predictive tools', 'protein protein interaction', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'sex', 'text searching', 'tool']",NCI,ROSWELL PARK CANCER INSTITUTE CORP,R03,2018,93591,-0.03300380934089699
"Approaches to Genetic Heterogeneity of Obstructive Sleep Apnea ABSTRACT  Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is recognized as an extremely common disorder that results in excessive daytime sleepiness and an increased risk of automobile crashes. It is also an independent risk factor for insulin resistance, hypertension, cardiovascular events, increased cancer rates and cancer mortality, and accelerates the progression of neurodegenerative disorders. OSA is a systemic disorder and the cyclical intermittent hypoxia that occurs during sleep affects every organ system. OSA is heritable, with first degree relatives of individuals with OSA having a two-fold increased risk of the disorder. Although this has been known for over two decades, there are very limited data on gene variants conferring risk or protection for OSA. This is likely the result of underpowered studies and GENETIC HETEROGENEITY. There are multiple pathways to OSA. Obesity is a major risk factor, as are craniofacial dimensions. The relative risk of these different risk factors varies by ethnic group. There are also neuronal mechanisms and other physiological risk factors. This proposal seeks to directly address the issue of genetic heterogeneity using a very large sample of patients and state-of- the-art analysis techniques. Towards this end, we have assembled by far the largest sample of well characterized and genotyped patients with OSA. This is the result of collaboration with key sites in the eMERGE Network [Geisinger, Vanderbilt, Mayo Clinic, Northwestern], Kaiser Permanente Southern California, and the University of Pennsylvania. We propose to carry out a robust genome-wide association studies (GWAS) using an electronic health record (EHR) derived case definition and quantitative trait analysis of OSA severity. We will use novel machine learning approaches to specifically address genetic heterogeneity. The GWAS approach will be complimented by a PheWAS strategy as another approach to identifying common variants and related clinical phenotypes. Specifically, we will look for variants that associate with OSA and other clinical diagnoses in the EHR. It is likely that gene variants for OSA will have pleiotropic effects. Gene variants identified from GWAS and/or PheWAS will be further assessed. First, we will use available whole exome sequencing data to see if there are relevant rare variants in these genes, as well as to perform exploratory discovery analyses to look for novel rare variation. The functional role of the genes identified will be studied by functional network analysis. Finally, we will assess associations with quantitative data on intermediate traits identified by high throughput craniofacial and intra-oral photography. These data are currently available within the Sleep Apnea Global Interdisciplinary Consortium (SAGIC). Future directions will assess the function of the genes identified in model systems and the clinical utility of utilizing variants as part of risk stratification for OSA. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common disorder with multiple adverse consequences. It is known that OSA has a genetic basis, but to date no convincing gene variants have been identified. This study uses state of the art approaches to identifying relevant genes based on a very large sample of patients with OSA obtained from multiple institutions in the United States. It is by far the largest study ever proposed for identifying genes for this common sleep disorder.",Approaches to Genetic Heterogeneity of Obstructive Sleep Apnea,9478321,R01HL134015,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Automobiles', 'Biological Models', 'Bladder', 'California', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network', 'Ethnic group', 'Event', 'Excessive Daytime Sleepiness', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'First Degree Relative', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hypertension', 'Hypoxia', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Nature', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Obesity', 'Obstructive Sleep Apnea', 'Participant', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Periodicity', 'Phenotype', 'Photography', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Relative Risks', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Apnea Syndromes', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Thinness', 'Tissues', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Vehicle crash', 'Woman', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'body system', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'case control', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical phenotype', 'cohort', 'craniofacial', 'craniofacial tissue', 'disorder risk', 'exome', 'exome sequencing', 'gene discovery', 'gene function', 'genetic association', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'genotyped patients', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'men', 'mortality', 'novel', 'phenome', 'pleiotropism', 'precision medicine', 'rare variant', 'secondary analysis', 'soft tissue', 'trait']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2018,692794,-0.058820631998501
"Integrated Clinical and Transcriptomic Profiling to Characterize Disease Phenotype PROJECT SUMMARY Exome and whole-genome sequencing are becoming increasingly routine approaches in cancer[1], common disease[2]and rare disease diagnosis.[3] Despite their success, our ability to fully interpret the clinical relevance of personal genome variation remains a significant gap[4-6]. Considering this, the most crucial need is more genotype-phenotype data that link genetic variation with disease causation. The objective of this proposal is to improve the clinical interpretation of genetic variation; in particular, by developing integrative approaches that predict the effect of genetic variation on clinical phenotype. This proposal addresses the hypothesis, supported by preliminary data, that combining patient transcriptomic data with genotypic and clinical data (as opposed to each alone) offers a better mechanistic understanding of disease natural history, from initial presentation to progression. The specific aims are designed such that each independently add substantial functional genomic information, over and above previously available patient genetic data, to further resolve the clinical phenotype. Aim 1 establishes a comprehensive and widely-shared dataset of patient transcriptomic (and genetic) variation across multiple cancer, cardiovascular and thrombosis/bleeding phenotypes, in patients with somatically-acquired myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) and select other rare heritable blood diseases (HBD). Aim 2 methodically determines differential RNA expression and processing between clinically-relevant subgroups of MPN and HBD patients. Aim 3 brings these elements together – and applies two integrative Bayesian and machine learning approaches, RIVER[24] (RNA-informed variant effect on regulation) and LASSO[25] (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator), to resolve the functional and clinical relevance of rare variants; and identify signatures most predictive of disease risk or progression. Completion of these aims will contribute new scientific knowledge on how integrating transcriptomic data improves clinical genomic analyses in other genetic (and rare) diseases. In addition, this project will enable the Principal Investigator to develop expertise in the informatics and data science aspects of genomic medicine that complement her current background in biophysics, biochemistry and translational hematology. Combined with additional informatics training at Stanford University through coursework, seminars, one-on-one advising from project mentors, and interactions with the wider statistics, bioinformatics and genomics communities, this project will prepare the Principal Investigator to launch an independent academic career in genomic medicine.

"ADPKD: Disease Spectrum & Genotype-Phenotype Correlations Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is a common monoallelic disorder associated with progressive cyst development and resulting in end stage renal failure (ESRD) in 50% of patients by 60y. However, there is considerable phenotypic variability, extending from in utero onset to patients with adequate renal function into old age. Autosomal dominant polycystic liver disease (ADPLD), as traditionally defined, results in PLD with minimal renal cysts. Classically there have been considered two ADPKD genes, PKD1 and PKD2, encoding PC1 and PC2, and two ADPLD genes, PRKCSH and SEC63, but in the past few years greater genetic heterogeneity has been described, with nine genes now implicated overall. Recent data also indicates an overlap in etiology and pathogenesis associated with ADPKD and ADPLD, with the efficient biogenesis and localization of the PC-complex central to both disorders. During the last funding period we identified a novel gene, GANAB, which is associated with both disorders, where the encoded protein, GII is involved in the maturation and trafficking of PC1.  In this proposal we will take advantage of advances in next generation sequencing (NGS) methodologies, and large populations of ADPKD and ADPLD patients that have been assembled and screened for the classic genes, to hunt for novel genes for these disorders (Aim 1). The phenotype associated with these genes will be characterized (Aim 3) along with their mechanism of action (Aim 2). NGS methods will be perfected to screen the segmentally duplicated locus, PKD1, and to identify missed mutations at the known loci, including those present in just some cells due to mosaicism (Aim 1). The significance of many PKD1 nontruncating variants has been difficult to evaluate (classed as variants of unknown significance; VUS), but recently evidence that some are incompletely penetrant alleles partially explains phenotypic variability in PKD1 populations. In Aim 2 improved in silico predictions, in combination with machine learning, will improve the understanding of the pathogenicity and penetrance of VUS. A cellular assay of the biogenesis and trafficking of this PC-complex will also be employed to quantify the penetrance of VUS. The mechanism of pathogenesis will be explored in animal models with ultralow penetrant (ULP) Pkd1 or Pkd2 alleles. Employing the large clinically, imaging, and genetically well-defined populations phenotypic groupings of patients will be defined that will then be compared to the genic and PKD1 allelic groups (Aim 3). This iterative process will allow the Variant Score (VS) associated with each PKD1 VUS to be refined. In a separate population the revised VS, alone and in combination with clinical, functional, and imaging data, will be employed to generate a comprehensive, predictive algorithm for ADPKD (Aim 3). Disease modifiers to severe disease, via biallelic ADPKD, and due to alleles at other loci will also be identified and characterized in the cellular assay and in vivo in combination with the Pkd1 hypomorphic, RC model. The final aim will exploit the newly identified information that some PKD1 and PKD2 VUS are rescuable, folding mutations that in a maturation-fostering environment can traffic and function appropriately. A screening scheme based on the level of cell surface PC1 will be improved and new chaperone drugs specific for the PC complex will be sought in collaboration with Sanford Burnham Prebys. A second mutation group that will be explored therapeutically are nonsense mutations. A cellular assay for readthrough efficiency is being developed and will be used for screening. Identified chaperone or readthrough drugs will be tested in available mouse models. Overall this proposal will better explain the etiology and the genetic causes of phenotypic variability in ADPKD/ADPLD, develop better prognostic tools for individual selection of patients for treatment that are now becoming available, and explore allele based treatments for ADPKD. ADPKD and ADPLD are genetic diseases associated with cyst development and loss of function in the kidney and liver cysts, where the disease severity varies greatly between patients. Here we will identify new genes that cause these disorders and evaluate mutations in silico, in a cellular assay, and in whole animals to better predict the disease course in each patient. Treatment options associated with the type of individual patient mutations will also be explored, bringing individualized medicine to these diseases.",ADPKD: Disease Spectrum & Genotype-Phenotype Correlations,9522439,R01DK058816,"['Age', 'Alleles', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney', 'Biochemical', 'Biogenesis', 'Biological', 'Budgets', 'Cell surface', 'Cells', 'Cellular Assay', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Cyst', 'Cystic kidney', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'End stage renal failure', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Family', 'Fostering', 'Functional Imaging', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genotype', 'Germ-Line Mutation', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Hepatic', 'Hepatic Cyst', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Kidney', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Chaperones', 'Mosaicism', 'Mutation', 'Nonsense Mutation', 'Other Genetics', 'PRKCSH protein', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patient Selection', 'Patients', 'Penetrance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Process', 'Proprotein Convertase 1', 'Proprotein Convertase 2', 'Proteins', 'Renal function', 'Role', 'Scheme', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Signal Transduction', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Variant', 'base', 'disease phenotype', 'dosage', 'early onset', 'exome sequencing', 'improved', 'in utero', 'in vitro Assay', 'in vivo', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'insight', 'loss of function', 'molecular diagnostics', 'mouse model', 'mutant', 'mutation screening', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'polycystic liver disease', 'prediction algorithm', 'prognostic', 'prognostic tool', 'protein folding', 'screening', 'therapy development', 'trafficking', 'variant of unknown significance']",NIDDK,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2018,510292,0.0010117646538758773
"Statistical methods for early disease prediction and treatment strategy estimation using biomarker signatures Project Summary:  Neuropsychiatric disorders pose an immense burden on patients, families, and health care systems, thus underscoring the urgent need to develop disease-modifying treatment. Research on neuropsychiatric disorders (e.g., Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease) faces unique challenges, including the fact that these disorders typically have a late onset and slow progression, the diagnostic criteria are based on subjective clinical symptoms, and there is substantial disease and subject heterogeneity. In the proposed work, we aim to tackle these chal- lenges by leveraging complementary contributions from multiple biomarkers, including genome-wide polymor- phisms, whole brain neuroimaging, bioﬂuids, and comprehensive neuropsychiatric assessments. We develop sophisticated analytic tools with higher resolution and improved accuracy by accounting for biological mecha- nisms of disease, synthesizing dynamic system-wide information, and integrating multiple sources of biomarkers. These methods are applied to clinical data collected by the investigative team or available from large international consortia in order to model the earliest pathological changes of neurodegenerative disease, assess treatment responses, and inform the design of early-intervention clinical trials and the discovery of optimal personalized therapies. Speciﬁcally, in Aim 1, we develop efﬁcient methods for multi-level semiparametric transformation mod- els to estimate and test the risk of genetic variants on various types of complex phenotypes to inform genetic counseling and improve clinical trial efﬁciency. Our methods do not rely on full pedigree genotyping and provide family-speciﬁc substructure, in addition to population substructure, to better control confounding and reduce false discovery rates in genome-wide association studies. In Aim 2, we develop large-scale nonlinear dynamic sys- tems through ordinary differential equations with random inﬂections to understand early pathological changes and identify subjects with preclinical signs. Our method provides multi-domain integration of ensembles of biomarker dynamics. In Aim 3, we develop dynamic hazards models and incorporate dynamic network structures to estimate biomarker proﬁles that evolve smoothly with disease progression for earlier disease diagnosis. We account for irregularly measured biomarkers and biological network dependence among biomarkers. In Aim 4, we develop doubly robust and efﬁcient machine learning methods to identify predictive markers, estimate optimal individu- alized therapies, and identify subgroups who may receive the greatest beneﬁt from therapy, with minimal risk. In each aim, we will validate the proposed methods through extensive simulation studies and demonstrate their practical value via application to real-world clinical studies. We establish theoretical properties of the proposed methods using modern empirical process theory and statistical learning theory. Together, the state-of-the-art ana- lytic methods proposed here will substantially improve analytic accuracy, and our combined statistical and clinical expertise will ensure that our methods are translated directly back to the clinical and translational research com- munity. Project Narrative:  The ultimate goal of neuropsychiatric research is to develop experimental therapeutics to delay disease on- set, slow disease progression, and provide effective treatment at each stage of disease. This proposal aims to develop new statistical approaches to integrate complementary sources of information from genomic measures, brain imaging biomarkers, and early clinical signs to characterize disease mechanism, progression, and treatment responses, and thereby inform the design of clinical trials and the discovery of optimal personalized therapies.",Statistical methods for early disease prediction and treatment strategy estimation using biomarker signatures,9502388,R01NS073671,"['Accounting', 'Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Back', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Differential Equation', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Intervention', 'Ensure', 'Equilibrium', 'Event', 'Face', 'Family', 'Family health status', 'Family member', 'First Degree Relative', 'Funding', 'Genetic Counseling', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Hazard Models', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heterogeneity', 'Impact evaluation', 'Individual', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Investigational Therapies', 'Late-Onset Disorder', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Nonlinear Dynamics', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Radiation exposure', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Safety', 'Source', 'Spinal Puncture', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'dynamic system', 'effective therapy', 'genetic pedigree', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'learning strategy', 'minimal risk', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'randomized trial', 'semiparametric', 'simulation', 'theories', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'validation studies']",NINDS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2018,340491,-0.003664524133876131
"Exploring Statin Pleiotropic Effects within a Very Large EHR Cohort - Diversity Supplement Statins among the most widely prescribed agents worldwide for prevention of cardiovascular diseases, produce substantial pleiotropic effects. Pleiotropic effects are unanticipated outcomes other than those for which the drug was originally developed, either therapeutic (beneficial) or detrimental (adverse drug reactions). Statin pleiotropic effects are unanticipatedly broad, including increasing the risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus and cataract, decreasing cancer-related mortality, and reducing dementia. Many effects are still not determined. In addition, individual responses to statins are highly variable. Genetics studies have identified loci that are significantly associated with statin response. However, it is unclear if either of the genetic variants within these regions is also associated with statin pleiotropic effects. We propose to investigate statin pleiotropic effects using whole de-identified electronic health records (EHRs) of >2.5 million individuals at Vanderbilt, including >110,000 statin exposure individuals. By linking this cohort to BioVU, the Vanderbilt de-identified DNA biobank, >10,000 of these statin exposure individuals have extant genome-wide genotyping. We argue that 1) previous inconclusive results are largely caused by inconsistent phenotype definitions, and 2) using the EHR to develop a novel, drug-based phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS) provides an ideal approach to discover unknown statin effects. The still-growing Vanderbilt de-identified EHRs allow large amounts of individuals' clinical data shared to support validation of known pleiotropic effects and to enable novel discoveries. Our previous work demonstrated our ability to develop consistent EHR-based phenotype definitions that can be deployed across multiple EHRs and institutions. We have expertise leveraging state-of-the-art informatics techniques, including natural language processing and ontologies, for pharmacogenetic studies, including for statins. We first described the PheWAS approach to not only replicate genetic associations but also discover novel, pleiotropic associations.

"An Integrative Radiogenomic Approach to Design Genetically-Informed Image Biomarker for Characterizing COPD ! Abstract  Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is one of the leading causes of death worldwide with a devastating socio-economic burden impacting more than three million individuals per year in the US. The primary environmental risk factor in the susceptible population is smoking, which causes an exaggerated inflammatory response. However, many factors including several genetic risk variants substantially influence the susceptibility. Twin-based studies show that families with emphysema have a higher risk for the disease. The two different major phenotypes of COPD are small airway remodeling (airway disease) and alveolar destruction (emphysema). Although these two major phenotypes result in a similar deficiency in global lung function, the relationship between them is complicated and likely involves feedback mechanisms. Developing an objective method to characterize lung phenotypes is critical since treatment candidates vary based on phenotype. Measurements from High-Resolution Computed Tomography (HRCT) images are increasingly used to describe COPD since they can quantitatively describe the contribution of the phenotypes. To discover the genetic risk variants, Genome-Association Studies (GWAS) have focused on either the physiological lung function or a simple threshold-based measurement from lung CT, neither of which fully characterizes phenotypic subtypes or the distribution pattern of disease. The proposed studies will take advantage of the rich image and genetic data jointly to build a genetically-informed imaging biomarker to characterize each patient. For each patient, our method summarizes the CT image to a vector representation that accurately describes the severity of the disease. Also, a method to link the representation back to the genetic risk variants will be developed. If successful, these methods can be used to monitor the efficacy of treatment or progression of the disease using imaging data. Successful execution of the second aim will result in better understanding of the etiology of different disease subtypes and discovery of novel genetic pathways that could be used as potential drug targets. Furthermore, the patient representation enables the use of image data to construct a more powerful model to predict the so-called acute exacerbation event. Predicting the exacerbations is clinically important since they cause further damage to the lung.  In Aim 1, we develop and implement a novel image biomarker that is mutually informed by imaging and genetic data from each patient. Our statistical method in Aim 2 elucidates the underlying genetic pathways behind the abnormal anatomical variations explained by the biomarker. We validate our method on data from 10,300 patients in the COPDGene dataset. !

"Overall NIDA Core ""Center of Excellence"" in Transcriptomics, Systems Genetics and the Addictome Addiction is a highly complex disease with risk factors that include genetic variants and differences in development, sex, and environment. The long term potential of precision medicine to improve drug treatment and prevention depends on gaining a much better understanding how genetics, drugs, brain cells, and neuronal circuitry interact to influence behavior. There are serious technical barriers that prevent researchers and clinicians from incorporating more powerful computational and predictive methods in addiction research. The purpose of the NIDA P30 Core Center of Excellence in Omics, Systems Genetics, and the Addictome is to empower and train researchers supported by NIH, NIDA, NIAAA, and other federal and state institutions to use more quantitative and testable ways to analyze genetic, epigenetic, and the environmental factors that influence drug abuse risk and treatment. In the Transcriptome Informatics and Mechanisms research core we assemble and upgrade hundreds of large genome (DNA) and transcriptome (RNA) datasets for experimental rodent (rat) models of addiction. In the Systems Analytics and Modeling research core, we are using innovative systems genetics methods (gene mapping) to understand the linkage between DNA differences, environmental risks such as stress, and the differential risk of drug abuse and relapse. Our Pilot core is catalyzing new collaborations among young investigator in the field of addiction research. In sum the Center is a national resource for more reproducible research in addiction. We are centralizing, archiving, distributing, analyzing and integrating high quality data, metadata, using open software systems in collaboration with many other teams of researchers. Our goal is to help build toward an NIDA Addictome Portal that will include all genomic research relevant to addiction research. PROJECT NARRATIVE The NIDA Core Center of Excellence in Omics, Systems Genetics, and the Addictome (OSGA) provides genomic and computational support to a large number of research scientists working on mechanisms and treatment of addiction. The two main research cores of OSGA are providing support for transcriptome, epigenome, and metagenome studies of rat models of addiction at many levels of analysis. We are also creating open access tools and a powerful web portal to catalyze more effective and replicable use of massive datasets generated by programs in addiction biology and treatment.","Overall NIDA Core ""Center of Excellence"" in Transcriptomics, Systems Genetics and the Addictome",9531327,P30DA044223,"['Archives', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Cellular Assay', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consult', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug abuse', 'Educational workshop', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Joints', 'Leadership', 'Machine Learning', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Proteome', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Quantitative Genetics', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'RNA', 'Rattus', 'Relapse', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Models', 'Stress', 'Sum', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translations', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'Variant', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'behavior influence', 'brain cell', 'career', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'computing resources', 'data archive', 'data integration', 'data modeling', 'data warehouse', 'deep learning', 'digital imaging', 'drug relapse', 'epigenome', 'experience', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic variant', 'genomic variation', 'graphical user interface', 'health record', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'metagenome', 'mouse model', 'multiple omics', 'neurogenomics', 'neuronal circuitry', 'novel', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'programs', 'ranpirnase', 'rat genome', 'repository', 'sex', 'single cell analysis', 'software systems', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'web portal']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE HEALTH SCI CTR,P30,2018,773018,0.008990599639354498
"Whole Genome Sequencing in Irish Multiplex Schizophrenia Families Project Summary: Although affected members of multiplex schizophrenia pedigrees have substantially elevated recurrence risk compared to singleton cases, the mean polygenic risk scores between these groups do not differ, suggesting that one source of this higher familial recurrence risk is rare, higher impact variation. We will collect whole genome sequence (WGS) from 600 affected members of multiplex schizophrenia pedigrees to identify rare variation shared by affected individuals within and between pedigrees potentially accounting for the increased recurrence risk, and reducing the `variant space' under consideration. After QC and calling in our existing pipeline, a) familial sequence variants in the exome will be directly analyzed in 2000 Irish cases and 2000 Irish controls with 30X exome sequence data in production currently, and b) variants outside the exome will be imputed into 3600 Irish singleton schizophrenia or bipolar disorder cases and 3000 Irish population controls with GWAS framework data; 3781 additional UK10K controls with 10X WGS are available to increase analysis power. This imputed dataset will be analyzed using recently developed methods for kernel-based tests of variation aggregated over a defined interval (such as a gene) that avoid the inflation of type-1 error. We use multiple sources of genomic information to develop weights for each position in the genome (indexing the prior probability that a change at the site has functional consequence) and each variant detected (indexing the probability that observed changes have functional consequence), and we propose to improve the existing genomic information sources for this weighting in a number of ways. In aim 3, prioritized variants from aim 2a/2b will be directly genotyped in the case/control samples by custom microarray; individual genes or genesets showing enrichment of variation in cases (if any are observed) will be resequenced in the case/control sample. In Aim 4, the directly assessed genotypic and sequence data from aim 3 will be analyzed using standard methods to identify individual associated variants, and variant-enriched genes, genesets or other functional sequences. We seek to unambiguously identify 1) individual variants that are significantly more common in cases, or 2) individual genes or other functional sequences or 3) gene- or functional sequence sets enriched for variation in cases to provide critical information about the brain systems perturbed in schizophrenia, and the mechanisms by which such alleles increase risk. Project Narrative Rare sequence variation has been implicated in many human complex traits, incuding schizophrenia, and has been studied in unrelated cases and controls and parent:offspring trios, but remains unstudied in multiplex families. Sequencing the genomes of such families will allow conprehensive identification of variation in protein coding genes, non-coding expressed loci, regulatory sequences, and evolutionarily conserved regions, as well as detection of structural variation, and testing these alleles in a large case/control series of the same ethnic and geographic origin offers significant advantages over prior study designs, and has the potential to identify individual alleles, variant enriched genes, variant enriched non-genic sequences, and/or variant enriched genesets contributing to SCH risk in the Irish population. Such variants offer great potential for understanding the functional impact of risk alleles and improving mechanistic understanding of schizophrenia and related disorders.",Whole Genome Sequencing in Irish Multiplex Schizophrenia Families,9555069,R01MH114593,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'Alleles', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Face', 'Family', 'Genes', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Ireland', 'LGALS3BP gene', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Nucleotides', 'Parents', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Population Control', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Principal Investigator', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Recurrence', 'Research Design', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Source', 'System', 'Testing', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'base', 'case control', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'exome', 'genetic pedigree', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'indexing', 'member', 'offspring', 'power analysis', 'programs', 'risk variant', 'sample collection', 'trait', 'whole genome', 'working group']",NIMH,VIRGINIA COMMONWEALTH UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,457798,-0.024263109522332744
"Biomedical Computing and Informatics Strategies for Infectious Disease Research ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): An important goal of infectious disease research is to develop genetic predictors of susceptibility. Our success in this endeavor will depend critically on the informatics methods and software that are available for making sense of high-dimensional genetic and genomic data. The goal of this research program is to develop, evaluate, distribute and support new and novel biomedical computing algorithms and open-source software for identifying combinations of genetic predictors of clinically important infectious disease outcomes. This application will target the growing body of rare genetic variants identified by high-throughput DNA sequencing. Our clinical application will focus on the prediction of antiretroviral response in clinical trials for HIV/AIDS. We propose here a highly innovative Hierarchical Rare Variant Collapsing Machine (HRVCM) algorithm for identifying and collapsing combinations of rare variants across gene regions (AIM 1). We will then integrate these new collapsed HRVCM variables into our popular Multifactor Dimensionality Reduction (MDR) method that will assess them in combination with common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from genome-wide association studies or GWAS (AIM 2). Our novel HRVCM-MDR approach will, for the first time, make it possible to assess non-additive interactions among sets of rare and common variants simultaneously in genetic studies of infectious diseases. We will apply these new and novel methods to approximately 13 million rare and common variants from nearly 3000 subjects that participated in an AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) study to evaluate risk for virologic failure with efavirenz-containing antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimens (AIM 3). Finally, we will release all methods as open source to the biomedical research community through our freely available MDR software package (AIM 4). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The overall goal of this application is to develop innovative new computational methods for the genetic analysis of infectious diseases.

"Statistical Tests for Mapping Genetic Determinants of Complex Traits ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Genotyping and emerging sequencing technologies have enabled comprehensive interrogation of genetic variation across the human genome, thereby facilitating a study's ability to map genetic variants that influence phenotypes of interes. Nevertheless, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and next-generation sequencing (NGS) projects have uncovered only a limited number of trait-influencing loci. While large increases in sample size will improve power to detect such variation, the ascertainment and sequencing/genotyping of such samples are costly and inefficient. Therefore, it is desirable to increase power to detect such variants without requiring additional sample collection. We propose novel methods for improved gene mapping of common and rare susceptibility variants that move beyond standard strategies typically applied to GWAS and NGS studies of complex traits. The first topic we consider is pleiotropic or cross- phenotype effects of genetic variants. Empirical studies have suggested that pleiotropy is widespread throughout the genome and that leveraging this additional information for gene mapping yields a more powerful analysis than an analysis that ignores such information. In Aim 1, we propose novel statistical methods for genetic analysis of high-dimensional phenotype data using an innovative kernel distance-covariance (KDC) framework that allows for an arbitrary number of phenotypes both continuous and/or categorical in nature, as well as an arbitrary number of genotypes (permitting gene-based testing of both rare and common variants). We will use the KDC framework to implement tests of pleiotropy as well as tests of mediation. The second topic we consider is the mapping of rare susceptibility variants using affected pedigrees, which provide many attractive features for rare-variant testing that case-control studies lack. In Aim 2, we propose a series of powerful statistical methods for rare-variant association testing in affected pedigrees that are based on a framework (recently published in AJHG) for rare-variant association testing in affected sibships. The existing framework compares rare-variant burden in a region by an affected sib pair to the number of regions that pairs shares identical by descent. We have shown the method is more powerful than case-control association testing given fixed sample size and further is robust to population stratification. In this proposal, we will extend the framework to handle affected pedigrees of arbitrary size and structure (rather than just affected sib pairs) and devise a powerful two-stage screening and validation strategy for rare-variant mapping that first compares familial cases in the pedigrees to external controls and then follows up the most interesting findings using an independent test based on our identity-by-descent sharing statistic among the affected relatives used in the first stage. We will apply the methods in Aims 1-2 to relevant data from genetic studies of complex traits in which we are directly involved. We also will implement the methods in public user-friendly software (Aim 3). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this project is to develop a set of statistical approaches to investigate two important topics in gene- mapping studies of complex human traits. First, we will develop techniques for identifying genes that have pleiotropic effects on phenotypes of possibly high dimension and further assess whether such genes have direct effects on such phenotypes or indirect effects through other possible factors. Second, we will develop tools to facilitate identification of rare polymorphic variation that increase risk for complex disease using data from affected pedigrees of arbitrary size and structure. We will evaluate these methods using simulated data and illustrate their value by applying them to genetic projects of complex traits in which we are actively involved. Application of the proposed methods to these datasets should improve our understanding of the genetic origins of various complex traits.",Statistical Tests for Mapping Genetic Determinants of Complex Traits,9405576,R01GM117946,"['Affect', 'Applied Genetics', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Categories', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Family', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genetic study', 'Genets', 'Genome', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mediation', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Nature', 'Phenotype', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Siblings', 'Signal Transduction', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'case control', 'cost', 'design', 'flexibility', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic association', 'genetic pedigree', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genome-wide analysis', 'high dimensionality', 'human disease', 'identity by descent', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'novel sequencing technology', 'phenotypic data', 'pleiotropism', 'population stratification', 'public health relevance', 'rare variant', 'risk variant', 'sample collection', 'screening', 'tool', 'trait', 'user friendly software']",NIGMS,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,297619,-0.03120673911339873
"Regulation of mRNA splicing by intronic genetic variants ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Genetic variations in introns commonly impact cellular functions by causing alterations in mRNA splicing. The abnormal inclusion and exclusion of exons often change protein functions and cellular phenotypes. Although many intronic variations have known functions, with the adoption of next generation sequencing, many more intronic variants have been discovered for which the functional impact is unknown. Thus, it is important to be able to predict the impact of the variants without needing to test them all in expensive and laborious assays. Although there are informatics algorithms that predict the impact of genetic variants on pre-mRNA splicing, their ability to predict the effect on protein function and ultimately disease and therapeutic phenotypes is lacking. In addition, there is a need for high-throughput cellular assays to test the results of these predictions on cellular functions. The studies proposed here will fulfill these needs by developing algorithms that prioritize the intronic variants by their potential impact on splicing and gene function, and developing a high-throughput assay to functionally test thousands of these predictions. These novel technologies will be applied to the effect of intronic variants on the pharmacogenomics of two clinically important oncology drugs, clofarabine and paclitaxel. Our long-term goals are to be able to predict the functional impact of genomic variants on human disease and therapeutic response. Our central hypothesis is that intronic genetic variants alter mRNA splicing and consequently protein function that ultimately affects the cellular response to drug therapy. Our first aim will be to develop computational algorithms that prioritize intronic variants based on their impacts on pre-mRNA splicing and protein function. Using a variety of genomic and structural features and large sets of genomic data, we will develop a bioinformatics algorithm specifically designed to prioritize intronic variants based on their potential impacts on pre-mRNA splicing and protein function. Our second aim will be to identify functional intronic variants associated with drug-induced cytotoxicity. Using existing genomics and cellular cytotoxic response data from populations of human cell lines, we will identify functional intronic variants that contribute to individuals' responses to clofarabine and paclitaxel cytotoxicity. Our third aim will be to functionally test the impact of the prioritized intronic variants on pre-mRNA splicing and drug cytotoxicity. Using our novel high- throughput functional splicing assay, we will test the effects of predicted functional variants from Aim 2 on pre- mRNA splicing. In addition, we will validate the effect of the intronic variants on cytotoxicity using exon specific siRNA and CRISPR/Cas technology to manipulate the target gene splicing. Upon completion of these studies, we expect to have developed bioinformatics algorithms that can accurately prioritize the intronic variants based on their functional impact on pre-mRNA splicing and protein function. Also, we will have tested thousands of variants in a cellular pre-mRNA splicing assay and validated the impact of several of these functional variants on paclitaxel and clofarabine cytotoxicity. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Project Narrative The goal of this project is to design and implement a set of bioinformatics algorithms and high-throughput experimental assays for prioritizing functional intronic variants that contribute to phenotypic differences by affecting pre-mRNA splicing. The developed model, including a molecular validation component, will be used to systematically evaluate the functions of such variants that are associated with drug-induced cytotoxicity. The same strategy can also be used to study the etiology of complex diseases.

"Overlap in genetic and learning-based mechanisms for alcohol use disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder Project Summary  Alcohol use disorder (AUD) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are common outcomes following trauma that are frequently comorbid, and this comorbidity is associated with greater symptom severity and poorer prognosis. Thus, efforts to better understand the etiology of these conditions is important for decreasing negative outcomes and improving prevention and treatment efforts, as much is still unknown regarding the etiology and mechanisms involved in their co-occurrence. Recent research has found that in addition to both phenotypes being moderately heritable, there is a modest degree of overlap in their latent genetic risk. Moreover, there is reason to suggest that fear-learning mechanisms frequently associated with PTSD may also be associated with AUD. Areas in need of further research include identification of molecular variation responsible for AUD/PTSD comorbidity, and extension of fear-learning models to AUD and comorbid AUD/PTSD populations. Developments in statistical procedures have afforded the ability to leverage genome- wide association data to answer key questions about these shared molecular underpinnings. The overarching goals of this K01 proposal are threefold. First, the study aims to use existing large-scale genome-wide data from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC; PTSD and Substance Use Disorders workgroups) to examine the molecular overlap via bivariate single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based heritability models, and determine if the polygenic risk score (PRS) from each disorder predicts case status in the other dataset. Second, a clinical laboratory study will be conducted using fear-conditioning paradigms in a trauma-exposed sample of diagnosis free controls, AUD, PTSD, and comorbid AUD/PTSD diagnostic groups to determine if deficits in learning are shared. Finally, an exploratory aim will use the PRS scores from the PGC data to generate risk scores in the lab sample to examine if there is a genetic association with conditioning deficits.  To achieve these aims, the candidate and multidisciplinary mentorship team have developed a comprehensive training plan that delineates a series of training and research goals. These goals will incorporate training in the epidemiology and genetics of AUD and PTSD, molecular and statistical genetics techniques, and conduct of clinical laboratory paradigms using genetic and psychophysiological measures. This training and resultant findings will capitalize on existing expertise and provide additional, focused training to allow for the development of a multimodal research program that uses large-scale genetic association findings to develop mechanism-focused laboratory studies that inform upon the development and maintenance of this complex presentation. The proposed research represents an important contribution towards advancing our understanding of the complicated and frequently comorbid phenotypes of AUD and PTSD. The institutional environment is ideal for the candidate's goal of developing an independent research line that ultimately aims to decrease the burden of alcohol-related problems, consistent with NIAAA research priority. Project Narrative Alcohol use disorder (AUD) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) commonly co-occur, and some of the genetic risk for these conditions is shared. This project aims to elucidate the shared molecular genetic risk and examine potential learning-based mechanisms common to both disorders, by linking large-scale genome-wide data with a clinical laboratory study. This K01 award will provide the candidate with the training necessary to pursue a multimodal program of research that aims to synthesize genetically informed research with laboratory studies of mechanism to inform upon the shared underpinnings of AUD and PTSD and advance work aimed at improving prevention and treatment efforts.",Overlap in genetic and learning-based mechanisms for alcohol use disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder,9445540,K01AA025692,"['Address', 'Alcohol Phenotype', 'Alcohols', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Clinical', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Extinction (Psychology)', 'Fright', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Techniques', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Glean', 'Goals', 'Heritability', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Study', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Outcome', 'Phenotype', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prevention', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychophysiology', 'Research', 'Research Priority', 'Research Support', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Symptoms', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Trauma', 'Twin Studies', 'Variant', 'Work', 'addiction', 'alcohol comorbidity', 'alcohol related problem', 'alcohol use disorder', 'base', 'conditioned fear', 'conditioning', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'genetic association', 'genetic epidemiology', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'interest', 'laboratory experiment', 'molecular scale', 'multidisciplinary', 'multimodality', 'outcome forecast', 'programs', 'psychogenetics', 'responsible alcohol use', 'risk sharing', 'skills', 'trait', 'trauma exposure']",NIAAA,VIRGINIA COMMONWEALTH UNIVERSITY,K01,2018,177833,-0.01953380451795247
"Genetic neuroscience: How human genes and alleles shape neuronal phenotypes Genetic studies have identified many specific loci with significant associations to psychiatric disorders. However, unless we can develop useful approaches for systematically turning genetic information into neurobiological insights about brain disorders, there is a danger that costly and hard-won genetic findings will not be exploitable to understand pathophysiology and generate important therapeutic hypotheses. The goal of our collaborative, interdisciplinary effort is to develop powerful, generalizable approaches for discovering how risk variants for psychiatric disorders shape neurobiological processes at multiple levels of analysis, and to identify the processes whose dysregulation underlies disease. To do this, we propose to develop new experimental and inferential systems to bridge a longstanding gap between human genetics and experimental biology. We aim to identify biological causes and effects that span the genetic, molecular, and cellular levels of the nervous system. Our interdisciplinary team will develop new experimental systems that measure genetic influences across levels of analysis (RNA, proteins, and cellular function including physiology) in precise, scalable, well- controlled ways. We will make use of emerging cellular systems including three-dimensional cortical spheroids and organoids, and radically novel “population in a dish” experimental systems that collect data on cells from hundreds of donors in a shared environment, inferring donor identity at the time of phenotypic readout. The analysis of such systems in turn requires sophisticated inferential strategies and new ideas from computer science. We propose to develop and widely share experimental and computational resources, including cell lines, methods, datasets, and analytic tools. The successful completion of this work will identify key neurobiological processes for multiple psychiatric disorders, and fortify many other scientists in making such connections in their own work. We hope in so doing to create a new kind of interdisciplinary science that – by combining the strengths of data-driven, unbiased human genetics with the power of emerging experimental systems – transforms the rate at which human- genetic leads lead to insights about disease mechanisms. To better understand common, severe psychiatric illnesses and develop improved treatments for them, we need to understand what specific aspects of brain biology give rise to each disorder. Here a team of scientists with diverse areas of expertise – from neuroscience to computer science to psychiatry to human genetics to stem cell biology – come together to develop a set of next-generation scientific approaches to this important problem, and to generate new methods and data sets that we will widely share. Our team will work to understand how aspects of brain biology at many levels – genes, molecules, and cells – act upon one another to create vulnerability to psychiatric illness.",Genetic neuroscience: How human genes and alleles shape neuronal phenotypes,9568024,U01MH115727,"['Affect', 'Alleles', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Awareness', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'California', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell Line', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Communities', 'Computer Analysis', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Experimental Models', 'Functional disorder', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic study', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Investments', 'Ion Channel', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Microglia', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Mutation', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Organoids', 'Penetrance', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Psychiatry', 'RNA', 'Regenerative Medicine', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Shapes', 'System', 'Technology', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'cell type', 'computer science', 'computing resources', 'cost', 'cytokine', 'excitatory neuron', 'experimental study', 'genetic information', 'high dimensionality', 'human data', 'improved', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'inhibitory neuron', 'innovation', 'insight', 'loss of function mutation', 'neurophysiology', 'next generation', 'novel', 'protein expression', 'protein function', 'rare variant', 'response', 'risk variant', 'stem cell biology', 'translational neuroscience', 'whole genome']",NIMH,"BROAD INSTITUTE, INC.",U01,2018,4132864,0.019422575516076096
"High-resolution map of human germline mutation patterns and inference of mutagenic mechanisms ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mutations are the ultimate source of genetic variation and one of the driving forces of evolution. Both the absolute mutation rate and the relative rate among mutation subtypes fluctuate along the genome, affected by adjacent nucleotide motifs and local features such as GC content and replication timing. Characterizing regional variation of mutation patterns is critical for understanding genome evolution and to identify variants causing genetic diseases. However, mutation rate and molecular spectrum are difficult to measure at high resolution, genomewide, and in an unbiased fashion. Estimates based on common variants and between- species substitutions are confounded by natural selection, population demographic history, and biased gene conversion (BGC). Methods relying on incidence rates of monogenic diseases or finding de novo variants by trio sequencing can inform global trends, but do not provide sufficient data to assess fine-scale local parameters. This study will overcome these limitations by using the extremely rare variants (ERVs) as a new data source to characterize patterns of recent germline variation in humans. ERVs, defined in this study as singletons in 30,000 samples, are becoming available via large-scale whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of population samples. Unlike common variants or substitutions, ERVs arose very recently and are largely unaffected by selection, BGC, etc. We will analyze 200-300 million singleton variants observed in 30,000 subjects at 20-30X coverage. The regional distribution of ERV subtypes will establish a quantitative atlas of the rate and spectrum of human germline mutations mostly unaltered by selection. We will share this resource with the research community and apply it to determine the impact of local genomic features and epigenomic attributes. We will use the systematic departures between ERVs and variants of higher frequencies (polymorphisms and substitutions) to infer local effects of selection, and this may uncover hitherto unknown functional regions of the genome. By comparing mutation signatures in ERVs with those in somatic variations observed in diverse cancers we will attribute distinct mutational signatures to known biochemical processes and thus infer the major contributors to new germline mutations in the human genome. This subtype-specific atlas will also be used to predict the probability of observing every possible single-base mutation in the genome, thus facilitating the interpretation of candidate causal variants of human diseases. We will assess mutation pattern differences among European Americans, African Americans and Latinos, and seek to discover genetic modifiers of germline mutation rate by finding functionally damaging mutations that show increased ERV counts in the surrounding genomic region, potentially identifying both known and previous unknown ""mutator"" genes that play a role in transmission fidelity in humans. This research will provide an essential resource to study the genesis and maintenance of germline mutations in humans. Understanding such a fundamental process will be the basis for a deeper understanding of human evolution and diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We will study the patterns of inherited mutations in humans using approximately 250 million extremely rare DNA variants in human populations. Our results will allow the prediction of the rate of new mutations at every site in the genome based on features of the surrounding DNA sequence, thus providing a common resource to study the arrival and maintenance of mutations in humans. Understanding such a basic process is important for answering fundamental questions in human evolution, the cause of inherited diseases, and the role of DNA abnormality in cancer and aging.",High-resolution map of human germline mutation patterns and inference of mutagenic mechanisms,9494629,R01GM118928,"['Address', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'American', 'Atlases', 'Biochemical Process', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Child', 'Chromatin', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Demographic Factors', 'Dependence', 'Disease', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'European', 'Evolution', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Gene Conversion', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Recombination', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Germ-Line Mutation', 'Guanine + Cytosine Composition', 'Hereditary Disease', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Human Genome', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Internet', 'Latino', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mendelian disorder', 'Methods', 'Mismatch Repair', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutation', 'Natural Selections', 'Nucleotides', 'Parents', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resource Sharing', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Selection Bias', 'Site', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Source', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Tissues', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'actionable mutation', 'base', 'data sharing', 'density', 'driving force', 'epigenomics', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genome-wide', 'human disease', 'human model', 'improved', 'next generation sequencing', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'rare variant', 'repository', 'transmission process', 'trend', 'whole genome']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2018,300473,-0.002496027609216873
"Genomic and Phenomic Architecture of Heart Failure The overarching goal of this project is to improve care for patients with heart failure (HF). HF, whether with reduced (HFrEF) or preserved (HFpEF) ejection fraction, is associated with significant morbidity, mortality, and cost. In the U.S. alone, HF affects over 5 million adults, and the prevalence is projected to exceed 8 million by 2030. HF is the most frequent cause of hospitalization among Medicare recipients and results in over $30 billion in health care expenditures each year. Advances in management, especially for HFrEF, have modestly reduced death rates over time, but mortality continues to be high, with approximately half of patients dying within 5 years of diagnosis. Moreover, the pace of drug discovery has been slow, and there are no proven therapies for patients suffering with HFpEF. Among patients with established HF there is substantial variation in illness severity, degree of cardiac remodeling, disease progression, and response to therapy. These observations highlight the heterogeneity of the HF syndrome and suggest existence of subtypes with differing clinical and potentially genetic profiles, with subsequent differences in downstream disease mechanisms, overall risk, and therapeutic response. However, the understanding of the phenotypic, genetic, and pathophysiological heterogeneity of HF is incomplete. This project investigates the phenotypic substructure and genetic architecture of HF by leveraging a unique collection of interrelated datasets from Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC), including the de- identified electronic health record (EHR) and BioVU, a linked DNA biobank. The EHR contains ~2.6 million patients, including ~35,000 with HF, and BioVU currently houses >225,000 DNA samples. Dense genotype data are available in >28,000 subjects and an institutional genotyping project will increase this to >125,000 by mid- 2017; this includes >13,000 subjects with HF. The proposed research will: 1) identify HF subtypes from dense clinical data alone using advanced, unbiased, deep learning algorithms (Aim 1), 2) define the genetic architecture of HF and HF subtypes by using inferred gene expression, general linear mixed models, genetic risk scores, and traditional association testing to quantify heritability of and genetic correlations among HF subtypes, define the contribution of established risk factors to HF subtypes, and 3) discover subtype-specific genetic risk factors (Aim 2), and discover HF subtype-specific clinical outcomes, disease associations, and drug response phenotypes using advanced phenome scanning and network analysis (Aim 3). Heart failure (HF) is a complex, debilitating syndrome associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The heterogeneity of HF has limited success of prior efforts to understand HF pathobiology and develop effective interventions. By defining clinical and genetic modifiers of HF risk, disease course, and treatment response for clinically recognized and novel, data-driven HF subtypes, results from this work could result in a more sophisticated HF classification system based on underlying biology, and ultimately facilitate precision risk stratification, tailoring of therapeutic strategies, and rational HF clinical trials.",Genomic and Phenomic Architecture of Heart Failure,9427555,R01HL140074,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiomyopathies', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Death Rate', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'EFRAC', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Failure', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health Expenditures', 'Heart failure', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Link', 'Measures', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medical', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medicare', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial dysfunction', 'Natural History', 'Outcome', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Severity of illness', 'Subgroup', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'biobank', 'cohort', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'defined contribution', 'disease phenotype', 'drug discovery', 'effective intervention', 'genetic architecture', 'genetic association', 'genetic profiling', 'genetic risk factor', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'mortality', 'novel', 'phenome', 'phenomics', 'response', 'risk variant', 'success', 'treatment response']",NHLBI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2018,395000,0.022141210963339247
"Massively parallel functional analyses of human PTEN variants Project Summary  We are now able to routinely sequence human genomes at single-base resolution. However, our ability to interpret the functional consequences of detected mutations has lagged behind. Computational approaches scale well but have poor accuracy, whereas retrospective analysis of detected variants has high accuracy but does not scale well. In order to solve this problem, a new experimental paradigm has emerged to empirically characterize the effects of mutations with high accuracy at scale. This approach takes advantage of recent and ongoing improvements in DNA synthesis and sequencing, and has the potential to offer unprecedented insight into protein biochemistry and human disease. We believe these insights will prove to be critical for unlocking the potential of genomic medicine.  In this project we seek to comprehensively assess multiple molecular effects of PTEN mutations on protein function, and assess the utility of this data as a predictor for human clinical phenotype. The PTEN protein is a tumor suppressor that is frequently mutated in diverse human cancers and in the germline of some individuals with overgrowth disorders, cancer predisposition syndromes, or autism. Currently, it is impossible to predict the effects of the vast majority of PTEN germline mutations. Since the phenotypic spectrum of PTEN mutation carriers is broad, it would be highly valuable to understand the ways in which phenotypic outcomes arise from PTEN mutation genotypes.  In Aim 1, we will first employ a yeast-based screen to assess the effects all PTEN single amino acid mutations on lipid phosphatase activity, the primary biochemical function of PTEN protein. It is known that several pathogenic variants are destabilized. Therefore, in Aim 2, we will perform a second, independent screen to assess the steady state protein stability of all PTEN single amino acid mutations. In Aim 3, we will use the data derived from this study as well as publically available biochemical information to train a classifier model to predict the relationship between the mutation genotypes and clinical phenotypes observed in humans. These data will increase our fundamental understanding of PTEN function and the role of mutations in diverse disorders, and could provide a valuable clinical tool that would increase the quality of life for PTEN mutation carriers. Project Narrative  Mutations in the gene PTEN are causal for a diverse set of clinical disorders ranging from cancer to autism spectrum disorder. Here, we seek to gain new fundamental insights into the functional relationships between PTEN mutations and clinical presentations by prospectively characterizing the effects of all single amino acid PTEN mutations in parallel. These data will allow the creation of new models that can predict risk of specific PTEN mutations for different clinical outcomes and potentially lead to personalized therapies, early interventions, and optimal outcomes for PTEN mutation carriers.",Massively parallel functional analyses of human PTEN variants,9539482,F31HD095571,"['Affect', 'Amino Acids', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Biophysics', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Cell Separation', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Coupling', 'DNA biosynthesis', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Deletion Mutation', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'FRAP1 gene', 'Fluorescence', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Germ-Line Mutation', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Metabolism', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Outcome', 'PTEN gene', 'PTEN protein', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphatidylinositols', 'Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases', 'Play', 'Predisposition', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Protein Biochemistry', 'Proteins', 'Pythons', 'Quality of life', 'Reaction', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Training', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Ubiquitination', 'Variant', 'Yeast Model System', 'Yeasts', 'accurate diagnosis', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'clinical phenotype', 'experimental study', 'fitness', 'genomic signature', 'genomic variation', 'high throughput technology', 'human disease', 'improved', 'insight', 'mutation carrier', 'next generation', 'novel', 'open source', 'personalized medicine', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'protein function', 'screening', 'synthetic biology', 'tool', 'tumorigenic']",NICHD,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,F31,2018,44524,-0.036924785431860244
"Optimizing Genetic Testing for Deafness for Clinical Diagnostics Project Summary  Hearing loss is the most common sensory deficit in humans. It is diagnosed in 1 in 500 newborns and affects half of all octogenarians. Although causality is multifactorial, in developed countries a large fraction of hearing loss is genetic and non-syndromic, i.e. not associated with other phenotypes.  During the prior granting period, we implemented and integrated comprehensive genetic testing as a cornerstone in the evaluation of the deaf and hard-of-hearing person. The American College of Medical Genetics has recognized the merit of this approach, and in 2014 included comprehensive genetic testing for the evaluation of deafness in their newest treatment guidelines. In the largest study to date to corroborate this decision, we found an underlying genetic cause for hearing loss in 440 (39%) of 1119 sequentially accrued patients chosen without exclusion criteria. Pathogenic variants were present in 49 genes and included missense variants (49%), copy number changes (18%), indels (18%), nonsense variants (8%), splice-site alterations (6%) and promoter variants (<1%), making comprehensive genetic testing the single best test to order in the diagnosis of hearing loss after an audiogram.  In this competitive renewal, we will build on these accomplishments by completing the following aims: • Specific Aim 1: To optimize phenotype-genotype integration in the analysis of hereditary hearing loss  by refining the use of hierarchical surface clustering and audioprofile surface analysis to determine  which types of genetic hearing loss are associated with clinically meaningful sub-clusters • Specific Aim 2: To validate and integrate physics-based protein modeling as a tool within the Deafness  Variation Database to predict variant effect and the molecular and patient phenotype • Specific Aim 3: To identify genetic modifiers of specific deafness-causing genes predicted by  hierarchical surface clustering and validated by physics-based potential free-energy modeling  The successful completion of this grant will improve the clinical care of persons with hearing loss by enhancing phenome-genome integration and by making variant interpretation more robust. Knowledge gained from this proposal will also lay the foundation for refined studies focused on the identification of genetic modifiers – both positive and negative – associated with complex phenotypes such as noise- induced and age-related hearing loss. This competitive renewal addresses the increasingly daunting challenge of variant interpretation. We will seamlessly integrate AudioGene into the OtoSCOPE® pipeline, explore hierarchical surfaces clustering at all loci, enhance the utility of the Deafness Variation Database by adding physics-based potential free-energy modeling, and using these tools, identify genetic modifiers of select types of genetic hearing loss.

"Molecular Characterization of Joubert Syndrome Project Summary Congenital ataxia presents in early childhood with non-progressive hypotonia, gross motor, fine motor and cognitive delays. These disorders are distinct from the progressive ataxias because of the presence of congenital cerebellar malformations and because they are typically inherited recessively. Joubert Syndrome and Related Disorders (JSRD) constitute a major subset of these conditions, consisting of a cerebellar midline (vermis) malformation, a nearly pathognomonic Molar Tooth sign on brain Imaging (MTI) and co-existent oculomotor apraxia and episodic breathing dysrhythmias. In our published data, we have: 1] Identified ten unique genetic causes of JSRD (nearly half of the published causes), 2] Generated genotype-phenotype correlations involving cerebellar, retinal, renal, hepatic, digit, and cerebral manifestations. 3] Identified common founder mutations that allow for population-based screening. 4] Discovered that JSRD encoded proteins frequently localize to the cilium. 5] Identified ciliary transition zone (TZ) defects in cells with JSRD mutations. 6] Performed siRNA cell-based screens for defective ciliogenesis to prioritize candidate JSRD genes. 7] Generated and characterized multiple zebrafish, mouse and human cell culture models for JSRD. 8] Defined the concept of ‘Ciliary localization’ model, in which one JSRD gene is required for ciliary localization of other JSRD proteins. In our unpublished data we have: 1] Recruited an additional 200 JSRD patients without molecular diagnosis. 2] Performed whole exome (WES) and whole genome sequencing (WGS) on an additional 100 JSRD families. 3] Identified an additional 12 novel likely JSRD candidate genes. 4] Generated IPSCs and cerebellar organoids from mutation-positive and negative families to aid in functional analysis and gene discovery using RNAseq. 5] Begun functional validation of the putative mutations. 6] Developed methods to interrogate ciliary structure in a high-throughput fashion with electron microscopy (EM). The goal of this competing renewal is to identify the remaining ‘discoverable’ genes that lead to JSRD when lost, functionally validate mutations within the pathogenetic framework, and test the hypothesis that mutations in JSRD genes lead to collapse of the ciliary TZ. Because the majority of patients still have unknown cause of disease, this renewal aims to advance knowledge through molecular characterization of new genes, using newly evolving high-throughput techniques, integrated bioinformatics, and a unique resource of consanguineous families recruited world-wide. We further aim to validate these mutations in patient cells, within a mechanistic framework that JSRD genes are required for essential ciliary structural components during cerebellar development. Project Narrative Joubert syndrome is a genetically and phenotypically heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorder unified by defects of the cellular primary cilium.

"Elucidating the Role of the Genetic and Environmental Determinants of Preterm Birth Using Integrative Computational Approaches ABSTRACT Given the wealth and availability of genomic and environmental exposure data, computational methods provide a powerful opportunity to identify population-specific determinants of disease. Proper treatment of data types emerging from a diverse set of molecular and environmental profiling technologies cannot be analyzed using traditional statistical routines and new computational approaches are needed. In line with the President's Precision Medicine Initiative, the goal of this proposal is to develop computational methods and integrate large- scale genetic and environmental exposure datasets to elucidate factors that affect preterm birth (PTB) in diverse populations. Preterm birth, or the delivery of an infant prior to 37 weeks of gestation, is a major health concern. Infants born prematurely, comprising of about 12% of the US newborns, have elevated risks of neonatal mortality and a wide array of health problems. Preterm birth rates vary among different ethnic groups, with frequencies significantly elevated in African Americans and moderately elevated in Hispanics in comparison to Europeans. Environmental and socioeconomic factors alone may not explain these disparities and despite the evidence for a genetic basis to preterm birth, to date no causal genetic variants have been identified. In this proposal I aim to leverage the rich genetic and environmental variation data and develop computational approaches to advance our understanding of biology of preterm birth as it relates to all populations. To that extent, I propose three aims. In aim 1, I will develop computational methods to identify and validate novel genetic factors for preterm birth by genome-wide association (GWA) study in diverse ethnic populations. I obtained a comprehensive set of publicly available PTB case and control datasets consisting of ethnically diverse mothers and babies including 3,500 cases and nearly 16,000 controls from dbGAP and will carry out an ancestry-based case-control GWA study to identify genetic factors influencing PTB. In aim 2, I will develop analytical methodology to identify environmental and socioeconomic factors that impact preterm birth in diverse ethnic populations. I propose to integrate linked California State databases covering over 3 million births across diverse populations with geographical location data and pollution levels and UV exposure data from the Environmental Protection Agency in order to identify whether these exposures play a role in contributing to population-specific PTB risk. In aim 3, I will carry out integrative data analysis and build computational models in order to identify population specific interactions between the genetic and environmental factors affecting PTB risk. I hypothesize that gene-environment interactions contribute to population differences in preterm birth risk following environmental exposures. The proposed work will allow us to learn more about the etiology PTB, but could also be extended to other phenotypes of interest. This project is the logical next step for the study of the interaction of genetics and environment in the context of disease, which can be used to inform precise population-specific diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. PROJECT NARRATIVE Given the wealth and availability of genomic and environmental exposure data, computational methods provide a powerful opportunity to identify population-specific determinants of disease. The goal of this proposal is to develop computational approaches to integrate diverse genetic and environmental exposure datasets to elucidate factors that affect disease in diverse populations and apply them to the study of preterm birth.

"Dissecting the pathogenesis and outcomes of PSC using multi-omics by studying the exposome and genome PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The major goal of this RC2 proposal is to generate the first, multi-omics translational study capturing the sum of environmental exposures (i.e. the exposome) and comprehensive data resource for Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC), a chronic, progressive liver disease without effective medical therapy. PSC shortens survival, is associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and strongly predisposes to cholangiocarcinoma (i.e. bile duct cancer) and colon cancer. Our recent genome wide association studies (GWAS) revealed the significant role of genetic variation in PSC, while also re-emphasizing the importance of environmental factors and gene-environment interactions in PSC pathogenesis. To further elucidate the role of exposures from our external environment and lifestyle (e.g., diet, stress, toxins, drugs, microbes), we have assembled a world-class, multi-disciplinary team that synergizes expertise and resources across four institutions: Mayo Clinic, Emory University, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), and University of Oslo, Norway. Our collaborative team will leverage large clinical databases and biorepositories, as well as expertise in PSC and related conditions, exposomics, metabolomics, methylomics, transcriptomics, metagenomics, genomics, and data analytics to develop the PSC Scientific Community Resource for hypothesis-generating science and simultaneously uncover factors contributing to PSC.  We now seek to define the bigger-picture cellular networks, rather than individual genes, driving disease processes. To do so, we will use unbiased network-based approaches designed to integrate multiple layers of omics data. Our proposal is predicated on the hypothesis that multi-omics analyses of data capturing environmental exposures and the associated biological responses, including the effect on the genome, will reveal networks or pathways influencing PSC pathogenesis and outcomes. To test this hypothesis, we will perform a series of sophisticated analyses to identify PSC-associated changes in and across the exposome, metabolome, methylome, and transcriptome in blood as well as the gut metagenome, exposome and metabolome.  Our collaboration and data generation are already underway with pilot studies demonstrating differences in blood exposomes and metabolomes and stool metagenomes between PSC patients and controls. Using a suite of bioinformatic tools and available genetic variation data, we aim to discover stable, detectable, omics-based disease signatures in blood (Aim 1) and stool (Aim 2) that when integrated with clinical data (Aim 3) will reveal biological pathways driving disease pathogenesis and outcomes. All data, residual specimens, and analytical details will be made freely available to the research community in accordance with NIDDK's mission. Furthermore, this effort responds to the NIDDK's call “to better understand the role of the microbiome, genetics, and exposome.” PROJECT NARRATIVE We seek to generate the first, multi-omics translational study and comprehensive data resource for Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC), a chronic, progressive liver disease without medical therapy. We will define the bigger-picture cellular networks and gene-environment interactions driving PSC by integrating multiple layers of -omics data.

"Modeling Dimensionality and Genetic Heterogeneity in Schizophrenia ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Schizophrenia (SZ) represents a significant and costly public health burden. Recently, we have witnessed the emergence of the first molecular insights into the etiopathogenic mechanisms of SZ, via the first genome-wide association studies (GWAS) with sufficient case-control sample sizes to detect allelic effects. Importantly, a polygenic signature, which includes genome-wide significant common genetic variants of small effect, has been clearly demonstrated to influence SZ risk. The availability of well-defined risk factors makes it possible, for the first time, to address several critical questions about the genetic architecture of SZ and its component phenotypes and endophenotypes. The overarching goals of this K01 proposal are 1) to test polygenic risk score prediction of dimensional SZ and schizotypy phenotypes across large case, high-density SZ pedigree, and prodromal-aged GWAS samples, and 2) to develop and test, with leaders of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, innovative statistical methods to identify and characterize ""genetic subtypes"" of SZ.  This proposal delineates a series of training and research goals for the candidate that incorporates strengths from phenotypic assessment, statistical genetics, and molecular genetics and combines samples reflecting a broad range of genetic risk. The candidate will capitalize on previously established expertise in schizotypy and clinical risk assessment, as well as expertise in the familial transmission of dimensional traits, to establish a program of translational research wherein the application of statistical genetic/bioinformatic techniques to genetic subtyping analyses will be used to generate promising candidates for further exploration in human genomic data. Empirically-based genetic subtyping methods will be developed and tested in the largest SZ case sample to date, and subtypes will be characterized with respect to dimensional phenotypic traits. Top loci hits in subtype analyses of dimensional symptoms will be validated in secondary analyses of differential gene expression in post-mortem SZ brain. This will allow for a detailed analysis of function at both the SNP and gene levels, and will provide the candidate with substantive training in both statistical and molecular genetics methods. The institutional environment is ideal for the candidate's goal of developing a comprehensive program in SZ research, and the proposed research represents an important contribution toward advancing the understanding of SZ through a combination of clinical, statistical, molecular, and translational methods, consistent with the mission of the NIMH. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Mental illnesses such as schizophrenia constitute 13% of the global burden of disease and schizophrenia, although relatively rare, is highly heritable (80%) and one of the most severe mental disorders. This project aims to elucidate the influence of genetic factors and gene function on dimensional schizophrenia and schizotypy symptoms with multiple measures, across multiple samples of varying genetic risk. Insights gained from this research will inform prediction, prevention, intervention, and treatment efforts by clarifying the biological mechanisms underlying SZ symptoms.",Modeling Dimensionality and Genetic Heterogeneity in Schizophrenia,9429123,K01MH109765,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Age of Onset', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alleles', 'Autopsy', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Gaussian model', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Interview', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Malignant neoplasm of ovary', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Personality', 'Phenotype', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Process', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Schizophrenia', 'Schizotypal Personality Disorder', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Subgroup', 'Suicide attempt', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Trees', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Wisconsin', 'aged', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'burden of illness', 'case control', 'clinical risk', 'cocaine use', 'cost', 'density', 'differential expression', 'dimensional analysis', 'disorder subtype', 'endophenotype', 'gene function', 'genetic architecture', 'genetic pedigree', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'marijuana use', 'mind control', 'nicotine use', 'novel', 'population stratification', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'secondary analysis', 'severe mental illness', 'sex', 'substance misuse', 'symptomatology', 'theories', 'training opportunity', 'trait', 'translational research program', 'transmission process']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,K01,2018,178674,-0.006870545770999906
"Searching for missing heritability for cardiometabolic outcomes by race ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiometabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) are common global health conditions that carry a great public health burden for chronic disability and early death. African Americans are more likely to be disproportionately affected than Whites. Our proposed project will have an important impact because it has great potential to explain, 1) A measure of the genetic susceptibility of these cardiometabolic diseases and mortality, and 2) Interaction and mediation of a genetic risk score (GRS) with a low diet quality score and low physical activity levels on these adverse health outcomes. There are published reports of interaction (effect modification) but not mediation (indirectly through an intervening variable) of a GRS with nutritional factors and low physical activity levels on cardiometabolic conditions; however, these studies involving interaction were performed predominantly in Whites. Most of the genetic susceptibility for these outcomes remains unexplained for African Americans. Studies are lacking on the role of these lifestyle factors in terms of interaction and especially mediation with a GRS to increase risk for cardiometabolic outcomes among Whites and African Americans. Thus, several questions remain regarding the influence environmental factors have with genes to increase disease risk and mortality among different race/ethnic groups. To address our questions, we will use the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute Candidate Gene Association Resource dataset of about 50,000 subjects, including 13,000 African Americans. To account for a measure of the genetic susceptibility, we will capture multiplicative single nucleotide polymorphism effects by the re-weighted random forest statistical method to compute a disease-and-race-specific GRS. We will include functional reduction- oxidation and metabolic disruptive single nucleotide polymorphisms that are involved in the inflammation and nutrient-signaling pathways. We will then investigate interaction and mediation of a GRS with a low diet quality score and low physical activity levels on T2DM, CVD, and mortality at baseline and over time by performing a meta-analysis. Our data include information on genetic polymorphisms, cross-sectional and longitudinal measurements on phenotypes for T2DM, CVD, and mortality, as well as dietary intake, physical activity, and relevant covariates. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The purpose of the study is to find a measure of the genetic susceptibility for type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and mortality in Whites and especially African Americans. Our study will examine interaction and mediation of a genetic risk score with a low diet quality score and low physical activity levels on these cardiometabolic outcomes at baseline and over time by performing a meta-analysis. To address our aims we will use the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute Candidate Gene Association Resource dataset of approximately 50,000 subjects, including 13,000 African Americans.",Searching for missing heritability for cardiometabolic outcomes by race,9390802,K01HL127278,"['Address', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Biometry', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Competence', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diet', 'Dietary intake', 'Disease', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Ensure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic group', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heritability', 'Inflammation', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Metabolic', 'Modification', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Nutrient', 'Nutritional', 'Outcome', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Parents', 'Phenotype', 'Physical activity', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Race', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Secure', 'Signal Pathway', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Time', 'Visit', 'Writing', 'cardiometabolic risk', 'cardiometabolism', 'caucasian American', 'design', 'disability', 'disorder risk', 'forest', 'gene interaction', 'global health', 'health disparity', 'high risk', 'lifestyle factors', 'mid-career faculty', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'nutrition', 'professor', 'public health relevance', 'response']",NHLBI,MOREHOUSE SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,K01,2018,136036,-0.006763709817661973
"Gene-Environment Interactions in Glaucoma Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is the leading cause of chronic optic neuropathy and a major source of ocular morbidity worldwide. Understanding preclinical events, early phase disease and disease heterogeneity represent key objectives in early disease detection, prevention and treatment of POAG. In this study, we propose 4 specific aims. 1) We will perform both targeted and untargeted metabolome-wide association studies (MWAS) for POAG using pre-clinical serum from a large case-control group (500 cases and 500 controls) nested within ongoing prospective studies of the Nurses' Health Study (NHS), NHS2, and Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS) to advance our understanding of the biochemical events that precede POAG diagnosis (blood was collected ~ 10 years prior to disease diagnosis). Prior studies suggest that nitric oxide metabolites represent genetically informed markers and will form the basis for targeted profiling. 2) While considerable discoveries have been made of POAG genes, more work is needed to leverage genome-wide information to inform POAG etiology. Thus, we will create a genome-wide genetic correlation matrix between POAG and complex traits previously linked to POAG, using data from the NEIGHBORHOOD (National Eye Institute Glaucoma Human Genetics Collaboration Heritable Overall Operational Database; 3800 POAG cases) consortium and publicly available summary genome-wide association study data. An assessment of the shared heritability between POAG and these traits as well as the relation between the genetic risk scores for these traits and POAG will lead to new etiologic insights. 3) New-onset POAG is clinically heterogeneous with variable visual field (VF) loss patterns that may reflect different etiologies. We will apply archetype analysis, which objectively quantifies a patient's VF loss pattern to 16 existing clinically validated archetypes (ATs), 9 of which are glaucomatous in nature. Each POAG case (n=1250 from NHS, NHS2 and HPFS) and10 matched controls will be assigned 16 weighted coefficients that add up to 1, with each value representing how consistent his / her VF loss pattern is with each glaucomatous AT. We will evaluate the differential relation between established POAG risk factors and the values on the 16 ATs, to identify unique risk factors for homogeneous incident POAG subtypes. 4) A carbohydrate-restricted diet may meet the energy requirement in the non-myelinated retinal ganglion cell axon segment of the optic nerve and reduce risk of POAG. We will conduct a prospective evaluation of this exposure in relation to POAG and POAG subtypes in the 3 cohorts (n=2100 cases). By integrating MWAS, genomics with prospective environmental exposure data and AT analysis, this proposal addresses a number of important knowledge gaps—in particular, it will shed light on how genetic and pre-diagnostic risk factors influence POAG and POAG heterogeneity. Linking specific exposures with POAG subtypes will provide important mechanistic understanding as well as evidence of causality, which will contribute to discovering precision medicine approaches for this condition. Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is an intraocular pressure-related chronic optic nerve disease that produces characteristic visual loss patterns. In this proposal we will study a host of genes, plasma metabolites and environmental factors in relation to POAG overall as well as it's objectively determined subtypes based on visual loss pattern. Understanding how these various exposures relate to POAG and it's subtypes will highlight disease prevention strategies and precision medical treatment options for this potentially blinding disease that requires lifetime management.",Gene-Environment Interactions in Glaucoma,9519600,R01EY015473,"['Acetyl Coenzyme A', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Archives', 'Arginine', 'Axon', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biogenesis', 'Blindness', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Carbohydrates', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Citrulline', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Family', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genomics', 'Glaucoma', 'Health Professional', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human Genetics', 'Impairment', 'Knowledge', 'Life Style', 'Light', 'Link', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Metabolism', 'Mitochondria', 'Modification', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Eye Institute', 'Nature', 'Neighborhoods', 'Nested Case-Control Study', 'Nitric Oxide', 'Nitric Oxide Pathway', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Nurses&apos', ' Health Study', 'Optic Nerve', 'Ornithine', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral', 'Phase', 'Physiologic Intraocular Pressure', 'Plasma', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive', 'Primary Open Angle Glaucoma', 'Prospective Studies', 'Prospective cohort', 'Recording of previous events', 'Retinal Ganglion Cells', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Thinness', 'Visual', 'Visual Fields', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'beta-Hydroxybutyrate', 'case control', 'cohort', 'common treatment', 'dietary restriction', 'disability', 'disease diagnosis', 'disease heterogeneity', 'disorder prevention', 'follow-up', 'gene environment interaction', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'insight', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'mitochondrial dysfunction', 'novel', 'optic nerve disorder', 'pre-clinical', 'precision medicine', 'prospective', 'secondary analysis', 'targeted treatment', 'time interval', 'trait']",NEI,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2018,571504,0.0007110439357201051
"Statistical Genetics and Genomics for Epidemiologic Research Project Summary/Abstract Genome-wide association studies have identi ed an unprecedented number of genetic variants associated with disease risk, yet molecular mechanisms and clinical implications of genetic risk alleles are largely unknown. Epidemiologic research is extending its reach to more translational and mechanistic studies, integrating genetic risk variants with environmental exposures, interventions, gene expression and epigenetics. Motivated by population-based studies for prostate cancer research, we will develop statistical methods for emerging translational topics: how to search for genotypes that predict individual and subgroup intervention e ects? how to identify epigenetic alterations that may be an interface of the environment and the genome? how to assess causal mediation e ect of a modi able risk factor or a molecular alteration in relation to disease outcomes? These topics present unmet statistical challenges because of high dimensionality and complex modeling. Speci c statistical methods to be developed include high-dimensional gene- treatment interaction, multi-locus regional association, mediation analyses, instrumental variable analyses, Mendelian randomization, and shrinkage and regularization.  The methodological research in this project is driven primarily by prostate cancer, the most common noncutaneous cancer and the second leading cause of cancer death in American men, a ecting one in six in his lifetime. This project nests in highly-accomplished consortium studies (PCPT/SELECT/PRACTICAL/PCPS), all of which have generated far-reaching impact on prostate cancer research. The unique feature of this project is that methodological development will be seamlessly integrated with ongoing analyses, ensuring immediate translation. Our transdisciplinary research team has been actively engaged in statistical genetics and genomics, and conducting molecular epidemiological studies. The PI brings a wealth of expertise in high-dimensional methods, molecular biomarkers, and genetic epidemiology. This project will have a far-reaching impact on methodologies in cancer etiology, prevention, and treatment outcomes. Project Narrative In this project we will develop a suite of statistical methodologies for dissecting the multi-faceted role of genetics and genomics in modern epidemiology, and perform innovative analyses in well-characterized extant populations for prostate cancer research. The methodological topics include precision prevention based on individual genetic susceptibility, epigenetic alterations as the interface of the environment and the genome, and causal inference and mediation.",Statistical Genetics and Genomics for Epidemiologic Research,9597142,R01CA222833,"['Alcohol consumption', 'American', 'Beds', 'Biological Markers', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Prognosis', 'Cations', 'Cessation of life', 'Chemoprevention', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'DNA Methylation', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiology', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Etiology', 'Exercise', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Gleason Grade for Prostate Cancer', 'Guide prevention', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Indolent', 'Insulin-Like Growth-Factor-Binding Proteins', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Life Style', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Measures', 'Mediation', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Outcome', 'PSA screening', 'Patient risk', 'Population', 'Population Study', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Prevention', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial', 'Prostate Cancer therapy', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Selenium and Vitamin E Efficacy Trial', 'Smoking', 'Southwest Oncology Group', 'Statistical Methods', 'Subgroup', 'The Sun', 'Transcription Alteration', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Variant', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'blood lipid', 'cancer therapy', 'cohort', 'disorder risk', 'drinking', 'epidemiology study', 'epigenetic marker', 'gene discovery', 'genetic epidemiology', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'individualized prevention', 'innovation', 'lifestyle factors', 'men', 'methylation biomarker', 'molecular marker', 'mortality', 'neglect', 'novel', 'overtreatment', 'pleiotropism', 'population based', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'prostate cancer prevention', 'prostate cancer risk', 'risk variant', 'success', 'tool', 'tumor']",NCI,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2018,439543,-0.026033680640697363
"Pharmacogenomics of Statin Therapy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall objective of the Center ""Pharmacogenomics of Statin Therapy"" (POST) is to apply genomic, transcriptomic, and metabolomic analyses, together with studies in cellular and animal models, and innovative informatic tools, to identify and validate biomarkers for efficacy of statin drugs in reducing riskof cardiovascular disease (CVD), and for adverse effects of statins, specifically myopathy and type 2 diabetes. This multidisciplinary approach is enabled by a team of investigators with expertise in genomics (human, mouse, and molecular), statistics and informatics, and clinical medicine and pharmacology. The Center is comprised of three Projects, two Research Cores, and an Administrative Core. A major aim of Project 1 is the identification of cellular transcriptomic and metabolomic markers for clinical efficacy and adverse effects of statins. This will be accomplished by analyses in statin-exposed lymphoblast cell lines derived from patients with major adverse coronary events, or onset of myopathy or type 2 diabetes on statin treatment, compared with unaffected statin- treated controls. In addition, using genome wide genotypes from these patients, DNA variants will be identified that are associated with statin-induced changes in the transcripts and metabolites that most strongly discriminate affected patients and controls. Project 2 will use a unique, well-characterized panel of 100 inbred mouse strains to discover genetic variation associated with statin-induced myopathy and dysglycemia. Mechanisms underlying these effects will be investigated, with emphasis on the role of dysregulation of autophagy by statin treatment. Projects 1 and 2 will also use relevant cellular and mouse models, respectively, to perform functional studies to validate effects of genes identified in all POST projects as strong candidates for modulating statin efficacy or adverse effects. In Project 3, information derived from genome-wide genotypes, electronic health records, and pharmacy data in a very large and diverse population-based patient cohort will be leveraged to identify and replicate genetic associations with statin efficacy (lipid lowering and CVD event reduction) and adverse effects (myopathy and type 2 diabetes), as well as to assess the overall heritability of these responses. The Clinical Core, based in Kaiser Permanente of Northern California, will provide the clinical information and biologic materials for both Projects1 and 3. Investigators in the Informatics Core will optimize data analysis and integration of results across all projects. The Administrative Core will provide scientific leadership and management of the Center, and foster scientific interactions and training opportunities. Overall, the research program of this Center provides an innovative model for a ""systems"" approach to pharmacogenomics that incorporates complementary investigative tools to discover and validate genetically influenced determinants of drug response. Moreover, the findings have the potential for guiding more effective use of statins for reducing CVD risk and minimizing adverse effects, and identifying biomarkers of pathways that modulate the multiple actions of this widely used class of drugs.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Coronary heart disease and stroke are the leading causes of death and disability in the United States, and statins are the most widely prescribed class of drugs to prevent these conditions. There is however, considerable interindividual variation in efficacy of statins for reducing disease risk, as well as in susceptibility to the most common adverse statin effects, myopathy and type 2 diabetes. The goal of the Center ""Pharmacogenomics of Statin Therapy"" (POST) is to apply complementary investigative approaches and multidisciplinary expertise for discovering and validating the genetic and metabolic factors responsible for this variability. This information has the potential for optimizig use of statins in clinical practice, and for identifying new pathways that underlie the diverse biologic actions of this drug class.              ",Pharmacogenomics of Statin Therapy,9560840,P50GM115318,"['Adverse effects', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Autophagocytosis', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'California', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Line', 'Cell model', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Markers', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Pharmacology', 'Collaborations', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease Outcome', 'Drug effect disorder', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Ethnic group', 'Event', 'Fostering', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Hybrids', 'Hyperglycemia', 'In Vitro', 'Inbred Strains Mice', 'Informatics', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Metabolic', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Muscle function', 'Myopathy', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Predisposition', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Recombinants', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Residual state', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Simvastatin', 'Stroke', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Transcript', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Visualization software', 'adverse outcome', 'alternative treatment', 'base', 'biomarker identification', 'blood glucose regulation', 'candidate validation', 'cardiovascular disorder prevention', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'clinical efficacy', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'coronary event', 'data integration', 'data visualization', 'design', 'disability', 'disorder risk', 'exome', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic association', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genotyped patients', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'inter-individual variation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'lymphoblast', 'lymphoblastoid cell line', 'metabolomics', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'novel strategies', 'population based', 'predictive marker', 'prevent', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'risk minimization', 'statistics', 'tool', 'training opportunity', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment strategy']",NIGMS,CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL & RES CTR AT OAKLAND,P50,2018,2667664,0.009096673486966115
"Understanding modifiers of mendelian mutation penetrance using familial hypercholesterolemia as a model PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Rare monogenic forms of common diseases have provided key fundamental insights about common disease. However, genetic, environmental, and stochastic elements influence risk for disease. Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), an autosomal dominant disorder afflicting 1 in 250 linked to severe increases in LDL cholesterol and premature coronary heart disease (CHD) risk, is an ideal model to characterize modifiers of disease. Despite the presence of a strong genetic driver of hypercholesterolemia from FH mutations, we recently observed that half do not have the expected severe hypercholesterolemia. In this proposal, we outline several methods to discover and dissect the genetic and non-genetic factors influencing CHD risk conferred by FH mutations in humans and determine whether knowledge of these factors can improve risk discrimination among those with FH mutations. Our approach harnesses several multi-dimensional datasets: whole genome sequences, metabolomics, and cross-sectional and longitudinal cardiovascular phenotypes. In Aim 1, we will aggregate and curate 75,000 deep (30X) whole genome sequences and cardiovascular phenotypes. In Aim 2, we will discover genetic and non-genetic modifiers of LDL cholesterol and CHD risk in FH and evaluate their metabolomic consequences. In Aim 3, we will develop a method incorporating genetics and longitudinal non- genetic exposures for CHD risk stratification among ~4,000 with FH mutations in the Million Veteran Program. In addition to the proposed Aims, this five-year proposal outlines a comprehensive strategy for the principal investigator's (PI's) scientific and professional development in academic cardiovascular medicine. The research strategy builds upon the PI's prior research experience and clinical training. In addition to an undergraduate degree in Molecular Biology and master's degree in Biomedical Informatics, he completed post- graduate medical training in Internal Medicine and Cardiovascular Medicine. He recently developed a new preventive/genetic cardiology clinic focusing on the evaluation and management of those with or a family history of premature CHD, including those with FH, at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH). This proposal now focuses on expanding his scientific skills in human genetics and genomics into new domains: integrative genomics, statistical genetics, clinical informatics, and risk modeling. The career development goals will be at achieved through a multi-faceted approach involving mentorship, collaboration, didactic coursework, conferences, and scientific investigation. This work will take place in a unique training environment comprised of MGH and the Broad Institute. Successful completion of this career development award will result in improved fundamental understanding of the determinants of CHD, result in the PI's transition to an independent physician-scientist, and provide a solid foundation from which he will apply for R01-level funding. PROJECT NARRATIVE / PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Cardiovascular disease, largely due to coronary heart disease (CHD), remains the leading cause of death in the United States and now worldwide despite current advances. Familial hypercholesterolemia is a relative common genetic disorder characterized by severe hypercholesterolemia and premature CHD but many carrying these mutations do not develop these consequences. This proposal seeks to define and characterize the factors modifying CHD risk among those with FH mutations; success has the potential to broadly identify new mechanisms of CHD and novel strategies for prevention.",Understanding modifiers of mendelian mutation penetrance using familial hypercholesterolemia as a model,9431712,K08HL140203,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'African', 'Algorithms', 'Amish', 'Bachelor&apos', 's Degree', 'Biochemical', 'Cardiology', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Catalogs', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Cloud Computing', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Simulation', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary heart disease', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Disease Pathway', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Ethnic Origin', 'European', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Familial Hypercholesterolemia', 'Family history of', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Gene Mutation', 'General Hospitals', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Counseling', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Internal Medicine', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'LDL Cholesterol Lipoproteins', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Low-Density Lipoproteins', 'Machine Learning', 'Massachusetts', 'Master&apos', 's Degree', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mendelian disorder', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Biology', 'Mutation', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Network-based', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Penetrance', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive', 'Preventive therapy', 'Principal Investigator', 'Quality Control', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Scientist', 'Solid', 'Statistical Models', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Veterans', 'Work', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomedical informatics', 'career development', 'cloud based', 'cohort', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'genetic analysis', 'genome sequencing', 'genomic variation', 'heart disease risk', 'high risk', 'human disease', 'human genomics', 'hypercholesterolemia', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'lifestyle factors', 'metabolomics', 'next generation', 'non-genetic', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'premature', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'skills', 'success', 'symposium', 'trait', 'whole genome']",NHLBI,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K08,2018,173296,0.03456191097276575
"Epi25 Clinical Phenotyping R03 PROJECT SUMMARY Clinical genetic data suggests that specific categories of epilepsy have genetic contributors, and there may be some overlap between categories. The Epi25 Collaborative was formed among more than 40 cohorts from around the world to sequence as many as 25,000 genomes or exomes. As of 2017, the collaborative has sequenced more than 13,000 exomes and clinical data has been collected for more than 8,000 cases. This project will complete the collection and review of the clinical data for each sample in the Epi25 collection to facilitate the translation of genomic and clinical discoveries into improved care for patients. The clinical and genomic data from Epi25 will be a global resource, shared with the research community for years to come. Epi25's governance structure, membership, and other information are available online at www.epi-25.org. In this project, clinical data is entered by contributors into Red Cap forms or uploaded directly into the Epi25 database. The clinical data is then checked by a computer algorithm that looks for key eligibility criteria for each participant. Errors and missing data are sent to the Phenotyping Coordinator to review and resolve, with the help of the contributing site. PROJECT NARRATIVE In 2014, collaborators from around the world created the Epi25 Collaborative to exome sequence as many as 25,000 patients with epilepsy. The collaborative has more than 6,200 exomes generated in year 2016, an additional 7,500 on sequencers in 2017, and more than 1,000 ready for sequencing in 2018.

However, these technical advances are not yet uniformly applied, as there is under-representation in personalized medicine (PM) research that cuts across ages, genders, racial minorities, and socioeconomic groups. This is particularly true for American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) populations, which are critical communities to involve in discovery research for several reasons. First, these populations have been neglected to date, partly due to a lack of community engagement and historical mistrust around the scientific enterprise. Second, these oftentimes isolated populations can have differences in the prevalence of known, function-disrupting gene variants of clinical significance and/or may possess novel variants with altered function. Third, the effects of unique dietary and other environmental influences among these AI/AN populations on drug response may be modified by genetic variation. We address these issues in Aims 1-3 of Project 2 of our Program Project grant, which seeks a better understanding of the relationship between novel measurements of short- and long-term hepatic vitamin K status, variation in vitamin K cycle genes, and warfarin anticoagulation outcomes. Warfarin is still the most commonly used drug in its pharmacological class in the US and has enormous clinical utility for AI/AN populations, who have more restricted access to emergency hospital facilities and expensive new anticoagulant medications. In Aim 1 we will develop more sensitive and specific biomarkers of hepatic vitamin K status than the existing plasma ELISA-based PIVKA-II and vitamin K assays, using LC-MS/MS-based approaches to quantitate all eleven (proteo)forms of carboxylated prothrombin (Factor II) in plasma and CYP4F2-dependent vitamin K catabolites in urine. This is biologically significant because hepatic vitamin K levels affect Factor II proteoform synthesis and several undercarboxylated proteoforms have clotting factor activity. In Aim 2, we will use our enhanced assays to (A) characterize short- and long-term hepatic vitamin K status in three AI/AN populations and test its association with CYP4F2*3 and (B) directly test whether the gene variant modifies the effect of vitamin K supplementation on hepatic vitamin K status. In Aim 3, we will test whether prospectively applied pharmacogenetic and biomarkers tests of hepatic vitamin K status are associated with long-term hemostasis control in AI/AN (and all other) populations receiving warfarin-based anticoagulation therapy. These aims are highly clinically significant. Specifically, they will enhance our understanding of the regulation of hepatic vitamin K status, and by inference all human vitamin K-dependent Gla proteins, by CYP4F2. The results may also further the development of a new decision tree for warfarin versus DOAC therapy based on the aforementioned PM test results.s. PROGRAM NARRATIVE The coordinated efforts of these Projects and Cores will advance our knowledge of gene-environment-drug interactions in the treatment of cardiovascular disease with anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapies in American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) populations. This, we believe, can lead to safer and more effective drug therapies for the treatment of cardiovascular disease in AI/AN people and the general population. In addition, the program will enhance opportunities for responsible genomic research in AI/AN communities.",Competing Revision - Precision Medicine and Oral Anticoagulants,9416858,P01GM116691,"['Address', 'Admixture', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alaska', 'Alaska Native', 'American Indians', 'Anticoagulants', 'Anticoagulation', 'Antiplatelet Drugs', 'Applications Grants', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Coagulation Factor', 'Blood Platelets', 'Cardiovascular Agents', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Coagulation Process', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Dietary Factors', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug usage', 'Emergency Situation', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Event', 'Gender', 'General Population', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hemostatic function', 'Hepatic', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Marketing', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morals', 'Native-Born', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Pacific Northwest', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Pharmacology', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Plasma', 'Platelet Activation', 'Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids', 'Population', 'Population Study', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Program Research Project Grants', 'Proteins', 'Prothrombin', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Source', 'Supplementation', 'Technology', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Translational Research', 'Tribes', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Variant', 'Venous Thrombosis', 'Vitamin K', 'Warfarin', 'acarboxy prothrombin', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'carboxylate', 'clinically significant', 'community based participatory research', 'community consultation', 'cost', 'drug response prediction', 'genetic variant', 'improved', 'individual response', 'neglect', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'personalized medicine', 'pharmacogenetic testing', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'racial minority', 'response', 'rural Americans', 'socioeconomics', 'specific biomarkers', 'success']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,P01,2018,297702,-0.008636263612839265
"Joint patterns of multi-genetic/epigenetic factors via non-parametric clustering and their association with allergic disease Ray PA-16-162 Project Summary Eczema is a chronic skin inflammatory disease infecting 10-30% of children and 2-10% of adults and increasing. Researchers have struggled to understand the genetic and environmental factors that appear to play a role in eczema's increasing prevalence. The majority of current studies focus on one or two specific types of Genome-wide data in association with eczema such as SNPS, DNA methylation levels, or gene expression levels. Current statistical methods have forced this limitation as none exist, to our knowledge that allow clustering of subjects across multi-dimensional and multi-faceted variables. Therefore, in this project we aim to introduce a novel clustering approach that will cluster subjects across genes which contain SNP information, DNA methylation levels, and gene expression levels. Summarized clusters will then tested for associated risk of eczema or any allergic disease. Genetic patterns associated with eczema will then be further explored to better identify the behavior genetic data and it's uniqueness. The method will be built in R Gui as a free downloadable package making it accessible and easy to use. We will apply the proposed method to the third generation Isle of Wight cohort data. The third generation cohort data consist of children born (2010-current time) from the original cohort of children born between 1989 and 1990 on the Isle of Wight in the UK and contains Genome-wide datasets, disease and exposure status, and allergy information across multiple follow-ups. The implications of this study not only impact the statistical field with a new clustering approach but the eczema and allergy field as well as no other studies have been able to analyze three Genome-wide datasets in concert associated with the risk of allergic diseases. Ray PA-16-162 Project Narrative The prevalence of eczema is increasing world-wide and infecting between 10-30% of children. The complete underlying cause of eczema is unknown but thought to be mixture of genetic and environmental factors. This project aims to incorporate genetic and epigenetic data in concert using a novel statistical approach in hopes of identifying patterns associated with eczema risk, allowing researchers to better understand the biological mechanisms.",Joint patterns of multi-genetic/epigenetic factors via non-parametric clustering and their association with allergic disease,9456064,R03AI128227,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Allergic Disease', 'Behavioral Genetics', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Birth', 'Blood specimen', 'Categories', 'Child', 'Chronic', 'Complex', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Eczema', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Health', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Location', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Prevalence', 'Public Health', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Skin', 'Statistical Methods', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Umbilical Cord Blood', 'Work', 'base', 'chronic inflammatory skin', 'cohort', 'flexibility', 'genetic variant', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'infancy', 'novel', 'screening', 'unsupervised learning', 'user-friendly', 'vector']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF MEMPHIS,R03,2018,69617,-0.04710510467245417
"Quantitative microscopy-based rapid phenotyping and screening ﻿    DESCRIPTION:  Synapses are most fundamental to the function of a nervous system. C. elegans is an excellent genetic model system for finding genes and elucidating pathways because of its sequenced genome and the abundance of molecular biology tools and mutants. Due to the simplicity of its nervous system, many breakthroughs have been made in C. elegans for understanding molecular mechanisms in the patterning of the nervous system and synapse development. The current bottlenecks are in the manual and non-quantitative techniques such as visual screens, limiting both the throughput of the experiments and the phenotypes one can examine. Our long-term objective is to develop technologies and to understand how genes, age, and the environment together define and continue to remodel the nervous system of an organism. In the last funding period, we have made large progress in hardware system design (including microtechnologies and automation technologies) and software for quantitative characterization of phenotypes. The objective of this continuation project is to further engineer superior micro devices for large-scale live imaging and quantitative imaging technologies, and combine with the power of genetic and genomic approaches to study synapse development in this in vivo system; genes and pathways emerging from this study could potentially become targets of therapeutics in neurological disorders.  We have shown in the previous phase of the project that quantitative microscopy-based approaches can indeed enable identification of novel genes and pathways that conventional approaches cannot. In the continuation phase, we will further optimize on-chip rapid and high-content in vivo imaging techniques, and in parallel further develop algorithms and quantitative measures for the analysis of such high-content data; we will screen based on novel synthetic phenotype unobservable by eye; we will also exploit powerful genomic techniques to identify loci and potential multigenic interactions that shape the synapse morphology. These experimental approaches will identify genes that cannot have been identified otherwise because of the difficulties associated with the phenotypical profiling, but addressed using our engineered techniques here. The approach is innovative because the technology developed here dramatically increases the throughput, sensitivity, and accuracy of the experiments, and truly enables the utility of extremely powerful genetic and genomic methods. The proposed research is significant because it fills the urgent need in high-throughput and high-content screens as well as identifying novel genes and pathways. In addition, besides the contribution to the specific neurobiology, the technologies are widely applicable to areas such as developmental cell biology, and to other small organisms such as fly larvae and zebrafish embryos. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:   Synapse development is an important and active area of research linking genes and environments to the formation and maintenance of synapses in the nervous system. It has direct implications in many human diseases developmental and psychiatric diseases such as Autism Spectrum Disorder and Schizophrenia.",Quantitative microscopy-based rapid phenotyping and screening,9502988,R01GM088333,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Automation', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Developmental Cell Biology', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Drosophila genus', 'Embryo', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Eye', 'Fill-It', 'Fluorescence', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Models', 'Genetic Research', 'Genetic Screening', 'Genome', 'Genomic approach', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Inbreeding', 'Larva', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Maintenance', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Microfluidics', 'Microscopy', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Morphology', 'Nematoda', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Organism', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Phylogeny', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Quantitative Microscopy', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Regulatory Pathway', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Schizophrenia', 'Shapes', 'Speed', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Work', 'Zebrafish', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'design', 'developmental disease', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'fly', 'forward genetics', 'genetic approach', 'high dimensionality', 'high throughput screening', 'human disease', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in vivo imaging', 'innovation', 'mutant', 'nerve injury', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'quantitative imaging', 'screening', 'success', 'synaptogenesis', 'targeted treatment', 'technology development', 'tool', 'trait']",NIGMS,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2018,305174,0.0067272420513899076
"Tracing the evolution of the human mutation rate ﻿DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): All genetic variation is created by mutations, changes that arise due to DNA damage or copying mistakes during DNA replication. Mutations are frequent enough that, on average, a child's 3-billion base pair genome contains 74 new genetic variants that are not present in the genome of either parent. Such new mutations confer a higher disease risk than older mutations because they have not passed the test of surviving through several generations of parents and offspring. We aim to pinpoint how the human mutation rate has evolved as humans left Africa and adapted to diverse new environments across the globe.  One specific aim will follow up on my preliminary research which showed that Europeans experienced a mutation rate change after diverging from Africans and Asians. The primary evidence for this change is that European genomes have a higher burden than African or Asian genomes of the mutation type TCC→TTC, where the trinucleotide ""TCC"" has experienced a mutation from ""C"" to ""T"" at its central site. We wish to and the genetic basis of this mutation rate change by looking at rare variants in mixed- ancestry Latino and African-American individuals. Specially, we will isolate young genetic variants that probably arose via mutation within the past 10-15 generations, after gene ow from Europe into the Americas had already begun. We will infer the genetic background (European, African, or Native American) upon which each new mutation arose and look for genomic regions where European ances- try correlates strongly with an excess of TCC→TTC mutations. These will be the regions most likely to harbor a causal allele that changed the process of mutation accumulation in Europeans. This work has the potential to yield valuable insights into melanoma, a cancer that predominantly affects individuals of European ancestry and whose somatic mutational signature is dominated by TCC→TTC.  A second specific aim is to look for other signatures of mutation rate change that have occurred within the human species or, more broadly, within the great apes. We will use a natural language processing technique called Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to identify collections of mutation types whose rates appear to be under common genetic control. A few mutation types besides TCC→TTC show weak signals of rate differentiation between populations, and we will attempt to infer how many separate mutation rate change events are necessary to explain these signals. The admixture mapping technique from Specific Aim I can also be adapted to interrogate the genetic basis of other mutation rate changes that might have occurred in the recent past. These efforts should improve our understanding of the human mutation rate's genetic architecture and how mutation rates differ between populations.

"Predicting Impact of Genetic Variation on Splicing ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The genetic code not only determines protein amino acid residue sequence but also defines the 'splicing code' of cis- and trans-acting regulatory elements that control pre-mRNA splicing. Single nucleotide variant (SNV) changes at key regions in pre-mRNA may disrupt splicing resulting in disease [1, 2]. Understanding which SNVs cause aberrant splicing and which are benign is important for understanding disease pathogenesis. SNVs at consensus splice sites, at exon-intron junctions, are known to cause aberrant splicing and contribute to at least 10% of inherited diseases [2]. However, SNVs outside consensus splice sites can still disrupt splicing [3]. Current, bioinformatics tools limit analysis to SNVs at or near consensus splice sites and lack the ability to generalize to SNVs beyond the consensus splice site [4-7]. In this application, I propose to substantially improve the ability to interpret the consequences of mutations on pre-mRNA splicing. This goal will be achieved by: 1) developing novel features, useful in predicting the impact of variation on cis- splicing regulation; 2) training a supervised machine learning algorithm that uses the novel features to predict the impact of SNVs; 3) sharing the algorithm in a publically available software package; and 4) comparing algorithm predictions to the relationships between SNVs and splicing patterns derived from matched DNA- and RNA-sequencing studies.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Genetic sequences not only encode the amino acids of proteins but also regulate many critical biological functions, including pre-mRNA splicing. The impact of genetic variation on splicing is not well understood. The goal of this research project i to computationally identify features of variants useful in predicting aberrant splicing, then incorporate the features into a machine learning algorithm and test the utility of the predictions using publically available sequencing studies. 1            ",Predicting Impact of Genetic Variation on Splicing,9213314,F31HG007804,"['Algorithms', 'Amino Acids', 'Benign', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Cell physiology', 'Characteristics', 'Code', 'Comparative Study', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consensus', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Exons', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Code', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Inherited', 'Introns', 'Label', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Mutation', 'Nucleotides', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Proteins', 'RNA Splicing', 'Regulation', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research Project Grants', 'Role', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Variant', 'base', 'improved', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'mRNA Precursor', 'novel', 'prediction algorithm', 'public health relevance', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NHGRI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,F31,2017,17892,-0.01439924193133622
"Integrating Neuroimaging, Multi-omics, and Clinical Data in Complex Disease ABSTRACT Rapid progress in biomedical informatics has generated massive high-dimensional data sets (“big data”), ranging from clinical information and medical imaging to genomic sequence data. The scale and complexity of these data sets hold great promise, yet present substantial challenges. To fully exploit the potential informativeness of big data, there is an urgent need to find effective ways to integrate diverse data from different levels of informatics technologies. Existing approaches and methods for data integration to date have several important limitations. In this project, we propose novel statistical methods and strategies to integrate neuroimaging, multi-omics, and clinical/behavioral data sets. To increase power for association analysis compared to existing methods, we propose a novel multi-phenotype multi-variant association method that can evaluate the cumulative effect of common and rare variants in genes or regions of interest, incorporate prior biological knowledge on the multiple phenotype structure, identify associated phenotypes among multiple phenotypes, and be computationally efficient for high-dimensional phenotypes. To improve the prediction of clinical outcomes, we propose a novel machine learning strategy that can integrate multimodal neuroimaging and multi-omics data into a mathematical model and can incorporate prior biological knowledge to identify genomic interactions associated with clinical outcomes. The ongoing Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and Indiana Memory and Aging Study (IMAS) projects as a test bed provide a unique opportunity to evaluate/validate the proposed methods. Specific Aims: Aim 1: to develop powerful statistical methods for multivariate tests of associations between multiple phenotypes and a single genetic variant or set of variants (common and rare) in regions of interest, and to develop methods for mediation analysis to integrate neuroimaging, genetic, and clinical data to test for direct and indirect genetic effects mediated through neuroimaging phenotypes on clinical outcomes; Aim 2: to develop a novel multivariate model that combines multi-omics and neuroimaging data using a machine learning strategy to predict individuals with disease or those at high-risk for developing disease, and to develop a novel multivariate model incorporating prior biological knowledge to identify genomic interactions associated with clinical outcomes; Aim 3: to evaluate and validate the proposed methods using real data from the ADNI and IMAS cohorts; and Aim 4: to disseminate and support publicly available user-friendly software that efficiently implements the proposed methods. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH: Alzheimer's disease (AD) as an exemplar is an increasingly common progressive neurodegenerative condition with no validated disease modifying treatment. The proposed multivariate methods are likely to help identify novel diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for AD. Identifying new susceptibility loci/biomarkers for AD has important implications for gaining greater insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying AD. NARRATIVE In this project, we propose novel statistical methods and strategies to integrate high-dimensional neuroimaging, multi-omics, and clinical/behavioral data sets, which aim to increase detection power for association analysis and improve the prediction of clinical outcomes. The development of an advanced integrative analysis platform will provide more comprehensive and integrated approaches to answering complex biological questions. The proposed multivariate analysis methods have a high potential impact on and important implications for gaining greater insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying complex diseases, as well as helping the development of earlier diagnostic tests and novel therapeutic targets.","Integrating Neuroimaging, Multi-omics, and Clinical Data in Complex Disease",9287487,R01LM012535,"['Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Beds', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Evaluation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Indiana', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Medical Imaging', 'Memory', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Outcome', 'Phenotype', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Science', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'cohort', 'data integration', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'disease classification', 'endophenotype', 'epigenomics', 'genetic association', 'genetic variant', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'mathematical model', 'metabolomics', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'predict clinical outcome', 'rare variant', 'risk variant', 'therapeutic target', 'transcriptomics', 'user friendly software']",NLM,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,R01,2017,367055,-0.03741748555384108
"Center for Multi- and Trans-ethnic Mapping of Mendelian and Complex Diseases ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The NHGRI Genome Sequencing Program (GSP) will identify genomic variants relevant to health and disease by genome sequencing over 225,000 participants across a multitude of diseases. The GSP will also serve as a pilot for the Precision Medicine Initiative that aims to enroll and sequence more than a million people representative of U.S. ethnic diversity. Here, we propose a GSP analysis center focused on Multi- and Trans- ethnic Mapping of Mendelian and Complex Diseases. There is a growing recognition of the substantial scientific advantages, as well as public health importance, of conducting biomedical research across ethnically diverse cohorts. We propose to develop scalable methods that incorporate ancestry to optimize medical genomic study design and improve power for uncovering the role of common and rare variants in disease. Achieving this goal requires expertise across diverse domains of knowledge including: medical and population genomics, algorithm development for complex disease mapping, and expertise in management of large-scale databases. Here, we have assembled a world-class team of medical and population geneticists, computer scientists, statisticians and clinicians, with leading expertise in the development of novel and scalable strategies for characterizing sequence variants and their role in disease. Importantly, our group has been at the forefront of development of resources, study designs and methods to enable genomic research in U.S. minority populations. Our project has three main objectives. First, we will develop an Automated Scalable Ancestry Pipeline (ASAP) for common disease mapping in diverse populations. ASAP will improve the computational efficiency of existing state-of-the-art methods for ancestry inference and develop important extensions to linear mixed models (LMMs) and other mapping strategies leveraging local and global ancestry. We will also develop methods to refine phenotypes and identify common controls for disease studies and define endpoints. Secondly, we will develop tools and resources for trans- and multi-population rare variant discovery that incorporate patterns of local and sub-continental ancestry. We will also develop machine-learning tools for variant annotation that leverage ancestral information, patterns of sequence evolution, and protein structure in a unified framework. Furthermore, we will incorporate population-specific patterns of cellular phenotypes to improve functional prediction algorithms for non-coding and coding variants. Lastly, we will disseminate our results through web-based resource that empower the biomedical research community. We will augment existing resources including ClinGen by annotating and characterizing pathogenic variants across diverse populations. We will develop a secure web-server that allows sharing of summary statistics and analysis pipelines to enable discovery, fine-mapping and functional prediction of genetic variants. Our team has ample experience with NIH-funded consortia and is dedicated to meeting the overall GSP project goals through collaborative work with NHGRI leadership and other funded investigators. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE The goal of our project is to accelerate the discovery of DNA variation relevant to health and disease by analyzing data from over 225,000 ethnically and racially diverse patients that will undergo genome sequencing. Of particular importance is ensuring we have powerful statistical methods for analyzing data from underserved groups including U.S. minority populations.

"UNDERSTANDING THE FUNCTIONAL IMPACTS OF GENETIC VARIANTS IN MENTAL DISORDERS ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the US, 46% are afflicted with a mental illness at some point of life. The management and treatment of mental disorders pose significant economical and social burden to the society. Many rare and common genetic variants, including SNPs and CNVs, are reported to be associated with mental disorders, yet more remain to be discovered. However, despite the large amount of high-throughput genomics data, there is a lack of integrative methods to systematically prioritize variants that confer susceptibility to mental disorders; additionally, despite the presence of many candidate variants for mental disorders, their disease-contributory mechanism remains elusive, so appropriate functional follow-up experiments cannot be designed. Altogether, these problems resulted in a large gap between the copious amount of data about genetic variation and our understanding of their functional impacts on mental diseases, which ultimately delays the development of targeted therapeutic approaches. To address these problems, we propose to develop a suite of novel bioinformatics approaches: (1) NeuroComplex, an information integration approach that leverages phenotype information and multiple sources of prior biological knowledge to rank genes by their likelihood of contributing to specific phenotypic presentations. (2) integrated MEntal-disorder GEnome Score (iMEGES), which leverages a two-layer strategy to predict the impacts of variants in personal genomes on mental disorders. The first layer uses machine learning algorithm to build variant deleteriousness scores for coding, non-coding and structural variants; the second layer integrates variant scores and NeuroComplex to assign pathogenicity scores. (3) a hierarchical model called CombOmics that incorporates cross-omics information to characterizes how variants confers disease risk, in order to help formulate hypothesis of pathogenicity and facilitate the design of functional follow-up experiments. (4) we will develop user-friendly software tools and web applications that implement all the aforementioned bioinformatics approaches, and continuously release and maintain these tools to ensure the maximum benefits to the scientific community.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We will develop novel informatics approaches to understand how genetic variation impacts various mental disorders, such as schizophrenia and autism. These tools help clarify the genetic cause of mental diseases, characterize individual disease risks and develop individualized treatment strategies.            ",UNDERSTANDING THE FUNCTIONAL IMPACTS OF GENETIC VARIANTS IN MENTAL DISORDERS,9389287,R01MH108728,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Benchmarking', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Ensure', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Family', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Proteins', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Annotation', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patient Selection', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Predisposition', 'Procedures', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychiatry', 'Reporting', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Societies', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Uncertainty', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'cohort', 'design', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder risk', 'experimental study', 'follow-up', 'genetic information', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic data', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'knowledge integration', 'novel', 'personalized therapeutic', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'skills', 'social', 'success', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'user friendly software', 'user-friendly', 'web app']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2017,381539,-0.002004316109607414
"Decrypting Variants of Uncertain Significance in Long-QT Syndrome DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Clinical genetic testing has become standard-of-care for many diseases including hundreds of inherited conditions. However, interpreting genetic test results is often confounded by the discovery of 'variants of unknown significance' (VUS) for which there is insufficient data or inadequate predictive tools to establish whether or not a particular variant predisposes to a disease. This problem is particularly vexing for genetic disorders with strong allelic heterogeneity and a preponderance of 'private' mutations such as the congenital long-QT syndrome (LQTS), which predisposes young adults and children to sudden death from cardiac arrhythmias. With the anticipated incorporation of personal exome or genome data into routine clinical care, interpreting VUS will become an even greater challenge especially when variants in genes associated with human disorders are incidentally discovered. Unfortunately, there are no reliable methods to predict a priori whether a given variant predisposes an individual to a particular disorder or whether the change is merely a benign rare variant. We propose to develop a novel paradigm for distinguishing disease-causing mutations from benign variants in LQTS as a model for other inherited arrhythmia syndromes and channelopathies. We will focus on variants in KCNQ1, the most commonly mutated gene in LQTS. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that a holistic predictive model that relates experimentally determined protein structure and dynamics to function and disease is highly accurate even for novel variants. Our ultimate objectives are to develop a data-trained, web-accessible algorithm that classifies VUS discovered in KCNQ1 based on reliable predictions of the structure and dynamics of the affected protein, and to achieve prediction accuracy to levels needed to inform medical decisions. The medical importance of correctly classifying KCNQ1 variants provides strong justification for having a dedicated and highly-tailored gene-specific prediction model. The ability to distinguish deleterious from neutral variants would help avoid unnecessary and potentially harmful interventions in carriers of benign alleles, and save the lives of those with true mutations. We propose to collect extensive electrophysiological, biochemical and structural data on a large set of KCNQ1 variants discovered in LQTS subjects as well as several suspected benign or neutral variants (Aims 1-2), then use these data to iteratively train and validate a machine learning based algorithm that can differentiate benign from deleterious KCNQ1 alleles among a set of new VUS (Aim 3). Our proposal is innovative in the use of a multidisciplinary approach to functionally and structurally annotate genomic variant data for a medically important gene at an unprecedented scale, and then to use these experimental findings to train/test a novel computational system to achieve clinical-grade predictions. Targeting KCNQ1 will also validate an approach for parallel work that can be utilized to predict the medical significance of variants in closely related potassium channels associated with heritable epilepsy (KCNQ2, KCNQ3) or deafness (KCNQ4). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this project is to develop a method to reliably predict the consequences of genetic variants of unknown significance discovered in the course of genetic testing in the congenital long-QT syndrome (LQTS), a cause of sudden cardiac death in children and young adults. We propose a multidisciplinary experimental approach including electrophysiology, biochemistry and structural biology deployed on a large scale to generate information on at least 110 genetic variants in the main gene responsible for LQTS (KCNQ1), which encodes a potassium channel required for normal electrical activity in the heart. Our final product will be a data-trained computational strategy that will outperform existing methods for accurately predicting the functional consequences of novel KCNQ1 genetic variants, enhance the value of genetic testing in LQTS and provide for more informed medical decisions.",Decrypting Variants of Uncertain Significance in Long-QT Syndrome,9313321,R01HL122010,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Anti-Arrhythmia Agents', 'Arrhythmia', 'Benign', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological', 'Cardiac', 'Cell surface', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Computer Simulation', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Defibrillators', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Epilepsy', 'First Degree Relative', 'Genes', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Intervention', 'Ion Channel', 'Link', 'Long QT Syndrome', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Genetics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Online Systems', 'Other Genetics', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Potassium Channel', 'Predisposition', 'Privatization', 'Protein Dynamics', 'Proteins', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Structure', 'Sudden Death', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical care', 'cost', 'deafness', 'design', 'disease-causing mutation', 'exome', 'experimental study', 'genetic variant', 'heart rhythm', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'knowledge base', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'proband', 'protein function', 'protein structure', 'protein transport', 'public health relevance', 'rare variant', 'standard of care', 'structural biology', 'sudden cardiac death', 'trafficking', 'variant of unknown significance', 'web-accessible', 'young adult']",NHLBI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2017,1280593,0.006432595804218744
"An Integrative Analysis of Structural Variation for the 1000 Genomes Project DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Structural variation (SV), involving deletions, duplications, insertions and inversions of DNA segments, accounts for a large proportion of human genetic diversity. Comprehensive identification and analysis of these genetic variants will help us more fully elucidate the biology of their functional effects on human health and demography. Despite recent advances, the tools and data needed to comprehensively identify all types of SVs, genotype each variant, integrate and phase these variants remain lacking. Indeed, the data released from the early phases of the 1000 Genomes Project (1000GP) (1000 Genomes Project Consortium, 2010; 1000 Genomes Project Consortium, 2012) are biased primarily towards the detection of deletions within relatively unique regions of the genome. As a consortium, we propose to pool expertise from various research groups to provide an integrative analysis of SVs by combining rigorous computational algorithmic development with extensive experimental validation. The new algorithms we develop and the high confidence lists of SVs obtained will be rapidly made available as a public resource. n/a",An Integrative Analysis of Structural Variation for the 1000 Genomes Project,9528959,U41HG007497,"['Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Benchmarking', 'Biology', 'Chromosomes', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Consensus', 'DNA', 'DNA Insertion Elements', 'Data', 'Demography', 'Development', 'Future', 'Gene Conversion', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Haplotypes', 'Health', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nucleotides', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Process', 'Repetitive Sequence', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Statistical Models', 'Technology', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'deletion detection', 'design', 'experimental study', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic variant', 'improved', 'integration site', 'method development', 'novel', 'tool']",NHGRI,JACKSON LABORATORY,U41,2017,1986604,0.012219207735488265
"Approaches to Genetic Heterogeneity of Obstructive Sleep Apnea ABSTRACT  Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is recognized as an extremely common disorder that results in excessive daytime sleepiness and an increased risk of automobile crashes. It is also an independent risk factor for insulin resistance, hypertension, cardiovascular events, increased cancer rates and cancer mortality, and accelerates the progression of neurodegenerative disorders. OSA is a systemic disorder and the cyclical intermittent hypoxia that occurs during sleep affects every organ system. OSA is heritable, with first degree relatives of individuals with OSA having a two-fold increased risk of the disorder. Although this has been known for over two decades, there are very limited data on gene variants conferring risk or protection for OSA. This is likely the result of underpowered studies and GENETIC HETEROGENEITY. There are multiple pathways to OSA. Obesity is a major risk factor, as are craniofacial dimensions. The relative risk of these different risk factors varies by ethnic group. There are also neuronal mechanisms and other physiological risk factors. This proposal seeks to directly address the issue of genetic heterogeneity using a very large sample of patients and state-of- the-art analysis techniques. Towards this end, we have assembled by far the largest sample of well characterized and genotyped patients with OSA. This is the result of collaboration with key sites in the eMERGE Network [Geisinger, Vanderbilt, Mayo Clinic, Northwestern], Kaiser Permanente Southern California, and the University of Pennsylvania. We propose to carry out a robust genome-wide association studies (GWAS) using an electronic health record (EHR) derived case definition and quantitative trait analysis of OSA severity. We will use novel machine learning approaches to specifically address genetic heterogeneity. The GWAS approach will be complimented by a PheWAS strategy as another approach to identifying common variants and related clinical phenotypes. Specifically, we will look for variants that associate with OSA and other clinical diagnoses in the EHR. It is likely that gene variants for OSA will have pleiotropic effects. Gene variants identified from GWAS and/or PheWAS will be further assessed. First, we will use available whole exome sequencing data to see if there are relevant rare variants in these genes, as well as to perform exploratory discovery analyses to look for novel rare variation. The functional role of the genes identified will be studied by functional network analysis. Finally, we will assess associations with quantitative data on intermediate traits identified by high throughput craniofacial and intra-oral photography. These data are currently available within the Sleep Apnea Global Interdisciplinary Consortium (SAGIC). Future directions will assess the function of the genes identified in model systems and the clinical utility of utilizing variants as part of risk stratification for OSA. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common disorder with multiple adverse consequences. It is known that OSA has a genetic basis, but to date no convincing gene variants have been identified. This study uses state of the art approaches to identifying relevant genes based on a very large sample of patients with OSA obtained from multiple institutions in the United States. It is by far the largest study ever proposed for identifying genes for this common sleep disorder.",Approaches to Genetic Heterogeneity of Obstructive Sleep Apnea,9331729,R01HL134015,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Automobiles', 'Biological Models', 'Bladder', 'California', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ethnic group', 'Event', 'Excessive Daytime Sleepiness', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'First Degree Relative', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hypertension', 'Hypoxia', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Nature', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Obesity', 'Obstructive Sleep Apnea', 'Participant', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Periodicity', 'Phenotype', 'Photography', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Relative Risks', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Apnea Syndromes', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Thinness', 'Tissues', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Vehicle crash', 'Woman', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'body system', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'case control', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical phenotype', 'cohort', 'craniofacial', 'disorder risk', 'exome', 'exome sequencing', 'gene discovery', 'gene function', 'genetic association', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'genotyped patients', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'men', 'mortality', 'novel', 'phenome', 'pleiotropism', 'precision medicine', 'rare variant', 'secondary analysis', 'soft tissue', 'trait']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2017,650526,-0.058820631998501
"Fast and Robust Methods for Large Scale Genotype Phenotype Association Study ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A fundamental challenge in life sciences is the characterization of genetic factors that underlie phenotypic differences. Thanks to the advanced sequencing technologies, an enormous amount of genetic variants have been identified and cataloged. Such data hold great potential to understand how genes affect phenotypes and contribute to the susceptibility to environmental stimulus. However, the existing computational methods for analyzing and interpreting the high‐throughput genetic data are still in their infancy.    We propose to systematically investigate the computational and statistical principles in modeling and discovering genetic basis of complex phenotypes. The proposed research provides answers to the following fundamental questions in genetic association study: (1) How to effectively and efficiently assess statistical significance of the findings? (2) How to account for the relatedness between samples in genetic association study? (3) How to accurately capture possible interactions between multiple genetic factors and their joint contribution to phenotypic variation? In particular, we will develop data structures and efficient algorithms for accurate and robust significance assessment that account for local population structure and joint effect of multiple genetic factors.    The proposed computational tools will be integrated into software packages under common application framework adopted by the broad scientific community. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A fundamental challenge in life sciences is the characterization of genetic factors that underlie phenotypic differences.

"Statistical methods for early disease prediction and treatment strategy estimation using biomarker signatures Project Summary:  Neuropsychiatric disorders pose an immense burden on patients, families, and health care systems, thus underscoring the urgent need to develop disease-modifying treatment. Research on neuropsychiatric disorders (e.g., Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease) faces unique challenges, including the fact that these disorders typically have a late onset and slow progression, the diagnostic criteria are based on subjective clinical symptoms, and there is substantial disease and subject heterogeneity. In the proposed work, we aim to tackle these chal- lenges by leveraging complementary contributions from multiple biomarkers, including genome-wide polymor- phisms, whole brain neuroimaging, bioﬂuids, and comprehensive neuropsychiatric assessments. We develop sophisticated analytic tools with higher resolution and improved accuracy by accounting for biological mecha- nisms of disease, synthesizing dynamic system-wide information, and integrating multiple sources of biomarkers. These methods are applied to clinical data collected by the investigative team or available from large international consortia in order to model the earliest pathological changes of neurodegenerative disease, assess treatment responses, and inform the design of early-intervention clinical trials and the discovery of optimal personalized therapies. Speciﬁcally, in Aim 1, we develop efﬁcient methods for multi-level semiparametric transformation mod- els to estimate and test the risk of genetic variants on various types of complex phenotypes to inform genetic counseling and improve clinical trial efﬁciency. Our methods do not rely on full pedigree genotyping and provide family-speciﬁc substructure, in addition to population substructure, to better control confounding and reduce false discovery rates in genome-wide association studies. In Aim 2, we develop large-scale nonlinear dynamic sys- tems through ordinary differential equations with random inﬂections to understand early pathological changes and identify subjects with preclinical signs. Our method provides multi-domain integration of ensembles of biomarker dynamics. In Aim 3, we develop dynamic hazards models and incorporate dynamic network structures to estimate biomarker proﬁles that evolve smoothly with disease progression for earlier disease diagnosis. We account for irregularly measured biomarkers and biological network dependence among biomarkers. In Aim 4, we develop doubly robust and efﬁcient machine learning methods to identify predictive markers, estimate optimal individu- alized therapies, and identify subgroups who may receive the greatest beneﬁt from therapy, with minimal risk. In each aim, we will validate the proposed methods through extensive simulation studies and demonstrate their practical value via application to real-world clinical studies. We establish theoretical properties of the proposed methods using modern empirical process theory and statistical learning theory. Together, the state-of-the-art ana- lytic methods proposed here will substantially improve analytic accuracy, and our combined statistical and clinical expertise will ensure that our methods are translated directly back to the clinical and translational research com- munity. Project Narrative:  The ultimate goal of neuropsychiatric research is to develop experimental therapeutics to delay disease on- set, slow disease progression, and provide effective treatment at each stage of disease. This proposal aims to develop new statistical approaches to integrate complementary sources of information from genomic measures, brain imaging biomarkers, and early clinical signs to characterize disease mechanism, progression, and treatment responses, and thereby inform the design of clinical trials and the discovery of optimal personalized therapies.",Statistical methods for early disease prediction and treatment strategy estimation using biomarker signatures,9308279,R01NS073671,"['Accounting', 'Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Back', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Differential Equation', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Intervention', 'Ensure', 'Equilibrium', 'Event', 'Face', 'Family', 'Family health status', 'Family member', 'First Degree Relative', 'Funding', 'Genetic Counseling', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Hazard Models', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heterogeneity', 'Impact evaluation', 'Individual', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Investigational Therapies', 'Late-Onset Disorder', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Nonlinear Dynamics', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Radiation exposure', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Safety', 'Source', 'Spinal Puncture', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'dynamic system', 'effective therapy', 'genetic pedigree', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'minimal risk', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'randomized trial', 'semiparametric', 'simulation', 'theories', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'validation studies']",NINDS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2017,366940,-0.003664524133876131
"Exploring Statin Pleiotropic Effects within a Very Large EHR Cohort Statins among the most widely prescribed agents worldwide for prevention of cardiovascular diseases, produce substantial pleiotropic effects. Pleiotropic effects are unanticipated outcomes other than those for which the drug was originally developed, either therapeutic (beneficial) or detrimental (adverse drug reactions). Statin pleiotropic effects are unanticipatedly broad, including increasing the risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus and cataract, decreasing cancer-related mortality, and reducing dementia. Many effects are still not determined. In addition, individual responses to statins are highly variable. Genetics studies have identified loci that are significantly associated with statin response. However, it is unclear if either of the genetic variants within these regions is also associated with statin pleiotropic effects. We propose to investigate statin pleiotropic effects using whole de-identified electronic health records (EHRs) of >2.5 million individuals at Vanderbilt, including >110,000 statin exposure individuals. By linking this cohort to BioVU, the Vanderbilt de-identified DNA biobank, >10,000 of these statin exposure individuals have extant genome-wide genotyping. We argue that 1) previous inconclusive results are largely caused by inconsistent phenotype definitions, and 2) using the EHR to develop a novel, drug-based phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS) provides an ideal approach to discover unknown statin effects. The still-growing Vanderbilt de-identified EHRs allow large amounts of individuals' clinical data shared to support validation of known pleiotropic effects and to enable novel discoveries. Our previous work demonstrated our ability to develop consistent EHR-based phenotype definitions that can be deployed across multiple EHRs and institutions. We have expertise leveraging state-of-the-art informatics techniques, including natural language processing and ontologies, for pharmacogenetic studies, including for statins. We first described the PheWAS approach to not only replicate genetic associations but also discover novel, pleiotropic associations. Our informatics expertise combined with an ideal EHR/DNA population, will enable us to validate and discover statin pleiotropic effects. Accordingly, we propose the following three aims: 1. develop and test EHR-based phenotype algorithms for four controversial statin pleiotropic effects, 2. conduct a PheWAS to discover unknown statin pleiotropic effects, and 3. evaluate and discover genetic predictors of statin pleiotropic effects. Project Narrative Statins (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors), among the most widely prescribed agents worldwide for prevention of cardiovascular diseases, produce substantial pleiotropic effects. Statin pleiotropic effects are unanticipatedly broad and the genetic variants associated with statin pleiotropic effects remain unclear. We propose to investigate statin pleiotropic effects using whole de-identified electronic health records (EHRs) of >2 million patients at Vanderbilt (including 10,000 genotyped statin recipients) to answer these questions.",Exploring Statin Pleiotropic Effects within a Very Large EHR Cohort,9309793,R01HL133786,"['Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Breast', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cataract', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cohort Analysis', 'Colorectal', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiologist', 'Exposure to', 'General Population', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genetic study', 'Genotype', 'Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Link', 'Lung', 'Lymphoma', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Oxidoreductase', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Prostate', 'Qi', 'Reaction', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'TCF7L2 gene', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Work', 'base', 'biobank', 'cancer risk', 'cardiovascular disorder prevention', 'cohort', 'data sharing', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic association', 'genetic predictors', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'glutaryl coA', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'phenome', 'pleiotropism', 'response']",NHLBI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2017,406123,-0.016459168069406817
"Whole Genome Sequencing in Irish Multiplex Schizophrenia Families Project Summary: Although affected members of multiplex schizophrenia pedigrees have substantially elevated recurrence risk compared to singleton cases, the mean polygenic risk scores between these groups do not differ, suggesting that one source of this higher familial recurrence risk is rare, higher impact variation. We will collect whole genome sequence (WGS) from 600 affected members of multiplex schizophrenia pedigrees to identify rare variation shared by affected individuals within and between pedigrees potentially accounting for the increased recurrence risk, and reducing the `variant space' under consideration. After QC and calling in our existing pipeline, a) familial sequence variants in the exome will be directly analyzed in 2000 Irish cases and 2000 Irish controls with 30X exome sequence data in production currently, and b) variants outside the exome will be imputed into 3600 Irish singleton schizophrenia or bipolar disorder cases and 3000 Irish population controls with GWAS framework data; 3781 additional UK10K controls with 10X WGS are available to increase analysis power. This imputed dataset will be analyzed using recently developed methods for kernel-based tests of variation aggregated over a defined interval (such as a gene) that avoid the inflation of type-1 error. We use multiple sources of genomic information to develop weights for each position in the genome (indexing the prior probability that a change at the site has functional consequence) and each variant detected (indexing the probability that observed changes have functional consequence), and we propose to improve the existing genomic information sources for this weighting in a number of ways. In aim 3, prioritized variants from aim 2a/2b will be directly genotyped in the case/control samples by custom microarray; individual genes or genesets showing enrichment of variation in cases (if any are observed) will be resequenced in the case/control sample. In Aim 4, the directly assessed genotypic and sequence data from aim 3 will be analyzed using standard methods to identify individual associated variants, and variant-enriched genes, genesets or other functional sequences. We seek to unambiguously identify 1) individual variants that are significantly more common in cases, or 2) individual genes or other functional sequences or 3) gene- or functional sequence sets enriched for variation in cases to provide critical information about the brain systems perturbed in schizophrenia, and the mechanisms by which such alleles increase risk. Project Narrative Rare sequence variation has been implicated in many human complex traits, incuding schizophrenia, and has been studied in unrelated cases and controls and parent:offspring trios, but remains unstudied in multiplex families. Sequencing the genomes of such families will allow conprehensive identification of variation in protein coding genes, non-coding expressed loci, regulatory sequences, and evolutionarily conserved regions, as well as detection of structural variation, and testing these alleles in a large case/control series of the same ethnic and geographic origin offers significant advantages over prior study designs, and has the potential to identify individual alleles, variant enriched genes, variant enriched non-genic sequences, and/or variant enriched genesets contributing to SCH risk in the Irish population. Such variants offer great potential for understanding the functional impact of risk alleles and improving mechanistic understanding of schizophrenia and related disorders.",Whole Genome Sequencing in Irish Multiplex Schizophrenia Families,9403711,R01MH114593,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'Alleles', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Economic Inflation', 'Face', 'Family', 'Genes', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Ireland', 'LGALS3BP gene', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Nucleotides', 'Parents', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Population Control', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Principal Investigator', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Recurrence', 'Research Design', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Source', 'System', 'Testing', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'base', 'case control', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'exome', 'genetic pedigree', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'indexing', 'member', 'offspring', 'power analysis', 'programs', 'risk variant', 'sample collection', 'trait', 'whole genome', 'working group']",NIMH,VIRGINIA COMMONWEALTH UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,464747,-0.024263109522332744
"Biomedical Computing and Informatics Strategies for Infectious Disease Research ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): An important goal of infectious disease research is to develop genetic predictors of susceptibility. Our success in this endeavor will depend critically on the informatics methods and software that are available for making sense of high-dimensional genetic and genomic data. The goal of this research program is to develop, evaluate, distribute and support new and novel biomedical computing algorithms and open-source software for identifying combinations of genetic predictors of clinically important infectious disease outcomes. This application will target the growing body of rare genetic variants identified by high-throughput DNA sequencing. Our clinical application will focus on the prediction of antiretroviral response in clinical trials for HIV/AIDS. We propose here a highly innovative Hierarchical Rare Variant Collapsing Machine (HRVCM) algorithm for identifying and collapsing combinations of rare variants across gene regions (AIM 1). We will then integrate these new collapsed HRVCM variables into our popular Multifactor Dimensionality Reduction (MDR) method that will assess them in combination with common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from genome-wide association studies or GWAS (AIM 2). Our novel HRVCM-MDR approach will, for the first time, make it possible to assess non-additive interactions among sets of rare and common variants simultaneously in genetic studies of infectious diseases. We will apply these new and novel methods to approximately 13 million rare and common variants from nearly 3000 subjects that participated in an AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) study to evaluate risk for virologic failure with efavirenz-containing antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimens (AIM 3). Finally, we will release all methods as open source to the biomedical research community through our freely available MDR software package (AIM 4). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The overall goal of this application is to develop innovative new computational methods for the genetic analysis of infectious diseases. We will focus on the development of methods that are able to detect synergistic effects of multiple genetic variants regardless of whether they are rare of common in human populations.

"NHGRI PAGE Coordinating Center DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): NHGRI developed the Population Architecture Using Genomics and Epidemiology (PAGE) research program to identify and characterize genomic variants in non-European populations. To support the complexities of such an ambitious effort, we have convened a strong team of statistical, population, and molecular geneticists, computer and information scientists, biostatisticians, and project management staff with many years of related experience to serve as a Coordinating Center (CC). Specifically, the CC will serve as a centralized resource to facilitate and support the activities of the program and Study Investigators focused on characterization of causal variants by: (1) coordinating phenotype harmonization efforts, including mapping phenotype variables across studies and to the PhenX measures; (2) synthesizing individual-level data into centralized datasets to facilitate sharing of data within and outside of PAGE; (3) utilizing state-of-the-art computer and information science support and scientific workflows that will facilitate analyses, ancestry deconvolution, genotype calling and imputation, SNP annotation, and data synthesis; (4) rapidly disseminating all study data via dbGaP and/or the PAGE website or other applicable databases; and (5) serving as a centralized resource to facilitate, support, and manage program activities and logistics as requested by the Steering Committee or Project Office and as needed for successful coordination of the program. Coordination of the program will be done in a spirit of collaboration using creative and flexible approaches, while providing leadership in statistical genetic methodologies and approaches to project management. The ultimate goal of our CC is to facilitate the identification and characterization of genotype-phenotype associations, especially as relevant to non-European populations, thereby accelerating our understanding of ancestral differences in the genetic and environmental causes of common diseases. Critical to achieving this mission is the deployment of powerful methods for ancestry deconvolution, multi- and trans-ethnic mapping, and imputation. Building upon our success as the PAGE I CC, we have added additional investigators with expertise in these areas and consortium experience with next-generation sequence analysis of both whole-genome and exome data. Our collaborative team is ideally staffed to meet the challenges of the new round of PAGE.

"Regulation of mRNA splicing by intronic genetic variants ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Genetic variations in introns commonly impact cellular functions by causing alterations in mRNA splicing. The abnormal inclusion and exclusion of exons often change protein functions and cellular phenotypes. Although many intronic variations have known functions, with the adoption of next generation sequencing, many more intronic variants have been discovered for which the functional impact is unknown. Thus, it is important to be able to predict the impact of the variants without needing to test them all in expensive and laborious assays. Although there are informatics algorithms that predict the impact of genetic variants on pre-mRNA splicing, their ability to predict the effect on protein function and ultimately disease and therapeutic phenotypes is lacking. In addition, there is a need for high-throughput cellular assays to test the results of these predictions on cellular functions. The studies proposed here will fulfill these needs by developing algorithms that prioritize the intronic variants by their potential impact on splicing and gene function, and developing a high-throughput assay to functionally test thousands of these predictions. These novel technologies will be applied to the effect of intronic variants on the pharmacogenomics of two clinically important oncology drugs, clofarabine and paclitaxel. Our long-term goals are to be able to predict the functional impact of genomic variants on human disease and therapeutic response. Our central hypothesis is that intronic genetic variants alter mRNA splicing and consequently protein function that ultimately affects the cellular response to drug therapy. Our first aim will be to develop computational algorithms that prioritize intronic variants based on their impacts on pre-mRNA splicing and protein function. Using a variety of genomic and structural features and large sets of genomic data, we will develop a bioinformatics algorithm specifically designed to prioritize intronic variants based on their potential impacts on pre-mRNA splicing and protein function. Our second aim will be to identify functional intronic variants associated with drug-induced cytotoxicity. Using existing genomics and cellular cytotoxic response data from populations of human cell lines, we will identify functional intronic variants that contribute to individuals' responses to clofarabine and paclitaxel cytotoxicity. Our third aim will be to functionally test the impact of the prioritized intronic variants on pre-mRNA splicing and drug cytotoxicity. Using our novel high- throughput functional splicing assay, we will test the effects of predicted functional variants from Aim 2 on pre- mRNA splicing. In addition, we will validate the effect of the intronic variants on cytotoxicity using exon specific siRNA and CRISPR/Cas technology to manipulate the target gene splicing. Upon completion of these studies, we expect to have developed bioinformatics algorithms that can accurately prioritize the intronic variants based on their functional impact on pre-mRNA splicing and protein function. Also, we will have tested thousands of variants in a cellular pre-mRNA splicing assay and validated the impact of several of these functional variants on paclitaxel and clofarabine cytotoxicity. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Project Narrative The goal of this project is to design and implement a set of bioinformatics algorithms and high-throughput experimental assays for prioritizing functional intronic variants that contribute to phenotypic differences by affecting pre-mRNA splicing. The developed model, including a molecular validation component, will be used to systematically evaluate the functions of such variants that are associated with drug-induced cytotoxicity. The same strategy can also be used to study the etiology of complex diseases.

"Statistical Tests for Mapping Genetic Determinants of Complex Traits ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Genotyping and emerging sequencing technologies have enabled comprehensive interrogation of genetic variation across the human genome, thereby facilitating a study's ability to map genetic variants that influence phenotypes of interes. Nevertheless, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and next-generation sequencing (NGS) projects have uncovered only a limited number of trait-influencing loci. While large increases in sample size will improve power to detect such variation, the ascertainment and sequencing/genotyping of such samples are costly and inefficient. Therefore, it is desirable to increase power to detect such variants without requiring additional sample collection. We propose novel methods for improved gene mapping of common and rare susceptibility variants that move beyond standard strategies typically applied to GWAS and NGS studies of complex traits. The first topic we consider is pleiotropic or cross- phenotype effects of genetic variants. Empirical studies have suggested that pleiotropy is widespread throughout the genome and that leveraging this additional information for gene mapping yields a more powerful analysis than an analysis that ignores such information. In Aim 1, we propose novel statistical methods for genetic analysis of high-dimensional phenotype data using an innovative kernel distance-covariance (KDC) framework that allows for an arbitrary number of phenotypes both continuous and/or categorical in nature, as well as an arbitrary number of genotypes (permitting gene-based testing of both rare and common variants). We will use the KDC framework to implement tests of pleiotropy as well as tests of mediation. The second topic we consider is the mapping of rare susceptibility variants using affected pedigrees, which provide many attractive features for rare-variant testing that case-control studies lack. In Aim 2, we propose a series of powerful statistical methods for rare-variant association testing in affected pedigrees that are based on a framework (recently published in AJHG) for rare-variant association testing in affected sibships. The existing framework compares rare-variant burden in a region by an affected sib pair to the number of regions that pairs shares identical by descent. We have shown the method is more powerful than case-control association testing given fixed sample size and further is robust to population stratification. In this proposal, we will extend the framework to handle affected pedigrees of arbitrary size and structure (rather than just affected sib pairs) and devise a powerful two-stage screening and validation strategy for rare-variant mapping that first compares familial cases in the pedigrees to external controls and then follows up the most interesting findings using an independent test based on our identity-by-descent sharing statistic among the affected relatives used in the first stage. We will apply the methods in Aims 1-2 to relevant data from genetic studies of complex traits in which we are directly involved. We also will implement the methods in public user-friendly software (Aim 3). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this project is to develop a set of statistical approaches to investigate two important topics in gene- mapping studies of complex human traits. First, we will develop techniques for identifying genes that have pleiotropic effects on phenotypes of possibly high dimension and further assess whether such genes have direct effects on such phenotypes or indirect effects through other possible factors. Second, we will develop tools to facilitate identification of rare polymorphic variation that increase risk for complex disease using data from affected pedigrees of arbitrary size and structure. We will evaluate these methods using simulated data and illustrate their value by applying them to genetic projects of complex traits in which we are actively involved. Application of the proposed methods to these datasets should improve our understanding of the genetic origins of various complex traits.",Statistical Tests for Mapping Genetic Determinants of Complex Traits,9207474,R01GM117946,"['Affect', 'Applied Genetics', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Categories', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Family', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genetic study', 'Genets', 'Genome', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mediation', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Nature', 'Phenotype', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Siblings', 'Signal Transduction', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'case control', 'cost', 'design', 'flexibility', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic association', 'genetic pedigree', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genome-wide analysis', 'high dimensionality', 'human disease', 'identity by descent', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'phenotypic data', 'pleiotropism', 'population stratification', 'public health relevance', 'rare variant', 'risk variant', 'sample collection', 'screening', 'tool', 'trait', 'user friendly software']",NIGMS,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,297842,-0.03120673911339873
"Genomics-based prediction of antibiotic failure in S. aureus infections ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    The Gram positive bacterium Staphylococcus aureus is both an asymptomatic human colonizer and a pathogen that can cause infections in multiple tissue sites, including blood, skin and soft tissue, bone, and internal organs. Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a common cause of death by hospital infections (HA-MRSA) and is now also a common community acquired infection (CA-MRSA). Vancomycin (a glycopeptide antibiotic) is the most commonly prescribed drug to treat MRSA infections. High-level resistance (minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) ≥16 μg/ml) to vancomycin encoded by the mobile vanA gene is rare due to a fitness burden on S. aureus. However, it is more common to encounter strains with mutations conferring intermediate resistance to vancomycin arising from selection during the course of antibiotic therapy. The genetic basis of these vancomycin intermediate S. aureus (VISA) and heterogeneous resistant (hVISA) (MIC 2-8 μg/ml) strains involves a large number of different genomic mutations that result in cell wall thickening through changes in cellular signaling and regulation. Routine phenotypic testing in clinical labs probably underestimates the incidence of VISA and hVISA. Due to the fact that mutations in several genes have been linked with VISA, genetic-based detection of intermediate vancomycin resistance has not been developed for routine clinical microbiological use. In our preliminary work, we created an extensive catalog of sequenced clinical and laboratory-selected VISA as well as databases of SNPs and genetic variation in thousands of public S. aureus genomes. In this work we plan to extend these studies toward development of a sequence-based testing protocol that could be used for large numbers of clinical strains. In Specific Aim 1 we plan to extend our knowledge of the mutations that cause VISA by sequencing a panel of 300 novel mutants strains spontaneously selected from 40 S. aureus parent genotypes. We estimate, based on the results of the preliminary data, that this number of strains will be sufficient identify mutations found in 95% of VISA strains. These data will be used for creation of a comprehensive VISA detection assay based on whole genome data with an accuracy of at least 95%. In Specific Aim 2 we will use the information learned from Aim 1 to create a multiplex PCR sequence test for VISA, VRSA and other resistance determinants of S. aureus based on the commercially available Fluidigm platform. We will ultimately aim to have an assay that can be used to monitor systemic MRSA infections, such as bacteremia, to detect development of VISA in its early stages in clinical specimens from the patient. The test will also be able to detect other S. aureus resistance phenotypes and call the genotype of the strain. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Vancomycin is an antibiotic commonly used to treat methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections in chronically ill patients. The efficacy of this relatively cheap and well-tolerated therapy is compromised by mutations in the genome of the bacterium. In this project we propose to develop a genetic test based on a library of MRSA genome sequences with known antibiotic susceptibility level that identifies bacteria with diminished resistance to vancomycin.",Genomics-based prediction of antibiotic failure in S. aureus infections,9241329,R21AI121860,"['Address', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotic susceptibility', 'Antibiotics', 'Bacteremia', 'Bacteria', 'Base Sequence', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood', 'Catalogs', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Wall', 'Chronically Ill', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Microbiology', 'Community-Acquired Infections', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Evolution', 'Failure', 'Frequencies', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Glycopeptide Antibiotics', 'Goals', 'Gram-Positive Bacteria', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Infection', 'Intermediate resistance', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Methicillin', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Mutation', 'Nosocomial Infections', 'Organ', 'Parents', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Protocols documentation', 'Regulation', 'Resistance', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Skin Tissue', 'Specimen', 'Staphylococcus aureus', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Treatment Failure', 'University Hospitals', 'Vancomycin', 'Vancomycin Resistance', 'Vancomycin-resistant S. aureus', 'Variant', 'Virulence', 'Work', 'base', 'bone', 'design', 'economic cost', 'fitness', 'genetic predictors', 'genetic variant', 'interest', 'methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus', 'mortality', 'mutant', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'phenotypic data', 'pleiotropism', 'public health relevance', 'soft tissue', 'tool', 'whole genome']",NIAID,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R21,2017,195000,0.006126421732707873
"VENTRICLES, CORPUS CALLOSUM, SYMPTOMS & MIR137 IN LARGE N STUDY OF SCHIZOPHRENIA This R21 application proposes to use a large cohort of schizophrenia and healthy control subjects (2415 subjects) from the GENUS Consortium to clarify morphometric and genetic aspects of the corpus callosum (CC) and the lateral ventricles (LV) in schizophrenia (SZ). Our preliminary data indicate that LV and CC volume abnormalities are correlated in SZ, and index global functioning. Although abnormalities of LV and CC are hallmark of SZ and appear together in neurodevelopmental syndromes, LV and CC have rarely been studied together in SZ. Genetically, LV and CC are highly correlated, nonetheless the specific genetic determinants of this relationship are currently unknown. Recently, the SZ associated genetic risk variant miR137 has been shown to associate with LV and whole brain diffusion abnormalities in SZ where the two measures correlate. MiR137 has also been associated with poor cognitive and high negative symptoms load SZ, characterized by poor global functioning. By employing the unprecedented power of the GENUS cohort we will be able to clarify what appears to be a convergence of neuroimaging, symptomatology, cognitive measures and genetics information of LV and CC, and their relationship in one single large population of SZ and HC. This study is expected to provide novel data on the junction between morphometric measures of the corpus callosum and the lateral ventricles, their genetic background and their relation with symptoms and cognition in SZ and to identify subgroups of SZ based on these variables. The long term ramification of this proposal is the identification of novel therapeutic targets, based on miR137. T herapeutics based on miRNA, like miR137, are already been used in phase I cancer clinical trials, a disease that like SZ is polygenic. Finally, our study will reveal new information on the genetics of SZ and its relationship to symptomatology and brain variables. The lateral ventricles and corpus callosum are genetically correlated, and are often abnormal in schizophrenia, nonetheless, the genetic determinants of their relationship in schizophrenia remains unknown. Accordingly, we will employ the largest known population of schizophrenia and healthy subjects available, which includes morphometric, functional, cognitive and genetic data (2514 subjects), where we will analyze abnormalities of the lateral ventricles and the corpus callosum, and their relationship in schizophrenia. Volumetric and diffusion data will be explored for association with one of the strongest SZ associated genetic risk variant, MIR137, and with other genes, also SZ associated and themselves regulated by MIR137 and the outcome will be the identification of schizophrenia subgroups for more targeted intervention.","VENTRICLES, CORPUS CALLOSUM, SYMPTOMS & MIR137 IN LARGE N STUDY OF SCHIZOPHRENIA",9357709,R21MH109819,"['Affect', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Attention', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Caucasians', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Communication', 'Corpus Callosum', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diffusion', 'Disease', 'Fiber', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Variation', 'Height', 'Heritability', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modality', 'Neurobehavioral Manifestations', 'Neurobiology', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Proxy', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Schizophrenia', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'TCF7L2 gene', 'Techniques', 'United States', 'Variant', 'axonal degeneration', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'cancer clinical trial', 'cohort', 'disability', 'genetic association', 'genetic information', 'genome wide association study', 'indexing', 'individualized medicine', 'insight', 'lateral ventricle', 'learning strategy', 'morphometry', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroinflammation', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'risk variant', 'symptomatology', 'tractography', 'trend']",NIMH,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,R21,2017,190181,0.021157246982496443
"Genetic neuroscience: How human genes and alleles shape neuronal phenotypes Genetic studies have identified many specific loci with significant associations to psychiatric disorders. However, unless we can develop useful approaches for systematically turning genetic information into neurobiological insights about brain disorders, there is a danger that costly and hard-won genetic findings will not be exploitable to understand pathophysiology and generate important therapeutic hypotheses. The goal of our collaborative, interdisciplinary effort is to develop powerful, generalizable approaches for discovering how risk variants for psychiatric disorders shape neurobiological processes at multiple levels of analysis, and to identify the processes whose dysregulation underlies disease. To do this, we propose to develop new experimental and inferential systems to bridge a longstanding gap between human genetics and experimental biology. We aim to identify biological causes and effects that span the genetic, molecular, and cellular levels of the nervous system. Our interdisciplinary team will develop new experimental systems that measure genetic influences across levels of analysis (RNA, proteins, and cellular function including physiology) in precise, scalable, well- controlled ways. We will make use of emerging cellular systems including three-dimensional cortical spheroids and organoids, and radically novel “population in a dish” experimental systems that collect data on cells from hundreds of donors in a shared environment, inferring donor identity at the time of phenotypic readout. The analysis of such systems in turn requires sophisticated inferential strategies and new ideas from computer science. We propose to develop and widely share experimental and computational resources, including cell lines, methods, datasets, and analytic tools. The successful completion of this work will identify key neurobiological processes for multiple psychiatric disorders, and fortify many other scientists in making such connections in their own work. We hope in so doing to create a new kind of interdisciplinary science that – by combining the strengths of data-driven, unbiased human genetics with the power of emerging experimental systems – transforms the rate at which human- genetic leads lead to insights about disease mechanisms. To better understand common, severe psychiatric illnesses and develop improved treatments for them, we need to understand what specific aspects of brain biology give rise to each disorder. Here a team of scientists with diverse areas of expertise – from neuroscience to computer science to psychiatry to human genetics to stem cell biology – come together to develop a set of next-generation scientific approaches to this important problem, and to generate new methods and data sets that we will widely share. Our team will work to understand how aspects of brain biology at many levels – genes, molecules, and cells – act upon one another to create vulnerability to psychiatric illness.",Genetic neuroscience: How human genes and alleles shape neuronal phenotypes,9479556,U01MH115727,"['Affect', 'Alleles', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Awareness', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'California', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell Line', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Communities', 'Computer Analysis', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Experimental Models', 'Functional disorder', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic study', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Investments', 'Ion Channel', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Microglia', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Mutation', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Organoids', 'Penetrance', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Psychiatry', 'RNA', 'Regenerative Medicine', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Shapes', 'System', 'Technology', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'cell type', 'computer science', 'computing resources', 'cost', 'cytokine', 'excitatory neuron', 'experimental study', 'genetic information', 'high dimensionality', 'human data', 'improved', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'inhibitory neuron', 'innovation', 'insight', 'loss of function mutation', 'neurophysiology', 'next generation', 'novel', 'protein expression', 'protein function', 'rare variant', 'response', 'risk variant', 'stem cell biology', 'translational neuroscience', 'whole genome']",NIMH,"BROAD INSTITUTE, INC.",U01,2017,4412707,0.019422575516076096
"High-resolution map of human germline mutation patterns and inference of mutagenic mechanisms ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mutations are the ultimate source of genetic variation and one of the driving forces of evolution. Both the absolute mutation rate and the relative rate among mutation subtypes fluctuate along the genome, affected by adjacent nucleotide motifs and local features such as GC content and replication timing. Characterizing regional variation of mutation patterns is critical for understanding genome evolution and to identify variants causing genetic diseases. However, mutation rate and molecular spectrum are difficult to measure at high resolution, genomewide, and in an unbiased fashion. Estimates based on common variants and between- species substitutions are confounded by natural selection, population demographic history, and biased gene conversion (BGC). Methods relying on incidence rates of monogenic diseases or finding de novo variants by trio sequencing can inform global trends, but do not provide sufficient data to assess fine-scale local parameters. This study will overcome these limitations by using the extremely rare variants (ERVs) as a new data source to characterize patterns of recent germline variation in humans. ERVs, defined in this study as singletons in 30,000 samples, are becoming available via large-scale whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of population samples. Unlike common variants or substitutions, ERVs arose very recently and are largely unaffected by selection, BGC, etc. We will analyze 200-300 million singleton variants observed in 30,000 subjects at 20-30X coverage. The regional distribution of ERV subtypes will establish a quantitative atlas of the rate and spectrum of human germline mutations mostly unaltered by selection. We will share this resource with the research community and apply it to determine the impact of local genomic features and epigenomic attributes. We will use the systematic departures between ERVs and variants of higher frequencies (polymorphisms and substitutions) to infer local effects of selection, and this may uncover hitherto unknown functional regions of the genome. By comparing mutation signatures in ERVs with those in somatic variations observed in diverse cancers we will attribute distinct mutational signatures to known biochemical processes and thus infer the major contributors to new germline mutations in the human genome. This subtype-specific atlas will also be used to predict the probability of observing every possible single-base mutation in the genome, thus facilitating the interpretation of candidate causal variants of human diseases. We will assess mutation pattern differences among European Americans, African Americans and Latinos, and seek to discover genetic modifiers of germline mutation rate by finding functionally damaging mutations that show increased ERV counts in the surrounding genomic region, potentially identifying both known and previous unknown ""mutator"" genes that play a role in transmission fidelity in humans. This research will provide an essential resource to study the genesis and maintenance of germline mutations in humans. Understanding such a fundamental process will be the basis for a deeper understanding of human evolution and diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We will study the patterns of inherited mutations in humans using approximately 250 million extremely rare DNA variants in human populations. Our results will allow the prediction of the rate of new mutations at every site in the genome based on features of the surrounding DNA sequence, thus providing a common resource to study the arrival and maintenance of mutations in humans. Understanding such a basic process is important for answering fundamental questions in human evolution, the cause of inherited diseases, and the role of DNA abnormality in cancer and aging.",High-resolution map of human germline mutation patterns and inference of mutagenic mechanisms,9275505,R01GM118928,"['Address', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'American', 'Atlases', 'Biochemical Process', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Child', 'Chromatin', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Demographic Factors', 'Dependence', 'Disease', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'European', 'Evolution', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Gene Conversion', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Recombination', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Germ-Line Mutation', 'Guanine + Cytosine Composition', 'Hereditary Disease', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Human Genome', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Internet', 'Latino', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mendelian disorder', 'Methods', 'Mismatch Repair', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutation', 'Natural Selections', 'Nucleotides', 'Parents', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resource Sharing', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Selection Bias', 'Site', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Source', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Tissues', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'actionable mutation', 'base', 'data sharing', 'density', 'driving force', 'epigenomics', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genome-wide', 'human disease', 'improved', 'next generation sequencing', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'rare variant', 'repository', 'transmission process', 'trend', 'whole genome']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2017,300742,-0.002496027609216873
"F-CAP: Functionalization of Variants in Clinically Actionable Pharmacogenes ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Patient-to-patient variability in response to drugs creates a significant challenge for the safe and effective treatment of many human diseases. Pharmacogenomics seeks to address this challenge by linking drug response to patient genotypes at important loci, termed pharmacogenes, in order to better customize patient treatments. Genetic variation in pharmacogenes is extensive. For example, amongst 12 CYP genes, 10% of people carry at least one rare, potentially deleterious variant. Unfortunately, only a small number of variants have been unambiguously linked to alterations in drug response. Clearly, new approaches are needed to annotate the consequences of the huge pool of variants of unknown significance, including those already identified by existing large-scale sequencing programs, and those that will be discovered as clinical sequencing becomes routine. In this proposal, we seek to address this problem directly and at a scale never before possible by taking advantage of new technologies in sequencing and functional analysis. Our resource, termed F-CAP (Functionalization of Variants in Clinically Actionable Pharmacogenes) will test all possible substitutions at all amino acid residues in some of the most clinically important pharmacogenes and disseminate these data to the medical and research communities. In order to accomplish this, we will use deep mutational scanning, a method we have developed that allows parallelized, and quantitative measurements to be performed on libraries of genetic variants. In Aim 1 we will create these libraries, starting with five of the most important CPIC level A or B priority genes (CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, TPMT and VKORC1), and test the stability and enzymatic activity of each variant en masse using a pooled selection strategy. In Aim 2, we will integrate these data to create an impact score. This impact score provides a numerical value for a variant's functional effects that is amenable to easy integration into prescribing guidelines being developed by the pharmacogenomics community. Aim 3 will validate this score for a subset of variants that span the impact score spectrum using therapeutically relevant substrates for each pharmacogene. Finally, Aim 4 describes a key component of this resource: the dissemination of our findings to the entire pharmacogenomics community through partnership with CPIC and PharmGKB. In addition, we will make available our raw and processed data via a custom web resource that will also be developed in Aim 4. This resource will provide a series of fully annotated datasets describing the functional consequences of every possible single mutation in a series of key pharmacogenes, thereby greatly advancing the field of personalized medicine. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Pharmacogenomics seeks to identify genetic sources of inter-individual variability in drug response, with the goal of personalizing drug selection and dose to improve patient outcomes. A key barrier to using pharmacogenomic information is lack of clarity about the functional impact of variants, which hampers the provision of clear, unambiguous guidance to health care providers. We propose to connect pharmacogenomic variant discovery with novel high-throughput experimental approaches to deliver a resource to guide the use of individual pharmacogenomic information in personalizing drug treatment.",F-CAP: Functionalization of Variants in Clinically Actionable Pharmacogenes,9302807,R24GM115277,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Amino Acids', 'Applications Grants', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Assay', 'CYP2C19 gene', 'CYP2C9 gene', 'CYP2D6 gene', 'Catalogs', 'Cellular Assay', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dose', 'Elements', 'Funding', 'Gene Library', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health Personnel', 'High-Throughput DNA Sequencing', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Large-Scale Sequencing', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Research', 'Methods', 'Monoclonal Antibody R24', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Numerical value', 'Output', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Plant Roots', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Resources', 'Series', 'Source', 'TPMT gene', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Uses', 'Translations', 'Variant', 'clinical sequencing', 'clinically actionable', 'effective therapy', 'exome', 'genetic disorder diagnosis', 'genetic information', 'genetic variant', 'genotyped patients', 'human disease', 'improved', 'interest', 'mutation screening', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'online resource', 'personalized medicine', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'stability testing', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'variant of unknown significance']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R24,2017,737011,0.007708919162377576
"Integrative interpretation of the organismal consequences of non-coding variation ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our capacity to sequence human genomes has exceeded our ability to interpret genetic variation, particularly in non-coding regions. To address this challenge, we recently developed a novel framework, Combined Annotation Dependent Depletion (CADD), for estimating the deleteriousness of any genetic variant. CADD defines an objective, data-rich, and quantitative integration of many genomic annotations into a single measure of variant effect at the organismal level. The goals of this R01 proposal are to further develop the CADD framework, to apply it in the context of ongoing genetic studies of both rare and common human diseases, and to experimentally evaluate its predictions. In Specific Aim 1, we will substantially modify CADD in both straightforward and creative ways, with the goal of dramatically improving CADD's ability to annotate non- coding variants, not only to estimate their organismal effects but also to provide insights into molecular mechanisms. In Specific Aim 2, we will apply CADD to a variety of ongoing whole genome sequencing studies of human disease, especially those in which non-coding variants are either known or suspected to be causal. As part of this effort, we will develop new statistical frameworks that directly incorporat CADD into traditional genome-wide discovery approaches. In Specific Aim 3, we will perform a combination of high-throughput (massively parallel reporter assays), medium-throughput (CRISPR/Cas9), and low-throughput (in vivo mouse transgenics) experimental assays for systematic and targeted assessment of CADD predictions. This proposal includes both computational and experimental innovations, and builds on established collaborative relationships between investigators with complementary strengths. The completion of our aims will yield novel methods, data, and resources with which to annotate whole genome sequences, broadly enabling the field to more effectively identify and mechanistically understand non-coding genetic variants that are causally relevant to human disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: As we enter an era of personalized medicine, a deep understanding of human genomes will be increasingly important to public health, contributing to the unraveling of the genetic basis of human disease, as well as serving an increasing role in clinical diagnostics. However, our limited understanding of the functional consequences of most genetic variants, especially those that do not alter protein sequence, represents a major obstacle. This proposal seeks to dramatically improve our ability to identify and interpret ""non-coding"" variants that causally contribute to human disease. A recently developed computational approach will be substantially improved and evaluated in a variety of genetic studies, and its predictions will be experimentally validated. This project will provide much needed methods and resources to address the looming analytical challenges associated with individual whole genome sequencing in both biomedical research and patient care.",Integrative interpretation of the organismal consequences of non-coding variation,9228346,R01CA197139,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biomedical Research', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cell Line', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Event', 'Feedback', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Genomic approach', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Biology', 'Human Genetics', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mendelian disorder', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Nucleotides', 'Organism', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patient Care', 'Phenotype', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'RNA Binding', 'RNA Splicing', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Site', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Translating', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Vocabulary', 'Weight', 'candidate identification', 'clinical diagnostics', 'data resource', 'disease phenotype', 'exome', 'exome sequencing', 'experimental study', 'follow-up', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic pedigree', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genome-wide', 'human disease', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'insight', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'personalized medicine', 'public health relevance', 'trait', 'transcription factor', 'whole genome']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2017,632716,0.0005880095672300069
"Estimating disease risk using genetic data Project Summary In the past 10 years, over 21,000 genetic variants have been linked to complex human traits through genome-wide association studies (GWAS). However, the predictive power of many of these variants remains limited, and it is still unclear how best to use the wealth of information generated by GWAS to impact personal health and clinical practice. For nearly 10 years, 23andMe has been not only a driving force in direct-to-consumer genetic testing but also has established an innovative crowd-sourced genetics research platform. This platform has yielded a compelling data resource and many genetic discoveries. In this proposal, we will address the next phase of 23andMe human genetics research: the development of highly scalable and accurate disease risk estimation. Two of the key challenges in human genetics research are (1) to determine how to use results of GWAS to paint an accurate picture of an individual's disease risk, and (2) to determine how these estimates can provide information of personal and clinical utility. These challenges are difficult due to many factors including the wide spectrum of disease classes, the paucity of genetic and phenotypic data and significant methodological and computational challenges. In this proposal, we present a plan to utilize the genetic and phenotypic data stores at 23andMe to ​develop validated risk estimation algorithms​. In Phase I, we will build a computational pipeline that will be used to develop predictive algorithms for estimating disease risk (Aim #1) and use this pipeline to evaluate predictive ability of different estimation approaches in a broad class of human complex traits (Aim #2). In Phase II, we will validate these algorithms in external cohorts and build customer-facing reports that we will test for user comprehension. We believe that the development of accurate risk estimation capability will have a major impact on both consumer genetics and clinical genetics markets.      Project Narrative   The promise of genetics-based estimation of disease risk has yet to be realized. In this project, 23andMe will use its database of genetic and phenotypic information from over 1,000,000 research participants who have contributed more than 285,000,000 phenotypic data points on a wide spectrum of disease to build risk estimation algorithms. This project will enable 23andMe to produce the first validated risk estimation algorithms that provide both personal and clinical utility.    ",Estimating disease risk using genetic data,9255753,R43HG009089,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Applications Grants', 'Catalogs', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Comprehension', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Databases', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Models', 'Genetic Research', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genome', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Individual', 'Industry Collaboration', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical Genetics', 'Mendelian disorder', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Myopia', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Online Systems', 'Paint', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Peer Review', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Prevention', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Services', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Testing', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'crowdsourcing', 'data resource', 'disorder risk', 'driving force', 'drug development', 'flexibility', 'genetic predictors', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'health practice', 'human disease', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'lifestyle factors', 'new therapeutic target', 'non-genetic', 'personalized medicine', 'phenotypic data', 'prediction algorithm', 'research and development', 'risk variant', 'trait']",NHGRI,"23ANDME, INC.",R43,2017,241905,-0.0421451082327685
"Predicting causal non-coding variants in a founder population DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In order to characterize the molecular and cellular causes of human disease, it will be essential to unravel the functional impact of genetic variation. However, we are currently unable to predict the impact of the majority genetic variants that lie in non-coding regions of the genome, where indeed most complex disease-associated variants are found. Additionally, recent evidence suggests that a significant fraction of the non-coding genome is likely to be functional, often playing a role in gene regulation. Therefore, our limited understanding of non- coding variation is a critical hurdle to characterizing the genetic basis of disease. The goal of this project is to develop methods for interpreting non-coding genetic variation: to provide a robust and extensible Bayesian method for predicting causal variants from full genomes, to identify and validate a large set of functional non- coding variants using CRISPR technology, and to predict disease-relevant traits likely to be affected by each variant. Our project will leverage a unique cohort from a founder population in Sardinia, with genome sequence and/or transcriptome data available from 3000 individuals, along with extensive phenotyping for hundreds of traits. We will combine advanced statistical modeling with experimental validation based on genome engineering to identify causal non-coding variants affecting biomedical traits in the cohort, along with predicting functional mechanisms through which these variants ultimately perturb the cell. In Aim 1, we develop computational methods for predicting causal non-coding variation from full genomes, incorporating informative genomic features including epigenetic data, sequence motifs, and conservation information into a Bayesian approach jointly modeling multiple transcriptomic signals. We will optimize and apply these methods on genome and transcriptome data available for the Sardinia cohort to identify a large set of variants predicted to causally affect gene expression. Based on these predictions, in Aim 2, we connect putative causal variants with the diverse set of disease-relevant traits measured in the cohort, using network inference to capture the cascade from genetic variation to gene expression to disease. We will develop methods to integrate across variants, using the models in Aim 1, to identify the common causal mechanisms related to each trait. In Aim 3, we validate the causal impact of non-coding variants predicted to affect high-level traits. We will us genome editing through CRISPR to introduce individual genetic variants into cell lines and use qPCR to validate the predicted effects on gene expression. Finally, a major goal throughout this proposal will be to provide the research community with convenient computational tools for the prediction of causal non-coding variants from individual genomes, updated on an ongoing basis to integrate the most recent genomic annotations and public data in order to provide the best possible accuracy in predicting causal variants and the traits they are likely to affect. Our projet will greatly advance our understanding of non-coding genetic variation, the specific mechanisms affected by causal variants, and the downstream consequences to the cell and individual health. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Understanding the impact of variation in the entire genome, beyond the well-studied protein-coding regions, is essential to understanding the relationship between genetics and human health. This proposal addresses the problem of identifying functional non-coding genetic variants and predicting the impact of each variant on hundreds of disease-relevant traits.

"Optimizing Genetic Testing for Deafness for Clinical Diagnostics Project Summary  Hearing loss is the most common sensory deficit in humans. It is diagnosed in 1 in 500 newborns and affects half of all octogenarians. Although causality is multifactorial, in developed countries a large fraction of hearing loss is genetic and non-syndromic, i.e. not associated with other phenotypes.  During the prior granting period, we implemented and integrated comprehensive genetic testing as a cornerstone in the evaluation of the deaf and hard-of-hearing person. The American College of Medical Genetics has recognized the merit of this approach, and in 2014 included comprehensive genetic testing for the evaluation of deafness in their newest treatment guidelines. In the largest study to date to corroborate this decision, we found an underlying genetic cause for hearing loss in 440 (39%) of 1119 sequentially accrued patients chosen without exclusion criteria. Pathogenic variants were present in 49 genes and included missense variants (49%), copy number changes (18%), indels (18%), nonsense variants (8%), splice-site alterations (6%) and promoter variants (<1%), making comprehensive genetic testing the single best test to order in the diagnosis of hearing loss after an audiogram.  In this competitive renewal, we will build on these accomplishments by completing the following aims: • Specific Aim 1: To optimize phenotype-genotype integration in the analysis of hereditary hearing loss  by refining the use of hierarchical surface clustering and audioprofile surface analysis to determine  which types of genetic hearing loss are associated with clinically meaningful sub-clusters • Specific Aim 2: To validate and integrate physics-based protein modeling as a tool within the Deafness  Variation Database to predict variant effect and the molecular and patient phenotype • Specific Aim 3: To identify genetic modifiers of specific deafness-causing genes predicted by  hierarchical surface clustering and validated by physics-based potential free-energy modeling  The successful completion of this grant will improve the clinical care of persons with hearing loss by enhancing phenome-genome integration and by making variant interpretation more robust. Knowledge gained from this proposal will also lay the foundation for refined studies focused on the identification of genetic modifiers – both positive and negative – associated with complex phenotypes such as noise- induced and age-related hearing loss. This competitive renewal addresses the increasingly daunting challenge of variant interpretation. We will seamlessly integrate AudioGene into the OtoSCOPE® pipeline, explore hierarchical surfaces clustering at all loci, enhance the utility of the Deafness Variation Database by adding physics-based potential free-energy modeling, and using these tools, identify genetic modifiers of select types of genetic hearing loss. The completion of these aims will lay the foundation for more refined studies focused on the identification of genetic modifiers – both positive and negative – associated with complex hearing loss phenotypes including noise-induced and age-related hearing loss.",Optimizing Genetic Testing for Deafness for Clinical Diagnostics,9232830,R01DC012049,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Area', 'Audiometry', 'Biological Preservation', 'Biology', 'Case Study', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cochlear implant procedure', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Cystic Fibrosis', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Trees', 'Developed Countries', 'Developing Countries', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Duchenne muscular dystrophy', 'Enrollment', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Exclusion Criteria', 'Foundations', 'Free Energy', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Hearing', 'Hearing Impaired Persons', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Inherited', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Massive Parallel Sequencing', 'Medical Genetics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Newborn Infant', 'Noise', 'Octogenarian', 'Otoscopes', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Physics', 'Presbycusis', 'Proteins', 'RNA Splicing', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Scientist', 'Sensory', 'Site', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Variant', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinically significant', 'cohort', 'deafness', 'design', 'evaluation/testing', 'falls', 'gene therapy', 'genetic disorder diagnosis', 'hearing impairment', 'improved', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'medical schools', 'novel', 'phenome', 'prognostic', 'promoter', 'research clinical testing', 'software systems', 'tool']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R01,2017,564086,0.03222727074181328
"Overall NIDA Core ""Center of Excellence"" in Transcriptomics, Systems Genetics and the Addictome Addiction is a highly complex disease with risk factors that include genetic variants and differences in development, sex, and environment. The long term potential of precision medicine to improve drug treatment and prevention depends on gaining a much better understanding how genetics, drugs, brain cells, and neuronal circuitry interact to influence behavior. There are serious technical barriers that prevent researchers and clinicians from incorporating more powerful computational and predictive methods in addiction research. The purpose of the NIDA P30 Core Center of Excellence in Omics, Systems Genetics, and the Addictome is to empower and train researchers supported by NIH, NIDA, NIAAA, and other federal and state institutions to use more quantitative and testable ways to analyze genetic, epigenetic, and the environmental factors that influence drug abuse risk and treatment. In the Transcriptome Informatics and Mechanisms research core we assemble and upgrade hundreds of large genome (DNA) and transcriptome (RNA) datasets for experimental rodent (rat) models of addiction. In the Systems Analytics and Modeling research core, we are using innovative systems genetics methods (gene mapping) to understand the linkage between DNA differences, environmental risks such as stress, and the differential risk of drug abuse and relapse. Our Pilot core is catalyzing new collaborations among young investigator in the field of addiction research. In sum the Center is a national resource for more reproducible research in addiction. We are centralizing, archiving, distributing, analyzing and integrating high quality data, metadata, using open software systems in collaboration with many other teams of researchers. Our goal is to help build toward an NIDA Addictome Portal that will include all genomic research relevant to addiction research. PROJECT NARRATIVE The NIDA Core Center of Excellence in Omics, Systems Genetics, and the Addictome (OSGA) provides genomic and computational support to a large number of research scientists working on mechanisms and treatment of addiction. The two main research cores of OSGA are providing support for transcriptome, epigenome, and metagenome studies of rat models of addiction at many levels of analysis. We are also creating open access tools and a powerful web portal to catalyze more effective and replicable use of massive datasets generated by programs in addiction biology and treatment.","Overall NIDA Core ""Center of Excellence"" in Transcriptomics, Systems Genetics and the Addictome",9360448,P30DA044223,"['Archives', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Cells', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consult', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug abuse', 'Educational workshop', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Joints', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Proteome', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Quantitative Genetics', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'RNA', 'Rattus', 'Relapse', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Models', 'Stress', 'Sum', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translations', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'Variant', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'behavior influence', 'brain cell', 'career', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'computing resources', 'data archive', 'data integration', 'data modeling', 'digital imaging', 'drug relapse', 'epigenome', 'experience', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic variant', 'genomic variation', 'graphical user interface', 'health record', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'metagenome', 'mouse model', 'neuronal circuitry', 'novel', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'programs', 'ranpirnase', 'rat genome', 'repository', 'sex', 'single cell analysis', 'software systems', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'web portal']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE HEALTH SCI CTR,P30,2017,906404,0.008990599639354498
"Molecular Characterization of Joubert Syndrome ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Congenital ataxia presents in early childhood with non-progressive hypotonia, gross and fine motor delay and cognitive delays. These disorders are distinct from the progressive ataxias because of the presence of congenital cerebellar malformations and because they are typically inherited recessively. Joubert Syndrome and Related Disorders (JSRD) constitute a major subset of these conditions, consisting of a cerebellar midline (vermis) malformation, a nearly pathognomonic Molar Tooth sign on brain Imaging (MTI) and co-existent oculomotor apraxia and episodic breathing dysrhythmias. In our published data, we have: 1] Identified ten unique genetic causes of JSRD (nearly half of the published causes), 2] Generated genotype-phenotype correlations involving cerebellar, retinal, renal, hepatic, digit, and cerebral manifestations. 3] Identified common founder mutations that allow for population-based screening. 4] Discovered that JSRD encoded proteins localize to the cilium. 5] Identified ciliary defects in cells with JSRD mutations. 6] Performed siRNA cell-based screens for defective ciliogenesis to prioritize candidate JSRD genes. 7] Generated and characterized multiple zebrafish, mouse and human cell culture models for JSRD. 8] Defined the concept of `Ciliary localization' model, in which one JSRD gene is required for ciliary localization of other JSRD proteins. In our unpublished work we have: 1] Recruited an additional 200 JSRD patients without molecular diagnosis. 2] Performed whole exome sequencing (WES) and genetic mapping on an additional 100 JSRD families. 3] Identified an additional 12 novel likely JSRD candidate genes. 4] Begun functional validation of the putative mutations. 5] Developed methods to ultrastructurally interrogate ciliary structure in a high-throughput fashion. The goal of this competing renewal is to identify the remaining `discoverable' genes that when mutated lead to JSRD, functionally validate mutations within the pathogenetic framework, and test the hypothesis that mutations in any proven JSRD gene lead to collapse of the ciliary transition zone by correlating genetic mutations with ultrastructural ciliary defects. Because the majority of patients still have unknown cause of disease, this renewal aims to advance knowledge through molecular characterization of new genes, using newly evolving high-throughput techniques, integrated bioinformatics, and a unique resource of consanguineous families recruited world-wide. We further aim to validate these mutations within a mechanistic framework, and a model that JSRD genes are required for essential ciliary structural components during cerebellar development.

"Elucidating the Role of the Genetic and Environmental Determinants of Preterm Birth Using Integrative Computational Approaches ABSTRACT Given the wealth and availability of genomic and environmental exposure data, computational methods provide a powerful opportunity to identify population-specific determinants of disease. Proper treatment of data types emerging from a diverse set of molecular and environmental profiling technologies cannot be analyzed using traditional statistical routines and new computational approaches are needed. In line with the President's Precision Medicine Initiative, the goal of this proposal is to develop computational methods and integrate large- scale genetic and environmental exposure datasets to elucidate factors that affect preterm birth (PTB) in diverse populations. Preterm birth, or the delivery of an infant prior to 37 weeks of gestation, is a major health concern. Infants born prematurely, comprising of about 12% of the US newborns, have elevated risks of neonatal mortality and a wide array of health problems. Preterm birth rates vary among different ethnic groups, with frequencies significantly elevated in African Americans and moderately elevated in Hispanics in comparison to Europeans. Environmental and socioeconomic factors alone may not explain these disparities and despite the evidence for a genetic basis to preterm birth, to date no causal genetic variants have been identified. In this proposal I aim to leverage the rich genetic and environmental variation data and develop computational approaches to advance our understanding of biology of preterm birth as it relates to all populations. To that extent, I propose three aims. In aim 1, I will develop computational methods to identify and validate novel genetic factors for preterm birth by genome-wide association (GWA) study in diverse ethnic populations. I obtained a comprehensive set of publicly available PTB case and control datasets consisting of ethnically diverse mothers and babies including 3,500 cases and nearly 16,000 controls from dbGAP and will carry out an ancestry-based case-control GWA study to identify genetic factors influencing PTB. In aim 2, I will develop analytical methodology to identify environmental and socioeconomic factors that impact preterm birth in diverse ethnic populations. I propose to integrate linked California State databases covering over 3 million births across diverse populations with geographical location data and pollution levels and UV exposure data from the Environmental Protection Agency in order to identify whether these exposures play a role in contributing to population-specific PTB risk. In aim 3, I will carry out integrative data analysis and build computational models in order to identify population specific interactions between the genetic and environmental factors affecting PTB risk. I hypothesize that gene-environment interactions contribute to population differences in preterm birth risk following environmental exposures. The proposed work will allow us to learn more about the etiology PTB, but could also be extended to other phenotypes of interest. This project is the logical next step for the study of the interaction of genetics and environment in the context of disease, which can be used to inform precise population-specific diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. PROJECT NARRATIVE Given the wealth and availability of genomic and environmental exposure data, computational methods provide a powerful opportunity to identify population-specific determinants of disease. The goal of this proposal is to develop computational approaches to integrate diverse genetic and environmental exposure datasets to elucidate factors that affect disease in diverse populations and apply them to the study of preterm birth. The methodology developed as part of this proposal can be extended and applied to other phenotypes of interest and inform precise population-specific diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.",Elucidating the Role of the Genetic and Environmental Determinants of Preterm Birth Using Integrative Computational Approaches,9324358,K01LM012381,"['37 weeks gestation', 'Advisory Committees', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Air Pollution', 'Animals', 'Behavior', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Birth', 'Birth Rate', 'California', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Child', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Drug usage', 'Ecology', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Ethnic group', 'Etiology', 'European', 'Family', 'Food', 'Frequencies', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Geographic Locations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heritability', 'High Prevalence', 'Hispanics', 'Immunity', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Inflammation', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Latino', 'Learning', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Mothers', 'Neonatal Mortality', 'Neonatology', 'Newborn Infant', 'Nutrient', 'Particulate', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Pollution', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Pregnancy', 'Premature Birth', 'Premature Infant', 'Prevalence', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smoking', 'Societies', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Stress', 'Subgroup', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Training Activity', 'Twin Studies', 'UV Radiation Exposure', 'United States Environmental Protection Agency', 'Variant', 'Work', 'admixture mapping', 'base', 'case control', 'cohort', 'database of Genotypes and Phenotypes', 'economic cost', 'ethnic diversity', 'gene environment interaction', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'improved', 'interest', 'non-genetic', 'novel', 'precision medicine', 'racial and ethnic', 'statistics']",NLM,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K01,2017,176920,0.026658112011164747
"Modeling Dimensionality and Genetic Heterogeneity in Schizophrenia ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Schizophrenia (SZ) represents a significant and costly public health burden. Recently, we have witnessed the emergence of the first molecular insights into the etiopathogenic mechanisms of SZ, via the first genome-wide association studies (GWAS) with sufficient case-control sample sizes to detect allelic effects. Importantly, a polygenic signature, which includes genome-wide significant common genetic variants of small effect, has been clearly demonstrated to influence SZ risk. The availability of well-defined risk factors makes it possible, for the first time, to address several critical questions about the genetic architecture of SZ and its component phenotypes and endophenotypes. The overarching goals of this K01 proposal are 1) to test polygenic risk score prediction of dimensional SZ and schizotypy phenotypes across large case, high-density SZ pedigree, and prodromal-aged GWAS samples, and 2) to develop and test, with leaders of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, innovative statistical methods to identify and characterize ""genetic subtypes"" of SZ.  This proposal delineates a series of training and research goals for the candidate that incorporates strengths from phenotypic assessment, statistical genetics, and molecular genetics and combines samples reflecting a broad range of genetic risk. The candidate will capitalize on previously established expertise in schizotypy and clinical risk assessment, as well as expertise in the familial transmission of dimensional traits, to establish a program of translational research wherein the application of statistical genetic/bioinformatic techniques to genetic subtyping analyses will be used to generate promising candidates for further exploration in human genomic data. Empirically-based genetic subtyping methods will be developed and tested in the largest SZ case sample to date, and subtypes will be characterized with respect to dimensional phenotypic traits. Top loci hits in subtype analyses of dimensional symptoms will be validated in secondary analyses of differential gene expression in post-mortem SZ brain. This will allow for a detailed analysis of function at both the SNP and gene levels, and will provide the candidate with substantive training in both statistical and molecular genetics methods. The institutional environment is ideal for the candidate's goal of developing a comprehensive program in SZ research, and the proposed research represents an important contribution toward advancing the understanding of SZ through a combination of clinical, statistical, molecular, and translational methods, consistent with the mission of the NIMH.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Mental illnesses such as schizophrenia constitute 13% of the global burden of disease and schizophrenia, although relatively rare, is highly heritable (80%) and one of the most severe mental disorders. This project aims to elucidate the influence of genetic factors and gene function on dimensional schizophrenia and schizotypy symptoms with multiple measures, across multiple samples of varying genetic risk. Insights gained from this research will inform prediction, prevention, intervention, and treatment efforts by clarifying the biological mechanisms underlying SZ symptoms.        ",Modeling Dimensionality and Genetic Heterogeneity in Schizophrenia,9243309,K01MH109765,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Age of Onset', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alleles', 'Architecture', 'Autopsy', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Gaussian model', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Interview', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Malignant neoplasm of ovary', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nicotine', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Personality', 'Phenotype', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Process', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Schizophrenia', 'Schizotypal Personality Disorder', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Subgroup', 'Suicide attempt', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Trees', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Wisconsin', 'aged', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'burden of illness', 'case control', 'clinical risk', 'cocaine use', 'cost', 'density', 'differential expression', 'dimensional analysis', 'disorder subtype', 'endophenotype', 'gene function', 'genetic pedigree', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'marijuana use', 'mind control', 'novel', 'population stratification', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'secondary analysis', 'severe mental illness', 'sex', 'substance misuse', 'symptomatology', 'theories', 'training opportunity', 'trait', 'translational research program', 'transmission process']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,K01,2017,158132,-0.006870545770999906
"Searching for missing heritability for cardiometabolic outcomes by race ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiometabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) are common global health conditions that carry a great public health burden for chronic disability and early death. African Americans are more likely to be disproportionately affected than Whites. Our proposed project will have an important impact because it has great potential to explain, 1) A measure of the genetic susceptibility of these cardiometabolic diseases and mortality, and 2) Interaction and mediation of a genetic risk score (GRS) with a low diet quality score and low physical activity levels on these adverse health outcomes. There are published reports of interaction (effect modification) but not mediation (indirectly through an intervening variable) of a GRS with nutritional factors and low physical activity levels on cardiometabolic conditions; however, these studies involving interaction were performed predominantly in Whites. Most of the genetic susceptibility for these outcomes remains unexplained for African Americans. Studies are lacking on the role of these lifestyle factors in terms of interaction and especially mediation with a GRS to increase risk for cardiometabolic outcomes among Whites and African Americans. Thus, several questions remain regarding the influence environmental factors have with genes to increase disease risk and mortality among different race/ethnic groups. To address our questions, we will use the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute Candidate Gene Association Resource dataset of about 50,000 subjects, including 13,000 African Americans. To account for a measure of the genetic susceptibility, we will capture multiplicative single nucleotide polymorphism effects by the re-weighted random forest statistical method to compute a disease-and-race-specific GRS. We will include functional reduction- oxidation and metabolic disruptive single nucleotide polymorphisms that are involved in the inflammation and nutrient-signaling pathways. We will then investigate interaction and mediation of a GRS with a low diet quality score and low physical activity levels on T2DM, CVD, and mortality at baseline and over time by performing a meta-analysis. Our data include information on genetic polymorphisms, cross-sectional and longitudinal measurements on phenotypes for T2DM, CVD, and mortality, as well as dietary intake, physical activity, and relevant covariates. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The purpose of the study is to find a measure of the genetic susceptibility for type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and mortality in Whites and especially African Americans. Our study will examine interaction and mediation of a genetic risk score with a low diet quality score and low physical activity levels on these cardiometabolic outcomes at baseline and over time by performing a meta-analysis.

"Pharmacogenomics of Statin Therapy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall objective of the Center ""Pharmacogenomics of Statin Therapy"" (POST) is to apply genomic, transcriptomic, and metabolomic analyses, together with studies in cellular and animal models, and innovative informatic tools, to identify and validate biomarkers for efficacy of statin drugs in reducing riskof cardiovascular disease (CVD), and for adverse effects of statins, specifically myopathy and type 2 diabetes. This multidisciplinary approach is enabled by a team of investigators with expertise in genomics (human, mouse, and molecular), statistics and informatics, and clinical medicine and pharmacology. The Center is comprised of three Projects, two Research Cores, and an Administrative Core. A major aim of Project 1 is the identification of cellular transcriptomic and metabolomic markers for clinical efficacy and adverse effects of statins. This will be accomplished by analyses in statin-exposed lymphoblast cell lines derived from patients with major adverse coronary events, or onset of myopathy or type 2 diabetes on statin treatment, compared with unaffected statin- treated controls. In addition, using genome wide genotypes from these patients, DNA variants will be identified that are associated with statin-induced changes in the transcripts and metabolites that most strongly discriminate affected patients and controls. Project 2 will use a unique, well-characterized panel of 100 inbred mouse strains to discover genetic variation associated with statin-induced myopathy and dysglycemia. Mechanisms underlying these effects will be investigated, with emphasis on the role of dysregulation of autophagy by statin treatment. Projects 1 and 2 will also use relevant cellular and mouse models, respectively, to perform functional studies to validate effects of genes identified in all POST projects as strong candidates for modulating statin efficacy or adverse effects. In Project 3, information derived from genome-wide genotypes, electronic health records, and pharmacy data in a very large and diverse population-based patient cohort will be leveraged to identify and replicate genetic associations with statin efficacy (lipid lowering and CVD event reduction) and adverse effects (myopathy and type 2 diabetes), as well as to assess the overall heritability of these responses. The Clinical Core, based in Kaiser Permanente of Northern California, will provide the clinical information and biologic materials for both Projects1 and 3. Investigators in the Informatics Core will optimize data analysis and integration of results across all projects. The Administrative Core will provide scientific leadership and management of the Center, and foster scientific interactions and training opportunities. Overall, the research program of this Center provides an innovative model for a ""systems"" approach to pharmacogenomics that incorporates complementary investigative tools to discover and validate genetically influenced determinants of drug response. Moreover, the findings have the potential for guiding more effective use of statins for reducing CVD risk and minimizing adverse effects, and identifying biomarkers of pathways that modulate the multiple actions of this widely used class of drugs.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Coronary heart disease and stroke are the leading causes of death and disability in the United States, and statins are the most widely prescribed class of drugs to prevent these conditions. There is however, considerable interindividual variation in efficacy of statins for reducing disease risk, as well as in susceptibility to the most common adverse statin effects, myopathy and type 2 diabetes. The goal of the Center ""Pharmacogenomics of Statin Therapy"" (POST) is to apply complementary investigative approaches and multidisciplinary expertise for discovering and validating the genetic and metabolic factors responsible for this variability. This information has the potential for optimizig use of statins in clinical practice, and for identifying new pathways that underlie the diverse biologic actions of this drug class.              ",Pharmacogenomics of Statin Therapy,9326327,P50GM115318,"['Adverse effects', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Autophagocytosis', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'California', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Line', 'Cell model', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Markers', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Pharmacology', 'Collaborations', 'Coronary', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease Outcome', 'Drug effect disorder', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Ethnic group', 'Event', 'Fostering', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Hybrids', 'Hyperglycemia', 'In Vitro', 'Inbred Strains Mice', 'Informatics', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Metabolic', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Muscle function', 'Myopathy', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Predisposition', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Recombinants', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Residual state', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Simvastatin', 'Stroke', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Transcript', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Visualization software', 'adverse outcome', 'alternative treatment', 'base', 'biomarker identification', 'blood glucose regulation', 'candidate validation', 'cardiovascular disorder prevention', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'clinical efficacy', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'data integration', 'data visualization', 'design', 'disability', 'disorder risk', 'exome', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic association', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genotyped patients', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'inter-individual variation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'lymphoblast', 'lymphoblastoid cell line', 'metabolomics', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'novel strategies', 'population based', 'predictive marker', 'prevent', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'risk minimization', 'statistics', 'tool', 'training opportunity', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment strategy']",NIGMS,CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL & RES CTR AT OAKLAND,P50,2017,2688571,0.009096673486966115
"Genome Wide Association Study for Childhood Obesity DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Obesity is a major risk factor for type 2 diabetes, which in turn has serious complications including accelerated development of cardiovascular disease. The prevalence of obesity in children and adults in the United States has increased by more than 30% over the past decade.  We previously successfully argued in our application for the R01 HD056465 award that distillation of the genetic component in this complex phenotype should thus be easier to determine in children, where environmental exposure and impact has been for a relatively short period of their lifetime; indeed the resulting work did pan out to be successful in this regard. We carried out a non-hypothesis-driven study that was directed at uncovering genes and genetic variants that predispose to childhood obesity by conducting a genome-wide association study (GWAS) using a high density tag-SNP array. Employing a powered two-stage study design in a consortium setting, where cases were defined as being in the e95th percentile of BMI, we identified novel association signals which we subsequently replicated. This NICHD funded study was ultimately published in Nature Genetics (with the PI as senior author) and received widespread press attention, including with CNN, Time and the front page of USA Today.  The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia is now poised to determine additional genetic factors conferring risk to the pathogenesis of childhood obesity through the leveraging of new ultra-high-throughput sequencing technology, and also allow for fine-mapping of the already uncovered loci to determine the actual causal mechanism of action. Combining our accurately phenotyped cohort, which represents the largest pediatric obesity DNA collection in the world, with access to familial childhood obesity, availability of existing genome wide singl nucleotide polymorphism genotypes and the application of whole exome sequencing, this renewal application of R01 HD056465 proposes to broaden the list of novel genetic loci that are associated with this trait in order to get further insights in to the genetic etiology of common pediatric obesity.  We are well positioned to extend our knowledge of the genetic etiology of childhood obesity. It is unclear if these additional variants are common in the population, a set o private mutations in families or a mixture of both. Irrespective of the nature of the variant(s) we are well positioned to look for both types of event, with common variants detectable through leveraging the GWAS dataset of well powered cohorts and private mutations detectable through whole exome sequencing of many multi-case pedigrees. This represents a major follow-up to the Principal Investigator's original grant application and this renewal will allow for adding extr value to the already substantial findings made funded by the original grant. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The prevalence of obesity in children and adults in the United States has increased by more than 30% over the past decade. We are seeking to renew R01 HD056465 to expand on the successful findings made previously and to further characterize the genetic etiology of childhood obesity and pediatric BMI trajectory.

"Quantitative microscopy-based rapid phenotyping and screening ﻿    DESCRIPTION:  Synapses are most fundamental to the function of a nervous system. C. elegans is an excellent genetic model system for finding genes and elucidating pathways because of its sequenced genome and the abundance of molecular biology tools and mutants. Due to the simplicity of its nervous system, many breakthroughs have been made in C. elegans for understanding molecular mechanisms in the patterning of the nervous system and synapse development. The current bottlenecks are in the manual and non-quantitative techniques such as visual screens, limiting both the throughput of the experiments and the phenotypes one can examine. Our long-term objective is to develop technologies and to understand how genes, age, and the environment together define and continue to remodel the nervous system of an organism. In the last funding period, we have made large progress in hardware system design (including microtechnologies and automation technologies) and software for quantitative characterization of phenotypes. The objective of this continuation project is to further engineer superior micro devices for large-scale live imaging and quantitative imaging technologies, and combine with the power of genetic and genomic approaches to study synapse development in this in vivo system; genes and pathways emerging from this study could potentially become targets of therapeutics in neurological disorders.  We have shown in the previous phase of the project that quantitative microscopy-based approaches can indeed enable identification of novel genes and pathways that conventional approaches cannot. In the continuation phase, we will further optimize on-chip rapid and high-content in vivo imaging techniques, and in parallel further develop algorithms and quantitative measures for the analysis of such high-content data; we will screen based on novel synthetic phenotype unobservable by eye; we will also exploit powerful genomic techniques to identify loci and potential multigenic interactions that shape the synapse morphology. These experimental approaches will identify genes that cannot have been identified otherwise because of the difficulties associated with the phenotypical profiling, but addressed using our engineered techniques here. The approach is innovative because the technology developed here dramatically increases the throughput, sensitivity, and accuracy of the experiments, and truly enables the utility of extremely powerful genetic and genomic methods. The proposed research is significant because it fills the urgent need in high-throughput and high-content screens as well as identifying novel genes and pathways. In addition, besides the contribution to the specific neurobiology, the technologies are widely applicable to areas such as developmental cell biology, and to other small organisms such as fly larvae and zebrafish embryos. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:   Synapse development is an important and active area of research linking genes and environments to the formation and maintenance of synapses in the nervous system.

"Tracing the evolution of the human mutation rate ﻿DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): All genetic variation is created by mutations, changes that arise due to DNA damage or copying mistakes during DNA replication. Mutations are frequent enough that, on average, a child's 3-billion base pair genome contains 74 new genetic variants that are not present in the genome of either parent. Such new mutations confer a higher disease risk than older mutations because they have not passed the test of surviving through several generations of parents and offspring. We aim to pinpoint how the human mutation rate has evolved as humans left Africa and adapted to diverse new environments across the globe.  One specific aim will follow up on my preliminary research which showed that Europeans experienced a mutation rate change after diverging from Africans and Asians. The primary evidence for this change is that European genomes have a higher burden than African or Asian genomes of the mutation type TCC→TTC, where the trinucleotide ""TCC"" has experienced a mutation from ""C"" to ""T"" at its central site. We wish to and the genetic basis of this mutation rate change by looking at rare variants in mixed- ancestry Latino and African-American individuals. Specially, we will isolate young genetic variants that probably arose via mutation within the past 10-15 generations, after gene ow from Europe into the Americas had already begun. We will infer the genetic background (European, African, or Native American) upon which each new mutation arose and look for genomic regions where European ances- try correlates strongly with an excess of TCC→TTC mutations. These will be the regions most likely to harbor a causal allele that changed the process of mutation accumulation in Europeans. This work has the potential to yield valuable insights into melanoma, a cancer that predominantly affects individuals of European ancestry and whose somatic mutational signature is dominated by TCC→TTC.  A second specific aim is to look for other signatures of mutation rate change that have occurred within the human species or, more broadly, within the great apes. We will use a natural language processing technique called Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to identify collections of mutation types whose rates appear to be under common genetic control. A few mutation types besides TCC→TTC show weak signals of rate differentiation between populations, and we will attempt to infer how many separate mutation rate change events are necessary to explain these signals. The admixture mapping technique from Specific Aim I can also be adapted to interrogate the genetic basis of other mutation rate changes that might have occurred in the recent past. These efforts should improve our understanding of the human mutation rate's genetic architecture and how mutation rates differ between populations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: All genetic variation is created by mutations, the copying mistakes that occasionally happen during DNA replication. There is evidence that children born with a higher burden of new mutations are at increased risk for autism, schizophrenia, and serious congenital diseases [1, 2, 3], but it is not well understood how much the human mutation rate varies and what genetic risk factors affect the mutation rate [4]. We aim to follow up on preliminary evidence that the Europeans have a higher mutation rate than Asians or Africans [5], looking for the genetic basis of this rate difference and investigating how often the mutation rate has changed during human evolution.",Tracing the evolution of the human mutation rate,9117987,F32GM116381,"['Acceleration', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'African', 'African American', 'Alleles', 'American', 'Americas', 'Architecture', 'Asians', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Base Pairing', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Cancer Biology', 'Child', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Collection', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA biosynthesis', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Employee Strikes', 'Environment', 'Europe', 'European', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomic Segment', 'Germ-Line Mutation', 'Health', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Latino', 'Left', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Mutation', 'Mutation Spectra', 'Native Americans', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Parents', 'Pongidae', 'Population', 'Process', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Schizophrenia', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Work', 'admixture mapping', 'base', 'design', 'developmental disease', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'genetic risk factor', 'genetic variant', 'improved', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'melanoma', 'offspring', 'rare variant', 'rate of change', 'success', 'trait', 'transition mutation']",NIGMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,F32,2016,56118,0.028001273596949545
"Predicting Impact of Genetic Variation on Splicing ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The genetic code not only determines protein amino acid residue sequence but also defines the 'splicing code' of cis- and trans-acting regulatory elements that control pre-mRNA splicing. Single nucleotide variant (SNV) changes at key regions in pre-mRNA may disrupt splicing resulting in disease [1, 2]. Understanding which SNVs cause aberrant splicing and which are benign is important for understanding disease pathogenesis. SNVs at consensus splice sites, at exon-intron junctions, are known to cause aberrant splicing and contribute to at least 10% of inherited diseases [2]. However, SNVs outside consensus splice sites can still disrupt splicing [3]. Current, bioinformatics tools limit analysis to SNVs at or near consensus splice sites and lack the ability to generalize to SNVs beyond the consensus splice site [4-7]. In this application, I propose to substantially improve the ability to interpret the consequences of mutations on pre-mRNA splicing. This goal will be achieved by: 1) developing novel features, useful in predicting the impact of variation on cis- splicing regulation; 2) training a supervised machine learning algorithm that uses the novel features to predict the impact of SNVs; 3) sharing the algorithm in a publically available software package; and 4) comparing algorithm predictions to the relationships between SNVs and splicing patterns derived from matched DNA- and RNA-sequencing studies.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Genetic sequences not only encode the amino acids of proteins but also regulate many critical biological functions, including pre-mRNA splicing. The impact of genetic variation on splicing is not well understood. The goal of this research project i to computationally identify features of variants useful in predicting aberrant splicing, then incorporate the features into a machine learning algorithm and test the utility of the predictions using publically available sequencing studies. 1            ",Predicting Impact of Genetic Variation on Splicing,8991662,F31HG007804,"['Algorithms', 'Amino Acids', 'Benign', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Cell physiology', 'Characteristics', 'Code', 'Comparative Study', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consensus', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Exons', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Code', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Inherited', 'Introns', 'Label', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Mutation', 'Nucleotides', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Proteins', 'RNA Splicing', 'Regulation', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research Project Grants', 'Role', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Variant', 'base', 'improved', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'mRNA Precursor', 'novel', 'prediction algorithm', 'public health relevance', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NHGRI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,F31,2016,43576,-0.01439924193133622
"Clinically Relevant Genome Variation Database We propose to create the world's premier database of genetic variants relevant to clinical care (Clinically Relevant Genetic Variants Resource or CRVR). We will provide transparent data synthesis and consensus opinion on the clinical utility of a given genetic variant across a spectrum of genetic lesions including single nucleotide changes, small indels and structural variants. We will integrate with ClinVar, PharmGKB, and OMIM and draw upon NHGRI initiatives including the Genome Sequencing and Analysis and Mendelian Disorders Sequencing Centers, and the Clinical Sequencing Exploratory Research Centers. We will work closely with other CRVR sites and NHGRI funded initiatives to improve deposition of data from clinical laboratories. Our database will be built through three Aims. Aim 1 will engage and energize the clinical genomics community around CRVR efforts. We will partner with the other CRVR and U41 investigators in this activity as they will focus on engagement of professional societies, clinical testing laboratories, and the broader clinical genomics community to ensure creation of a CRVR resource that meets anticipated community needs including assembly of Disease-Specific and Mutation Type Working Groups (DSWGs and MTWGs) comprised of expert clinical geneticists and molecular diagnosticians to establish metrics for the initial classification of variants and integration of guidelines from professional organizations. Aim 2 will involve creation of a CRVR CoreDB resource through expert review of the existing literature, locus databases, and NHGRI initiatives. We will disseminate consensus findings on clinically relevant genetic variants and the clinical implications of these variants, with supporting evidence and documentation of the consensus process. Information will be aggregated using standard ontologies and advanced methodologies for handling heterogeneous data to create a Core Database (CoreDB). The consensus of expert review will be disseminated through a user-friendly web Portal (vetted by Genetic Counseling WG), web services for data mining, and consensus clinical guidelines to the appropriate clinical and research communities. The results will be organized by gene, variant, disease, pathway, and literature. Supporting evidence will also be curated and disseminated, and the resource will be updated continuously as new information accumulates. Aim 3 will involve deployment of machine-learning algorithms for semi- automatic identification of putative Clinically Relevant Variants (CRVs). We will undertake data mining of the clinical and epidemiological genetics literature and existing databases to identify putative clinically important variants. This will involve mining data from ClinVar, OMIM, CSER, and the Mendelian centers aggregated in Aim 2. The Working Groups formed in Aim 1 will establish criteria and oversee curators vetting variants.

"Statistical Modeling of Complex Traits in Genetic Reference Super-Populations DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Genetic crosses in model organisms play an essential role in understanding the heritable architecture of medically relevant phenotypes. Traditionally, such crosses have tended to be on a small scale with either limited power to detect genetic effects or limited resolution to localize causal variants. Recently, however, the emergence of larger-scale interdisciplinary research, cheaper genotyping and parallel advances in human genetics, have spurred the development of more sophisticated and powerful experimental designs. Genetic Resource Populations (GRPs) use economies of scale to provide cost-effective and replicable platforms for genetic studies. This project concerns the largest, most ambitious GRP in mouse genetics to date, the Collaborative Cross (CC), and a series of crosses and designs related to or derived from it: the Diversity Outbred (DO) cross, the CC Recombinant Inbred Cross (CC-RIX) and the diallel. Experiments on each separate cross provide distinct information about the heritable architecture of a target complex disease. In combination, this Genetic Reference Super-Population (GRSP) potentially provides an unparalleled basis for cross-study replication and integration in mouse genetics. This project aims to develop statistical methods that advance the current state of complex trait analysis of these populations separately, and, by exploiting the unique structure that connects them, proposes to develop a statistical framework that allows for their joint use.  Aim 1 develops a Bayesian probabilistic framework for haplotype-based analysis of quantitative trait loci (QTL). Aim 1a develops a statistical software module for flexible haplotype-based analysis, which can be ex- tended by the researcher to model a rich variety of designs and disease types. Aim 1b will adapt machine learning techniques to provide posterior inference of the allelic series of a QTL. Aim 1c will incorporate Bayesian modeling of polygenic effects.  Aim 2 and 3 concern joint analysis, building on the foundation set by Aim 1. Aim 2 develops methods to optimize experimental design of follow-up studies in one population given results from another. Aim 2a uses the diallel to inform design of CC/CC-RIX/DO experiments. Aim 2b uses partial data on CC/CC-RIX/DO to guide collection of additional data. Aim 3 explores models for jointly analyzing multiple populations in the GRSP, using complementary datasets to stabilize analysis at single QTL (Aim 3a) and across multiple QTL (Aim 3b).  These aims address specific and persistent challenges in the cost-effective design and efficient analysis of multiparent genetic data, in particular the CC, DO, CC-RIX and diallel. The project will generate tools useful for a wide range of model organism crosses and can be applied to the genetic study of any complex disease. The proposed research will lead to improvements in the analysis and design of genetic studies on animal models of human disease. Because the project focuses on statistical methodology applied to experimental mouse populations, the scientific output of the project is expected to be applicable to basic research focusing on any medical condition that can be studied in the mouse.",Statistical Modeling of Complex Traits in Genetic Reference Super-Populations,9126587,R01GM104125,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Anxiety', 'Architecture', 'Asthma', 'Basic Science', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Biomedical Research', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Equilibrium', 'Etiology', 'Experimental Designs', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Crosses', 'Genetic Programming', 'Genetic study', 'Genotype', 'Haplotypes', 'Heart Diseases', 'Human Genetics', 'Hybrids', 'Inbreeding', 'Influentials', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Plug-in', 'Population', 'Population Analysis', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Randomized', 'Recombinants', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Series', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'base', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'design', 'disease phenotype', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'follow-up', 'genetic resource', 'human disease', 'insight', 'interest', 'population based', 'prospective', 'research study', 'response', 'simulation', 'success', 'tool', 'trait']",NIGMS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2016,241086,0.029407183936189803
"Systems genetic and reverse phenotypic analysis of age and retirement DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): High throughput genomic platforms have revealed a profound effect of age on gene expression and gene methylation levels. For example, our integromic analysis of multiple publicly available data sets have identified hundreds of age related genes that can be organized into network modules. These gene sets along with genes and pathways known from the vast literature on aging and longevity provide valuable candidates in allelic association studies of the health and well-being of older Americans. The rich longitudinal data set and the genome wide scans of DNA samples from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) provide a unique resource for evaluating the phenotypic effects of genetic variants underlying aging related genes, gene sets and for developing multivariable models that include behavioral, psychosocial, and genetic factors. This proposal aims to apply systems biologic and systems genetic methods for identifying gene sets based on existing gene expression, gene methylation, and multiple large scale genome wide association studies (GWAS). Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) underlying these genes will then be related to health, cognitive, behavioral, and economic phenotypes using multivariable regression-, machine learning-, and weighted network analysis approaches. An iterative process between SNP and phenotype selection facilitates the definition of clinically and economically important phenotypes under genetic control (reverse phenotyping). The proposal will not only elucidate the genetic and molecular underpinnings of retirement relevant phenotypes (cognitive functioning, psychosocial factors, and health related expenditures) but also lead to a phenotypic annotation of aging related genes and pathways. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: State of the art statistical, computational, and network approaches for integrating genomic data with the valuable phenotypic and genetic data provided by the Health and Retirement Study is expected to lead to the identification of genetic markers relevant for improving the lives of America's older adults.

"Center for Multi- and Trans-ethnic Mapping of Mendelian and Complex Diseases ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The NHGRI Genome Sequencing Program (GSP) will identify genomic variants relevant to health and disease by genome sequencing over 225,000 participants across a multitude of diseases. The GSP will also serve as a pilot for the Precision Medicine Initiative that aims to enroll and sequence more than a million people representative of U.S. ethnic diversity. Here, we propose a GSP analysis center focused on Multi- and Trans- ethnic Mapping of Mendelian and Complex Diseases. There is a growing recognition of the substantial scientific advantages, as well as public health importance, of conducting biomedical research across ethnically diverse cohorts. We propose to develop scalable methods that incorporate ancestry to optimize medical genomic study design and improve power for uncovering the role of common and rare variants in disease. Achieving this goal requires expertise across diverse domains of knowledge including: medical and population genomics, algorithm development for complex disease mapping, and expertise in management of large-scale databases. Here, we have assembled a world-class team of medical and population geneticists, computer scientists, statisticians and clinicians, with leading expertise in the development of novel and scalable strategies for characterizing sequence variants and their role in disease. Importantly, our group has been at the forefront of development of resources, study designs and methods to enable genomic research in U.S. minority populations. Our project has three main objectives. First, we will develop an Automated Scalable Ancestry Pipeline (ASAP) for common disease mapping in diverse populations. ASAP will improve the computational efficiency of existing state-of-the-art methods for ancestry inference and develop important extensions to linear mixed models (LMMs) and other mapping strategies leveraging local and global ancestry. We will also develop methods to refine phenotypes and identify common controls for disease studies and define endpoints. Secondly, we will develop tools and resources for trans- and multi-population rare variant discovery that incorporate patterns of local and sub-continental ancestry. We will also develop machine-learning tools for variant annotation that leverage ancestral information, patterns of sequence evolution, and protein structure in a unified framework. Furthermore, we will incorporate population-specific patterns of cellular phenotypes to improve functional prediction algorithms for non-coding and coding variants. Lastly, we will disseminate our results through web-based resource that empower the biomedical research community. We will augment existing resources including ClinGen by annotating and characterizing pathogenic variants across diverse populations. We will develop a secure web-server that allows sharing of summary statistics and analysis pipelines to enable discovery, fine-mapping and functional prediction of genetic variants. Our team has ample experience with NIH-funded consortia and is dedicated to meeting the overall GSP project goals through collaborative work with NHGRI leadership and other funded investigators.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE The goal of our project is to accelerate the discovery of DNA variation relevant to health and disease by analyzing data from over 225,000 ethnically and racially diverse patients that will undergo genome sequencing. Of particular importance is ensuring we have powerful statistical methods for analyzing data from underserved groups including U.S. minority populations.

"Understanding the functional impacts of genetic variants in mental disorders ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the US, 46% are afflicted with a mental illness at some point of life. The management and treatment of mental disorders pose significant economical and social burden to the society. Many rare and common genetic variants, including SNPs and CNVs, are reported to be associated with mental disorders, yet more remain to be discovered. However, despite the large amount of high-throughput genomics data, there is a lack of integrative methods to systematically prioritize variants that confer susceptibility to mental disorders; additionally, despite the presence of many candidate variants for mental disorders, their disease-contributory mechanism remains elusive, so appropriate functional follow-up experiments cannot be designed. Altogether, these problems resulted in a large gap between the copious amount of data about genetic variation and our understanding of their functional impacts on mental diseases, which ultimately delays the development of targeted therapeutic approaches. To address these problems, we propose to develop a suite of novel bioinformatics approaches: (1) NeuroComplex, an information integration approach that leverages phenotype information and multiple sources of prior biological knowledge to rank genes by their likelihood of contributing to specific phenotypic presentations. (2) integrated MEntal-disorder GEnome Score (iMEGES), which leverages a two-layer strategy to predict the impacts of variants in personal genomes on mental disorders. The first layer uses machine learning algorithm to build variant deleteriousness scores for coding, non-coding and structural variants; the second layer integrates variant scores and NeuroComplex to assign pathogenicity scores. (3) a hierarchical model called CombOmics that incorporates cross-omics information to characterizes how variants confers disease risk, in order to help formulate hypothesis of pathogenicity and facilitate the design of functional follow-up experiments. (4) we will develop user-friendly software tools and web applications that implement all the aforementioned bioinformatics approaches, and continuously release and maintain these tools to ensure the maximum benefits to the scientific community.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We will develop novel informatics approaches to understand how genetic variation impacts various mental disorders, such as schizophrenia and autism.

"Decrypting Variants of Uncertain Significance in Long-QT Syndrome DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Clinical genetic testing has become standard-of-care for many diseases including hundreds of inherited conditions. However, interpreting genetic test results is often confounded by the discovery of 'variants of unknown significance' (VUS) for which there is insufficient data or inadequate predictive tools to establish whether or not a particular variant predisposes to a disease. This problem is particularly vexing for genetic disorders with strong allelic heterogeneity and a preponderance of 'private' mutations such as the congenital long-QT syndrome (LQTS), which predisposes young adults and children to sudden death from cardiac arrhythmias. With the anticipated incorporation of personal exome or genome data into routine clinical care, interpreting VUS will become an even greater challenge especially when variants in genes associated with human disorders are incidentally discovered. Unfortunately, there are no reliable methods to predict a priori whether a given variant predisposes an individual to a particular disorder or whether the change is merely a benign rare variant. We propose to develop a novel paradigm for distinguishing disease-causing mutations from benign variants in LQTS as a model for other inherited arrhythmia syndromes and channelopathies. We will focus on variants in KCNQ1, the most commonly mutated gene in LQTS. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that a holistic predictive model that relates experimentally determined protein structure and dynamics to function and disease is highly accurate even for novel variants. Our ultimate objectives are to develop a data-trained, web-accessible algorithm that classifies VUS discovered in KCNQ1 based on reliable predictions of the structure and dynamics of the affected protein, and to achieve prediction accuracy to levels needed to inform medical decisions. The medical importance of correctly classifying KCNQ1 variants provides strong justification for having a dedicated and highly-tailored gene-specific prediction model. The ability to distinguish deleterious from neutral variants would help avoid unnecessary and potentially harmful interventions in carriers of benign alleles, and save the lives of those with true mutations. We propose to collect extensive electrophysiological, biochemical and structural data on a large set of KCNQ1 variants discovered in LQTS subjects as well as several suspected benign or neutral variants (Aims 1-2), then use these data to iteratively train and validate a machine learning based algorithm that can differentiate benign from deleterious KCNQ1 alleles among a set of new VUS (Aim 3). Our proposal is innovative in the use of a multidisciplinary approach to functionally and structurally annotate genomic variant data for a medically important gene at an unprecedented scale, and then to use these experimental findings to train/test a novel computational system to achieve clinical-grade predictions. Targeting KCNQ1 will also validate an approach for parallel work that can be utilized to predict the medical significance of variants in closely related potassium channels associated with heritable epilepsy (KCNQ2, KCNQ3) or deafness (KCNQ4). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this project is to develop a method to reliably predict the consequences of genetic variants of unknown significance discovered in the course of genetic testing in the congenital long-QT syndrome (LQTS), a cause of sudden cardiac death in children and young adults. We propose a multidisciplinary experimental approach including electrophysiology, biochemistry and structural biology deployed on a large scale to generate information on at least 110 genetic variants in the main gene responsible for LQTS (KCNQ1), which encodes a potassium channel required for normal electrical activity in the heart. Our final product will be a data-trained computational strategy that will outperform existing methods for accurately predicting the functional consequences of novel KCNQ1 genetic variants, enhance the value of genetic testing in LQTS and provide for more informed medical decisions.",Decrypting Variants of Uncertain Significance in Long-QT Syndrome,9111957,R01HL122010,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Anti-Arrhythmia Agents', 'Arrhythmia', 'Benign', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological', 'Cardiac', 'Cell surface', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Defibrillators', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Epilepsy', 'First Degree Relative', 'Genes', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Intervention', 'Ion Channel', 'Link', 'Long QT Syndrome', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Genetics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Online Systems', 'Other Genetics', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Potassium Channel', 'Predisposition', 'Protein Dynamics', 'Proteins', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Structure', 'Sudden Death', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical care', 'deafness', 'design', 'disease-causing mutation', 'exome', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'heart rhythm', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'knowledge base', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'proband', 'protein function', 'protein structure', 'protein transport', 'public health relevance', 'rare variant', 'research study', 'standard of care', 'structural biology', 'sudden cardiac death', 'trafficking', 'variant of unknown significance', 'web-accessible', 'young adult']",NHLBI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2016,1277210,0.006432595804218744
"An Integrative Analysis of Structural Variation for the 1000 Genomes Project DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Structural variation (SV), involving deletions, duplications, insertions and inversions of DNA segments, accounts for a large proportion of human genetic diversity. Comprehensive identification and analysis of these genetic variants will help us more fully elucidate the biology of their functional effects on human health and demography. Despite recent advances, the tools and data needed to comprehensively identify all types of SVs, genotype each variant, integrate and phase these variants remain lacking. Indeed, the data released from the early phases of the 1000 Genomes Project (1000GP) (1000 Genomes Project Consortium, 2010; 1000 Genomes Project Consortium, 2012) are biased primarily towards the detection of deletions within relatively unique regions of the genome. As a consortium, we propose to pool expertise from various research groups to provide an integrative analysis of SVs by combining rigorous computational algorithmic development with extensive experimental validation. The new algorithms we develop and the high confidence lists of SVs obtained will be rapidly made available as a public resource. n/a",An Integrative Analysis of Structural Variation for the 1000 Genomes Project,9208745,U41HG007497,"['Accounting', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Benchmarking', 'Biology', 'Chromosomes', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'DNA', 'DNA Insertion Elements', 'Data', 'Demography', 'Development', 'Future', 'Gene Conversion', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Haplotypes', 'Health', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nucleotides', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Process', 'Reading', 'Repetitive Sequence', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Statistical Models', 'Technology', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'deletion detection', 'design', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'improved', 'integration site', 'method development', 'novel', 'research study', 'tool']",NHGRI,JACKSON LABORATORY,U41,2016,2868077,0.012219207735488265
"Approaches to Genetic Heterogeneity of Obstructive Sleep Apnea ABSTRACT  Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is recognized as an extremely common disorder that results in excessive daytime sleepiness and an increased risk of automobile crashes. It is also an independent risk factor for insulin resistance, hypertension, cardiovascular events, increased cancer rates and cancer mortality, and accelerates the progression of neurodegenerative disorders. OSA is a systemic disorder and the cyclical intermittent hypoxia that occurs during sleep affects every organ system. OSA is heritable, with first degree relatives of individuals with OSA having a two-fold increased risk of the disorder. Although this has been known for over two decades, there are very limited data on gene variants conferring risk or protection for OSA. This is likely the result of underpowered studies and GENETIC HETEROGENEITY. There are multiple pathways to OSA. Obesity is a major risk factor, as are craniofacial dimensions. The relative risk of these different risk factors varies by ethnic group. There are also neuronal mechanisms and other physiological risk factors. This proposal seeks to directly address the issue of genetic heterogeneity using a very large sample of patients and state-of- the-art analysis techniques. Towards this end, we have assembled by far the largest sample of well characterized and genotyped patients with OSA. This is the result of collaboration with key sites in the eMERGE Network [Geisinger, Vanderbilt, Mayo Clinic, Northwestern], Kaiser Permanente Southern California, and the University of Pennsylvania. We propose to carry out a robust genome-wide association studies (GWAS) using an electronic health record (EHR) derived case definition and quantitative trait analysis of OSA severity. We will use novel machine learning approaches to specifically address genetic heterogeneity. The GWAS approach will be complimented by a PheWAS strategy as another approach to identifying common variants and related clinical phenotypes. Specifically, we will look for variants that associate with OSA and other clinical diagnoses in the EHR. It is likely that gene variants for OSA will have pleiotropic effects. Gene variants identified from GWAS and/or PheWAS will be further assessed. First, we will use available whole exome sequencing data to see if there are relevant rare variants in these genes, as well as to perform exploratory discovery analyses to look for novel rare variation. The functional role of the genes identified will be studied by functional network analysis. Finally, we will assess associations with quantitative data on intermediate traits identified by high throughput craniofacial and intra-oral photography. These data are currently available within the Sleep Apnea Global Interdisciplinary Consortium (SAGIC). Future directions will assess the function of the genes identified in model systems and the clinical utility of utilizing variants as part of risk stratification for OSA. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common disorder with multiple adverse consequences. It is known that OSA has a genetic basis, but to date no convincing gene variants have been identified. This study uses state of the art approaches to identifying relevant genes based on a very large sample of patients with OSA obtained from multiple institutions in the United States. It is by far the largest study ever proposed for identifying genes for this common sleep disorder.",Approaches to Genetic Heterogeneity of Obstructive Sleep Apnea,9177170,R01HL134015,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Automobiles', 'Biological Models', 'Bladder', 'California', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ethnic group', 'Event', 'Excessive Daytime Sleepiness', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'First Degree Relative', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hypertension', 'Hypoxia', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Nature', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Obesity', 'Obstructive Sleep Apnea', 'Oral', 'Participant', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Phenotype', 'Photography', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Relative Risks', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Apnea Syndromes', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Stratification', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Tissues', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Vehicle crash', 'Woman', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'body system', 'case control', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical phenotype', 'cohort', 'craniofacial', 'disorder risk', 'exome sequencing', 'gene discovery', 'gene function', 'genetic association', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'genotyped patients', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'men', 'mortality', 'novel', 'phenome', 'pleiotropism', 'precision medicine', 'rare variant', 'soft tissue', 'trait']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2016,740775,-0.058820631998501

"Genetic predictors of anti-TNF treatment response and infections in IBD DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) affect over 1.4 million Americans. Over the past 15 years, considerable progress has been made in the therapy of CD and UC with monoclonal antibodies against tumor necrosis factor � (anti-TNF) representing the most significant therapeutic breakthrough. However, many patients fail to respond adequately. Recent genome wide associations studies (GWAS) have significantly increased our understanding of the pathogenesis of CD and UC. The role of these genetic variants in predicting response to anti-TNF therapy is yet to be defined adequately. In addition, significant safety concerns remain with the use of these agents with serious infections occurring in up to 10% of patients. There is a strong genetic component to susceptibility to infections, in particular involving polymorphisms in innate immunity. Given the key role of innate immunity in IBD pathogenesis, whether such shared polymorphisms also influence risk of infections on anti-TNF therapy has not been examined previously. Thus, the development of tools to define likelihood of treatment response and infections are a key unmet need in the field. Our overarching objective is to identify clinical and genetic predictors of both short-term and long-term response as well as infectious complications of anti-TNF therapy. To achieve these aims, we will utilize the complementary strengths of two large cohorts - a prospective registry cohort of over 1200 patients with CD or UC, and a novel EMR-based cohort of over 11,000 patients with CD or UC linked to a biospecimen repository. This proposal utilizes the mentorship and significant expertise in key areas including analytical genetics, translational immunology, and bioinformatics and allows the candidate to develop fundamental skills in these novel content areas and research methods. The access to expertise at the NIH-funded center Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside, the Center for Study of Inflammatory Bowel Disease, and the Broad Institute is a key strength of this application. This career development award will be critical in providing training in bioinformatics and genetic epidemiology, thus contributing to the candidate's long-term goal of establishing an independent IBD research career with focus on defining at-risk cohorts and personalizing therapy. The training component of the award includes graduate-level courses in the relevant content areas in genetic epidemiology, and bioinformatics at the Harvard Medical School, School of Public Health, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The candidate will continue to actively engage with an established group of multidisciplinary researchers who have demonstrated the utility of the EMR-based approach to accurately define autoimmune diseases, link it to biospecimen collection, and use it successfully for genotyping-phenotype research. This will help foster collaborative development of future proposals as the work proposed in this application has the potential for applicability in other cohorts. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The novel information gained from this study regarding genetic predictors of treatment response and infectious complications has the potential to transform clinical practice by leading to clinical trials focused on selected cohorts of patients most likely to respond to therapies with low risk of adverse events, thus preventing unnecessary exposure to potentially toxic therapies with low likelihood of benefit. Such work is a step toward developing personalized medicine approaches to tailor therapy based on likelihood of benefit and risk. The methodology developed here will also have applications in other EMR-based cohorts to investigate novel therapeutic agents and disease outcomes.",Genetic predictors of anti-TNF treatment response and infections in IBD,9070599,K23DK097142,"['Address', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor Therapy', 'Antibodies', 'Area', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Award', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'CD14 gene', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Comorbidity', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Crohn&apos', 's disease', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease remission', 'Exposure to', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Research', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human Genetics', 'IL1R1 gene', 'Immune response', 'Immunology', 'Immunosuppressive Agents', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Informatics', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Interferons', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Massachusetts', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Monoclonal Antibodies', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Immunity', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Pneumonia', 'Predisposition', 'Public Health Schools', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Sepsis', 'Source', 'Structure', 'TNF gene', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor Therapy', 'Ulcerative Colitis', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'adaptive immunity', 'base', 'career', 'clinical practice', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'cost', 'genetic epidemiology', 'genetic predictors', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'immune function', 'medical schools', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient registry', 'personalized medicine', 'predicting response', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'repository', 'response', 'skills', 'tool development', 'translational genetics', 'treatment response']",NIDDK,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K23,2016,169572,0.00042750634871423476
"Discovery and analysis of structural variation in whole genome sequences DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     The whole genome sequencing of large cohorts of individuals is quickly becoming a common tool for researchers to investigate the genetic basis of many disease phenotypes. The primary goals are to discover the underlying genetic variation that cause or contribute to these diseases as well as to correctly identify these variants in a diagnostic setting. These differences typicall consist of single base changes (SNPs), but can also encompass larger, more complex chromosomal rearrangements in the form of structural variation (SV) which are much more difficult to detect even with modern sequencing technologies. A number of approaches have been published that have studied this problem, but even the largest scale endeavors have only focused on deletion events and reported a sensitivity of <70%. Complex chromosomal rearrangements are even less well studied. Thus, it is paramount that accurate methods are developed which can detect all types of SVs at high specificity from sequence data. This proposal aims to improve the overall ability of researchers to identify and analyze genetic variation from whole genome sequences. An important, and often overlooked, aspect of SV discovery is the fact that typical paired-end, read depth, and split read approaches will identify different sets of non-overlapping variants at varying degrees of accuracy. In Aim 1, we will develop a unified SV discovery algorithm that can incorporate all of these different sources of information in a probabilistic fashion. Such a method would be useful for research, in particular with the identification of rare variants, as well as clinical applications which require a great del of accuracy and have thus far been limited to older karyotyping and microarray approaches. This would identify the majority of structural variants, however there are many regions in genomic sequences which are complex in nature, defined as consisting of multiple neighboring or overlapping chromosomal rearrangements that are challenging to resolve with typical SV detection approaches. In Aim 2, we propose methods to resolve these complex regions and assess their frequency and impact. Furthermore, a crucial step in medical genetics is the comparison of identified genetic mutations to databases of known pathogenic and benign variants. This is currently problematic with SVs, as they have often been originally reported with varying degrees of breakpoint resolution that can hamper the correct assignment of the variant. This issue is compounded further in more complex regions with multiple breakpoints, for which simplistic comparison methods do not work well. In Aim 3, we will develop and implement a system that describes and utilizes variant profiles to identify whether an individual's sequence data contains a variant of interest. Overall, this project will advance our understanding of the human genome as well as provide tools for use in the general research and clinical communities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     The rearrangement of chromosomal material in the form of structural variation is directly responsible for many disease phenotypes, however our ability to detect and resolve these events from whole genome sequence data is currently limited. We propose a number of strategies for improving the detection and analysis of structural genomic variation between individuals and resolving their underlying structure and function.

"Biomedical Computing and Informatics Strategies for Infectious Disease Research ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): An important goal of infectious disease research is to develop genetic predictors of susceptibility. Our success in this endeavor will depend critically on the informatics methods and software that are available for making sense of high-dimensional genetic and genomic data. The goal of this research program is to develop, evaluate, distribute and support new and novel biomedical computing algorithms and open-source software for identifying combinations of genetic predictors of clinically important infectious disease outcomes. This application will target the growing body of rare genetic variants identified by high-throughput DNA sequencing. Our clinical application will focus on the prediction of antiretroviral response in clinical trials for HIV/AIDS. We propose here a highly innovative Hierarchical Rare Variant Collapsing Machine (HRVCM) algorithm for identifying and collapsing combinations of rare variants across gene regions (AIM 1). We will then integrate these new collapsed HRVCM variables into our popular Multifactor Dimensionality Reduction (MDR) method that will assess them in combination with common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from genome-wide association studies or GWAS (AIM 2). Our novel HRVCM-MDR approach will, for the first time, make it possible to assess non-additive interactions among sets of rare and common variants simultaneously in genetic studies of infectious diseases. We will apply these new and novel methods to approximately 13 million rare and common variants from nearly 3000 subjects that participated in an AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) study to evaluate risk for virologic failure with efavirenz-containing antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimens (AIM 3). Finally, we will release all methods as open source to the biomedical research community through our freely available MDR software package (AIM 4).         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The overall goal of this application is to develop innovative new computational methods for the genetic analysis of infectious diseases.

"Regulation of mRNA splicing by intronic genetic variants ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Genetic variations in introns commonly impact cellular functions by causing alterations in mRNA splicing. The abnormal inclusion and exclusion of exons often change protein functions and cellular phenotypes. Although many intronic variations have known functions, with the adoption of next generation sequencing, many more intronic variants have been discovered for which the functional impact is unknown. Thus, it is important to be able to predict the impact of the variants without needing to test them all in expensive and laborious assays. Although there are informatics algorithms that predict the impact of genetic variants on pre-mRNA splicing, their ability to predict the effect on protein function and ultimately disease and therapeutic phenotypes is lacking. In addition, there is a need for high-throughput cellular assays to test the results of these predictions on cellular functions. The studies proposed here will fulfill these needs by developing algorithms that prioritize the intronic variants by their potential impact on splicing and gene function, and developing a high-throughput assay to functionally test thousands of these predictions. These novel technologies will be applied to the effect of intronic variants on the pharmacogenomics of two clinically important oncology drugs, clofarabine and paclitaxel. Our long-term goals are to be able to predict the functional impact of genomic variants on human disease and therapeutic response. Our central hypothesis is that intronic genetic variants alter mRNA splicing and consequently protein function that ultimately affects the cellular response to drug therapy. Our first aim will be to develop computational algorithms that prioritize intronic variants based on their impacts on pre-mRNA splicing and protein function. Using a variety of genomic and structural features and large sets of genomic data, we will develop a bioinformatics algorithm specifically designed to prioritize intronic variants based on their potential impacts on pre-mRNA splicing and protein function. Our second aim will be to identify functional intronic variants associated with drug-induced cytotoxicity. Using existing genomics and cellular cytotoxic response data from populations of human cell lines, we will identify functional intronic variants that contribute to individuals' responses to clofarabine and paclitaxel cytotoxicity. Our third aim will be to functionally test the impact of the prioritized intronic variants on pre-mRNA splicing and drug cytotoxicity. Using our novel high- throughput functional splicing assay, we will test the effects of predicted functional variants from Aim 2 on pre- mRNA splicing. In addition, we will validate the effect of the intronic variants on cytotoxicity using exon specific siRNA and CRISPR/Cas technology to manipulate the target gene splicing. Upon completion of these studies, we expect to have developed bioinformatics algorithms that can accurately prioritize the intronic variants based on their functional impact on pre-mRNA splicing and protein function. Also, we will have tested thousands of variants in a cellular pre-mRNA splicing assay and validated the impact of several of these functional variants on paclitaxel and clofarabine cytotoxicity.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Project Narrative The goal of this project is to design and implement a set of bioinformatics algorithms and high-throughput experimental assays for prioritizing functional intronic variants that contribute to phenotypic differences by affecting pre-mRNA splicing. The developed model, including a molecular validation component, will be used to systematically evaluate the functions of such variants that are associated with drug-induced cytotoxicity. The same strategy can also be used to study the etiology of complex diseases.

"Statistical Tests for Mapping Genetic Determinants of Complex Traits ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Genotyping and emerging sequencing technologies have enabled comprehensive interrogation of genetic variation across the human genome, thereby facilitating a study's ability to map genetic variants that influence phenotypes of interes. Nevertheless, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and next-generation sequencing (NGS) projects have uncovered only a limited number of trait-influencing loci. While large increases in sample size will improve power to detect such variation, the ascertainment and sequencing/genotyping of such samples are costly and inefficient. Therefore, it is desirable to increase power to detect such variants without requiring additional sample collection. We propose novel methods for improved gene mapping of common and rare susceptibility variants that move beyond standard strategies typically applied to GWAS and NGS studies of complex traits. The first topic we consider is pleiotropic or cross- phenotype effects of genetic variants. Empirical studies have suggested that pleiotropy is widespread throughout the genome and that leveraging this additional information for gene mapping yields a more powerful analysis than an analysis that ignores such information. In Aim 1, we propose novel statistical methods for genetic analysis of high-dimensional phenotype data using an innovative kernel distance-covariance (KDC) framework that allows for an arbitrary number of phenotypes both continuous and/or categorical in nature, as well as an arbitrary number of genotypes (permitting gene-based testing of both rare and common variants). We will use the KDC framework to implement tests of pleiotropy as well as tests of mediation. The second topic we consider is the mapping of rare susceptibility variants using affected pedigrees, which provide many attractive features for rare-variant testing that case-control studies lack. In Aim 2, we propose a series of powerful statistical methods for rare-variant association testing in affected pedigrees that are based on a framework (recently published in AJHG) for rare-variant association testing in affected sibships. The existing framework compares rare-variant burden in a region by an affected sib pair to the number of regions that pairs shares identical by descent. We have shown the method is more powerful than case-control association testing given fixed sample size and further is robust to population stratification. In this proposal, we will extend the framework to handle affected pedigrees of arbitrary size and structure (rather than just affected sib pairs) and devise a powerful two-stage screening and validation strategy for rare-variant mapping that first compares familial cases in the pedigrees to external controls and then follows up the most interesting findings using an independent test based on our identity-by-descent sharing statistic among the affected relatives used in the first stage. We will apply the methods in Aims 1-2 to relevant data from genetic studies of complex traits in which we are directly involved. We also will implement the methods in public user-friendly software (Aim 3).         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this project is to develop a set of statistical approaches to investigate two important topics in gene- mapping studies of complex human traits. First, we will develop techniques for identifying genes that have pleiotropic effects on phenotypes of possibly high dimension and further assess whether such genes have direct effects on such phenotypes or indirect effects through other possible factors. Second, we will develop tools to facilitate identification of rare polymorphic variation that increase risk for complex disease using data from affected pedigrees of arbitrary size and structure. We will evaluate these methods using simulated data and illustrate their value by applying them to genetic projects of complex traits in which we are actively involved. Application of the proposed methods to these datasets should improve our understanding of the genetic origins of various complex traits.                ",Statistical Tests for Mapping Genetic Determinants of Complex Traits,9055844,R01GM117946,"['Affect', 'Applied Genetics', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Family', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genetic study', 'Genets', 'Genome', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mediation', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Nature', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Siblings', 'Signal Transduction', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stratification', 'Structure', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'case control', 'design', 'flexibility', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic association', 'genetic pedigree', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genome-wide analysis', 'human disease', 'identity by descent', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'pleiotropism', 'public health relevance', 'rare variant', 'risk variant', 'sample collection', 'screening', 'statistics', 'tool', 'trait', 'user friendly software']",NIGMS,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,309883,-0.03120673911339873
"F-CAP: Functionalization of Variants in Clinically Actionable Pharmacogenes ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Patient-to-patient variability in response to drugs creates a significant challenge for the safe and effective treatment of many human diseases. Pharmacogenomics seeks to address this challenge by linking drug response to patient genotypes at important loci, termed pharmacogenes, in order to better customize patient treatments. Genetic variation in pharmacogenes is extensive. For example, amongst 12 CYP genes, 10% of people carry at least one rare, potentially deleterious variant. Unfortunately, only a small number of variants have been unambiguously linked to alterations in drug response. Clearly, new approaches are needed to annotate the consequences of the huge pool of variants of unknown significance, including those already identified by existing large-scale sequencing programs, and those that will be discovered as clinical sequencing becomes routine. In this proposal, we seek to address this problem directly and at a scale never before possible by taking advantage of new technologies in sequencing and functional analysis. Our resource, termed F-CAP (Functionalization of Variants in Clinically Actionable Pharmacogenes) will test all possible substitutions at all amino acid residues in some of the most clinically important pharmacogenes and disseminate these data to the medical and research communities. In order to accomplish this, we will use deep mutational scanning, a method we have developed that allows parallelized, and quantitative measurements to be performed on libraries of genetic variants. In Aim 1 we will create these libraries, starting with five of the most important CPIC level A or B priority genes (CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, TPMT and VKORC1), and test the stability and enzymatic activity of each variant en masse using a pooled selection strategy. In Aim 2, we will integrate these data to create an impact score. This impact score provides a numerical value for a variant's functional effects that is amenable to easy integration into prescribing guidelines being developed by the pharmacogenomics community. Aim 3 will validate this score for a subset of variants that span the impact score spectrum using therapeutically relevant substrates for each pharmacogene. Finally, Aim 4 describes a key component of this resource: the dissemination of our findings to the entire pharmacogenomics community through partnership with CPIC and PharmGKB. In addition, we will make available our raw and processed data via a custom web resource that will also be developed in Aim 4. This resource will provide a series of fully annotated datasets describing the functional consequences of every possible single mutation in a series of key pharmacogenes, thereby greatly advancing the field of personalized medicine. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Pharmacogenomics seeks to identify genetic sources of inter-individual variability in drug response, with the goal of personalizing drug selection and dose to improve patient outcomes. A key barrier to using pharmacogenomic information is lack of clarity about the functional impact of variants, which hampers the provision of clear, unambiguous guidance to health care providers. We propose to connect pharmacogenomic variant discovery with novel high-throughput experimental approaches to deliver a resource to guide the use of individual pharmacogenomic information in personalizing drug treatment.",F-CAP: Functionalization of Variants in Clinically Actionable Pharmacogenes,9110269,R24GM115277,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Amino Acids', 'Applications Grants', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Assay', 'CYP2C19 gene', 'CYP2C9 gene', 'CYP2D6 gene', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Cellular Assay', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dose', 'Elements', 'Funding', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'High-Throughput DNA Sequencing', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Large-Scale Sequencing', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Research', 'Methods', 'Monoclonal Antibody R24', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Numerical value', 'Output', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Plant Roots', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Resources', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Source', 'TPMT gene', 'Testing', 'Translations', 'Variant', 'clinical sequencing', 'clinically actionable', 'computerized data processing', 'effective therapy', 'exome', 'genetic disorder diagnosis', 'genetic information', 'genetic variant', 'genotyped patients', 'human disease', 'improved', 'interest', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'personalized medicine', 'programs', 'response', 'stability testing', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'variant of unknown significance']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R24,2016,747826,0.007708919162377576
"Mechanisms underlying complex trait human disease DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is now an explosion of new genome scale data relating genetic variation within the human population to phenotype, and particularly to common disease. Microarray technology has identified 100s of loci where the presence of particular variants is associated with altered risk of many common diseases; complete sequencing of individual exomes in cancer samples has discovered many somatic mutations in a variety of genes; and sequencing of 1000 human genomes has provided an almost complete inventory of common population variants. Further, these data are only the first in an ever-increasing flood, as even faster and cheaper sequencing technologies come on line. The results hold promise for major advances in treatment and diagnosis of common human diseases. Extracting the expected benefits is not straightforward, and will necessitate acquiring detailed knowledge of the mechanisms linking genetic variation to disease. This project focuses on one aspect of this challenge - using the new genomic data to identify new therapeutic opportunities. We will investigate those principles underlying complex trait disease that are particularly relevant to tha goal. We introduce a three stage mechanistic framework, relating genomic variation to the function of impacted gene products, the impact of these altered functions on pathways, processes and subsystems; and finally the consequences for complex trait disease phenotypes. We will develop computational methods to address key questions concerning three major aspects of the framework (1) How large are the changes in protein function brought about by the genomic variants underlying complex trait disease? What role do different classes of genomic and protein level mechanism, such as expression, non-synonymous changes and splicing, play in these variants? (2) How complete is the set genes with strong influence on the disease phenotypes discovered by current technologies, and how can missing genes be imputed from the genomic and network data? (3) What is the distribution of coupling between the activity of genes involved in disease mechanism and disease phenotypes? The results will deepen understanding of these aspects of complex disease, and provide a basis for identifying potential new drug targets from GWAS and other genomic studies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: New technologies are now providing extensive information on human genetic variation associated with increased risk of a wide range of common human disease, such as Alzheimer's, diabetes, heart disease, and many cancers. These data hold the promise for the development of new therapies, and realizing those benefits requires the acquisition of complementary knowledge of the mechanisms that link genetic variation to disease risk.

"VENTRICLES, CORPUS CALLOSUM, SYMPTOMS & MIR137 IN LARGE N STUDY OF SCHIZOPHRENIA This R21 application proposes to use a large cohort of schizophrenia and healthy control subjects (2415 subjects) from the GENUS Consortium to clarify morphometric and genetic aspects of the corpus callosum (CC) and the lateral ventricles (LV) in schizophrenia (SZ). Our preliminary data indicate that LV and CC volume abnormalities are correlated in SZ, and index global functioning. Although abnormalities of LV and CC are hallmark of SZ and appear together in neurodevelopmental syndromes, LV and CC have rarely been studied together in SZ. Genetically, LV and CC are highly correlated, nonetheless the specific genetic determinants of this relationship are currently unknown. Recently, the SZ associated genetic risk variant miR137 has been shown to associate with LV and whole brain diffusion abnormalities in SZ where the two measures correlate. MiR137 has also been associated with poor cognitive and high negative symptoms load SZ, characterized by poor global functioning. By employing the unprecedented power of the GENUS cohort we will be able to clarify what appears to be a convergence of neuroimaging, symptomatology, cognitive measures and genetics information of LV and CC, and their relationship in one single large population of SZ and HC. This study is expected to provide novel data on the junction between morphometric measures of the corpus callosum and the lateral ventricles, their genetic background and their relation with symptoms and cognition in SZ and to identify subgroups of SZ based on these variables. The long term ramification of this proposal is the identification of novel therapeutic targets, based on miR137. T herapeutics based on miRNA, like miR137, are already been used in phase I cancer clinical trials, a disease that like SZ is polygenic. Finally, our study will reveal new information on the genetics of SZ and its relationship to symptomatology and brain variables. The lateral ventricles and corpus callosum are genetically correlated, and are often abnormal in schizophrenia, nonetheless, the genetic determinants of their relationship in schizophrenia remains unknown. Accordingly, we will employ the largest known population of schizophrenia and healthy subjects available, which includes morphometric, functional, cognitive and genetic data (2514 subjects), where we will analyze abnormalities of the lateral ventricles and the corpus callosum, and their relationship in schizophrenia. Volumetric and diffusion data will be explored for association with one of the strongest SZ associated genetic risk variant, MIR137, and with other genes, also SZ associated and themselves regulated by MIR137 and the outcome will be the identification of schizophrenia subgroups for more targeted intervention.","VENTRICLES, CORPUS CALLOSUM, SYMPTOMS & MIR137 IN LARGE N STUDY OF SCHIZOPHRENIA",9245247,R21MH109819,"['Affect', 'Architecture', 'Attention', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Caucasians', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Communication', 'Corpus Callosum', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diffusion', 'Disease', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Fiber', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Variation', 'Height', 'Heritability', 'Impaired cognition', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modality', 'Neurobehavioral Manifestations', 'Neurobiology', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Proxy', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Schizophrenia', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'TCF7L2 gene', 'Techniques', 'United States', 'Variant', 'axonal degeneration', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'cancer clinical trial', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'disability', 'genetic association', 'genetic information', 'genome wide association study', 'indexing', 'individualized medicine', 'insight', 'lateral ventricle', 'learning strategy', 'morphometry', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroinflammation', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'risk variant', 'symptomatology', 'trend']",NIMH,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,R21,2016,240505,0.021157246982496443
"Genomics-based prediction of antibiotic failure in S. aureus infections ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    The Gram positive bacterium Staphylococcus aureus is both an asymptomatic human colonizer and a pathogen that can cause infections in multiple tissue sites, including blood, skin and soft tissue, bone, and internal organs. Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a common cause of death by hospital infections (HA-MRSA) and is now also a common community acquired infection (CA-MRSA). Vancomycin (a glycopeptide antibiotic) is the most commonly prescribed drug to treat MRSA infections. High-level resistance (minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) ≥16 μg/ml) to vancomycin encoded by the mobile vanA gene is rare due to a fitness burden on S. aureus. However, it is more common to encounter strains with mutations conferring intermediate resistance to vancomycin arising from selection during the course of antibiotic therapy. The genetic basis of these vancomycin intermediate S. aureus (VISA) and heterogeneous resistant (hVISA) (MIC 2-8 μg/ml) strains involves a large number of different genomic mutations that result in cell wall thickening through changes in cellular signaling and regulation. Routine phenotypic testing in clinical labs probably underestimates the incidence of VISA and hVISA. Due to the fact that mutations in several genes have been linked with VISA, genetic-based detection of intermediate vancomycin resistance has not been developed for routine clinical microbiological use. In our preliminary work, we created an extensive catalog of sequenced clinical and laboratory-selected VISA as well as databases of SNPs and genetic variation in thousands of public S. aureus genomes. In this work we plan to extend these studies toward development of a sequence-based testing protocol that could be used for large numbers of clinical strains. In Specific Aim 1 we plan to extend our knowledge of the mutations that cause VISA by sequencing a panel of 300 novel mutants strains spontaneously selected from 40 S. aureus parent genotypes. We estimate, based on the results of the preliminary data, that this number of strains will be sufficient identify mutations found in 95% of VISA strains. These data will be used for creation of a comprehensive VISA detection assay based on whole genome data with an accuracy of at least 95%. In Specific Aim 2 we will use the information learned from Aim 1 to create a multiplex PCR sequence test for VISA, VRSA and other resistance determinants of S. aureus based on the commercially available Fluidigm platform. We will ultimately aim to have an assay that can be used to monitor systemic MRSA infections, such as bacteremia, to detect development of VISA in its early stages in clinical specimens from the patient. The test will also be able to detect other S. aureus resistance phenotypes and call the genotype of the strain.             PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Vancomycin is an antibiotic commonly used to treat methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections in chronically ill patients. The efficacy of this relatively cheap and well-tolerated therapy is compromised by mutations in the genome of the bacterium. In this project we propose to develop a genetic test based on a library of MRSA genome sequences with known antibiotic susceptibility level that identifies bacteria with diminished resistance to vancomycin.            ",Genomics-based prediction of antibiotic failure in S. aureus infections,9017369,R21AI121860,"['Address', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotic susceptibility', 'Antibiotics', 'Bacteremia', 'Bacteria', 'Base Sequence', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Wall', 'Chronically Ill', 'Clinical', 'Community-Acquired Infections', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Evolution', 'Failure', 'Frequencies', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Glycopeptide Antibiotics', 'Goals', 'Gram-Positive Bacteria', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Infection', 'Intermediate resistance', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Methicillin', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Mutation', 'Nosocomial Infections', 'Organ', 'Parents', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Protocols documentation', 'Regulation', 'Resistance', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Skin Tissue', 'Specimen', 'Staging', 'Staphylococcus aureus', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Treatment Failure', 'University Hospitals', 'Vancomycin', 'Vancomycin Resistance', 'Vancomycin-resistant S. aureus', 'Variant', 'Virulence', 'Work', 'base', 'bone', 'clinical sequencing', 'design', 'economic cost', 'fitness', 'genetic predictors', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'interest', 'methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus', 'mortality', 'mutant', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'pleiotropism', 'public health relevance', 'soft tissue', 'tool', 'whole genome']",NIAID,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R21,2016,234000,0.006126421732707873
"NHGRI PAGE Coordinating Center DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): NHGRI developed the Population Architecture Using Genomics and Epidemiology (PAGE) research program to identify and characterize genomic variants in non-European populations. To support the complexities of such an ambitious effort, we have convened a strong team of statistical, population, and molecular geneticists, computer and information scientists, biostatisticians, and project management staff with many years of related experience to serve as a Coordinating Center (CC). Specifically, the CC will serve as a centralized resource to facilitate and support the activities of the program and Study Investigators focused on characterization of causal variants by: (1) coordinating phenotype harmonization efforts, including mapping phenotype variables across studies and to the PhenX measures; (2) synthesizing individual-level data into centralized datasets to facilitate sharing of data within and outside of PAGE; (3) utilizing state-of-the-art computer and information science support and scientific workflows that will facilitate analyses, ancestry deconvolution, genotype calling and imputation, SNP annotation, and data synthesis; (4) rapidly disseminating all study data via dbGaP and/or the PAGE website or other applicable databases; and (5) serving as a centralized resource to facilitate, support, and manage program activities and logistics as requested by the Steering Committee or Project Office and as needed for successful coordination of the program. Coordination of the program will be done in a spirit of collaboration using creative and flexible approaches, while providing leadership in statistical genetic methodologies and approaches to project management. The ultimate goal of our CC is to facilitate the identification and characterization of genotype-phenotype associations, especially as relevant to non-European populations, thereby accelerating our understanding of ancestral differences in the genetic and environmental causes of common diseases. Critical to achieving this mission is the deployment of powerful methods for ancestry deconvolution, multi- and trans-ethnic mapping, and imputation. Building upon our success as the PAGE I CC, we have added additional investigators with expertise in these areas and consortium experience with next-generation sequence analysis of both whole-genome and exome data. Our collaborative team is ideally staffed to meet the challenges of the new round of PAGE.

"High-resolution map of human germline mutation patterns and inference of mutagenic mechanisms ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mutations are the ultimate source of genetic variation and one of the driving forces of evolution. Both the absolute mutation rate and the relative rate among mutation subtypes fluctuate along the genome, affected by adjacent nucleotide motifs and local features such as GC content and replication timing. Characterizing regional variation of mutation patterns is critical for understanding genome evolution and to identify variants causing genetic diseases. However, mutation rate and molecular spectrum are difficult to measure at high resolution, genomewide, and in an unbiased fashion. Estimates based on common variants and between- species substitutions are confounded by natural selection, population demographic history, and biased gene conversion (BGC). Methods relying on incidence rates of monogenic diseases or finding de novo variants by trio sequencing can inform global trends, but do not provide sufficient data to assess fine-scale local parameters. This study will overcome these limitations by using the extremely rare variants (ERVs) as a new data source to characterize patterns of recent germline variation in humans. ERVs, defined in this study as singletons in 30,000 samples, are becoming available via large-scale whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of population samples. Unlike common variants or substitutions, ERVs arose very recently and are largely unaffected by selection, BGC, etc. We will analyze 200-300 million singleton variants observed in 30,000 subjects at 20-30X coverage. The regional distribution of ERV subtypes will establish a quantitative atlas of the rate and spectrum of human germline mutations mostly unaltered by selection. We will share this resource with the research community and apply it to determine the impact of local genomic features and epigenomic attributes. We will use the systematic departures between ERVs and variants of higher frequencies (polymorphisms and substitutions) to infer local effects of selection, and this may uncover hitherto unknown functional regions of the genome. By comparing mutation signatures in ERVs with those in somatic variations observed in diverse cancers we will attribute distinct mutational signatures to known biochemical processes and thus infer the major contributors to new germline mutations in the human genome. This subtype-specific atlas will also be used to predict the probability of observing every possible single-base mutation in the genome, thus facilitating the interpretation of candidate causal variants of human diseases. We will assess mutation pattern differences among European Americans, African Americans and Latinos, and seek to discover genetic modifiers of germline mutation rate by finding functionally damaging mutations that show increased ERV counts in the surrounding genomic region, potentially identifying both known and previous unknown ""mutator"" genes that play a role in transmission fidelity in humans. This research will provide an essential resource to study the genesis and maintenance of germline mutations in humans. Understanding such a fundamental process will be the basis for a deeper understanding of human evolution and diseases.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We will study the patterns of inherited mutations in humans using approximately 250 million extremely rare DNA variants in human populations. Our results will allow the prediction of the rate of new mutations at every site in the genome based on features of the surrounding DNA sequence, thus providing a common resource to study the arrival and maintenance of mutations in humans. Understanding such a basic process is important for answering fundamental questions in human evolution, the cause of inherited diseases, and the role of DNA abnormality in cancer and aging.            ",High-resolution map of human germline mutation patterns and inference of mutagenic mechanisms,9083570,R01GM118928,"['Address', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'American', 'Atlases', 'Biochemical Process', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Child', 'Chromatin', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Demographic Factors', 'Dependence', 'Disease', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'European', 'Evolution', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Gene Conversion', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Recombination', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Germ-Line Mutation', 'Guanine + Cytosine Composition', 'Hereditary Disease', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Human Genome', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Internet', 'Latino', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mendelian disorder', 'Methods', 'Mismatch Repair', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutation', 'Natural Selections', 'Nucleotides', 'Parents', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resource Sharing', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Selection Bias', 'Site', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Source', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'actionable mutation', 'base', 'data sharing', 'density', 'driving force', 'epigenomics', 'genetic evolution', 'genome sequencing', 'genome-wide', 'human disease', 'improved', 'next generation sequencing', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'rare variant', 'repository', 'transmission process', 'trend', 'whole genome']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2016,300999,-0.002496027609216873
"Integrative interpretation of the organismal consequences of non-coding variation ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our capacity to sequence human genomes has exceeded our ability to interpret genetic variation, particularly in non-coding regions. To address this challenge, we recently developed a novel framework, Combined Annotation Dependent Depletion (CADD), for estimating the deleteriousness of any genetic variant. CADD defines an objective, data-rich, and quantitative integration of many genomic annotations into a single measure of variant effect at the organismal level. The goals of this R01 proposal are to further develop the CADD framework, to apply it in the context of ongoing genetic studies of both rare and common human diseases, and to experimentally evaluate its predictions. In Specific Aim 1, we will substantially modify CADD in both straightforward and creative ways, with the goal of dramatically improving CADD's ability to annotate non- coding variants, not only to estimate their organismal effects but also to provide insights into molecular mechanisms. In Specific Aim 2, we will apply CADD to a variety of ongoing whole genome sequencing studies of human disease, especially those in which non-coding variants are either known or suspected to be causal. As part of this effort, we will develop new statistical frameworks that directly incorporat CADD into traditional genome-wide discovery approaches. In Specific Aim 3, we will perform a combination of high-throughput (massively parallel reporter assays), medium-throughput (CRISPR/Cas9), and low-throughput (in vivo mouse transgenics) experimental assays for systematic and targeted assessment of CADD predictions. This proposal includes both computational and experimental innovations, and builds on established collaborative relationships between investigators with complementary strengths. The completion of our aims will yield novel methods, data, and resources with which to annotate whole genome sequences, broadly enabling the field to more effectively identify and mechanistically understand non-coding genetic variants that are causally relevant to human disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: As we enter an era of personalized medicine, a deep understanding of human genomes will be increasingly important to public health, contributing to the unraveling of the genetic basis of human disease, as well as serving an increasing role in clinical diagnostics. However, our limited understanding of the functional consequences of most genetic variants, especially those that do not alter protein sequence, represents a major obstacle. This proposal seeks to dramatically improve our ability to identify and interpret ""non-coding"" variants that causally contribute to human disease. A recently developed computational approach will be substantially improved and evaluated in a variety of genetic studies, and its predictions will be experimentally validated. This project will provide much needed methods and resources to address the looming analytical challenges associated with individual whole genome sequencing in both biomedical research and patient care.",Integrative interpretation of the organismal consequences of non-coding variation,9024484,R01CA197139,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Biomedical Research', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cell Line', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Clinical', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Code', 'Complex Genetic Trait', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Event', 'Feedback', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Genomic approach', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Biology', 'Human Genetics', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mendelian disorder', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Nucleotides', 'Organism', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patient Care', 'Peptide Sequence Determination', 'Phenotype', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'RNA Binding', 'RNA Splicing', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Site', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Translating', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Untranslated Regions', 'Variant', 'Vocabulary', 'Weight', 'base', 'candidate identification', 'disease phenotype', 'exome', 'exome sequencing', 'follow-up', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic pedigree', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genome-wide', 'human disease', 'human genome sequencing', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'insight', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'personalized medicine', 'research study', 'trait', 'transcription factor', 'whole genome']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2016,636532,0.0005880095672300069
"Predicting causal non-coding variants in a founder population DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In order to characterize the molecular and cellular causes of human disease, it will be essential to unravel the functional impact of genetic variation. However, we are currently unable to predict the impact of the majority genetic variants that lie in non-coding regions of the genome, where indeed most complex disease-associated variants are found. Additionally, recent evidence suggests that a significant fraction of the non-coding genome is likely to be functional, often playing a role in gene regulation. Therefore, our limited understanding of non- coding variation is a critical hurdle to characterizing the genetic basis of disease. The goal of this project is to develop methods for interpreting non-coding genetic variation: to provide a robust and extensible Bayesian method for predicting causal variants from full genomes, to identify and validate a large set of functional non- coding variants using CRISPR technology, and to predict disease-relevant traits likely to be affected by each variant. Our project will leverage a unique cohort from a founder population in Sardinia, with genome sequence and/or transcriptome data available from 3000 individuals, along with extensive phenotyping for hundreds of traits. We will combine advanced statistical modeling with experimental validation based on genome engineering to identify causal non-coding variants affecting biomedical traits in the cohort, along with predicting functional mechanisms through which these variants ultimately perturb the cell. In Aim 1, we develop computational methods for predicting causal non-coding variation from full genomes, incorporating informative genomic features including epigenetic data, sequence motifs, and conservation information into a Bayesian approach jointly modeling multiple transcriptomic signals. We will optimize and apply these methods on genome and transcriptome data available for the Sardinia cohort to identify a large set of variants predicted to causally affect gene expression. Based on these predictions, in Aim 2, we connect putative causal variants with the diverse set of disease-relevant traits measured in the cohort, using network inference to capture the cascade from genetic variation to gene expression to disease. We will develop methods to integrate across variants, using the models in Aim 1, to identify the common causal mechanisms related to each trait. In Aim 3, we validate the causal impact of non-coding variants predicted to affect high-level traits. We will us genome editing through CRISPR to introduce individual genetic variants into cell lines and use qPCR to validate the predicted effects on gene expression. Finally, a major goal throughout this proposal will be to provide the research community with convenient computational tools for the prediction of causal non-coding variants from individual genomes, updated on an ongoing basis to integrate the most recent genomic annotations and public data in order to provide the best possible accuracy in predicting causal variants and the traits they are likely to affect. Our projet will greatly advance our understanding of non-coding genetic variation, the specific mechanisms affected by causal variants, and the downstream consequences to the cell and individual health. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Understanding the impact of variation in the entire genome, beyond the well-studied protein-coding regions, is essential to understanding the relationship between genetics and human health. This proposal addresses the problem of identifying functional non-coding genetic variants and predicting the impact of each variant on hundreds of disease-relevant traits. Our approach will focus on integrative, transformative methods for understanding mechanisms underlying the function of the human genome.",Predicting causal non-coding variants in a founder population,9116910,R01HG008150,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Bayesian Method', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Categories', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Family', 'Founder Generation', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genome engineering', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Genotype-Tissue Expression Project', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human Genetics', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Link', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Nucleotides', 'Open Reading Frames', 'Pathogenesis', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Property', 'RNA Splicing', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sardinia', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Models', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Transcript', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Widespread Disease', 'base', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'data modeling', 'density', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder risk', 'functional genomics', 'genetic linkage analysis', 'genetic variant', 'genome annotation', 'genome editing', 'genome sequencing', 'genomic data', 'human data', 'human disease', 'human genome sequencing', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'learning strategy', 'molecular phenotype', 'novel', 'prediction algorithm', 'trait', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'whole genome']",NHGRI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,454272,-0.02174474820636091
"Molecular Characterization of Joubert Syndrome Project Summary Congenital ataxia presents in early childhood with non-progressive hypotonia, gross motor, fine motor and cognitive delays. These disorders are distinct from the progressive ataxias because of the presence of congenital cerebellar malformations and because they are typically inherited recessively. Joubert Syndrome and Related Disorders (JSRD) constitute a major subset of these conditions, consisting of a cerebellar midline (vermis) malformation, a nearly pathognomonic Molar Tooth sign on brain Imaging (MTI) and co-existent oculomotor apraxia and episodic breathing dysrhythmias. In our published data, we have: 1] Identified ten unique genetic causes of JSRD (nearly half of the published causes), 2] Generated genotype-phenotype correlations involving cerebellar, retinal, renal, hepatic, digit, and cerebral manifestations. 3] Identified common founder mutations that allow for population-based screening. 4] Discovered that JSRD encoded proteins frequently localize to the cilium. 5] Identified ciliary transition zone (TZ) defects in cells with JSRD mutations. 6] Performed siRNA cell-based screens for defective ciliogenesis to prioritize candidate JSRD genes. 7] Generated and characterized multiple zebrafish, mouse and human cell culture models for JSRD. 8] Defined the concept of ‘Ciliary localization’ model, in which one JSRD gene is required for ciliary localization of other JSRD proteins. In our unpublished data we have: 1] Recruited an additional 200 JSRD patients without molecular diagnosis. 2] Performed whole exome (WES) and whole genome sequencing (WGS) on an additional 100 JSRD families. 3] Identified an additional 12 novel likely JSRD candidate genes. 4] Generated IPSCs and cerebellar organoids from mutation-positive and negative families to aid in functional analysis and gene discovery using RNAseq. 5] Begun functional validation of the putative mutations. 6] Developed methods to interrogate ciliary structure in a high-throughput fashion with electron microscopy (EM). The goal of this competing renewal is to identify the remaining ‘discoverable’ genes that lead to JSRD when lost, functionally validate mutations within the pathogenetic framework, and test the hypothesis that mutations in JSRD genes lead to collapse of the ciliary TZ. Because the majority of patients still have unknown cause of disease, this renewal aims to advance knowledge through molecular characterization of new genes, using newly evolving high-throughput techniques, integrated bioinformatics, and a unique resource of consanguineous families recruited world-wide. We further aim to validate these mutations in patient cells, within a mechanistic framework that JSRD genes are required for essential ciliary structural components during cerebellar development. Project Narrative Joubert syndrome is a genetically and phenotypically heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorder unified by defects of the cellular primary cilium.

"Elucidating the Role of the Genetic and Environmental Determinants of Preterm Birth Using Integrative Computational Approaches ABSTRACT Given the wealth and availability of genomic and environmental exposure data, computational methods provide a powerful opportunity to identify population-specific determinants of disease. Proper treatment of data types emerging from a diverse set of molecular and environmental profiling technologies cannot be analyzed using traditional statistical routines and new computational approaches are needed. In line with the President's Precision Medicine Initiative, the goal of this proposal is to develop computational methods and integrate large- scale genetic and environmental exposure datasets to elucidate factors that affect preterm birth (PTB) in diverse populations. Preterm birth, or the delivery of an infant prior to 37 weeks of gestation, is a major health concern. Infants born prematurely, comprising of about 12% of the US newborns, have elevated risks of neonatal mortality and a wide array of health problems. Preterm birth rates vary among different ethnic groups, with frequencies significantly elevated in African Americans and moderately elevated in Hispanics in comparison to Europeans. Environmental and socioeconomic factors alone may not explain these disparities and despite the evidence for a genetic basis to preterm birth, to date no causal genetic variants have been identified. In this proposal I aim to leverage the rich genetic and environmental variation data and develop computational approaches to advance our understanding of biology of preterm birth as it relates to all populations. To that extent, I propose three aims. In aim 1, I will develop computational methods to identify and validate novel genetic factors for preterm birth by genome-wide association (GWA) study in diverse ethnic populations. I obtained a comprehensive set of publicly available PTB case and control datasets consisting of ethnically diverse mothers and babies including 3,500 cases and nearly 16,000 controls from dbGAP and will carry out an ancestry-based case-control GWA study to identify genetic factors influencing PTB. In aim 2, I will develop analytical methodology to identify environmental and socioeconomic factors that impact preterm birth in diverse ethnic populations. I propose to integrate linked California State databases covering over 3 million births across diverse populations with geographical location data and pollution levels and UV exposure data from the Environmental Protection Agency in order to identify whether these exposures play a role in contributing to population-specific PTB risk. In aim 3, I will carry out integrative data analysis and build computational models in order to identify population specific interactions between the genetic and environmental factors affecting PTB risk. I hypothesize that gene-environment interactions contribute to population differences in preterm birth risk following environmental exposures. The proposed work will allow us to learn more about the etiology PTB, but could also be extended to other phenotypes of interest. This project is the logical next step for the study of the interaction of genetics and environment in the context of disease, which can be used to inform precise population-specific diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. PROJECT NARRATIVE Given the wealth and availability of genomic and environmental exposure data, computational methods provide a powerful opportunity to identify population-specific determinants of disease. The goal of this proposal is to develop computational approaches to integrate diverse genetic and environmental exposure datasets to elucidate factors that affect disease in diverse populations and apply them to the study of preterm birth.

"Modeling Dimensionality and Genetic Heterogeneity in Schizophrenia ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Schizophrenia (SZ) represents a significant and costly public health burden. Recently, we have witnessed the emergence of the first molecular insights into the etiopathogenic mechanisms of SZ, via the first genome-wide association studies (GWAS) with sufficient case-control sample sizes to detect allelic effects. Importantly, a polygenic signature, which includes genome-wide significant common genetic variants of small effect, has been clearly demonstrated to influence SZ risk. The availability of well-defined risk factors makes it possible, for the first time, to address several critical questions about the genetic architecture of SZ and its component phenotypes and endophenotypes. The overarching goals of this K01 proposal are 1) to test polygenic risk score prediction of dimensional SZ and schizotypy phenotypes across large case, high-density SZ pedigree, and prodromal-aged GWAS samples, and 2) to develop and test, with leaders of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, innovative statistical methods to identify and characterize ""genetic subtypes"" of SZ.  This proposal delineates a series of training and research goals for the candidate that incorporates strengths from phenotypic assessment, statistical genetics, and molecular genetics and combines samples reflecting a broad range of genetic risk. The candidate will capitalize on previously established expertise in schizotypy and clinical risk assessment, as well as expertise in the familial transmission of dimensional traits, to establish a program of translational research wherein the application of statistical genetic/bioinformatic techniques to genetic subtyping analyses will be used to generate promising candidates for further exploration in human genomic data. Empirically-based genetic subtyping methods will be developed and tested in the largest SZ case sample to date, and subtypes will be characterized with respect to dimensional phenotypic traits. Top loci hits in subtype analyses of dimensional symptoms will be validated in secondary analyses of differential gene expression in post-mortem SZ brain. This will allow for a detailed analysis of function at both the SNP and gene levels, and will provide the candidate with substantive training in both statistical and molecular genetics methods. The institutional environment is ideal for the candidate's goal of developing a comprehensive program in SZ research, and the proposed research represents an important contribution toward advancing the understanding of SZ through a combination of clinical, statistical, molecular, and translational methods, consistent with the mission of the NIMH.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Mental illnesses such as schizophrenia constitute 13% of the global burden of disease and schizophrenia, although relatively rare, is highly heritable (80%) and one of the most severe mental disorders. This project aims to elucidate the influence of genetic factors and gene function on dimensional schizophrenia and schizotypy symptoms with multiple measures, across multiple samples of varying genetic risk.

"Searching for missing heritability for cardiometabolic outcomes by race ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiometabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) are common global health conditions that carry a great public health burden for chronic disability and early death. African Americans are more likely to be disproportionately affected than Whites. Our proposed project will have an important impact because it has great potential to explain, 1) A measure of the genetic susceptibility of these cardiometabolic diseases and mortality, and 2) Interaction and mediation of a genetic risk score (GRS) with a low diet quality score and low physical activity levels on these adverse health outcomes. There are published reports of interaction (effect modification) but not mediation (indirectly through an intervening variable) of a GRS with nutritional factors and low physical activity levels on cardiometabolic conditions; however, these studies involving interaction were performed predominantly in Whites. Most of the genetic susceptibility for these outcomes remains unexplained for African Americans. Studies are lacking on the role of these lifestyle factors in terms of interaction and especially mediation with a GRS to increase risk for cardiometabolic outcomes among Whites and African Americans. Thus, several questions remain regarding the influence environmental factors have with genes to increase disease risk and mortality among different race/ethnic groups. To address our questions, we will use the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute Candidate Gene Association Resource dataset of about 50,000 subjects, including 13,000 African Americans. To account for a measure of the genetic susceptibility, we will capture multiplicative single nucleotide polymorphism effects by the re-weighted random forest statistical method to compute a disease-and-race-specific GRS. We will include functional reduction- oxidation and metabolic disruptive single nucleotide polymorphisms that are involved in the inflammation and nutrient-signaling pathways. We will then investigate interaction and mediation of a GRS with a low diet quality score and low physical activity levels on T2DM, CVD, and mortality at baseline and over time by performing a meta-analysis. Our data include information on genetic polymorphisms, cross-sectional and longitudinal measurements on phenotypes for T2DM, CVD, and mortality, as well as dietary intake, physical activity, and relevant covariates.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The purpose of the study is to find a measure of the genetic susceptibility for type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and mortality in Whites and especially African Americans.

"Pharmacogenomics of Statin Therapy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall objective of the Center ""Pharmacogenomics of Statin Therapy"" (POST) is to apply genomic, transcriptomic, and metabolomic analyses, together with studies in cellular and animal models, and innovative informatic tools, to identify and validate biomarkers for efficacy of statin drugs in reducing riskof cardiovascular disease (CVD), and for adverse effects of statins, specifically myopathy and type 2 diabetes. This multidisciplinary approach is enabled by a team of investigators with expertise in genomics (human, mouse, and molecular), statistics and informatics, and clinical medicine and pharmacology. The Center is comprised of three Projects, two Research Cores, and an Administrative Core. A major aim of Project 1 is the identification of cellular transcriptomic and metabolomic markers for clinical efficacy and adverse effects of statins. This will be accomplished by analyses in statin-exposed lymphoblast cell lines derived from patients with major adverse coronary events, or onset of myopathy or type 2 diabetes on statin treatment, compared with unaffected statin- treated controls. In addition, using genome wide genotypes from these patients, DNA variants will be identified that are associated with statin-induced changes in the transcripts and metabolites that most strongly discriminate affected patients and controls. Project 2 will use a unique, well-characterized panel of 100 inbred mouse strains to discover genetic variation associated with statin-induced myopathy and dysglycemia. Mechanisms underlying these effects will be investigated, with emphasis on the role of dysregulation of autophagy by statin treatment. Projects 1 and 2 will also use relevant cellular and mouse models, respectively, to perform functional studies to validate effects of genes identified in all POST projects as strong candidates for modulating statin efficacy or adverse effects. In Project 3, information derived from genome-wide genotypes, electronic health records, and pharmacy data in a very large and diverse population-based patient cohort will be leveraged to identify and replicate genetic associations with statin efficacy (lipid lowering and CVD event reduction) and adverse effects (myopathy and type 2 diabetes), as well as to assess the overall heritability of these responses. The Clinical Core, based in Kaiser Permanente of Northern California, will provide the clinical information and biologic materials for both Projects1 and 3. Investigators in the Informatics Core will optimize data analysis and integration of results across all projects. The Administrative Core will provide scientific leadership and management of the Center, and foster scientific interactions and training opportunities. Overall, the research program of this Center provides an innovative model for a ""systems"" approach to pharmacogenomics that incorporates complementary investigative tools to discover and validate genetically influenced determinants of drug response. Moreover, the findings have the potential for guiding more effective use of statins for reducing CVD risk and minimizing adverse effects, and identifying biomarkers of pathways that modulate the multiple actions of this widely used class of drugs.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Coronary heart disease and stroke are the leading causes of death and disability in the United States, and statins are the most widely prescribed class of drugs to prevent these conditions. There is however, considerable interindividual variation in efficacy of statins for reducing disease risk, as well as in susceptibility to the most common adverse statin effects, myopathy and type 2 diabetes. The goal of the Center ""Pharmacogenomics of Statin Therapy"" (POST) is to apply complementary investigative approaches and multidisciplinary expertise for discovering and validating the genetic and metabolic factors responsible for this variability. This information has the potential for optimizig use of statins in clinical practice, and for identifying new pathways that underlie the diverse biologic actions of this drug class.              ",Pharmacogenomics of Statin Therapy,9139479,P50GM115318,"['Adverse effects', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Autophagocytosis', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'California', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Line', 'Cell model', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Pharmacology', 'Collaborations', 'Control Locus', 'Coronary', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease Outcome', 'Drug effect disorder', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronics', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Ethnic group', 'Event', 'Fostering', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Hybrids', 'Hyperglycemia', 'In Vitro', 'Inbred Strains Mice', 'Informatics', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Metabolic', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Muscle function', 'Myopathy', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Predisposition', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Recombinants', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Residual state', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Simvastatin', 'Stroke', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Transcript', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'Variant', 'adverse outcome', 'alternative treatment', 'base', 'biomarker identification', 'blood glucose regulation', 'candidate validation', 'cardiovascular disorder prevention', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'clinical efficacy', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'data integration', 'data visualization', 'design', 'disability', 'disorder risk', 'exome', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic association', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genotyped patients', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'inter-individual variation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'lymphoblast', 'lymphoblastoid cell line', 'metabolomics', 'mouse model', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'novel strategies', 'population based', 'predictive marker', 'prevent', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'statistics', 'tool', 'training opportunity', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment strategy']",NIGMS,CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL & RES CTR AT OAKLAND,P50,2016,2741022,0.009096673486966115
"Genome Wide Association Study for Childhood Obesity DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Obesity is a major risk factor for type 2 diabetes, which in turn has serious complications including accelerated development of cardiovascular disease. The prevalence of obesity in children and adults in the United States has increased by more than 30% over the past decade.  We previously successfully argued in our application for the R01 HD056465 award that distillation of the genetic component in this complex phenotype should thus be easier to determine in children, where environmental exposure and impact has been for a relatively short period of their lifetime; indeed the resulting work did pan out to be successful in this regard. We carried out a non-hypothesis-driven study that was directed at uncovering genes and genetic variants that predispose to childhood obesity by conducting a genome-wide association study (GWAS) using a high density tag-SNP array. Employing a powered two-stage study design in a consortium setting, where cases were defined as being in the e95th percentile of BMI, we identified novel association signals which we subsequently replicated. This NICHD funded study was ultimately published in Nature Genetics (with the PI as senior author) and received widespread press attention, including with CNN, Time and the front page of USA Today.  The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia is now poised to determine additional genetic factors conferring risk to the pathogenesis of childhood obesity through the leveraging of new ultra-high-throughput sequencing technology, and also allow for fine-mapping of the already uncovered loci to determine the actual causal mechanism of action. Combining our accurately phenotyped cohort, which represents the largest pediatric obesity DNA collection in the world, with access to familial childhood obesity, availability of existing genome wide singl nucleotide polymorphism genotypes and the application of whole exome sequencing, this renewal application of R01 HD056465 proposes to broaden the list of novel genetic loci that are associated with this trait in order to get further insights in to the genetic etiology of common pediatric obesity.  We are well positioned to extend our knowledge of the genetic etiology of childhood obesity. It is unclear if these additional variants are common in the population, a set o private mutations in families or a mixture of both. Irrespective of the nature of the variant(s) we are well positioned to look for both types of event, with common variants detectable through leveraging the GWAS dataset of well powered cohorts and private mutations detectable through whole exome sequencing of many multi-case pedigrees. This represents a major follow-up to the Principal Investigator's original grant application and this renewal will allow for adding extr value to the already substantial findings made funded by the original grant. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The prevalence of obesity in children and adults in the United States has increased by more than 30% over the past decade. We are seeking to renew R01 HD056465 to expand on the successful findings made previously and to further characterize the genetic etiology of childhood obesity and pediatric BMI trajectory. Combining our recruited accurately phenotyped and largest pediatric obesity cohort in the world, access to familial childhood obesity, availability of existing genome wide single nucleotide polymorphism genotypes and the application of whole exome sequencing, this renewal proposes to broaden the list of novel genetic loci that are associated with this trait.",Genome Wide Association Study for Childhood Obesity,9095391,R01HD056465,"['Adult', 'Applications Grants', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Body mass index', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Copy Number Polymorphism', 'DNA', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Impact', 'Event', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genotype', 'Grant', 'Health', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Knowledge', 'Maps', 'Mutation', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Nature', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Normal Statistical Distribution', 'Nucleotides', 'Obesity', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Phenotype', 'Philadelphia', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Principal Investigator', 'Publishing', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research Design', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'SNP array', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Staging', 'Technology', 'Time', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'Work', 'cohort', 'density', 'exome sequencing', 'follow-up', 'genetic pedigree', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'insight', 'longitudinal analysis', 'novel', 'obesity in children', 'rare variant', 'risk variant', 'targeted sequencing', 'trait']",NICHD,CHILDREN'S HOSP OF PHILADELPHIA,R01,2016,656794,-0.013995076157517045
"Quantitative microscopy-based rapid phenotyping and screening ﻿    DESCRIPTION:  Synapses are most fundamental to the function of a nervous system. C. elegans is an excellent genetic model system for finding genes and elucidating pathways because of its sequenced genome and the abundance of molecular biology tools and mutants. Due to the simplicity of its nervous system, many breakthroughs have been made in C. elegans for understanding molecular mechanisms in the patterning of the nervous system and synapse development. The current bottlenecks are in the manual and non-quantitative techniques such as visual screens, limiting both the throughput of the experiments and the phenotypes one can examine. Our long-term objective is to develop technologies and to understand how genes, age, and the environment together define and continue to remodel the nervous system of an organism. In the last funding period, we have made large progress in hardware system design (including microtechnologies and automation technologies) and software for quantitative characterization of phenotypes. The objective of this continuation project is to further engineer superior micro devices for large-scale live imaging and quantitative imaging technologies, and combine with the power of genetic and genomic approaches to study synapse development in this in vivo system; genes and pathways emerging from this study could potentially become targets of therapeutics in neurological disorders.  We have shown in the previous phase of the project that quantitative microscopy-based approaches can indeed enable identification of novel genes and pathways that conventional approaches cannot. In the continuation phase, we will further optimize on-chip rapid and high-content in vivo imaging techniques, and in parallel further develop algorithms and quantitative measures for the analysis of such high-content data; we will screen based on novel synthetic phenotype unobservable by eye; we will also exploit powerful genomic techniques to identify loci and potential multigenic interactions that shape the synapse morphology. These experimental approaches will identify genes that cannot have been identified otherwise because of the difficulties associated with the phenotypical profiling, but addressed using our engineered techniques here. The approach is innovative because the technology developed here dramatically increases the throughput, sensitivity, and accuracy of the experiments, and truly enables the utility of extremely powerful genetic and genomic methods. The proposed research is significant because it fills the urgent need in high-throughput and high-content screens as well as identifying novel genes and pathways. In addition, besides the contribution to the specific neurobiology, the technologies are widely applicable to areas such as developmental cell biology, and to other small organisms such as fly larvae and zebrafish embryos.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:   Synapse development is an important and active area of research linking genes and environments to the formation and maintenance of synapses in the nervous system. It has direct implications in many human diseases developmental and psychiatric diseases such as Autism Spectrum Disorder and Schizophrenia.                ",Quantitative microscopy-based rapid phenotyping and screening,9116662,R01GM088333,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Automation', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Developmental Cell Biology', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Drosophila genus', 'Embryo', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Eye', 'Fill-It', 'Fluorescence', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Models', 'Genetic Research', 'Genetic Screening', 'Genomic approach', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Inbreeding', 'Larva', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Maintenance', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Microfluidics', 'Microscopy', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Morphology', 'Nematoda', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Organism', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Phylogeny', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Quantitative Microscopy', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Regulatory Pathway', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Schizophrenia', 'Shapes', 'Speed', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Work', 'Zebrafish', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'design', 'experience', 'fly', 'forward genetics', 'genetic approach', 'genome sequencing', 'high throughput screening', 'human disease', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in vivo imaging', 'innovation', 'mutant', 'nerve injury', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'quantitative imaging', 'research study', 'screening', 'success', 'synaptogenesis', 'targeted treatment', 'technology development', 'tool', 'trait']",NIGMS,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2016,306503,0.0067272420513899076
"Tracing the evolution of the human mutation rate ﻿DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): All genetic variation is created by mutations, changes that arise due to DNA damage or copying mistakes during DNA replication. Mutations are frequent enough that, on average, a child's 3-billion base pair genome contains 74 new genetic variants that are not present in the genome of either parent. Such new mutations confer a higher disease risk than older mutations because they have not passed the test of surviving through several generations of parents and offspring. We aim to pinpoint how the human mutation rate has evolved as humans left Africa and adapted to diverse new environments across the globe.  One specific aim will follow up on my preliminary research which showed that Europeans experienced a mutation rate change after diverging from Africans and Asians. The primary evidence for this change is that European genomes have a higher burden than African or Asian genomes of the mutation type TCC→TTC, where the trinucleotide ""TCC"" has experienced a mutation from ""C"" to ""T"" at its central site. We wish to and the genetic basis of this mutation rate change by looking at rare variants in mixed- ancestry Latino and African-American individuals. Specially, we will isolate young genetic variants that probably arose via mutation within the past 10-15 generations, after gene ow from Europe into the Americas had already begun. We will infer the genetic background (European, African, or Native American) upon which each new mutation arose and look for genomic regions where European ances- try correlates strongly with an excess of TCC→TTC mutations. These will be the regions most likely to harbor a causal allele that changed the process of mutation accumulation in Europeans. This work has the potential to yield valuable insights into melanoma, a cancer that predominantly affects individuals of European ancestry and whose somatic mutational signature is dominated by TCC→TTC.  A second specific aim is to look for other signatures of mutation rate change that have occurred within the human species or, more broadly, within the great apes. We will use a natural language processing technique called Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to identify collections of mutation types whose rates appear to be under common genetic control. A few mutation types besides TCC→TTC show weak signals of rate differentiation between populations, and we will attempt to infer how many separate mutation rate change events are necessary to explain these signals. The admixture mapping technique from Specific Aim I can also be adapted to interrogate the genetic basis of other mutation rate changes that might have occurred in the recent past. These efforts should improve our understanding of the human mutation rate's genetic architecture and how mutation rates differ between populations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: All genetic variation is created by mutations, the copying mistakes that occasionally happen during DNA replication. There is evidence that children born with a higher burden of new mutations are at increased risk for autism, schizophrenia, and serious congenital diseases [1, 2, 3], but it is not well understood how much the human mutation rate varies and what genetic risk factors affect the mutation rate [4]. We aim to follow up on preliminary evidence that the Europeans have a higher mutation rate than Asians or Africans [5], looking for the genetic basis of this rate difference and investigating how often the mutation rate has changed during human evolution.",Tracing the evolution of the human mutation rate,8982093,F32GM116381,"['Acceleration', 'Admixture', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'African', 'African American', 'Alleles', 'American', 'Americas', 'Architecture', 'Asians', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Base Pairing', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Cancer Biology', 'Child', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Collection', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA biosynthesis', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Employee Strikes', 'Environment', 'Europe', 'European', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomic Segment', 'Germ-Line Mutation', 'Health', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Latino', 'Left', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Mutation', 'Mutation Spectra', 'Native Americans', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Parents', 'Pongidae', 'Population', 'Process', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Schizophrenia', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'design', 'developmental disease', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'genetic risk factor', 'genetic variant', 'improved', 'insight', 'melanoma', 'offspring', 'rare variant', 'success', 'trait', 'transition mutation']",NIGMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,F32,2015,50690,0.028001273596949545
"Predicting Impact of Genetic Variation on Splicing ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The genetic code not only determines protein amino acid residue sequence but also defines the 'splicing code' of cis- and trans-acting regulatory elements that control pre-mRNA splicing. Single nucleotide variant (SNV) changes at key regions in pre-mRNA may disrupt splicing resulting in disease [1, 2]. Understanding which SNVs cause aberrant splicing and which are benign is important for understanding disease pathogenesis. SNVs at consensus splice sites, at exon-intron junctions, are known to cause aberrant splicing and contribute to at least 10% of inherited diseases [2]. However, SNVs outside consensus splice sites can still disrupt splicing [3]. Current, bioinformatics tools limit analysis to SNVs at or near consensus splice sites and lack the ability to generalize to SNVs beyond the consensus splice site [4-7]. In this application, I propose to substantially improve the ability to interpret the consequences of mutations on pre-mRNA splicing. This goal will be achieved by: 1) developing novel features, useful in predicting the impact of variation on cis- splicing regulation; 2) training a supervised machine learning algorithm that uses the novel features to predict the impact of SNVs; 3) sharing the algorithm in a publically available software package; and 4) comparing algorithm predictions to the relationships between SNVs and splicing patterns derived from matched DNA- and RNA-sequencing studies.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Genetic sequences not only encode the amino acids of proteins but also regulate many critical biological functions, including pre-mRNA splicing. The impact of genetic variation on splicing is not well understood. The goal of this research project i to computationally identify features of variants useful in predicting aberrant splicing, then incorporate the features into a machine learning algorithm and test the utility of the predictions using publically available sequencing studies. 1            ",Predicting Impact of Genetic Variation on Splicing,8833507,F31HG007804,"['Algorithms', 'Amino Acids', 'Benign', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Cell physiology', 'Characteristics', 'Code', 'Comparative Study', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consensus', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Exons', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Code', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Inherited', 'Introns', 'Label', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Mutation', 'Nucleotides', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Proteins', 'RNA Sequences', 'RNA Splicing', 'Regulation', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research Project Grants', 'Role', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Variant', 'base', 'improved', 'interest', 'mRNA Precursor', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NHGRI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,F31,2015,43120,-0.01439924193133622
"Clinically Relevant Genome Variation Database We propose to create the world's premier database of genetic variants relevant to clinical care (Clinically Relevant Genetic Variants Resource or CRVR). We will provide transparent data synthesis and consensus opinion on the clinical utility of a given genetic variant across a spectrum of genetic lesions including single nucleotide changes, small indels and structural variants. We will integrate with ClinVar, PharmGKB, and OMIM and draw upon NHGRI initiatives including the Genome Sequencing and Analysis and Mendelian Disorders Sequencing Centers, and the Clinical Sequencing Exploratory Research Centers. We will work closely with other CRVR sites and NHGRI funded initiatives to improve deposition of data from clinical laboratories. Our database will be built through three Aims. Aim 1 will engage and energize the clinical genomics community around CRVR efforts. We will partner with the other CRVR and U41 investigators in this activity as they will focus on engagement of professional societies, clinical testing laboratories, and the broader clinical genomics community to ensure creation of a CRVR resource that meets anticipated community needs including assembly of Disease-Specific and Mutation Type Working Groups (DSWGs and MTWGs) comprised of expert clinical geneticists and molecular diagnosticians to establish metrics for the initial classification of variants and integration of guidelines from professional organizations. Aim 2 will involve creation of a CRVR CoreDB resource through expert review of the existing literature, locus databases, and NHGRI initiatives. We will disseminate consensus findings on clinically relevant genetic variants and the clinical implications of these variants, with supporting evidence and documentation of the consensus process. Information will be aggregated using standard ontologies and advanced methodologies for handling heterogeneous data to create a Core Database (CoreDB). The consensus of expert review will be disseminated through a user-friendly web Portal (vetted by Genetic Counseling WG), web services for data mining, and consensus clinical guidelines to the appropriate clinical and research communities. The results will be organized by gene, variant, disease, pathway, and literature. Supporting evidence will also be curated and disseminated, and the resource will be updated continuously as new information accumulates. Aim 3 will involve deployment of machine-learning algorithms for semi- automatic identification of putative Clinically Relevant Variants (CRVs). We will undertake data mining of the clinical and epidemiological genetics literature and existing databases to identify putative clinically important variants. This will involve mining data from ClinVar, OMIM, CSER, and the Mendelian centers aggregated in Aim 2.

"Clinically Relevant Genome Variation Database We propose to create the world's premier database of genetic variants relevant to clinical care (Clinically Relevant Genetic Variants Resource or CRVR). We will provide transparent data synthesis and consensus opinion on the clinical utility of a given genetic variant across a spectrum of genetic lesions including single nucleotide changes, small indels and structural variants. We will integrate with ClinVar, PharmGKB, and OMIM and draw upon NHGRI initiatives including the Genome Sequencing and Analysis and Mendelian Disorders Sequencing Centers, and the Clinical Sequencing Exploratory Research Centers. We will work closely with other CRVR sites and NHGRI funded initiatives to improve deposition of data from clinical laboratories. Our database will be built through three Aims. Aim 1 will engage and energize the clinical genomics community around CRVR efforts. We will partner with the other CRVR and U41 investigators in this activity as they will focus on engagement of professional societies, clinical testing laboratories, and the broader clinical genomics community to ensure creation of a CRVR resource that meets anticipated community needs including assembly of Disease-Specific and Mutation Type Working Groups (DSWGs and MTWGs) comprised of expert clinical geneticists and molecular diagnosticians to establish metrics for the initial classification of variants and integration of guidelines from professional organizations. Aim 2 will involve creation of a CRVR CoreDB resource through expert review of the existing literature, locus databases, and NHGRI initiatives. We will disseminate consensus findings on clinically relevant genetic variants and the clinical implications of these variants, with supporting evidence and documentation of the consensus process. Information will be aggregated using standard ontologies and advanced methodologies for handling heterogeneous data to create a Core Database (CoreDB). The consensus of expert review will be disseminated through a user-friendly web Portal (vetted by Genetic Counseling WG), web services for data mining, and consensus clinical guidelines to the appropriate clinical and research communities. The results will be organized by gene, variant, disease, pathway, and literature. Supporting evidence will also be curated and disseminated, and the resource will be updated continuously as new information accumulates. Aim 3 will involve deployment of machine-learning algorithms for semi- automatic identification of putative Clinically Relevant Variants (CRVs). We will undertake data mining of the clinical and epidemiological genetics literature and existing databases to identify putative clinically important variants. This will involve mining data from ClinVar, OMIM, CSER, and the Mendelian centers aggregated in Aim 2. The Working Groups formed in Aim 1 will establish criteria and oversee curators vetting variants. We will develop and optimize disease- and gene-specific machine learning algorithms to facilitate rapid classification of variants based on data provided by genetic testing services via ClinVar. We will integrate population-genetic data inferred from at least 25 reference populations from the 1000 Genomes Project and other large endeavors into our machine learning approaches so as to infer the global relevance of CRVs discovered here.

"Optimizing Genetic Testing for Deafness for Clinical Diagnostics Project Summary  In this goal-driven proposal, submitted in response to Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) Number PAR-11-003, we will make comprehensive genetic testing for deafness available to clinicians for under $500 per person. The driving force behind this initiative is the frequency of hearing impairment. As the most common sensory impairment, it is diagnosed in 1 of every 500 newborns and 50% of octogenarians (Morton Ann N Y Acad Sci 1991). With 57 genes implicated in nonsyndromic hearing loss (NSHL), it is also an extremely heterogeneous trait and presents a tremendous challenge to diagnosis.  Current strategies for genetic testing for deafness are inadequate. For most, only a minority of genes is included, with selection criteria typically reflecting: 1) high prevalence as a cause of deafness (i.e. GJB2); 2) association with another recognizable feature (i.e. SLC26A4 and enlarged vestibular aqueduct); or 3) a recognizable audioprofile (i.e. low frequency hearing loss as seen with WFS1) (Hilgert et al Mut Res 2009).  The recent advent of powerful DNA target enrichment and sequencing technologies, however, makes it possible to provide comprehensive genetic testing for deafness that is efficient and cost-effective. We have shown that it is possible to analyze all deafness genes simultaneously on a single platform (called OtoSCOPE) (Shearer et al PNAS 2010). Related to this endeavor, we have also validated AudioGene as a phenotypic tool that uses patient audiograms to predict the genetic cause of ADNSHL (Hildebrand et al Genet Med 2008; Hildebrand et al Laryngoscope 2009).  Building on these findings, in this proposal we will complete two specific aims.  Specific Aim 1: To provide comprehensive, high-throughput, low-cost DNA sequence generation and analysis for deafness genetic testing  Goal 1: Comprehensive, high-throughput, low-cost DNA sequence analysis for genetic testing for deafness is possible at sensitivities and specificities comparable to Sanger sequencing by using targeted sequence enrichment followed by massively parallel sequencing.  Specific Aim 2: To optimize both machine learning-based audioprofiling of audiometric data and phenotypic filtering of genotypic data by expanding and improving the platform we have developed called AudioGene  Goal 2: As a phenome tool, a machine-learning software system trained on an extensive set of audiometric data can be used to predict and to eliminate specific genes or gene variants as causes of deafness based on audiometric data.  Achieving these specific aims will change the clinical evaluation of deaf and hard-of-hearing persons by making genetic testing the most important diagnostic test after a history, physical examination and audiological assessment. In this goal-driven proposal, submitted in response to Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) Number PAR-11-003, we will make comprehensive genetic testing for deafness available to clinicians for under $500 per person.

"Systems genetic and reverse phenotypic analysis of age and retirement DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): High throughput genomic platforms have revealed a profound effect of age on gene expression and gene methylation levels. For example, our integromic analysis of multiple publicly available data sets have identified hundreds of age related genes that can be organized into network modules. These gene sets along with genes and pathways known from the vast literature on aging and longevity provide valuable candidates in allelic association studies of the health and well-being of older Americans. The rich longitudinal data set and the genome wide scans of DNA samples from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) provide a unique resource for evaluating the phenotypic effects of genetic variants underlying aging related genes, gene sets and for developing multivariable models that include behavioral, psychosocial, and genetic factors. This proposal aims to apply systems biologic and systems genetic methods for identifying gene sets based on existing gene expression, gene methylation, and multiple large scale genome wide association studies (GWAS). Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) underlying these genes will then be related to health, cognitive, behavioral, and economic phenotypes using multivariable regression-, machine learning-, and weighted network analysis approaches. An iterative process between SNP and phenotype selection facilitates the definition of clinically and economically important phenotypes under genetic control (reverse phenotyping). The proposal will not only elucidate the genetic and molecular underpinnings of retirement relevant phenotypes (cognitive functioning, psychosocial factors, and health related expenditures) but also lead to a phenotypic annotation of aging related genes and pathways. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: State of the art statistical, computational, and network approaches for integrating genomic data with the valuable phenotypic and genetic data provided by the Health and Retirement Study is expected to lead to the identification of genetic markers relevant for improving the lives of America's older adults.

"Statistical Modeling of Complex Traits in Genetic Reference Super-Populations DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Genetic crosses in model organisms play an essential role in understanding the heritable architecture of medically relevant phenotypes. Traditionally, such crosses have tended to be on a small scale with either limited power to detect genetic effects or limited resolution to localize causal variants. Recently, however, the emergence of larger-scale interdisciplinary research, cheaper genotyping and parallel advances in human genetics, have spurred the development of more sophisticated and powerful experimental designs. Genetic Resource Populations (GRPs) use economies of scale to provide cost-effective and replicable platforms for genetic studies. This project concerns the largest, most ambitious GRP in mouse genetics to date, the Collaborative Cross (CC), and a series of crosses and designs related to or derived from it: the Diversity Outbred (DO) cross, the CC Recombinant Inbred Cross (CC-RIX) and the diallel. Experiments on each separate cross provide distinct information about the heritable architecture of a target complex disease. In combination, this Genetic Reference Super-Population (GRSP) potentially provides an unparalleled basis for cross-study replication and integration in mouse genetics. This project aims to develop statistical methods that advance the current state of complex trait analysis of these populations separately, and, by exploiting the unique structure that connects them, proposes to develop a statistical framework that allows for their joint use.  Aim 1 develops a Bayesian probabilistic framework for haplotype-based analysis of quantitative trait loci (QTL). Aim 1a develops a statistical software module for flexible haplotype-based analysis, which can be ex- tended by the researcher to model a rich variety of designs and disease types. Aim 1b will adapt machine learning techniques to provide posterior inference of the allelic series of a QTL. Aim 1c will incorporate Bayesian modeling of polygenic effects.  Aim 2 and 3 concern joint analysis, building on the foundation set by Aim 1. Aim 2 develops methods to optimize experimental design of follow-up studies in one population given results from another. Aim 2a uses the diallel to inform design of CC/CC-RIX/DO experiments. Aim 2b uses partial data on CC/CC-RIX/DO to guide collection of additional data. Aim 3 explores models for jointly analyzing multiple populations in the GRSP, using complementary datasets to stabilize analysis at single QTL (Aim 3a) and across multiple QTL (Aim 3b).  These aims address specific and persistent challenges in the cost-effective design and efficient analysis of multiparent genetic data, in particular the CC, DO, CC-RIX and diallel. The project will generate tools useful for a wide range of model organism crosses and can be applied to the genetic study of any complex disease. The proposed research will lead to improvements in the analysis and design of genetic studies on animal models of human disease. Because the project focuses on statistical methodology applied to experimental mouse populations, the scientific output of the project is expected to be applicable to basic research focusing on any medical condition that can be studied in the mouse.",Statistical Modeling of Complex Traits in Genetic Reference Super-Populations,8919917,R01GM104125,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Anxiety', 'Architecture', 'Asthma', 'Basic Science', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Biomedical Research', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Equilibrium', 'Etiology', 'Experimental Designs', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Crosses', 'Genetic Programming', 'Genetic study', 'Genotype', 'Haplotypes', 'Heart Diseases', 'Human Genetics', 'Hybrids', 'Inbreeding', 'Influentials', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Plug-in', 'Population', 'Population Analysis', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Randomized', 'Recombinants', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Series', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'base', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'design', 'disease phenotype', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'follow-up', 'genetic resource', 'human disease', 'insight', 'interest', 'population based', 'prospective', 'research study', 'response', 'simulation', 'success', 'tool', 'trait']",NIGMS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2015,241086,0.029407183936189803
"Methods for high-dimensional data in HIV/CVD research DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent technological advances have yielded vast quantities of molecular and cellular data, affording unprecedented opportunities to understand complex disease etiologies and to inform clinical management strategies. However, in order to derive information from these rich stores of data we need to develop sound and appropriate analytic techniques. This need is especially relevant in studies at the intersection of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and cardiovascular disease (CVD), which are characterized by an elaborate set of interactions among viral and host factors. These factors include viral and host genetic profiles, as well as markers of caloric metabolism, immune activation and inflammation, which work together to determine response to therapy and overall disease progression. A comprehensive assessment of these markers presents several analytical challenges owing to the large number of potentially informative variables and the largely uncharacterized relationship among them. We propose a multi-faceted strategy that focuses on the development and application of integrative statistical approaches. Such approaches will allow us to explore and characterize novel hypotheses relating to the complex relationships among multiple genetic, environmental, demographic, and clinical factors and measures of disease progression. Specifically, this continuation application focuses on advancing and applying statistical methods in two settings: first, we consider population-based genetic association studies of innate-immunity, adipokine, drug metabolism and drug transport genes and markers of immune reconstitution, inflammation and risk of CVD in HIV-infected individuals; and second, we address investigations of metabolic and immunologic profiles that associate with immune recovery, inflammation and risk of CVD. The Specific Aims of the proposed research are to develop and evaluate: (1) Latent class and mixture modeling paradigms for (a) discovering and characterizing multi-locus genotype-trait associations and (b) evaluating unobservable haplotype-trait associations in candidate-gene investigations; and (2) Hierarchical mixture models and machine learning approaches for (a) monitoring quantitative biomarkers in resource-limited settings and (b) characterizing high- dimensional predictors of immune reconstitution and inflammation. IMPACT: This research will lead to the creation of appropriate and carefully evaluated analytic tools to derive information from the rich array of molecular and cellular data now available. Ultimately, this research will advance our ability to translate molecular and cellular level data for clinical decision making, serving at the cornerstone of personalized medicine. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The newly available array of data on genetic polymorphisms and cellular level immune factors promises unprecedented opportunities to elucidate complex disease etiology and inform clinical management strategies. Using human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) as our model systems, we propose to develop, evaluate and apply new analytic approaches for high-dimensional data.

"Decrypting Variants of Uncertain Significance in Long-QT Syndrome DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Clinical genetic testing has become standard-of-care for many diseases including hundreds of inherited conditions. However, interpreting genetic test results is often confounded by the discovery of 'variants of unknown significance' (VUS) for which there is insufficient data or inadequate predictive tools to establish whether or not a particular variant predisposes to a disease. This problem is particularly vexing for genetic disorders with strong allelic heterogeneity and a preponderance of 'private' mutations such as the congenital long-QT syndrome (LQTS), which predisposes young adults and children to sudden death from cardiac arrhythmias. With the anticipated incorporation of personal exome or genome data into routine clinical care, interpreting VUS will become an even greater challenge especially when variants in genes associated with human disorders are incidentally discovered. Unfortunately, there are no reliable methods to predict a priori whether a given variant predisposes an individual to a particular disorder or whether the change is merely a benign rare variant. We propose to develop a novel paradigm for distinguishing disease-causing mutations from benign variants in LQTS as a model for other inherited arrhythmia syndromes and channelopathies. We will focus on variants in KCNQ1, the most commonly mutated gene in LQTS. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that a holistic predictive model that relates experimentally determined protein structure and dynamics to function and disease is highly accurate even for novel variants. Our ultimate objectives are to develop a data-trained, web-accessible algorithm that classifies VUS discovered in KCNQ1 based on reliable predictions of the structure and dynamics of the affected protein, and to achieve prediction accuracy to levels needed to inform medical decisions. The medical importance of correctly classifying KCNQ1 variants provides strong justification for having a dedicated and highly-tailored gene-specific prediction model. The ability to distinguish deleterious from neutral variants would help avoid unnecessary and potentially harmful interventions in carriers of benign alleles, and save the lives of those with true mutations. We propose to collect extensive electrophysiological, biochemical and structural data on a large set of KCNQ1 variants discovered in LQTS subjects as well as several suspected benign or neutral variants (Aims 1-2), then use these data to iteratively train and validate a machine learning based algorithm that can differentiate benign from deleterious KCNQ1 alleles among a set of new VUS (Aim 3). Our proposal is innovative in the use of a multidisciplinary approach to functionally and structurally annotate genomic variant data for a medically important gene at an unprecedented scale, and then to use these experimental findings to train/test a novel computational system to achieve clinical-grade predictions. Targeting KCNQ1 will also validate an approach for parallel work that can be utilized to predict the medical significance of variants in closely related potassium channels associated with heritable epilepsy (KCNQ2, KCNQ3) or deafness (KCNQ4). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this project is to develop a method to reliably predict the consequences of genetic variants of unknown significance discovered in the course of genetic testing in the congenital long-QT syndrome (LQTS), a cause of sudden cardiac death in children and young adults. We propose a multidisciplinary experimental approach including electrophysiology, biochemistry and structural biology deployed on a large scale to generate information on at least 110 genetic variants in the main gene responsible for LQTS (KCNQ1), which encodes a potassium channel required for normal electrical activity in the heart. Our final product will be a data-trained computational strategy that will outperform existing methods for accurately predicting the functional consequences of novel KCNQ1 genetic variants, enhance the value of genetic testing in LQTS and provide for more informed medical decisions.",Decrypting Variants of Uncertain Significance in Long-QT Syndrome,8892240,R01HL122010,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Anti-Arrhythmia Agents', 'Arrhythmia', 'Benign', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological', 'Cardiac', 'Caring', 'Cell surface', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Defibrillators', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Epilepsy', 'First Degree Relative', 'Genes', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Intervention', 'Ion Channel', 'Link', 'Long QT Syndrome', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Genetics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Online Systems', 'Other Genetics', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Potassium Channel', 'Predisposition', 'Protein Dynamics', 'Proteins', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Structure', 'Sudden Death', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical care', 'deafness', 'design', 'disease-causing mutation', 'exome', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'heart rhythm', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'knowledge base', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'proband', 'protein function', 'protein structure', 'protein transport', 'public health relevance', 'rare variant', 'research study', 'structural biology', 'sudden cardiac death', 'tool', 'trafficking', 'variant of unknown significance', 'web-accessible', 'young adult']",NHLBI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2015,1254784,0.006432595804218744
"International Case Control Study of Malignant Glioma DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Glioma comprises about 40% of all primary brain tumors accounting for as many as 26,000 U.S. and European deaths annually. Inherited susceptibility plays a role with 2-fold increased risk of glioma among first-degree relatives of glioma cases. We initiated a multi-center, international linkage study: ""Genetic Epidemiology of Glioma International Consortium"" in 2007 to address the role of inherited susceptibility. Since this study does not allow us currently to address the role of genetic susceptibility in sporadic cases, we propose this case- control study to address this gap. Members of the consortium have conducted genome wide association studies (GWAS) that will be the discovery phase (phase I). While of high value for discovery, we propose to recruit 6,000 newly diagnosed glioma cases and 6,000 age-gender-ethnicity-matched controls, and collect detailed epidemiologic data and biologic samples from the 13 participating Gliogene sites. We hypothesize that novel inherited variation influencing the susceptibility to glioma can be identified by high density SNP analysis, and propose the following specific aims: SA1: Identify common genetic variants contributing to the risk of glioma. We plan to conduct phases 2 and 3 of the 3 phase approach, specifically we will: (SA1a) Validate GWAS findings from the discovery sets, and replicate the top hits (~23,000 SNPs) with lowest p- values from the two phase GWA studies in a series of 2,000 cases and 2,000 controls (phase 2, validation). Validate the top hits from the test set (aim 1a). From stage 2, genes with SNPs displaying an association at pd10-4 (including the complete haplotype tagging - approximately 100 SNPs) will then be genotyped in a further series of 4,000 cases and 4,000 controls (stage 3, validation). SNPs significant at 10-7 or better will be considered in the final analyses. (SA1b). Using an a priori hypothesis that DNA repair in inflammation contribute to glioma risk, we will selectively interrogate DNA repair and inflammation pathway genes using data for select genes derived from the high-density array. We will conduct a hypothesis driven genetic association in DNA repair and in inflammation/immune function related genes with glioma risk using functional genomic and bioinformatic tools to interrogate available databases. (SA2): Evaluate gene-gene (G-G) and gene- environmental (G-E) interactions with strong biologic relevance to identify G-G and G-E interactions for glioma risk using machine-learning tools (MDR, FITF, and CART) in these exploratory analyses. There are no existing glioma case-control studies with sufficient numbers of biological samples and common epidemiologic data to conduct a comprehensive validation and replication study, or to address the issues of tumor heterogeneity as we will in this study.

"An Integrative Analysis of Structural Variation for the 1000 Genomes Project DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Structural variation (SV), involving deletions, duplications, insertions and inversions of DNA segments, accounts for a large proportion of human genetic diversity. Comprehensive identification and analysis of these genetic variants will help us more fully elucidate the biology of their functional effects on human health and demography. Despite recent advances, the tools and data needed to comprehensively identify all types of SVs, genotype each variant, integrate and phase these variants remain lacking. Indeed, the data released from the early phases of the 1000 Genomes Project (1000GP) (1000 Genomes Project Consortium, 2010; 1000 Genomes Project Consortium, 2012) are biased primarily towards the detection of deletions within relatively unique regions of the genome. As a consortium, we propose to pool expertise from various research groups to provide an integrative analysis of SVs by combining rigorous computational algorithmic development with extensive experimental validation. The new algorithms we develop and the high confidence lists of SVs obtained will be rapidly made available as a public resource. n/a",An Integrative Analysis of Structural Variation for the 1000 Genomes Project,8920443,U41HG007497,"['Accounting', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Benchmarking', 'Biology', 'Chromosomes', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'DNA', 'DNA Insertion Elements', 'Data', 'Demography', 'Development', 'Future', 'Gene Conversion', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Haplotypes', 'Health', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nucleotides', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Process', 'Reading', 'Repetitive Sequence', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Statistical Models', 'Technology', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'deletion detection', 'design', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'improved', 'integration site', 'method development', 'novel', 'research study', 'tool']",NHGRI,JACKSON LABORATORY,U41,2015,2663757,0.012219207735488265
"Genetic predictors of anti-TNF treatment response and infections in IBD DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) affect over 1.4 million Americans. Over the past 15 years, considerable progress has been made in the therapy of CD and UC with monoclonal antibodies against tumor necrosis factor � (anti-TNF) representing the most significant therapeutic breakthrough. However, many patients fail to respond adequately. Recent genome wide associations studies (GWAS) have significantly increased our understanding of the pathogenesis of CD and UC. The role of these genetic variants in predicting response to anti-TNF therapy is yet to be defined adequately. In addition, significant safety concerns remain with the use of these agents with serious infections occurring in up to 10% of patients. There is a strong genetic component to susceptibility to infections, in particular involving polymorphisms in innate immunity. Given the key role of innate immunity in IBD pathogenesis, whether such shared polymorphisms also influence risk of infections on anti-TNF therapy has not been examined previously. Thus, the development of tools to define likelihood of treatment response and infections are a key unmet need in the field. Our overarching objective is to identify clinical and genetic predictors of both short-term and long-term response as well as infectious complications of anti-TNF therapy. To achieve these aims, we will utilize the complementary strengths of two large cohorts - a prospective registry cohort of over 1200 patients with CD or UC, and a novel EMR-based cohort of over 11,000 patients with CD or UC linked to a biospecimen repository. This proposal utilizes the mentorship and significant expertise in key areas including analytical genetics, translational immunology, and bioinformatics and allows the candidate to develop fundamental skills in these novel content areas and research methods. The access to expertise at the NIH-funded center Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside, the Center for Study of Inflammatory Bowel Disease, and the Broad Institute is a key strength of this application. This career development award will be critical in providing training in bioinformatics and genetic epidemiology, thus contributing to the candidate's long-term goal of establishing an independent IBD research career with focus on defining at-risk cohorts and personalizing therapy. The training component of the award includes graduate-level courses in the relevant content areas in genetic epidemiology, and bioinformatics at the Harvard Medical School, School of Public Health, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The candidate will continue to actively engage with an established group of multidisciplinary researchers who have demonstrated the utility of the EMR-based approach to accurately define autoimmune diseases, link it to biospecimen collection, and use it successfully for genotyping-phenotype research. This will help foster collaborative development of future proposals as the work proposed in this application has the potential for applicability in other cohorts. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The novel information gained from this study regarding genetic predictors of treatment response and infectious complications has the potential to transform clinical practice by leading to clinical trials focused on selected cohorts of patients most likely to respond to therapies with low risk of adverse events, thus preventing unnecessary exposure to potentially toxic therapies with low likelihood of benefit. Such work is a step toward developing personalized medicine approaches to tailor therapy based on likelihood of benefit and risk.

"Fast and Robust Methods for Large Scale Genotype Phenotype Association Study ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A fundamental challenge in life sciences is the characterization of genetic factors that underlie phenotypic differences. Thanks to the advanced sequencing technologies, an enormous amount of genetic variants have been identified and cataloged. Such data hold great potential to understand how genes affect phenotypes and contribute to the susceptibility to environmental stimulus. However, the existing computational methods for analyzing and interpreting the high‐throughput genetic data are still in their infancy.    We propose to systematically investigate the computational and statistical principles in modeling and discovering genetic basis of complex phenotypes. The proposed research provides answers to the following fundamental questions in genetic association study: (1) How to effectively and efficiently assess statistical significance of the findings? (2) How to account for the relatedness between samples in genetic association study? (3) How to accurately capture possible interactions between multiple genetic factors and their joint contribution to phenotypic variation? In particular, we will develop data structures and efficient algorithms for accurate and robust significance assessment that account for local population structure and joint effect of multiple genetic factors.    The proposed computational tools will be integrated into software packages under common application framework adopted by the broad scientific community.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A fundamental challenge in life sciences is the characterization of genetic factors that underlie phenotypic differences.

"Discovery and analysis of structural variation in whole genome sequences DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     The whole genome sequencing of large cohorts of individuals is quickly becoming a common tool for researchers to investigate the genetic basis of many disease phenotypes. The primary goals are to discover the underlying genetic variation that cause or contribute to these diseases as well as to correctly identify these variants in a diagnostic setting. These differences typicall consist of single base changes (SNPs), but can also encompass larger, more complex chromosomal rearrangements in the form of structural variation (SV) which are much more difficult to detect even with modern sequencing technologies. A number of approaches have been published that have studied this problem, but even the largest scale endeavors have only focused on deletion events and reported a sensitivity of <70%. Complex chromosomal rearrangements are even less well studied. Thus, it is paramount that accurate methods are developed which can detect all types of SVs at high specificity from sequence data. This proposal aims to improve the overall ability of researchers to identify and analyze genetic variation from whole genome sequences. An important, and often overlooked, aspect of SV discovery is the fact that typical paired-end, read depth, and split read approaches will identify different sets of non-overlapping variants at varying degrees of accuracy. In Aim 1, we will develop a unified SV discovery algorithm that can incorporate all of these different sources of information in a probabilistic fashion. Such a method would be useful for research, in particular with the identification of rare variants, as well as clinical applications which require a great del of accuracy and have thus far been limited to older karyotyping and microarray approaches. This would identify the majority of structural variants, however there are many regions in genomic sequences which are complex in nature, defined as consisting of multiple neighboring or overlapping chromosomal rearrangements that are challenging to resolve with typical SV detection approaches. In Aim 2, we propose methods to resolve these complex regions and assess their frequency and impact. Furthermore, a crucial step in medical genetics is the comparison of identified genetic mutations to databases of known pathogenic and benign variants. This is currently problematic with SVs, as they have often been originally reported with varying degrees of breakpoint resolution that can hamper the correct assignment of the variant. This issue is compounded further in more complex regions with multiple breakpoints, for which simplistic comparison methods do not work well. In Aim 3, we will develop and implement a system that describes and utilizes variant profiles to identify whether an individual's sequence data contains a variant of interest. Overall, this project will advance our understanding of the human genome as well as provide tools for use in the general research and clinical communities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     The rearrangement of chromosomal material in the form of structural variation is directly responsible for many disease phenotypes, however our ability to detect and resolve these events from whole genome sequence data is currently limited. We propose a number of strategies for improving the detection and analysis of structural genomic variation between individuals and resolving their underlying structure and function. These approaches will have direct application to the clinical diagnosis of such events and the future of personalized genomics.",Discovery and analysis of structural variation in whole genome sequences,8906910,R01HG007068,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Area', 'Benign', 'Chromosomal Rearrangement', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'DNA Sequence Rearrangement', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Karyotype determination procedure', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Genetics', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Organism', 'Pathogenicity', 'Population', 'Publishing', 'Reading', 'Records', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Scanning', 'Seeds', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical application', 'cohort', 'direct application', 'disease phenotype', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genomic variation', 'improved', 'interest', 'markov model', 'rare variant', 'structural genomics', 'tool', 'virtual']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2015,371408,0.0024190465716892825
"F-CAP: Functionalization of Variants in Clinically Actionable Pharmacogenes ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Patient-to-patient variability in response to drugs creates a significant challenge for the safe and effective treatment of many human diseases. Pharmacogenomics seeks to address this challenge by linking drug response to patient genotypes at important loci, termed pharmacogenes, in order to better customize patient treatments. Genetic variation in pharmacogenes is extensive. For example, amongst 12 CYP genes, 10% of people carry at least one rare, potentially deleterious variant. Unfortunately, only a small number of variants have been unambiguously linked to alterations in drug response. Clearly, new approaches are needed to annotate the consequences of the huge pool of variants of unknown significance, including those already identified by existing large-scale sequencing programs, and those that will be discovered as clinical sequencing becomes routine. In this proposal, we seek to address this problem directly and at a scale never before possible by taking advantage of new technologies in sequencing and functional analysis. Our resource, termed F-CAP (Functionalization of Variants in Clinically Actionable Pharmacogenes) will test all possible substitutions at all amino acid residues in some of the most clinically important pharmacogenes and disseminate these data to the medical and research communities. In order to accomplish this, we will use deep mutational scanning, a method we have developed that allows parallelized, and quantitative measurements to be performed on libraries of genetic variants. In Aim 1 we will create these libraries, starting with five of the most important CPIC level A or B priority genes (CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, TPMT and VKORC1), and test the stability and enzymatic activity of each variant en masse using a pooled selection strategy. In Aim 2, we will integrate these data to create an impact score. This impact score provides a numerical value for a variant's functional effects that is amenable to easy integration into prescribing guidelines being developed by the pharmacogenomics community. Aim 3 will validate this score for a subset of variants that span the impact score spectrum using therapeutically relevant substrates for each pharmacogene. Finally, Aim 4 describes a key component of this resource: the dissemination of our findings to the entire pharmacogenomics community through partnership with CPIC and PharmGKB. In addition, we will make available our raw and processed data via a custom web resource that will also be developed in Aim 4. This resource will provide a series of fully annotated datasets describing the functional consequences of every possible single mutation in a series of key pharmacogenes, thereby greatly advancing the field of personalized medicine.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Pharmacogenomics seeks to identify genetic sources of inter-individual variability in drug response, with the goal of personalizing drug selection and dose to improve patient outcomes. A key barrier to using pharmacogenomic information is lack of clarity about the functional impact of variants, which hampers the provision of clear, unambiguous guidance to health care providers. We propose to connect pharmacogenomic variant discovery with novel high-throughput experimental approaches to deliver a resource to guide the use of individual pharmacogenomic information in personalizing drug treatment.            ",F-CAP: Functionalization of Variants in Clinically Actionable Pharmacogenes,8933744,R24GM115277,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Amino Acids', 'Applications Grants', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Assay', 'CYP2C19 gene', 'CYP2C9 gene', 'CYP2D6 gene', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Cellular Assay', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dose', 'Elements', 'Funding', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health Personnel', 'High-Throughput DNA Sequencing', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Large-Scale Sequencing', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Research', 'Methods', 'Monoclonal Antibody R24', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Numerical value', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Plant Roots', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Relative (related person)', 'Resources', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Source', 'TPMT gene', 'Testing', 'Translations', 'Variant', 'clinical sequencing', 'clinically actionable', 'computerized data processing', 'effective therapy', 'exome', 'genetic disorder diagnosis', 'genetic information', 'genetic variant', 'human disease', 'improved', 'interest', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'personalized medicine', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'stability testing', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'variant of unknown significance']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R24,2015,751729,0.007708919162377576
"Mechanisms underlying complex trait human disease DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is now an explosion of new genome scale data relating genetic variation within the human population to phenotype, and particularly to common disease. Microarray technology has identified 100s of loci where the presence of particular variants is associated with altered risk of many common diseases; complete sequencing of individual exomes in cancer samples has discovered many somatic mutations in a variety of genes; and sequencing of 1000 human genomes has provided an almost complete inventory of common population variants. Further, these data are only the first in an ever-increasing flood, as even faster and cheaper sequencing technologies come on line. The results hold promise for major advances in treatment and diagnosis of common human diseases. Extracting the expected benefits is not straightforward, and will necessitate acquiring detailed knowledge of the mechanisms linking genetic variation to disease. This project focuses on one aspect of this challenge - using the new genomic data to identify new therapeutic opportunities. We will investigate those principles underlying complex trait disease that are particularly relevant to tha goal. We introduce a three stage mechanistic framework, relating genomic variation to the function of impacted gene products, the impact of these altered functions on pathways, processes and subsystems; and finally the consequences for complex trait disease phenotypes. We will develop computational methods to address key questions concerning three major aspects of the framework (1) How large are the changes in protein function brought about by the genomic variants underlying complex trait disease? What role do different classes of genomic and protein level mechanism, such as expression, non-synonymous changes and splicing, play in these variants? (2) How complete is the set genes with strong influence on the disease phenotypes discovered by current technologies, and how can missing genes be imputed from the genomic and network data? (3) What is the distribution of coupling between the activity of genes involved in disease mechanism and disease phenotypes? The results will deepen understanding of these aspects of complex disease, and provide a basis for identifying potential new drug targets from GWAS and other genomic studies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: New technologies are now providing extensive information on human genetic variation associated with increased risk of a wide range of common human disease, such as Alzheimer's, diabetes, heart disease, and many cancers. These data hold the promise for the development of new therapies, and realizing those benefits requires the acquisition of complementary knowledge of the mechanisms that link genetic variation to disease risk.

To address this challenge, we recently developed a novel framework, Combined Annotation Dependent Depletion (CADD), for estimating the deleteriousness of any genetic variant. CADD defines an objective, data-rich, and quantitative integration of many genomic annotations into a single measure of variant effect at the organismal level. The goals of this R01 proposal are to further develop the CADD framework, to apply it in the context of ongoing genetic studies of both rare and common human diseases, and to experimentally evaluate its predictions. In Specific Aim 1, we will substantially modify CADD in both straightforward and creative ways, with the goal of dramatically improving CADD's ability to annotate non- coding variants, not only to estimate their organismal effects but also to provide insights into molecular mechanisms. In Specific Aim 2, we will apply CADD to a variety of ongoing whole genome sequencing studies of human disease, especially those in which non-coding variants are either known or suspected to be causal. As part of this effort, we will develop new statistical frameworks that directly incorporat CADD into traditional genome-wide discovery approaches. In Specific Aim 3, we will perform a combination of high-throughput (massively parallel reporter assays), medium-throughput (CRISPR/Cas9), and low-throughput (in vivo mouse transgenics) experimental assays for systematic and targeted assessment of CADD predictions. This proposal includes both computational and experimental innovations, and builds on established collaborative relationships between investigators with complementary strengths. The completion of our aims will yield novel methods, data, and resources with which to annotate whole genome sequences, broadly enabling the field to more effectively identify and mechanistically understand non-coding genetic variants that are causally relevant to human disease.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: As we enter an era of personalized medicine, a deep understanding of human genomes will be increasingly important to public health, contributing to the unraveling of the genetic basis of human disease, as well as serving an increasing role in clinical diagnostics. However, our limited understanding of the functional consequences of most genetic variants, especially those that do not alter protein sequence, represents a major obstacle. This proposal seeks to dramatically improve our ability to identify and interpret ""non-coding"" variants that causally contribute to human disease. A recently developed computational approach will be substantially improved and evaluated in a variety of genetic studies, and its predictions will be experimentally validated. This project will provide much needed methods and resources to address the looming analytical challenges associated with individual whole genome sequencing in both biomedical research and patient care.                ",Integrative interpretation of the organismal consequences of non-coding variation,8792292,R01CA197139,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cell Line', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Clinical', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Code', 'Complex Genetic Trait', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Event', 'Feedback', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Genomic approach', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Biology', 'Human Genetics', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mendelian disorder', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Nucleotides', 'Organism', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patient Care', 'Peptide Sequence Determination', 'Phenotype', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'RNA Binding', 'RNA Splicing', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Site', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Translating', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Untranslated Regions', 'Variant', 'Vocabulary', 'Weight', 'base', 'candidate identification', 'disease phenotype', 'exome', 'exome sequencing', 'follow-up', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic pedigree', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genome-wide', 'human disease', 'human genome sequencing', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'insight', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'personalized medicine', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'trait', 'transcription factor']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2015,666593,0.0005880095672300069
"Predicting causal non-coding variants in a founder population Enter the text here that is the new abstract information for your application. This section must be no longer than 30 lines of text. In order to characterize the molecular and cellular causes of human disease, it will be essential to unravel the functional impact of genetic variation. However, we are currently unable to predict the impact of the majority of genetic variants that lie in non-coding regions of the genome, where indeed most complex disease-associated variants are found. Additionally, recent evidence suggests that a significant fraction of the non-coding genome is likely to be functional, often playing a role in gene regulation. Therefore, our limited understanding of non- coding variation is a critical hurdle to characterizing the genetic basis of disease. The goal of this project is to develop methods for interpreting non-coding genetic variation: to provide a robust and extensible Bayesian method for predicting causal variants from full genomes, to identify and validate a large set of functional non- coding variants using CRISPR technology, and to predict disease-relevant traits likely to be affected by each variant. Our project will leverage the increasing availability of cohorts such as UK10K, GTEx, CARTaGENE and SardiNIA, with genome sequence and transcriptome data available from thousands of individuals, along with extensive phenotyping for hundreds of traits. We will combine advanced statistical modeling with experimental validation based on genome engineering to identify causal non-coding variants affecting biomedical traits in the cohort, along with predicting functional mechanisms through which these variants ultimately perturb the cell. In Aim 1, we develop computational methods for predicting causal non-coding variation from full genomes, incorporating multiple informative genomic features into a Bayesian approach. We will optimize and apply these methods on genome and transcriptome data available for well-studied and broadly-accessible cohorts to identify a large set of variants predicted to causally affect gene expression. Based on these predictions, in Aim 2, we connect putative causal variants with the diverse set of disease- relevant traits measured in the cohort, using network inference to capture the cascade from genetic variation to gene expression to disease. We will develop methods to integrate across variants, using the models in Aim 1, to identify the common causal mechanisms related to each trait. In Aim 3, we validate the causal impact of non-coding variants predicted to affect high-level traits. We will use genome editing through CRISPR to introduce individual genetic variants into cell lines and use qPCR to validate the predicted effects on gene expression. Finally, a major goal throughout this proposal will be to provide the research community with convenient computational tools for the prediction of causal non-coding variants from individual genomes, updated on an ongoing basis to integrate the most recent genomic annotations and public data in order to provide the best possible accuracy in predicting causal variants and the traits they are likely to affect. Our project will greatly advance our understanding of non-coding genetic variation, the specific mechanisms affected by causal variants, and the downstream consequences to the cell and individual health. 2. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Understanding the impact of variation in the entire genome, beyond the well-studied protein-coding regions, is essential to understanding the relationship between genetics and human health. This proposal addresses the problem of identifying functional non-coding genetic variants and predicting the impact of each variant on hundreds of disease-relevant traits. Our approach will focus on integrative, transformative methods for understanding mechanisms underlying the function of the human genome.                ",Predicting causal non-coding variants in a founder population,8792751,R01HG008150,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Bayesian Method', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Categories', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Family', 'Founder Generation', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genome engineering', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human Genetics', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Link', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Nucleotides', 'Open Reading Frames', 'Pathogenesis', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Property', 'RNA Splicing', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sardinia', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Models', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Transcript', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Widespread Disease', 'base', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'data modeling', 'density', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder risk', 'functional genomics', 'genetic linkage analysis', 'genetic variant', 'genome annotation', 'genome editing', 'genome sequencing', 'genome-wide', 'human data', 'human disease', 'human genome sequencing', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'molecular phenotype', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'trait', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NHGRI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,477647,-0.0221350458708039
"Multivariate Pattern Analysis Methods for Neuroimaging Genetics Studies DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Common mental disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia are largely heritable with complex genetic underpinnings. Large-scale genome-wide association studies that contrast DNA sequence data from patients and controls have recently identified novel genetic risk variants for these disorders. Nevertheless, the processes through which genotype increases risk are yet to be fully characterized.  Neuroimaging offers a richer picture of the underlying disease processes than a clinical diagnosis. Thus the joint analysis of neuroimaging and genetics data promises to advance our understanding of these processes. Today, neuroimaging genetics studies however face important challenges that obstruct progress: small sample sizes, modest effect sizes, and the extreme dimensionality of the data limit statistical power and thus our ability to explore the complex and subtle associations between genes, neuroanatomy and clinical decline. Currently, the prevalent approach in neuroimaging genetics is to concentrate the analysis on a small number of anatomic regions of interest and/or candidate genes and often ignore a large portion of the data. The core goal of the proposed project is to develop computational tools that will take full advantage of the richness in the datasets and facilitate the exploration of the multifaceted associations between genotype, neuroimaging measurements and clinical phenotype. The proposed project will use advanced multivariate pattern analysis methods such as support vector machines to compute image-based and genetic scores that reflect pathology. We will validate the tools based on their association with classical biomarkers of disease. Finally, we will develop a model that uses both imaging and genotype data to predict future clinical outcome. We expect these tools will enable progress along three directions relevant to complex mental disorders, e.g. late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD): (1) confirming and characterizing risk genes, (2) identifying disease-specific anatomical alterations in healthy individuals, and (3) early diagnosis and prognosis. The project will (1) use three already-collected large-scale datasets to apply the developed tools to AD, (2) build on cutting-edge image processing algorithms that we have been developing, and (3) allow the candidate to receive further training in neuroanatomy, mental disorders and genetics, forming the foundation for his future career as an independent researcher. n/a",Multivariate Pattern Analysis Methods for Neuroimaging Genetics Studies,8916113,K25EB013649,"['Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Anatomy', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Face', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Research', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genetic study', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Late Onset Alzheimer Disease', 'Lead', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Schizophrenia', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Training', 'base', 'career', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical phenotype', 'cognitive performance', 'computerized tools', 'data modeling', 'disorder risk', 'entorhinal cortex', 'genetic risk factor', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'high risk', 'image processing', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'molecular pathology', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'pre-clinical', 'programs', 'risk variant', 'tool']",NIBIB,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K25,2015,175392,-0.018311287788248046
"Integrative Analysis of Genomic Risk Factors in Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA), afflicting ~1 in 10,000 North American Children, encompasses a highly heterogeneous group of chronic, immune-mediated joint disorders. Aside from causing severe pain, tissue damage, and physical immobility, chronic disease activity leads to permanent short stature and limb disfigurement. Similar to a number of other complex polygenic autoimmune diseases, there is a clear heritable component to JIA, but all known genetic risk factors explain less than 20% of disease heritability. The majority of this is attributable to variation across the Major Histocompatibility  (MHC) locus, yet definitive high-resolution identification of MHC associations in JIA have not been conclusive. JIA is currently classified into seven clinical subtypes, based on a classification schema that has little research or clinical utility, since 10-50% of cases are classified as ""undifferentiated"". Biological and molecular evidence based on the presence of serum autoantibodies and other molecular biomarkers of immunological defects suggest that the existing seven JIA subtypes could be grouped into two major classes-subtypes that represent either predominantly seropositive autoimmune (AID) diseases or seronegative autoinflammatory (AIF) diseases. Whether genetic risk factors differ for AID versus AIF-like JIA subtypes is unknown, especially since the traditional approach to genetic association studies is poorly powered to identify loci with subtype- specific effects in the presence of significant phenotypic heterogeneity. To test the hypothesis that distinct genetic risk factors underlie the clinically observed differences in AID versus AIF-like JIA subtypes and identify both shared and subtype-distinct genetic susceptibility loci, I propose to use a subtype-sensitive GWAS to identify JIA disease subtype-specific genetics associations, evaluate evidence for functional HLA associations that are distinct or shared across JIA subtypes, and test if the identified genetic associations can be used to predict disease susceptibility, distinguish patients who belong to AID versus AIF-like JIA classes, and reclassify patients currently defined as having undifferentiated disease. The analysis approach proposed here integrates genomic screening, disease modeling and prediction, and the use of expression and functional data resources to better understand the etiology of JIA. The successful completion of this work will likely yield novel biomolecular or pathway-based targets for the development of therapeutic agents for children with JIA and patients with other related rheumatological or immunological diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis is a severe pediatric form of immune-mediate joint disease that can result in significant morbidity and life-long disability. While the etiology of JIA, similar to other complex autoimmune and inflammatory disorders that together affect nearly 10% of the United States population, is not well-understood, a strong genetic component has been demonstrated. My proposal aims to develop novel genome-wide analysis tools and applies these tools to the identification of genetic risk susceptibility factorsin JIA and other heterogeneous, complex hereditary disorders, which have the potential to yield promising disease-specific molecular and pharmacologic targets.",Integrative Analysis of Genomic Risk Factors in Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis,8879958,F30AR066486,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'American', 'Amino Acids', 'Antigenic Variation', 'Antigens', 'Arthritis', 'Autoantibodies', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmune Process', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Surface Receptors', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Childhood Arthritis', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Crohn&apos', 's disease', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Epitopes', 'Etiology', 'Exclusion', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Epistasis', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'HLA Antigens', 'Health', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Histocompatibility', 'Immune', 'Immune System Diseases', 'Inflammatory', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Life', 'Limb structure', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mutation', 'Pain', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Polyarthritides', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Psoriasis', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Serological', 'Serum', 'Siblings', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Specificity', 'TNFRSF10A gene', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Undifferentiated', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'arthropathies', 'base', 'case control', 'cohort', 'disability', 'disease classification', 'disorder risk', 'disorder subtype', 'evidence base', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic association', 'genetic risk factor', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide analysis', 'novel', 'risk variant', 'screening', 'seropositive', 'targeted treatment', 'tool']",NIAMS,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,F30,2015,46443,0.008105338221317818
"Pharmacogenomics of Statin Therapy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall objective of the Center ""Pharmacogenomics of Statin Therapy"" (POST) is to apply genomic, transcriptomic, and metabolomic analyses, together with studies in cellular and animal models, and innovative informatic tools, to identify and validate biomarkers for efficacy of statin drugs in reducing riskof cardiovascular disease (CVD), and for adverse effects of statins, specifically myopathy and type 2 diabetes. This multidisciplinary approach is enabled by a team of investigators with expertise in genomics (human, mouse, and molecular), statistics and informatics, and clinical medicine and pharmacology. The Center is comprised of three Projects, two Research Cores, and an Administrative Core. A major aim of Project 1 is the identification of cellular transcriptomic and metabolomic markers for clinical efficacy and adverse effects of statins. This will be accomplished by analyses in statin-exposed lymphoblast cell lines derived from patients with major adverse coronary events, or onset of myopathy or type 2 diabetes on statin treatment, compared with unaffected statin- treated controls. In addition, using genome wide genotypes from these patients, DNA variants will be identified that are associated with statin-induced changes in the transcripts and metabolites that most strongly discriminate affected patients and controls. Project 2 will use a unique, well-characterized panel of 100 inbred mouse strains to discover genetic variation associated with statin-induced myopathy and dysglycemia. Mechanisms underlying these effects will be investigated, with emphasis on the role of dysregulation of autophagy by statin treatment. Projects 1 and 2 will also use relevant cellular and mouse models, respectively, to perform functional studies to validate effects of genes identified in all POST projects as strong candidates for modulating statin efficacy or adverse effects. In Project 3, information derived from genome-wide genotypes, electronic health records, and pharmacy data in a very large and diverse population-based patient cohort will be leveraged to identify and replicate genetic associations with statin efficacy (lipid lowering and CVD event reduction) and adverse effects (myopathy and type 2 diabetes), as well as to assess the overall heritability of these responses. The Clinical Core, based in Kaiser Permanente of Northern California, will provide the clinical information and biologic materials for both Projects1 and 3. Investigators in the Informatics Core will optimize data analysis and integration of results across all projects. The Administrative Core will provide scientific leadership and management of the Center, and foster scientific interactions and training opportunities. Overall, the research program of this Center provides an innovative model for a ""systems"" approach to pharmacogenomics that incorporates complementary investigative tools to discover and validate genetically influenced determinants of drug response. Moreover, the findings have the potential for guiding more effective use of statins for reducing CVD risk and minimizing adverse effects, and identifying biomarkers of pathways that modulate the multiple actions of this widely used class of drugs.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Coronary heart disease and stroke are the leading causes of death and disability in the United States, and statins are the most widely prescribed class of drugs to prevent these conditions. There is however, considerable interindividual variation in efficacy of statins for reducing disease risk, as well as in susceptibility to the most common adverse statin effects, myopathy and type 2 diabetes. The goal of the Center ""Pharmacogenomics of Statin Therapy"" (POST) is to apply complementary investigative approaches and multidisciplinary expertise for discovering and validating the genetic and metabolic factors responsible for this variability. This information has the potential for optimizig use of statins in clinical practice, and for identifying new pathways that underlie the diverse biologic actions of this drug class.              ",Pharmacogenomics of Statin Therapy,8934878,P50GM115318,"['Adverse effects', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Autophagocytosis', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'California', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Line', 'Cell model', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Pharmacology', 'Collaborations', 'Control Locus', 'Coronary', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease Outcome', 'Drug effect disorder', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronics', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Event', 'Fostering', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Hybrids', 'Hyperglycemia', 'In Vitro', 'Inbred Strains Mice', 'Informatics', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Metabolic', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Muscle function', 'Myopathy', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Predisposition', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Recombinants', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Residual state', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Simvastatin', 'Stroke', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'Variant', 'adverse outcome', 'alternative treatment', 'base', 'blood glucose regulation', 'candidate validation', 'cardiovascular disorder prevention', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'clinical efficacy', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'data integration', 'data visualization', 'design', 'disability', 'disorder risk', 'exome', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic association', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'lymphoblast', 'lymphoblastoid cell line', 'metabolomics', 'mouse model', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'novel strategies', 'population based', 'prevent', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'statistics', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment strategy']",NIGMS,CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL & RES CTR AT OAKLAND,P50,2015,2836708,0.009096673486966115
"Genome Wide Association Study for Childhood Obesity DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Obesity is a major risk factor for type 2 diabetes, which in turn has serious complications including accelerated development of cardiovascular disease. The prevalence of obesity in children and adults in the United States has increased by more than 30% over the past decade.  We previously successfully argued in our application for the R01 HD056465 award that distillation of the genetic component in this complex phenotype should thus be easier to determine in children, where environmental exposure and impact has been for a relatively short period of their lifetime; indeed the resulting work did pan out to be successful in this regard. We carried out a non-hypothesis-driven study that was directed at uncovering genes and genetic variants that predispose to childhood obesity by conducting a genome-wide association study (GWAS) using a high density tag-SNP array. Employing a powered two-stage study design in a consortium setting, where cases were defined as being in the e95th percentile of BMI, we identified novel association signals which we subsequently replicated. This NICHD funded study was ultimately published in Nature Genetics (with the PI as senior author) and received widespread press attention, including with CNN, Time and the front page of USA Today.  The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia is now poised to determine additional genetic factors conferring risk to the pathogenesis of childhood obesity through the leveraging of new ultra-high-throughput sequencing technology, and also allow for fine-mapping of the already uncovered loci to determine the actual causal mechanism of action. Combining our accurately phenotyped cohort, which represents the largest pediatric obesity DNA collection in the world, with access to familial childhood obesity, availability of existing genome wide singl nucleotide polymorphism genotypes and the application of whole exome sequencing, this renewal application of R01 HD056465 proposes to broaden the list of novel genetic loci that are associated with this trait in order to get further insights in to the genetic etiology of common pediatric obesity.  We are well positioned to extend our knowledge of the genetic etiology of childhood obesity. It is unclear if these additional variants are common in the population, a set o private mutations in families or a mixture of both. Irrespective of the nature of the variant(s) we are well positioned to look for both types of event, with common variants detectable through leveraging the GWAS dataset of well powered cohorts and private mutations detectable through whole exome sequencing of many multi-case pedigrees. This represents a major follow-up to the Principal Investigator's original grant application and this renewal will allow for adding extr value to the already substantial findings made funded by the original grant. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The prevalence of obesity in children and adults in the United States has increased by more than 30% over the past decade. We are seeking to renew R01 HD056465 to expand on the successful findings made previously and to further characterize the genetic etiology of childhood obesity and pediatric BMI trajectory.

"Quantitative microscopy-based rapid phenotyping and screening ﻿    DESCRIPTION:  Synapses are most fundamental to the function of a nervous system. C. elegans is an excellent genetic model system for finding genes and elucidating pathways because of its sequenced genome and the abundance of molecular biology tools and mutants. Due to the simplicity of its nervous system, many breakthroughs have been made in C. elegans for understanding molecular mechanisms in the patterning of the nervous system and synapse development. The current bottlenecks are in the manual and non-quantitative techniques such as visual screens, limiting both the throughput of the experiments and the phenotypes one can examine. Our long-term objective is to develop technologies and to understand how genes, age, and the environment together define and continue to remodel the nervous system of an organism. In the last funding period, we have made large progress in hardware system design (including microtechnologies and automation technologies) and software for quantitative characterization of phenotypes. The objective of this continuation project is to further engineer superior micro devices for large-scale live imaging and quantitative imaging technologies, and combine with the power of genetic and genomic approaches to study synapse development in this in vivo system; genes and pathways emerging from this study could potentially become targets of therapeutics in neurological disorders.  We have shown in the previous phase of the project that quantitative microscopy-based approaches can indeed enable identification of novel genes and pathways that conventional approaches cannot. In the continuation phase, we will further optimize on-chip rapid and high-content in vivo imaging techniques, and in parallel further develop algorithms and quantitative measures for the analysis of such high-content data; we will screen based on novel synthetic phenotype unobservable by eye; we will also exploit powerful genomic techniques to identify loci and potential multigenic interactions that shape the synapse morphology. These experimental approaches will identify genes that cannot have been identified otherwise because of the difficulties associated with the phenotypical profiling, but addressed using our engineered techniques here. The approach is innovative because the technology developed here dramatically increases the throughput, sensitivity, and accuracy of the experiments, and truly enables the utility of extremely powerful genetic and genomic methods. The proposed research is significant because it fills the urgent need in high-throughput and high-content screens as well as identifying novel genes and pathways.

"Clinically Relevant Genome Variation Database We propose to create the world's premier database of genetic variants relevant to clinical care (Clinically Relevant Genetic Variants Resource or CRVR). We will provide transparent data synthesis and consensus opinion on the clinical utility of a given genetic variant across a spectrum of genetic lesions including single nucleotide changes, small indels and structural variants. We will integrate with ClinVar, PharmGKB, and OMIM and draw upon NHGRI initiatives including the Genome Sequencing and Analysis and Mendelian Disorders Sequencing Centers, and the Clinical Sequencing Exploratory Research Centers. We will work closely with other CRVR sites and NHGRI funded initiatives to improve deposition of data from clinical laboratories. Our database will be built through three Aims. Aim 1 will engage and energize the clinical genomics community around CRVR efforts. We will partner with the other CRVR and U41 investigators in this activity as they will focus on engagement of professional societies, clinical testing laboratories, and the broader clinical genomics community to ensure creation of a CRVR resource that meets anticipated community needs including assembly of Disease-Specific and Mutation Type Working Groups (DSWGs and MTWGs) comprised of expert clinical geneticists and molecular diagnosticians to establish metrics for the initial classification of variants and integration of guidelines from professional organizations. Aim 2 will involve creation of a CRVR CoreDB resource through expert review of the existing literature, locus databases, and NHGRI initiatives. We will disseminate consensus findings on clinically relevant genetic variants and the clinical implications of these variants, with supporting evidence and documentation of the consensus process. Information will be aggregated using standard ontologies and advanced methodologies for handling heterogeneous data to create a Core Database (CoreDB). The consensus of expert review will be disseminated through a user-friendly web Portal (vetted by Genetic Counseling WG), web services for data mining, and consensus clinical guidelines to the appropriate clinical and research communities. The results will be organized by gene, variant, disease, pathway, and literature. Supporting evidence will also be curated and disseminated, and the resource will be updated continuously as new information accumulates. Aim 3 will involve deployment of machine-learning algorithms for semi- automatic identification of putative Clinically Relevant Variants (CRVs). We will undertake data mining of the clinical and epidemiological genetics literature and existing databases to identify putative clinically important variants. This will involve mining data from ClinVar, OMIM, CSER, and the Mendelian centers aggregated in Aim 2. The Working Groups formed in Aim 1 will establish criteria and oversee curators vetting variants. We will develop and optimize disease- and gene-specific machine learning algorithms to facilitate rapid classification of variants based on data provided by genetic testing services via ClinVar. We will integrate population-genetic data inferred from at least 25 reference populations from the 1000 Genomes Project and other large endeavors into our machine learning approaches so as to infer the global relevance of CRVs discovered here. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to create a unified, public, and freely available database of genetic alterations relevant to clinical care. Our ultimate goal is to empower clinicians, genetic counselors, and patients to make informed decisions based on DNA testing. Because much of the information required for such decisions is scattered among public and private databases, we propose combining the medical literature, expert summary of millions of de- identified genetic tests, and results from current and past NIH-funded genetic studies into a single unified database.",Clinically Relevant Genome Variation Database,8738706,U01HG007436,"['Algorithms', 'American', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Practice Guideline', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Consensus', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Association', 'Disease Pathway', 'Documentation', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Counseling', 'Genetic Population Study', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Human Genetics', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lesion', 'Letters', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Metric', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'North Carolina', 'Nucleotides', 'Online Mendelian Inheritance In Man', 'Ontology', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Population Genetics', 'Process', 'Professional Organizations', 'Professional counselor', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Services', 'Site', 'Societies', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinically relevant', 'college', 'data exchange', 'data mining', 'design', 'empowered', 'gene function', 'genetic variant', 'genome analysis', 'genome sequencing', 'improved', 'knowledge base', 'medical schools', 'meetings', 'novel', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'user-friendly', 'web services', 'working group']",NHGRI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,U01,2014,2351999,0.023859138905415463
"Optimizing Genetic Testing for Deafness for Clinical Diagnostics   Project Summary  In this goal-driven proposal, submitted in response to Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) Number PAR-11-003, we will make comprehensive genetic testing for deafness available to clinicians for under $500 per person. The driving force behind this initiative is the frequency of hearing impairment. As the most common sensory impairment, it is diagnosed in 1 of every 500 newborns and 50% of octogenarians (Morton Ann N Y Acad Sci 1991). With 57 genes implicated in nonsyndromic hearing loss (NSHL), it is also an extremely heterogeneous trait and presents a tremendous challenge to diagnosis.  Current strategies for genetic testing for deafness are inadequate. For most, only a minority of genes is included, with selection criteria typically reflecting: 1) high prevalence as a cause of deafness (i.e. GJB2); 2) association with another recognizable feature (i.e. SLC26A4 and enlarged vestibular aqueduct); or 3) a recognizable audioprofile (i.e. low frequency hearing loss as seen with WFS1) (Hilgert et al Mut Res 2009).  The recent advent of powerful DNA target enrichment and sequencing technologies, however, makes it possible to provide comprehensive genetic testing for deafness that is efficient and cost-effective. We have shown that it is possible to analyze all deafness genes simultaneously on a single platform (called OtoSCOPE) (Shearer et al PNAS 2010). Related to this endeavor, we have also validated AudioGene as a phenotypic tool that uses patient audiograms to predict the genetic cause of ADNSHL (Hildebrand et al Genet Med 2008; Hildebrand et al Laryngoscope 2009).  Building on these findings, in this proposal we will complete two specific aims.  Specific Aim 1: To provide comprehensive, high-throughput, low-cost DNA sequence generation and analysis for deafness genetic testing  Goal 1: Comprehensive, high-throughput, low-cost DNA sequence analysis for genetic testing for deafness is possible at sensitivities and specificities comparable to Sanger sequencing by using targeted sequence enrichment followed by massively parallel sequencing.  Specific Aim 2: To optimize both machine learning-based audioprofiling of audiometric data and phenotypic filtering of genotypic data by expanding and improving the platform we have developed called AudioGene  Goal 2: As a phenome tool, a machine-learning software system trained on an extensive set of audiometric data can be used to predict and to eliminate specific genes or gene variants as causes of deafness based on audiometric data.  Achieving these specific aims will change the clinical evaluation of deaf and hard-of-hearing persons by making genetic testing the most important diagnostic test after a history, physical examination and audiological assessment.   In this goal-driven proposal, submitted in response to Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) Number PAR-11-003, we will make comprehensive genetic testing for deafness available to clinicians for under $500 per person.

"Systems genetic and reverse phenotypic analysis of age and retirement     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): High throughput genomic platforms have revealed a profound effect of age on gene expression and gene methylation levels. For example, our integromic analysis of multiple publicly available data sets have identified hundreds of age related genes that can be organized into network modules. These gene sets along with genes and pathways known from the vast literature on aging and longevity provide valuable candidates in allelic association studies of the health and well-being of older Americans. The rich longitudinal data set and the genome wide scans of DNA samples from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) provide a unique resource for evaluating the phenotypic effects of genetic variants underlying aging related genes, gene sets and for developing multivariable models that include behavioral, psychosocial, and genetic factors. This proposal aims to apply systems biologic and systems genetic methods for identifying gene sets based on existing gene expression, gene methylation, and multiple large scale genome wide association studies (GWAS). Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) underlying these genes will then be related to health, cognitive, behavioral, and economic phenotypes using multivariable regression-, machine learning-, and weighted network analysis approaches. An iterative process between SNP and phenotype selection facilitates the definition of clinically and economically important phenotypes under genetic control (reverse phenotyping). The proposal will not only elucidate the genetic and molecular underpinnings of retirement relevant phenotypes (cognitive functioning, psychosocial factors, and health related expenditures) but also lead to a phenotypic annotation of aging related genes and pathways.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: State of the art statistical, computational, and network approaches for integrating genomic data with the valuable phenotypic and genetic data provided by the Health and Retirement Study is expected to lead to the identification of genetic markers relevant for improving the lives of America's older adults.

"Genome-Transcription-Phenome-Wide Association: a new paradigm for association stu DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many complex disease syndromes consist of a large number of highly related, rather than independent, clinical phenotypes. Differences between these syndromes involve the complex interplay of a large number of genomic variations that perturb the function of disease-related genes in the context of a regulatory network, rather than individually. Thus unraveling the causal genetic variations and understanding the mechanisms of consequent cell and tissue transformation requires an analysis that jointly considers the epistatic, pleiotropic, and plastic interactions of elements and modules within and between the genome (G), transcriptome (T), and phenome (P). Most conventional methods focus on associations between every individual marker genotype and every single phenotype; they have limited statistical power and overlook the complex omit structures. We propose a systematic attempt on methodological development for the largely unexplored but practically important problem of structured associations between the ""-omes"". Rather than testing each SNP separately for association and then applying a correction by multiple hypothesis test, a structured association analysis identifies associations between groups of entities each with its own sophisticated structure that can not be ignored, such as blocks of SNPs with high LD, modules of genes in the same pathway, and clusters of phenotypes belong to a system of clinical descriptors of a disease. We will develop a mathematically rigorous and computationally efficient machine learning platform and software to address the methodological challenges involved with unraveling the interplay between disease-relevant elements in the G, T, and P omes. Our technical innovations include novel statistical models and algorithms for haplotype inference, recombination hotspot detection, gene network and phenotype network inference, admixture association mapping, and most importantly, a family of new structured regression techniques such as the graph-regularized regression, graph- guided fused lasso and extensions, that perform functional approximations to the association functions among structural elements in the G, T, and P omes, and have provable guarantee on consistency and sparsistency. We envisage our proposed research will open a new paradigm for association studies of complex diseases, which facilitates: 1) Intra- and inter-omic integration of data for association mapping and disease gene/pathway discovery, 2) Thorough explorations of the internal structures within different omic data, so that cryptic associations that are not possibly detectable in unstructured analysis due to their weak statistical power can be now inferred. 3) Joint statistical inference of mechanisms and pathways of how variations in DNA lead to variations in complex traits flows through molecular networks, and inference of condition-specific state of gene function in the molecular networks, and 4) Development of faster and automated computational algorithm with greater scalability and robustness to large-scale inter-omic analysis, and more convenient software package and user interface. All the software tools will be made available for free to the public. Project Narrative  We propose a systematic attempt on methodological development for the largely unexplored but practically  important problem of structured association mapping between disease-relevant elements in the genome,  transcriptome, and phenome. Since many complex diseases involve composite phenotypes that are the  outcome of intricate perturbation of molecular network underlying gene regulatory resulted from complex and  interdependent genome variations, structured association analysis at multi-omic level is not only needed, but  also necessary, but it is beyond the grasp of convention methods and requires the methodological innovations  we propose. Characterizing such interactions can provide a more comprehensive genetic and molecular view  of complex diseases, which may lead to the identification of genes underlying disease processes; in addition,  such an approach will allow us to formulate hypotheses regarding the roles of these genes with respect to  disease pathogenesis, and to develop improved diagnostic biomarkers for multivariate clinical phenotypes.",Genome-Transcription-Phenome-Wide Association: a new paradigm for association stu,8656359,R01GM087694,"['Address', 'Admixture', 'Affect', 'Asthma', 'Biological Markers', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Descriptor', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Family', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Recombination', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Graph', 'Haplotypes', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Indium', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Lasso', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Analysis', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Plastics', 'Population', 'Process', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research', 'Role', 'Software Tools', 'Statistical Algorithm', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Study Subject', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transcript', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical phenotype', 'data integration', 'data mining', 'disorder control', 'gene function', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic linkage analysis', 'grasp', 'improved', 'innovation', 'novel', 'phenome', 'trait']",NIGMS,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R01,2014,492794,-0.021338651331230044
"Statistical Modeling of Complex Traits in Genetic Reference Super-Populations     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Genetic crosses in model organisms play an essential role in understanding the heritable architecture of medically relevant phenotypes. Traditionally, such crosses have tended to be on a small scale with either limited power to detect genetic effects or limited resolution to localize causal variants. Recently, however, the emergence of larger-scale interdisciplinary research, cheaper genotyping and parallel advances in human genetics, have spurred the development of more sophisticated and powerful experimental designs. Genetic Resource Populations (GRPs) use economies of scale to provide cost-effective and replicable platforms for genetic studies. This project concerns the largest, most ambitious GRP in mouse genetics to date, the Collaborative Cross (CC), and a series of crosses and designs related to or derived from it: the Diversity Outbred (DO) cross, the CC Recombinant Inbred Cross (CC-RIX) and the diallel. Experiments on each separate cross provide distinct information about the heritable architecture of a target complex disease. In combination, this Genetic Reference Super-Population (GRSP) potentially provides an unparalleled basis for cross-study replication and integration in mouse genetics. This project aims to develop statistical methods that advance the current state of complex trait analysis of these populations separately, and, by exploiting the unique structure that connects them, proposes to develop a statistical framework that allows for their joint use.  Aim 1 develops a Bayesian probabilistic framework for haplotype-based analysis of quantitative trait loci (QTL). Aim 1a develops a statistical software module for flexible haplotype-based analysis, which can be ex- tended by the researcher to model a rich variety of designs and disease types. Aim 1b will adapt machine learning techniques to provide posterior inference of the allelic series of a QTL. Aim 1c will incorporate Bayesian modeling of polygenic effects.  Aim 2 and 3 concern joint analysis, building on the foundation set by Aim 1. Aim 2 develops methods to optimize experimental design of follow-up studies in one population given results from another. Aim 2a uses the diallel to inform design of CC/CC-RIX/DO experiments. Aim 2b uses partial data on CC/CC-RIX/DO to guide collection of additional data. Aim 3 explores models for jointly analyzing multiple populations in the GRSP, using complementary datasets to stabilize analysis at single QTL (Aim 3a) and across multiple QTL (Aim 3b).  These aims address specific and persistent challenges in the cost-effective design and efficient analysis of multiparent genetic data, in particular the CC, DO, CC-RIX and diallel. The project will generate tools useful for a wide range of model organism crosses and can be applied to the genetic study of any complex disease.              The proposed research will lead to improvements in the analysis and design of genetic studies on animal models of human disease. Because the project focuses on statistical methodology applied to experimental mouse populations, the scientific output of the project is expected to be applicable to basic research focusing on any medical condition that can be studied in the mouse.

"Machine Learning Prediction of Cancer Susceptibility DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Susceptibility to sporadic forms of cancer is determined by numerous genetic factors that interact in a nonlinear manner in the context of an individual's age and environmental exposure. This complex genetic architecture has important implications for the use of genome-wide association studies for identifying susceptibility genes. The assumption of a simple architecture supports a strategy of testing each single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) individually using traditional univariate statistics followed by a correction for multiple tests. However, a complex genetic architecture that is characteristic of most types of cancer requires analytical methods that specifically model combinations of SNPs and environmental exposures. While new and novel methods are available for modeling interactions, exhaustive testing of all combinations of SNPs is not feasible on a genome- wide scale because the number of comparisons is effectively infinite. Thus, it is critical that we develop intelligent strategies for selecting subsets of SNPs prior to combinatorial modeling. The objective of this renewal application is to continue the development of a research strategy for the detection, characterization, and interpretation of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions in genome-wide association studies of bladder cancer susceptibility. To accomplish this objective, we will continue developing and evaluating modifications and extensions to the ReliefF family of algorithms for selecting or filtering subsets of single- nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) analysis of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions (AIM 1). We will continue developing and evaluating a stochastic wrapper or search strategy for MDR analysis of interactions that utilizes ReliefF values as a heuristic (AIM 2). We will continue to make available ReliefF algorithms as part of our open-source MDR software package (AIM 3). Finally, we will apply the best ReliefF-MDR analysis strategies to the detection, characterization, and interpretation of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions in large genome-wide association studies of bladder cancer susceptibility (AIM 4). We anticipate the proposed machine learning methods will provide powerful new approaches for identifying genetic variations that are predictive of cancer susceptibility. PROJECT NARRATIVE The technology to measure information about the human genome is advancing at a rapid pace. Despite these advance, the computational methods for analyzing the data have not kept pace. We will develop new computer algorithms and software that can be used to identify genetic biomarkers of common human diseases. We will then apply these new computational methods to identifying genetic biomarkers of bladder cancer in an epidemiological study from New Hampshire.",Machine Learning Prediction of Cancer Susceptibility,9019684,R01LM009012,[' '],NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2014,358350,0.007952624610959597
"Methods for high-dimensional data in HIV/CVD research    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent technological advances have yielded vast quantities of molecular and cellular data, affording unprecedented opportunities to understand complex disease etiologies and to inform clinical management strategies. However, in order to derive information from these rich stores of data we need to develop sound and appropriate analytic techniques. This need is especially relevant in studies at the intersection of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and cardiovascular disease (CVD), which are characterized by an elaborate set of interactions among viral and host factors. These factors include viral and host genetic profiles, as well as markers of caloric metabolism, immune activation and inflammation, which work together to determine response to therapy and overall disease progression. A comprehensive assessment of these markers presents several analytical challenges owing to the large number of potentially informative variables and the largely uncharacterized relationship among them. We propose a multi-faceted strategy that focuses on the development and application of integrative statistical approaches. Such approaches will allow us to explore and characterize novel hypotheses relating to the complex relationships among multiple genetic, environmental, demographic, and clinical factors and measures of disease progression. Specifically, this continuation application focuses on advancing and applying statistical methods in two settings: first, we consider population-based genetic association studies of innate-immunity, adipokine, drug metabolism and drug transport genes and markers of immune reconstitution, inflammation and risk of CVD in HIV-infected individuals; and second, we address investigations of metabolic and immunologic profiles that associate with immune recovery, inflammation and risk of CVD. The Specific Aims of the proposed research are to develop and evaluate: (1) Latent class and mixture modeling paradigms for (a) discovering and characterizing multi-locus genotype-trait associations and (b) evaluating unobservable haplotype-trait associations in candidate-gene investigations; and (2) Hierarchical mixture models and machine learning approaches for (a) monitoring quantitative biomarkers in resource-limited settings and (b) characterizing high- dimensional predictors of immune reconstitution and inflammation. IMPACT: This research will lead to the creation of appropriate and carefully evaluated analytic tools to derive information from the rich array of molecular and cellular data now available. Ultimately, this research will advance our ability to translate molecular and cellular level data for clinical decision making, serving at the cornerstone of personalized medicine.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The newly available array of data on genetic polymorphisms and cellular level immune factors promises unprecedented opportunities to elucidate complex disease etiology and inform clinical management strategies. Using human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) as our model systems, we propose to develop, evaluate and apply new analytic approaches for high-dimensional data. Ultimately, these methods will allow us to derive information from the vast quantities of molecular and cellular data for personalized, clinical decisions and thus serve as a central component of translational medicine.

"Decrypting Variants of Uncertain Significance in Long-QT Syndrome     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Clinical genetic testing has become standard-of-care for many diseases including hundreds of inherited conditions. However, interpreting genetic test results is often confounded by the discovery of 'variants of unknown significance' (VUS) for which there is insufficient data or inadequate predictive tools to establish whether or not a particular variant predisposes to a disease. This problem is particularly vexing for genetic disorders with strong allelic heterogeneity and a preponderance of 'private' mutations such as the congenital long-QT syndrome (LQTS), which predisposes young adults and children to sudden death from cardiac arrhythmias. With the anticipated incorporation of personal exome or genome data into routine clinical care, interpreting VUS will become an even greater challenge especially when variants in genes associated with human disorders are incidentally discovered. Unfortunately, there are no reliable methods to predict a priori whether a given variant predisposes an individual to a particular disorder or whether the change is merely a benign rare variant. We propose to develop a novel paradigm for distinguishing disease-causing mutations from benign variants in LQTS as a model for other inherited arrhythmia syndromes and channelopathies. We will focus on variants in KCNQ1, the most commonly mutated gene in LQTS. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that a holistic predictive model that relates experimentally determined protein structure and dynamics to function and disease is highly accurate even for novel variants. Our ultimate objectives are to develop a data-trained, web-accessible algorithm that classifies VUS discovered in KCNQ1 based on reliable predictions of the structure and dynamics of the affected protein, and to achieve prediction accuracy to levels needed to inform medical decisions. The medical importance of correctly classifying KCNQ1 variants provides strong justification for having a dedicated and highly-tailored gene-specific prediction model. The ability to distinguish deleterious from neutral variants would help avoid unnecessary and potentially harmful interventions in carriers of benign alleles, and save the lives of those with true mutations. We propose to collect extensive electrophysiological, biochemical and structural data on a large set of KCNQ1 variants discovered in LQTS subjects as well as several suspected benign or neutral variants (Aims 1-2), then use these data to iteratively train and validate a machine learning based algorithm that can differentiate benign from deleterious KCNQ1 alleles among a set of new VUS (Aim 3). Our proposal is innovative in the use of a multidisciplinary approach to functionally and structurally annotate genomic variant data for a medically important gene at an unprecedented scale, and then to use these experimental findings to train/test a novel computational system to achieve clinical-grade predictions. Targeting KCNQ1 will also validate an approach for parallel work that can be utilized to predict the medical significance of variants in closely related potassium channels associated with heritable epilepsy (KCNQ2, KCNQ3) or deafness (KCNQ4).          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this project is to develop a method to reliably predict the consequences of genetic variants of unknown significance discovered in the course of genetic testing in the congenital long-QT syndrome (LQTS), a cause of sudden cardiac death in children and young adults. We propose a multidisciplinary experimental approach including electrophysiology, biochemistry and structural biology deployed on a large scale to generate information on at least 110 genetic variants in the main gene responsible for LQTS (KCNQ1), which encodes a potassium channel required for normal electrical activity in the heart. Our final product will be a data-trained computational strategy that will outperform existing methods for accurately predicting the functional consequences of novel KCNQ1 genetic variants, enhance the value of genetic testing in LQTS and provide for more informed medical decisions.                ",Decrypting Variants of Uncertain Significance in Long-QT Syndrome,8786636,R01HL122010,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Anti-Arrhythmia Agents', 'Arrhythmia', 'Benign', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological', 'Cardiac', 'Caring', 'Cell surface', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Defibrillators', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Epilepsy', 'First Degree Relative', 'Genes', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Intervention', 'Ion Channel', 'Link', 'Long QT Syndrome', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Online Systems', 'Other Genetics', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Potassium Channel', 'Predisposition', 'Protein Dynamics', 'Proteins', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Structure', 'Sudden Death', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical care', 'deafness', 'design', 'disease-causing mutation', 'exome', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'heart rhythm', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'knowledge base', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'proband', 'protein function', 'protein structure', 'protein transport', 'public health relevance', 'rare variant', 'research study', 'structural biology', 'sudden cardiac death', 'tool', 'trafficking', 'web-accessible', 'young adult']",NHLBI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2014,1308724,0.006432595804218744
"An Integrative Analysis of Structural Variation for the 1000 Genomes Project DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Structural variation (SV), involving deletions, duplications, insertions and inversions of DNA segments, accounts for a large proportion of human genetic diversity. Comprehensive identification and analysis of these genetic variants will help us more fully elucidate the biology of their functional effects on human health and demography. Despite recent advances, the tools and data needed to comprehensively identify all types of SVs, genotype each variant, integrate and phase these variants remain lacking. Indeed, the data released from the early phases of the 1000 Genomes Project (1000GP) (1000 Genomes Project Consortium, 2010; 1000 Genomes Project Consortium, 2012) are biased primarily towards the detection of deletions within relatively unique regions of the genome. As a consortium, we propose to pool expertise from various research groups to provide an integrative analysis of SVs by combining rigorous computational algorithmic development with extensive experimental validation. The new algorithms we develop and the high confidence lists of SVs obtained will be rapidly made available as a public resource. n/a",An Integrative Analysis of Structural Variation for the 1000 Genomes Project,8737934,U41HG007497,"['Accounting', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Benchmarking', 'Biology', 'Chromosomes', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'DNA', 'DNA Insertion Elements', 'Data', 'Demography', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Future', 'Gene Conversion', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Haplotypes', 'Health', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nucleotides', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Process', 'Reading', 'Repetitive Sequence', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Statistical Models', 'Technology', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'design', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'improved', 'method development', 'novel', 'research study', 'tool']",NHGRI,JACKSON LABORATORY,U41,2014,2684060,0.012219207735488265
"International Case Control Study of Malignant Glioma    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Glioma comprises about 40% of all primary brain tumors accounting for as many as 26,000 U.S. and European deaths annually. Inherited susceptibility plays a role with 2-fold increased risk of glioma among first-degree relatives of glioma cases. We initiated a multi-center, international linkage study: ""Genetic Epidemiology of Glioma International Consortium"" in 2007 to address the role of inherited susceptibility. Since this study does not allow us currently to address the role of genetic susceptibility in sporadic cases, we propose this case- control study to address this gap. Members of the consortium have conducted genome wide association studies (GWAS) that will be the discovery phase (phase I). While of high value for discovery, we propose to recruit 6,000 newly diagnosed glioma cases and 6,000 age-gender-ethnicity-matched controls, and collect detailed epidemiologic data and biologic samples from the 13 participating Gliogene sites. We hypothesize that novel inherited variation influencing the susceptibility to glioma can be identified by high density SNP analysis, and propose the following specific aims: SA1: Identify common genetic variants contributing to the risk of glioma. We plan to conduct phases 2 and 3 of the 3 phase approach, specifically we will: (SA1a) Validate GWAS findings from the discovery sets, and replicate the top hits (~23,000 SNPs) with lowest p- values from the two phase GWA studies in a series of 2,000 cases and 2,000 controls (phase 2, validation). Validate the top hits from the test set (aim 1a). From stage 2, genes with SNPs displaying an association at pd10-4 (including the complete haplotype tagging - approximately 100 SNPs) will then be genotyped in a further series of 4,000 cases and 4,000 controls (stage 3, validation). SNPs significant at 10-7 or better will be considered in the final analyses. (SA1b). Using an a priori hypothesis that DNA repair in inflammation contribute to glioma risk, we will selectively interrogate DNA repair and inflammation pathway genes using data for select genes derived from the high-density array. We will conduct a hypothesis driven genetic association in DNA repair and in inflammation/immune function related genes with glioma risk using functional genomic and bioinformatic tools to interrogate available databases. (SA2): Evaluate gene-gene (G-G) and gene- environmental (G-E) interactions with strong biologic relevance to identify G-G and G-E interactions for glioma risk using machine-learning tools (MDR, FITF, and CART) in these exploratory analyses. There are no existing glioma case-control studies with sufficient numbers of biological samples and common epidemiologic data to conduct a comprehensive validation and replication study, or to address the issues of tumor heterogeneity as we will in this study.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Gliomas are a rare and understudied disease that is rapidly fatal. The proposed case-control study of primary malignant glioma (Gliogene Consortium) includes 13-centers, and will address the role of genetic susceptibility in sporadic cases. It will identify common genetic variants contributing to the risk of glioma from a genome wide association study.

"Predictive Modeling with Clinical and Genomic Data in COPD Candidate: Dr. Peter Castaldi is a physician completing a period of F32-funded support. On July 1st, 2009 he will begin a full-time position at Tufts Medical Center and the Institute for Clinical Research and Health Policy Studies (ICRHPS). This position involves a 25% clinical commitment. His principal research interests are the genetic epidemiology of COPD and the translation of genomic discoveries into clinical practice and public health. His particular interests are genetic meta-analysis, gene-environment interaction, and predictive modeling with regression-based and machine-learning methods.  His immediate goals are 1.) to identify novel genetic associations with COPD susceptibility and COPD- related phenotypes through the combined analysis of multiple genome-wide association (GWA) studies, 2.) to identify epistatic and gene-by-smoking interactions, and 3.) to develop accurate predictive models in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) using clinical and genomic information. His long-term goal is to be an independent investigator with expertise in bioinformatics. His vision for achieving this goal involves developing expertise in bioinformatics so as to be able to participate in and eventually lead multidisciplinary teams in the application of computational methods to genomic datasets in order to answer important clinical questions that will improve the care of patients and population health.    Environment: Dr. Castaldi will receive training in a rich, interdisciplinary environment. His principal mentor, Dr. Joseph Lau, is the head of the Center for Clinical Evidence Synthesis in the ICRHPS, and he is a worldwide leader in the field of meta-analysis and evidence synthesis. At Tufts, in addition to regular meetings with Dr. Lau, Peter will receive training in genetic evidence synthesis from leaders in the field, including Drs. John Ioannidis and Tom Trikalinos. The co-mentor of this application, Dr. Edwin Silverman, is a leading researcher in COPD genetics at the Channing Laboratory. At the Channing Laboratory, Peter will receive excellent training in respiratory genetics and genetic epidemiology, and he will have resources to state of the art high-throughput genotyping, next-generation sequencing technologies, and bioinformatics support. Dr. Castaldi will also continue his collaboration with Dr. Donna Slonim in the Tufts Computer Science Department, who will provide assistance with application of computational algorithms to genomic data and guidance as Dr. Castaldi continues to build a practical and theoretical foundation in Bioinformatics.    Research: COPD is a major cause of morbidity and mortality that is of increasing public health importance. While the principal risk factor for COPD, smoking, is well-established, there is variable susceptibility in the general population to the lung damage caused by cigarette smoke. There is strong evidence supporting a genetic component to COPD susceptibility. Understanding how genes and environment interact to produce clinical COPD will allow for more accurate diagnostic tools and open new avenues of investigation for the development of COPD therapies. We propose to 1.) identify novel genetic associations with COPD susceptibility and 4 COPD-related phenotypes by performing meta-analysis on patient-level data from 4 large COPD GWA studies, 2.) identify gene-by-smoking and gene-gene interactions, and 3.) develop predictive models for COPD susceptibility and COPD-related phenotypes. In order to maximize the information obtained from genomic data, we will combine data from multiple studies (the National Emphysema Treatment Trial Genetics Ancillary Study, the Norway Case-Control Study, COPDGene, and ECLIPSE - total sample size=7,962) to increase power and employ regression-based and machine-learning methods to identify complex patterns of interaction in genotype data. Our study is designed to both explore and subsequently rigorously validate discovered main effect and interaction associations. Using predictive models, we will quantify the incremental predictive benefit of including genetic main effects and genetic interaction data to traditional clinical variables.    Relevance: The proposed work will identify new genes associated with COPD and place them in a multivariate context so as to develop a better understanding of how genetic differences and environmental exposures contribute to the development of COPD. The models generated by this work will facilitate the translation of genomic discoveries to clinical practice and public health, in keeping with the NHLBI's mission to promote the prevention and treatment of heart, lung, and blood diseases and enhance the health of all individuals so that they can live longer and more fulfilling lives.

"Genetic predictors of anti-TNF treatment response and infections in IBD     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) affect over 1.4 million Americans. Over the past 15 years, considerable progress has been made in the therapy of CD and UC with monoclonal antibodies against tumor necrosis factor ¿ (anti-TNF) representing the most significant therapeutic breakthrough. However, many patients fail to respond adequately. Recent genome wide associations studies (GWAS) have significantly increased our understanding of the pathogenesis of CD and UC. The role of these genetic variants in predicting response to anti-TNF therapy is yet to be defined adequately. In addition, significant safety concerns remain with the use of these agents with serious infections occurring in up to 10% of patients. There is a strong genetic component to susceptibility to infections, in particular involving polymorphisms in innate immunity. Given the key role of innate immunity in IBD pathogenesis, whether such shared polymorphisms also influence risk of infections on anti-TNF therapy has not been examined previously. Thus, the development of tools to define likelihood of treatment response and infections are a key unmet need in the field. Our overarching objective is to identify clinical and genetic predictors of both short-term and long-term response as well as infectious complications of anti-TNF therapy. To achieve these aims, we will utilize the complementary strengths of two large cohorts - a prospective registry cohort of over 1200 patients with CD or UC, and a novel EMR-based cohort of over 11,000 patients with CD or UC linked to a biospecimen repository. This proposal utilizes the mentorship and significant expertise in key areas including analytical genetics, translational immunology, and bioinformatics and allows the candidate to develop fundamental skills in these novel content areas and research methods. The access to expertise at the NIH-funded center Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside, the Center for Study of Inflammatory Bowel Disease, and the Broad Institute is a key strength of this application. This career development award will be critical in providing training in bioinformatics and genetic epidemiology, thus contributing to the candidate's long-term goal of establishing an independent IBD research career with focus on defining at-risk cohorts and personalizing therapy. The training component of the award includes graduate-level courses in the relevant content areas in genetic epidemiology, and bioinformatics at the Harvard Medical School, School of Public Health, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The candidate will continue to actively engage with an established group of multidisciplinary researchers who have demonstrated the utility of the EMR-based approach to accurately define autoimmune diseases, link it to biospecimen collection, and use it successfully for genotyping-phenotype research. This will help foster collaborative development of future proposals as the work proposed in this application has the potential for applicability in other cohorts.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The novel information gained from this study regarding genetic predictors of treatment response and infectious complications has the potential to transform clinical practice by leading to clinical trials focused on selected cohorts of patients most likely to respond to therapies with low risk of adverse events, thus preventing unnecessary exposure to potentially toxic therapies with low likelihood of benefit. Such work is a step toward developing personalized medicine approaches to tailor therapy based on likelihood of benefit and risk. The methodology developed here will also have applications in other EMR-based cohorts to investigate novel therapeutic agents and disease outcomes.                  ",Genetic predictors of anti-TNF treatment response and infections in IBD,8676787,K23DK097142,"['Address', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor Therapy', 'Antibodies', 'Area', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Award', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'CD14 gene', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Comorbidity', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Crohn&apos', 's disease', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease remission', 'Exposure to', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Research', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Human Genetics', 'IL1R1 gene', 'Immune response', 'Immunology', 'Immunosuppressive Agents', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Informatics', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Interferons', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Massachusetts', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Monoclonal Antibodies', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Immunity', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Pneumonia', 'Predisposition', 'Public Health Schools', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Sepsis', 'Source', 'Structure', 'TNF gene', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor Therapy', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha', 'Ulcerative Colitis', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'adaptive immunity', 'base', 'career', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'cost', 'genetic epidemiology', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'immune function', 'medical schools', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient registry', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'repository', 'response', 'skills', 'tool development', 'treatment response']",NIDDK,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K23,2014,169572,0.00042750634871423476
"Discovery and analysis of structural variation in whole genome sequences     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     The whole genome sequencing of large cohorts of individuals is quickly becoming a common tool for researchers to investigate the genetic basis of many disease phenotypes. The primary goals are to discover the underlying genetic variation that cause or contribute to these diseases as well as to correctly identify these variants in a diagnostic setting. These differences typicall consist of single base changes (SNPs), but can also encompass larger, more complex chromosomal rearrangements in the form of structural variation (SV) which are much more difficult to detect even with modern sequencing technologies. A number of approaches have been published that have studied this problem, but even the largest scale endeavors have only focused on deletion events and reported a sensitivity of <70%. Complex chromosomal rearrangements are even less well studied. Thus, it is paramount that accurate methods are developed which can detect all types of SVs at high specificity from sequence data. This proposal aims to improve the overall ability of researchers to identify and analyze genetic variation from whole genome sequences. An important, and often overlooked, aspect of SV discovery is the fact that typical paired-end, read depth, and split read approaches will identify different sets of non-overlapping variants at varying degrees of accuracy. In Aim 1, we will develop a unified SV discovery algorithm that can incorporate all of these different sources of information in a probabilistic fashion. Such a method would be useful for research, in particular with the identification of rare variants, as well as clinical applications which require a great del of accuracy and have thus far been limited to older karyotyping and microarray approaches. This would identify the majority of structural variants, however there are many regions in genomic sequences which are complex in nature, defined as consisting of multiple neighboring or overlapping chromosomal rearrangements that are challenging to resolve with typical SV detection approaches. In Aim 2, we propose methods to resolve these complex regions and assess their frequency and impact. Furthermore, a crucial step in medical genetics is the comparison of identified genetic mutations to databases of known pathogenic and benign variants. This is currently problematic with SVs, as they have often been originally reported with varying degrees of breakpoint resolution that can hamper the correct assignment of the variant. This issue is compounded further in more complex regions with multiple breakpoints, for which simplistic comparison methods do not work well. In Aim 3, we will develop and implement a system that describes and utilizes variant profiles to identify whether an individual's sequence data contains a variant of interest. Overall, this project will advance our understanding of the human genome as well as provide tools for use in the general research and clinical communities.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     The rearrangement of chromosomal material in the form of structural variation is directly responsible for many disease phenotypes, however our ability to detect and resolve these events from whole genome sequence data is currently limited. We propose a number of strategies for improving the detection and analysis of structural genomic variation between individuals and resolving their underlying structure and function. These approaches will have direct application to the clinical diagnosis of such events and the future of personalized genomics.

"Bioinformatics Approaches to Visual Disease Genetics     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is now recognized that many visual diseases are influenced by complex interactions between multiple different genetic variants. As a result, our ability to predict susceptibility to visual diseases will depend critically on the computational, mathematical and statistical modeling methods and software that are available for making sense of high-dimensional genetic data. We propose here a bioinformatics research project to develop network modeling approaches for identifying combinations of genetic biomarkers associated with visual disease endpoints. Our working hypothesis is that a systems-based bioinformatics approach using network modeling will play a very important role in confronting the complexity of the relationship between genomic variation and visual diseases. We will first develop and evaluate modeling methods to infer large-scale genetic interaction networks from genome-wide association studies (AIM 1). We will then apply the modeling methods developed in AIM 1 to the inference of genetic interaction networks from genome-wide association data in subjects with and without visual diseases (AIM 2). Next, we will utilize the inferred genetic interaction networks to guide the development of predictive genetic models of visual diseases (AIM 3). Finally, all network modeling methods will be released to the vision research community as part of a popular user-friendly, freely available and open-source software package (AIM 4). We anticipate that the network modeling methods and software developed and distributed as part of this project will play an important role in the development of the genetic tests that will be necessary to identify those at risk for visual diseases.          The network modeling methods and software developed and distributed as part of this bioinformatics research project will play an important role in the development of the genetic tests that will be necessary to identify those at risk for common diseases such as glaucoma and age-related macular degeneration.

"Informatic Profiling of Clinically Relevant Mutation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our group focuses on genetic variants that disrupt molecular functions that cause human disease. In this renewal R01 application, we propose to begin the process of realizing our long-term goals, and to expand our original scope of research to include the challenge of understanding genetic disease mutations and polymorphisms that affect gene expression regulation in noncoding regions. Additionally, we have formed collaborations with genetic data managers and will apply these methods to aid in their research and identify new testable hypotheses. We will do this in three aims. First, we will integrate predictions of protein-disease associations with mutation predictions to develop a new quantitative model of genotype and phenotype. Second, we will integrate each of these together to develop a systems level, molecular function genome annotator with functionality to import into the genome databases.

"Mechanisms underlying complex trait human disease     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is now an explosion of new genome scale data relating genetic variation within the human population to phenotype, and particularly to common disease. Microarray technology has identified 100s of loci where the presence of particular variants is associated with altered risk of many common diseases; complete sequencing of individual exomes in cancer samples has discovered many somatic mutations in a variety of genes; and sequencing of 1000 human genomes has provided an almost complete inventory of common population variants. Further, these data are only the first in an ever-increasing flood, as even faster and cheaper sequencing technologies come on line. The results hold promise for major advances in treatment and diagnosis of common human diseases. Extracting the expected benefits is not straightforward, and will necessitate acquiring detailed knowledge of the mechanisms linking genetic variation to disease. This project focuses on one aspect of this challenge - using the new genomic data to identify new therapeutic opportunities. We will investigate those principles underlying complex trait disease that are particularly relevant to tha goal. We introduce a three stage mechanistic framework, relating genomic variation to the function of impacted gene products, the impact of these altered functions on pathways, processes and subsystems; and finally the consequences for complex trait disease phenotypes. We will develop computational methods to address key questions concerning three major aspects of the framework (1) How large are the changes in protein function brought about by the genomic variants underlying complex trait disease? What role do different classes of genomic and protein level mechanism, such as expression, non-synonymous changes and splicing, play in these variants? (2) How complete is the set genes with strong influence on the disease phenotypes discovered by current technologies, and how can missing genes be imputed from the genomic and network data? (3) What is the distribution of coupling between the activity of genes involved in disease mechanism and disease phenotypes? The results will deepen understanding of these aspects of complex disease, and provide a basis for identifying potential new drug targets from GWAS and other genomic studies.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: New technologies are now providing extensive information on human genetic variation associated with increased risk of a wide range of common human disease, such as Alzheimer's, diabetes, heart disease, and many cancers. These data hold the promise for the development of new therapies, and realizing those benefits requires the acquisition of complementary knowledge of the mechanisms that link genetic variation to disease risk. This project is focused on analysis of the relationship between genetic variation and common disease with the goal of identifying new therapeutic opportunities.

"NHGRI PAGE Coordinating Center     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): NHGRI developed the Population Architecture Using Genomics and Epidemiology (PAGE) research program to identify and characterize genomic variants in non-European populations. To support the complexities of such an ambitious effort, we have convened a strong team of statistical, population, and molecular geneticists, computer and information scientists, biostatisticians, and project management staff with many years of related experience to serve as a Coordinating Center (CC). Specifically, the CC will serve as a centralized resource to facilitate and support the activities of the program and Study Investigators focused on characterization of causal variants by: (1) coordinating phenotype harmonization efforts, including mapping phenotype variables across studies and to the PhenX measures; (2) synthesizing individual-level data into centralized datasets to facilitate sharing of data within and outside of PAGE; (3) utilizing state-of-the-art computer and information science support and scientific workflows that will facilitate analyses, ancestry deconvolution, genotype calling and imputation, SNP annotation, and data synthesis; (4) rapidly disseminating all study data via dbGaP and/or the PAGE website or other applicable databases; and (5) serving as a centralized resource to facilitate, support, and manage program activities and logistics as requested by the Steering Committee or Project Office and as needed for successful coordination of the program. Coordination of the program will be done in a spirit of collaboration using creative and flexible approaches, while providing leadership in statistical genetic methodologies and approaches to project management. The ultimate goal of our CC is to facilitate the identification and characterization of genotype-phenotype associations, especially as relevant to non-European populations, thereby accelerating our understanding of ancestral differences in the genetic and environmental causes of common diseases. Critical to achieving this mission is the deployment of powerful methods for ancestry deconvolution, multi- and trans-ethnic mapping, and imputation. Building upon our success as the PAGE I CC, we have added additional investigators with expertise in these areas and consortium experience with next-generation sequence analysis of both whole-genome and exome data. Our collaborative team is ideally staffed to meet the challenges of the new round of PAGE.

"Multivariate Pattern Analysis Methods for Neuroimaging Genetics Studies    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Common mental disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia are largely heritable with complex genetic underpinnings. Large-scale genome-wide association studies that contrast DNA sequence data from patients and controls have recently identified novel genetic risk variants for these disorders. Nevertheless, the processes through which genotype increases risk are yet to be fully characterized.  Neuroimaging offers a richer picture of the underlying disease processes than a clinical diagnosis. Thus the joint analysis of neuroimaging and genetics data promises to advance our understanding of these processes. Today, neuroimaging genetics studies however face important challenges that obstruct progress: small sample sizes, modest effect sizes, and the extreme dimensionality of the data limit statistical power and thus our ability to explore the complex and subtle associations between genes, neuroanatomy and clinical decline. Currently, the prevalent approach in neuroimaging genetics is to concentrate the analysis on a small number of anatomic regions of interest and/or candidate genes and often ignore a large portion of the data. The core goal of the proposed project is to develop computational tools that will take full advantage of the richness in the datasets and facilitate the exploration of the multifaceted associations between genotype, neuroimaging measurements and clinical phenotype. The proposed project will use advanced multivariate pattern analysis methods such as support vector machines to compute image-based and genetic scores that reflect pathology. We will validate the tools based on their association with classical biomarkers of disease. Finally, we will develop a model that uses both imaging and genotype data to predict future clinical outcome. We expect these tools will enable progress along three directions relevant to complex mental disorders, e.g. late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD): (1) confirming and characterizing risk genes, (2) identifying disease-specific anatomical alterations in healthy individuals, and (3) early diagnosis and prognosis. The project will (1) use three already-collected large-scale datasets to apply the developed tools to AD, (2) build on cutting-edge image processing algorithms that we have been developing, and (3) allow the candidate to receive further training in neuroanatomy, mental disorders and genetics, forming the foundation for his future career as an independent researcher.       n/a",Multivariate Pattern Analysis Methods for Neuroimaging Genetics Studies,8726983,K25EB013649,"['Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Anatomy', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Face', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Research', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Late Onset Alzheimer Disease', 'Lead', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Schizophrenia', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Training', 'base', 'career', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical phenotype', 'computerized tools', 'data modeling', 'disorder risk', 'entorhinal cortex', 'genetic risk factor', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'high risk', 'image processing', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'molecular pathology', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'pre-clinical', 'programs', 'risk variant', 'tool']",NIBIB,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K25,2014,175392,-0.018311287788248046
"Whole-Genome Prediction of Type-2 Diabetes Susceptibility in Various Populations     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The applicant's career goal is to become a productive independent investigator in the area of statistical genetics, particularly in the area of genomic-based prediction of type-2 diabetes (T2D) risk. To meet this goal, the applicant proposes a career development plan that includes hands- on and didactic training in statistical learning as applied to quantitative genetics, categorical and case-control data analysis, informatics as applied to high dimensional genetic data, and the biology and genetics of T2D. A highly accomplished and diverse set of investigators with proven track records of successful mentoring will oversee the applicant's career development. The research component of this project seeks to improve our ability to use genetic information to predict an individual's risk of developing T2D Publically available genetic and phenotypic data from sources such as dbGaP (The database of Phenotypes and Genotypes) will be used to develop and test various models for prediction of T2D risk among three racial/ethnic groups. This project will capitalize on newly developed statistical methods that are able to incorporate information from tens of thousands of genetic markers at once, which represent a major advance over current methods that typically take fewer than 100 markers into account. The aims of the study are: 1) To test the hypothesis, in different populations, that individualized whole-genome prediction of T2D (along with standard covariates of sex, age, and BMI) will offer major improvements over current genetics-based prediction models, and will offer equal or greater accuracy than prediction based on family history; 2) To impute additional genetic markers to determine whether prediction can be improved, and to identify the subset of markers that is most useful in predicting T2D; 3) To develop prediction models for T2D risk given a certain body mass index (BMI), by including as predictors the interaction of BMI and genotypes. This project will greatly enhance our ability to predict an individual's susceptibility to T2D within various populations, leading to earlier and targeted prevention strategies, will increase our understanding of the genetic basis of T2D, and will provide critical training for Dr. Klimentidis' development as an independent scientist.      Genetic factors are known to play a substantial role in the etiology of type-2 diabetes (T2D), which is a growing health challenge facing developed and developing countries. In this application, we propose to use state-of-the-art statistical methods that enable us to account for thousands of genetic variants simultaneously, in order to build and test predictive models for T2D susceptibility among individuals of European, Mexican, and African descent. This project has the potential to greatly improve prediction of T2D susceptibility in several ethnic groups, provide a better understanding of the specific genetic factors that play a role in T2D susceptibility, and ultimately bring us closer to the era of personalized medicine in which improved prediction ability results in earlier patient-oriented prevention and treatment.

"Integrative Analysis of Genomic Risk Factors in Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA), afflicting ~1 in 10,000 North American Children, encompasses a highly heterogeneous group of chronic, immune-mediated joint disorders. Aside from causing severe pain, tissue damage, and physical immobility, chronic disease activity leads to permanent short stature and limb disfigurement. Similar to a number of other complex polygenic autoimmune diseases, there is a clear heritable component to JIA, but all known genetic risk factors explain less than 20% of disease heritability. The majority of this is attributable to variation across the Major Histocompatibility  (MHC) locus, yet definitive high-resolution identification of MHC associations in JIA have not been conclusive. JIA is currently classified into seven clinical subtypes, based on a classification schema that has little research or clinical utility, since 10-50% of cases are classified as ""undifferentiated"". Biological and molecular evidence based on the presence of serum autoantibodies and other molecular biomarkers of immunological defects suggest that the existing seven JIA subtypes could be grouped into two major classes-subtypes that represent either predominantly seropositive autoimmune (AID) diseases or seronegative autoinflammatory (AIF) diseases. Whether genetic risk factors differ for AID versus AIF-like JIA subtypes is unknown, especially since the traditional approach to genetic association studies is poorly powered to identify loci with subtype- specific effects in the presence of significant phenotypic heterogeneity. To test the hypothesis that distinct genetic risk factors underlie the clinically observed differences in AID versus AIF-like JIA subtypes and identify both shared and subtype-distinct genetic susceptibility loci, I propose to use a subtype-sensitive GWAS to identify JIA disease subtype-specific genetics associations, evaluate evidence for functional HLA associations that are distinct or shared across JIA subtypes, and test if the identified genetic associations can be used to predict disease susceptibility, distinguish patients who belong to AID versus AIF-like JIA classes, and reclassify patients currently defined as having undifferentiated disease. The analysis approach proposed here integrates genomic screening, disease modeling and prediction, and the use of expression and functional data resources to better understand the etiology of JIA. The successful completion of this work will likely yield novel biomolecular or pathway-based targets for the development of therapeutic agents for children with JIA and patients with other related rheumatological or immunological diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis is a severe pediatric form of immune-mediate joint disease that can result in significant morbidity and life-long disability. While the etiology of JIA, similar to other complex autoimmune and inflammatory disorders that together affect nearly 10% of the United States population, is not well-understood, a strong genetic component has been demonstrated. My proposal aims to develop novel genome-wide analysis tools and applies these tools to the identification of genetic risk susceptibility factorsin JIA and other heterogeneous, complex hereditary disorders, which have the potential to yield promising disease-specific molecular and pharmacologic targets.",Integrative Analysis of Genomic Risk Factors in Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis,8717915,F30AR066486,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'American', 'Amino Acids', 'Antigenic Variation', 'Antigens', 'Arthritis', 'Autoantibodies', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmune Process', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Surface Receptors', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Childhood Arthritis', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Crohn&apos', 's disease', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Epitopes', 'Etiology', 'Exclusion', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Epistasis', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'HLA Antigens', 'Health', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Histocompatibility', 'Immune', 'Immune System Diseases', 'Inflammatory', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Life', 'Limb structure', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mutation', 'Pain', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Polyarthritides', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Psoriasis', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Serological', 'Serum', 'Siblings', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Specificity', 'TNFRSF10A gene', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Undifferentiated', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'arthropathies', 'base', 'case control', 'cohort', 'disability', 'disease classification', 'disorder risk', 'disorder subtype', 'evidence base', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic association', 'genetic risk factor', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide analysis', 'novel', 'risk variant', 'screening', 'tool']",NIAMS,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,F30,2014,46078,0.008105338221317818
"Genome Wide Association Study for Childhood Obesity     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Obesity is a major risk factor for type 2 diabetes, which in turn has serious complications including accelerated development of cardiovascular disease. The prevalence of obesity in children and adults in the United States has increased by more than 30% over the past decade.  We previously successfully argued in our application for the R01 HD056465 award that distillation of the genetic component in this complex phenotype should thus be easier to determine in children, where environmental exposure and impact has been for a relatively short period of their lifetime; indeed the resulting work did pan out to be successful in this regard. We carried out a non-hypothesis-driven study that was directed at uncovering genes and genetic variants that predispose to childhood obesity by conducting a genome-wide association study (GWAS) using a high density tag-SNP array. Employing a powered two-stage study design in a consortium setting, where cases were defined as being in the e95th percentile of BMI, we identified novel association signals which we subsequently replicated. This NICHD funded study was ultimately published in Nature Genetics (with the PI as senior author) and received widespread press attention, including with CNN, Time and the front page of USA Today.  The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia is now poised to determine additional genetic factors conferring risk to the pathogenesis of childhood obesity through the leveraging of new ultra-high-throughput sequencing technology, and also allow for fine-mapping of the already uncovered loci to determine the actual causal mechanism of action. Combining our accurately phenotyped cohort, which represents the largest pediatric obesity DNA collection in the world, with access to familial childhood obesity, availability of existing genome wide singl nucleotide polymorphism genotypes and the application of whole exome sequencing, this renewal application of R01 HD056465 proposes to broaden the list of novel genetic loci that are associated with this trait in order to get further insights in to the genetic etiology of common pediatric obesity.  We are well positioned to extend our knowledge of the genetic etiology of childhood obesity. It is unclear if these additional variants are common in the population, a set o private mutations in families or a mixture of both. Irrespective of the nature of the variant(s) we are well positioned to look for both types of event, with common variants detectable through leveraging the GWAS dataset of well powered cohorts and private mutations detectable through whole exome sequencing of many multi-case pedigrees. This represents a major follow-up to the Principal Investigator's original grant application and this renewal will allow for adding extr value to the already substantial findings made funded by the original grant.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The prevalence of obesity in children and adults in the United States has increased by more than 30% over the past decade. We are seeking to renew R01 HD056465 to expand on the successful findings made previously and to further characterize the genetic etiology of childhood obesity and pediatric BMI trajectory. Combining our recruited accurately phenotyped and largest pediatric obesity cohort in the world, access to familial childhood obesity, availability of existing genome wide single nucleotide polymorphism genotypes and the application of whole exome sequencing, this renewal proposes to broaden the list of novel genetic loci that are associated with this trait.            ",Genome Wide Association Study for Childhood Obesity,8691941,R01HD056465,"['Adult', 'Applications Grants', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Body mass index', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'DNA', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Impact', 'Event', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genotype', 'Grant', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Knowledge', 'Maps', 'Mutation', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Nature', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Normal Statistical Distribution', 'Nucleotides', 'Obesity', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Phenotype', 'Philadelphia', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Principal Investigator', 'Publishing', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research Design', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Staging', 'Technology', 'Time', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'Work', 'cohort', 'density', 'exome sequencing', 'follow-up', 'genetic pedigree', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'insight', 'longitudinal analysis', 'novel', 'obesity in children', 'public health relevance', 'rare variant', 'risk variant', 'trait']",NICHD,CHILDREN'S HOSP OF PHILADELPHIA,R01,2014,663772,-0.013995076157517045
"Pharmacogenomics of serotonin-specific reuptake inhibitors     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neuropsychiatric disorders, such as depression, have not shown conclusive linkage or association study results. Today, an enormous portion of heritability for depression remains unexplained. Rather than reiterating studies attempting to identify genetic variants underlying depression pathophysiology, I propose a different approach of evaluating genetic variation in the safety and efficacy of the major class of antidepressants. I will identify patients with the quantitative and discrete phenotypes of serotonin-specific reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) response (as measured through the Patient's Health Questionnaire-9 pre- and post-SSRI treatment), and SSRI-associated serious side effects, such as abnormal bleeding and serotonin syndrome. After identification of these phenotypes from the electronic Medical Records and Genetic Epidemiology (eMERGE) consortium, I will perform a genome-wide association study (GWAS) on 50,109 subjects to identify candidate genes involved in SSRI pharmacology and then leverage overlapping exome sequence data to identify rare, potentially causative mutations. As many GWAS and rare variant studies suffer from a lack of functional validation (i.e., that the identified variant truly causes the phenotype), I will functionally valiate these identified rare mutations in the model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae using a yeast growth-based assay as a direct measure of protein function. The P450 enzyme CYP3A4, which has been implicated in SSRI metabolism, will be used as a proof of concept for the yeast assay. Finally, I will then use this yeast growth assay to perform deep mutational scanning to create a pharmacogenomic map of all possible mutations and their effect on enzyme hydrolysis, thereby linking DNA sequence to protein function. This work will provide a unique resource for understanding SSRI pharmacology. Through completion of a GWAS on the pharmacogenomic phenotypes of SSRI response and separately, risk of SSRI-associated bleeding and serotonin syndrome, I will likely identify numerous candidate genes that may further inform on the metabolism, transport, and mechanism of action of SSRIs, thereby furthering basic science. Moreover, through functional validation and creation of a pharmacogenomic map with deep mutational scanning, I will create an invaluable resource for clinicians to interpret the likely efect of their patient's rare mutation. Through this project, I hope to further the effort to bring personalized, genomic medicine into clinical practice, to decrease the morbidity and mortality of depression, which is estimated by the Center for Disease Control to affect 1 in 10 adults in the U.S.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Depression is affects 1 in 10 adults in the United States and is one of the leading causes of disability. Depression is primarily treated with serotonin-specific reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Understanding how mutations in genes affect SSRI response and risk of side effects forwards the implementation of personalized, genomic medicine into evidence-based clinical practice. This integration of genomic information will likely greatly decrease the morbidity of depression in the United States and globally.            ",Pharmacogenomics of serotonin-specific reuptake inhibitors,8841610,F31MH101905,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animal Model', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Basic Science', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'CYP3A4 gene', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Code', 'Complementary DNA', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Cytochrome P450', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Enzymes', 'Fellowship', 'Functional disorder', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Hemorrhage', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Hydrolysis', 'ICD-9', 'Incidence', 'International', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medicine', 'Mental Depression', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mutation', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patients', 'Peptide Sequence Determination', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Pharmacology', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Population', 'Proteins', 'Questionnaires', 'Regression Analysis', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Safety', 'Scanning', 'Scientist', 'Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor', 'Serotonin', 'Serotonin Syndrome', 'Site-Directed Mutagenesis', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'Work', 'Yeasts', 'absorption', 'base', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical practice', 'disability', 'disease classification', 'evidence base', 'exome sequencing', 'genetic epidemiology', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'mortality', 'mutant', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'protein function', 'public health relevance', 'rare variant', 'response', 'reuptake', 'skills']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,F31,2014,35141,-0.05178325123358142
"Assessment of Gene Effects on the Brain and Disease Risk through Machine Learning    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Several neuroimaging modalities such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are becoming increasingly important for diagnostic classification, prognostic evaluation and tracking treatment response in patients with brain disorders. They provide detailed, quantitative information about brain structure and function, and aspects of ongoing disease processes. Measures derived from these neuroimaging modalities have been studied through automated algorithms as potential predictors of disease outcomes. This proposal aims to introduce and evaluate new computerized algorithms, based on the field of machine learning that would incorporate not only brain imaging measures, but also biochemical and genetic information to create more powerful predictions of diagnostic and prognostic outcomes. Such novel, automated, multimodal predictors, we propose, may have important applications in future clinical decision making and clinical trial design. Brain imaging offers new quantitative measures that may be closer than cognitive assessments to the underlying biological mechanisms that lead to disease. By studying the associations of genetic factors with phenotypes based on cutting edge imaging techniques such as diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), we plan to examine mechanistically meaningful genetic contributions to brain disorders. The rapidly expanding field of neuroimaging genetics will provide the nexus for the applicant's intensive training in the world-class imaging and genetics programs at the UCLA School of Medicine. This proposal will introduce new automated algorithms for gene discovery and risk prediction into the field of neuroimaging genetics. Algorithms that consider multiple genetic variants jointly, we propose, are likely to (1) more powerfully detect new gene effects on brain images, and (2) identify profiles of candidate genetic variants to assist prediction of an individual's brain integrity and risk for disease.       Neuropsychiatric disorders are the leading causes of disability across the world. By developing new computerized models for the prediction of clinical outcomes based on disease-specific neuroimaging, biochemical and genetic biomarkers as well as the early prediction of white matter integrity based on genetic profiles, we hope to pave the way to personalized prevention and management of brain disorders.",Assessment of Gene Effects on the Brain and Disease Risk through Machine Learning,8448904,F30AG041681,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anisotropy', 'Back', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Genetics', 'Biochemical Markers', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain imaging', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Deterioration', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Electroencephalography', 'Emission-Computed Tomography', 'Evaluation', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Gap Junctions', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Programming', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genotype', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Photons', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Risk', 'Severities', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Training', 'Variant', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinically relevant', 'computerized', 'design', 'disability', 'disease diagnosis', 'disorder risk', 'endophenotype', 'gene discovery', 'gene interaction', 'genetic association', 'genetic profiling', 'genetic risk factor', 'genetic variant', 'genome-wide', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'medical schools', 'molecular imaging', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'prognostic', 'response', 'time interval', 'treatment response', 'white matter', 'working group']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,F30,2013,47232,0.01806558046043347
"Clinically Relevant Genome Variation Database We propose to create the world's premier database of genetic variants relevant to clinical care (Clinically Relevant Genetic Variants Resource or CRVR). We will provide transparent data synthesis and consensus opinion on the clinical utility of a given genetic variant across a spectrum of genetic lesions including single nucleotide changes, small indels and structural variants. We will integrate with ClinVar, PharmGKB, and OMIM and draw upon NHGRI initiatives including the Genome Sequencing and Analysis and Mendelian Disorders Sequencing Centers, and the Clinical Sequencing Exploratory Research Centers. We will work closely with other CRVR sites and NHGRI funded initiatives to improve deposition of data from clinical laboratories. Our database will be built through three Aims. Aim 1 will engage and energize the clinical genomics community around CRVR efforts. We will partner with the other CRVR and U41 investigators in this activity as they will focus on engagement of professional societies, clinical testing laboratories, and the broader clinical genomics community to ensure creation of a CRVR resource that meets anticipated community needs including assembly of Disease-Specific and Mutation Type Working Groups (DSWGs and MTWGs) comprised of expert clinical geneticists and molecular diagnosticians to establish metrics for the initial classification of variants and integration of guidelines from professional organizations. Aim 2 will involve creation of a CRVR CoreDB resource through expert review of the existing literature, locus databases, and NHGRI initiatives. We will disseminate consensus findings on clinically relevant genetic variants and the clinical implications of these variants, with supporting evidence and documentation of the consensus process. Information will be aggregated using standard ontologies and advanced methodologies for handling heterogeneous data to create a Core Database (CoreDB). The consensus of expert review will be disseminated through a user-friendly web Portal (vetted by Genetic Counseling WG), web services for data mining, and consensus clinical guidelines to the appropriate clinical and research communities. The results will be organized by gene, variant, disease, pathway, and literature. Supporting evidence will also be curated and disseminated, and the resource will be updated continuously as new information accumulates. Aim 3 will involve deployment of machine-learning algorithms for semi- automatic identification of putative Clinically Relevant Variants (CRVs). We will undertake data mining of the clinical and epidemiological genetics literature and existing databases to identify putative clinically important variants. This will involve mining data from ClinVar, OMIM, CSER, and the Mendelian centers aggregated in Aim 2. The Working Groups formed in Aim 1 will establish criteria and oversee curators vetting variants. We will develop and optimize disease- and gene-specific machine learning algorithms to facilitate rapid classification of variants based on data provided by genetic testing services via ClinVar. We will integrate population-genetic data inferred from at least 25 reference populations from the 1000 Genomes Project and other large endeavors into our machine learning approaches so as to infer the global relevance of CRVs discovered here. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to create a unified, public, and freely available database of genetic alterations relevant to clinical care. Our ultimate goal is to empower clinicians, genetic counselors, and patients to make informed decisions based on DNA testing. Because much of the information required for such decisions is scattered among public and private databases, we propose combining the medical literature, expert summary of millions of de- identified genetic tests, and results from current and past NIH-funded genetic studies into a single unified database.",Clinically Relevant Genome Variation Database,8574128,U01HG007436,"['Algorithms', 'American', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Practice Guideline', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Consensus', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Association', 'Disease Pathway', 'Documentation', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Counseling', 'Genetic Population Study', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Human Genetics', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lesion', 'Letters', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Metric', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'North Carolina', 'Nucleotides', 'Online Mendelian Inheritance In Man', 'Ontology', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Population Genetics', 'Process', 'Professional Organizations', 'Professional counselor', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Services', 'Site', 'Societies', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinically relevant', 'college', 'data exchange', 'data mining', 'design', 'empowered', 'gene function', 'genetic variant', 'genome analysis', 'genome sequencing', 'improved', 'knowledge base', 'medical schools', 'meetings', 'novel', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'user-friendly', 'web services', 'working group']",NHGRI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,U01,2013,1400000,0.023859138905415463
"Optimizing Genetic Testing for Deafness for Clinical Diagnostics   Project Summary  In this goal-driven proposal, submitted in response to Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) Number PAR-11-003, we will make comprehensive genetic testing for deafness available to clinicians for under $500 per person. The driving force behind this initiative is the frequency of hearing impairment. As the most common sensory impairment, it is diagnosed in 1 of every 500 newborns and 50% of octogenarians (Morton Ann N Y Acad Sci 1991). With 57 genes implicated in nonsyndromic hearing loss (NSHL), it is also an extremely heterogeneous trait and presents a tremendous challenge to diagnosis.  Current strategies for genetic testing for deafness are inadequate. For most, only a minority of genes is included, with selection criteria typically reflecting: 1) high prevalence as a cause of deafness (i.e. GJB2); 2) association with another recognizable feature (i.e. SLC26A4 and enlarged vestibular aqueduct); or 3) a recognizable audioprofile (i.e. low frequency hearing loss as seen with WFS1) (Hilgert et al Mut Res 2009).  The recent advent of powerful DNA target enrichment and sequencing technologies, however, makes it possible to provide comprehensive genetic testing for deafness that is efficient and cost-effective. We have shown that it is possible to analyze all deafness genes simultaneously on a single platform (called OtoSCOPE) (Shearer et al PNAS 2010). Related to this endeavor, we have also validated AudioGene as a phenotypic tool that uses patient audiograms to predict the genetic cause of ADNSHL (Hildebrand et al Genet Med 2008; Hildebrand et al Laryngoscope 2009).  Building on these findings, in this proposal we will complete two specific aims.  Specific Aim 1: To provide comprehensive, high-throughput, low-cost DNA sequence generation and analysis for deafness genetic testing  Goal 1: Comprehensive, high-throughput, low-cost DNA sequence analysis for genetic testing for deafness is possible at sensitivities and specificities comparable to Sanger sequencing by using targeted sequence enrichment followed by massively parallel sequencing.  Specific Aim 2: To optimize both machine learning-based audioprofiling of audiometric data and phenotypic filtering of genotypic data by expanding and improving the platform we have developed called AudioGene  Goal 2: As a phenome tool, a machine-learning software system trained on an extensive set of audiometric data can be used to predict and to eliminate specific genes or gene variants as causes of deafness based on audiometric data.  Achieving these specific aims will change the clinical evaluation of deaf and hard-of-hearing persons by making genetic testing the most important diagnostic test after a history, physical examination and audiological assessment.   In this goal-driven proposal, submitted in response to Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) Number PAR-11-003, we will make comprehensive genetic testing for deafness available to clinicians for under $500 per person.

"Information Explorer: a Suite of Tools for Cross-study Genetic Loci Discovery    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Databases such as dbGaP represent extremely valuable resources of data that have been assembled across multiple cohorts. The increasing development of cost-effective high-throughput genotyping and sequencing technologies are resulting in vast amounts of genetic data. While such databases were formed in order to archive and distribute the results of previously performed genetic association analyses, an increasing number of studies have provided de-identified individual-level genotypic and phenotypic data that are made available to outside researchers who have obtained the appropriate authorization. While the amount of data made available has increased dramatically in recent years, relatively little has been done in order to facilitate phenotype harmonization across studies. Many genetic epidemiologic studies of cardiovascular disease have multiple variables related to any given phenotype, resulting from different definitions and multiple measurements or subsets of data. A researcher searching such databases for the availability of phenotype and genotype combinations is confronted with a veritable mountain of variables to sift through. This often requires visiting multiple websites to gain additional information about variables that are listed on databases, and examination of data distributions to assess similarities across cohorts. While the naming strategy for genetic variants is largely standardized across studies (e.g. ""rs"" numbers for single nucleotide polymorphisms or SNPs), this is often not the case for phenotype variables. For a given study, there are often numerous versions of phenotypic variables. Researchers currently have to analyze and compare increasingly larger numbers of variables that have varying degrees of documentation associated with them to obtain the desired information. This is a time-consuming process that may still miss the most appropriate variables. Moreover, every researcher that wants to compare the same datasets often needs to start from scratch since there are no tools to share the phenotype comparison results. The availability of informatic tools to make phenotype mapping more efficient and improve its accuracy, along with intuitive phenotype query tools, would provide a major resource for researchers utilizing these databases. The tools we are proposing would allow researchers to (1) Quickly obtain the information needed to assess whether a specific study will be useful for the hypothesis of interest; (2) Exclude variables that do not meet research criteria; (3) Ascertain which studies have combinations of phenotype and genetic information of interest; and (4) More easily expand research questions beyond the most basic main-effects to more complex analyses such as gene-by-environment interactions and multivariate tests incorporating multiple phenotypes. The increased utility will also enable larger meta-analyses to be performed, as researchers will be able to more quickly hone in on outcomes, exclusionary variables and covariates of interest, leading to increased statistical power to detect genetic associations.        While the amount of genomic data (e.g., GWAS, sequencing, etc.) made available has increased dramatically in recent years, relatively little has been done in order to facilitate phenotype harmonization across studies. The tools we are proposing would allow researchers to quickly identify data sets of interest, expand research questions beyond the most basic main-effects to more complex analyses such as gene-by-environment interactions and multivariate test incorporating multiple phenotypes, and perform larger meta-analyses easily by honing in on outcomes, exclusionary variables and covariates of interest with increased statistical power to detect genetic associations.

"Statistical Modeling of Complex Traits in Genetic Reference Super-Populations     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Genetic crosses in model organisms play an essential role in understanding the heritable architecture of medically relevant phenotypes. Traditionally, such crosses have tended to be on a small scale with either limited power to detect genetic effects or limited resolution to localize causal variants. Recently, however, the emergence of larger-scale interdisciplinary research, cheaper genotyping and parallel advances in human genetics, have spurred the development of more sophisticated and powerful experimental designs. Genetic Resource Populations (GRPs) use economies of scale to provide cost-effective and replicable platforms for genetic studies. This project concerns the largest, most ambitious GRP in mouse genetics to date, the Collaborative Cross (CC), and a series of crosses and designs related to or derived from it: the Diversity Outbred (DO) cross, the CC Recombinant Inbred Cross (CC-RIX) and the diallel. Experiments on each separate cross provide distinct information about the heritable architecture of a target complex disease. In combination, this Genetic Reference Super-Population (GRSP) potentially provides an unparalleled basis for cross-study replication and integration in mouse genetics. This project aims to develop statistical methods that advance the current state of complex trait analysis of these populations separately, and, by exploiting the unique structure that connects them, proposes to develop a statistical framework that allows for their joint use.  Aim 1 develops a Bayesian probabilistic framework for haplotype-based analysis of quantitative trait loci (QTL). Aim 1a develops a statistical software module for flexible haplotype-based analysis, which can be ex- tended by the researcher to model a rich variety of designs and disease types. Aim 1b will adapt machine learning techniques to provide posterior inference of the allelic series of a QTL. Aim 1c will incorporate Bayesian modeling of polygenic effects.  Aim 2 and 3 concern joint analysis, building on the foundation set by Aim 1. Aim 2 develops methods to optimize experimental design of follow-up studies in one population given results from another. Aim 2a uses the diallel to inform design of CC/CC-RIX/DO experiments. Aim 2b uses partial data on CC/CC-RIX/DO to guide collection of additional data. Aim 3 explores models for jointly analyzing multiple populations in the GRSP, using complementary datasets to stabilize analysis at single QTL (Aim 3a) and across multiple QTL (Aim 3b).  These aims address specific and persistent challenges in the cost-effective design and efficient analysis of multiparent genetic data, in particular the CC, DO, CC-RIX and diallel. The project will generate tools useful for a wide range of model organism crosses and can be applied to the genetic study of any complex disease.              The proposed research will lead to improvements in the analysis and design of genetic studies on animal models of human disease. Because the project focuses on statistical methodology applied to experimental mouse populations, the scientific output of the project is expected to be applicable to basic research focusing on any medical condition that can be studied in the mouse.

"Systems genetic and reverse phenotypic analysis of age and retirement     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): High throughput genomic platforms have revealed a profound effect of age on gene expression and gene methylation levels. For example, our integromic analysis of multiple publicly available data sets have identified hundreds of age related genes that can be organized into network modules. These gene sets along with genes and pathways known from the vast literature on aging and longevity provide valuable candidates in allelic association studies of the health and well-being of older Americans. The rich longitudinal data set and the genome wide scans of DNA samples from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) provide a unique resource for evaluating the phenotypic effects of genetic variants underlying aging related genes, gene sets and for developing multivariable models that include behavioral, psychosocial, and genetic factors. This proposal aims to apply systems biologic and systems genetic methods for identifying gene sets based on existing gene expression, gene methylation, and multiple large scale genome wide association studies (GWAS). Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) underlying these genes will then be related to health, cognitive, behavioral, and economic phenotypes using multivariable regression-, machine learning-, and weighted network analysis approaches. An iterative process between SNP and phenotype selection facilitates the definition of clinically and economically important phenotypes under genetic control (reverse phenotyping). The proposal will not only elucidate the genetic and molecular underpinnings of retirement relevant phenotypes (cognitive functioning, psychosocial factors, and health related expenditures) but also lead to a phenotypic annotation of aging related genes and pathways.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: State of the art statistical, computational, and network approaches for integrating genomic data with the valuable phenotypic and genetic data provided by the Health and Retirement Study is expected to lead to the identification of genetic markers relevant for improving the lives of America's older adults.

"Genome-Transcription-Phenome-Wide Association: a new paradigm for association stu DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many complex disease syndromes consist of a large number of highly related, rather than independent, clinical phenotypes. Differences between these syndromes involve the complex interplay of a large number of genomic variations that perturb the function of disease-related genes in the context of a regulatory network, rather than individually. Thus unraveling the causal genetic variations and understanding the mechanisms of consequent cell and tissue transformation requires an analysis that jointly considers the epistatic, pleiotropic, and plastic interactions of elements and modules within and between the genome (G), transcriptome (T), and phenome (P). Most conventional methods focus on associations between every individual marker genotype and every single phenotype; they have limited statistical power and overlook the complex omit structures. We propose a systematic attempt on methodological development for the largely unexplored but practically important problem of structured associations between the ""-omes"". Rather than testing each SNP separately for association and then applying a correction by multiple hypothesis test, a structured association analysis identifies associations between groups of entities each with its own sophisticated structure that can not be ignored, such as blocks of SNPs with high LD, modules of genes in the same pathway, and clusters of phenotypes belong to a system of clinical descriptors of a disease. We will develop a mathematically rigorous and computationally efficient machine learning platform and software to address the methodological challenges involved with unraveling the interplay between disease-relevant elements in the G, T, and P omes. Our technical innovations include novel statistical models and algorithms for haplotype inference, recombination hotspot detection, gene network and phenotype network inference, admixture association mapping, and most importantly, a family of new structured regression techniques such as the graph-regularized regression, graph- guided fused lasso and extensions, that perform functional approximations to the association functions among structural elements in the G, T, and P omes, and have provable guarantee on consistency and sparsistency. We envisage our proposed research will open a new paradigm for association studies of complex diseases, which facilitates: 1) Intra- and inter-omic integration of data for association mapping and disease gene/pathway discovery, 2) Thorough explorations of the internal structures within different omic data, so that cryptic associations that are not possibly detectable in unstructured analysis due to their weak statistical power can be now inferred. 3) Joint statistical inference of mechanisms and pathways of how variations in DNA lead to variations in complex traits flows through molecular networks, and inference of condition-specific state of gene function in the molecular networks, and 4) Development of faster and automated computational algorithm with greater scalability and robustness to large-scale inter-omic analysis, and more convenient software package and user interface. All the software tools will be made available for free to the public. Project Narrative  We propose a systematic attempt on methodological development for the largely unexplored but practically  important problem of structured association mapping between disease-relevant elements in the genome,  transcriptome, and phenome. Since many complex diseases involve composite phenotypes that are the  outcome of intricate perturbation of molecular network underlying gene regulatory resulted from complex and  interdependent genome variations, structured association analysis at multi-omic level is not only needed, but  also necessary, but it is beyond the grasp of convention methods and requires the methodological innovations  we propose. Characterizing such interactions can provide a more comprehensive genetic and molecular view  of complex diseases, which may lead to the identification of genes underlying disease processes; in addition,  such an approach will allow us to formulate hypotheses regarding the roles of these genes with respect to  disease pathogenesis, and to develop improved diagnostic biomarkers for multivariate clinical phenotypes.",Genome-Transcription-Phenome-Wide Association: a new paradigm for association stu,8251157,R01GM087694,"['Address', 'Admixture', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Asthma', 'Biological Markers', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Descriptor', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Family', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Recombination', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Graph', 'Haplotypes', 'Indium', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Lasso', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Analysis', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Plastics', 'Population', 'Process', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research', 'Role', 'Software Tools', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Study Subject', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transcript', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical phenotype', 'data integration', 'data mining', 'disorder control', 'gene function', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic linkage analysis', 'grasp', 'improved', 'innovation', 'novel', 'phenome', 'trait']",NIGMS,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R01,2013,477069,-0.021338651331230044
"Methods for high-dimensional data in HIV/CVD research    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent technological advances have yielded vast quantities of molecular and cellular data, affording unprecedented opportunities to understand complex disease etiologies and to inform clinical management strategies. However, in order to derive information from these rich stores of data we need to develop sound and appropriate analytic techniques. This need is especially relevant in studies at the intersection of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and cardiovascular disease (CVD), which are characterized by an elaborate set of interactions among viral and host factors. These factors include viral and host genetic profiles, as well as markers of caloric metabolism, immune activation and inflammation, which work together to determine response to therapy and overall disease progression. A comprehensive assessment of these markers presents several analytical challenges owing to the large number of potentially informative variables and the largely uncharacterized relationship among them. We propose a multi-faceted strategy that focuses on the development and application of integrative statistical approaches. Such approaches will allow us to explore and characterize novel hypotheses relating to the complex relationships among multiple genetic, environmental, demographic, and clinical factors and measures of disease progression. Specifically, this continuation application focuses on advancing and applying statistical methods in two settings: first, we consider population-based genetic association studies of innate-immunity, adipokine, drug metabolism and drug transport genes and markers of immune reconstitution, inflammation and risk of CVD in HIV-infected individuals; and second, we address investigations of metabolic and immunologic profiles that associate with immune recovery, inflammation and risk of CVD. The Specific Aims of the proposed research are to develop and evaluate: (1) Latent class and mixture modeling paradigms for (a) discovering and characterizing multi-locus genotype-trait associations and (b) evaluating unobservable haplotype-trait associations in candidate-gene investigations; and (2) Hierarchical mixture models and machine learning approaches for (a) monitoring quantitative biomarkers in resource-limited settings and (b) characterizing high- dimensional predictors of immune reconstitution and inflammation. IMPACT: This research will lead to the creation of appropriate and carefully evaluated analytic tools to derive information from the rich array of molecular and cellular data now available. Ultimately, this research will advance our ability to translate molecular and cellular level data for clinical decision making, serving at the cornerstone of personalized medicine.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The newly available array of data on genetic polymorphisms and cellular level immune factors promises unprecedented opportunities to elucidate complex disease etiology and inform clinical management strategies. Using human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) as our model systems, we propose to develop, evaluate and apply new analytic approaches for high-dimensional data. Ultimately, these methods will allow us to derive information from the vast quantities of molecular and cellular data for personalized, clinical decisions and thus serve as a central component of translational medicine.

"An Integrative Analysis of Structural Variation for the 1000 Genomes Project DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Structural variation (SV), involving deletions, duplications, insertions and inversions of DNA segments, accounts for a large proportion of human genetic diversity. Comprehensive identification and analysis of these genetic variants will help us more fully elucidate the biology of their functional effects on human health and demography. Despite recent advances, the tools and data needed to comprehensively identify all types of SVs, genotype each variant, integrate and phase these variants remain lacking. Indeed, the data released from the early phases of the 1000 Genomes Project (1000GP) (1000 Genomes Project Consortium, 2010; 1000 Genomes Project Consortium, 2012) are biased primarily towards the detection of deletions within relatively unique regions of the genome. As a consortium, we propose to pool expertise from various research groups to provide an integrative analysis of SVs by combining rigorous computational algorithmic development with extensive experimental validation. The new algorithms we develop and the high confidence lists of SVs obtained will be rapidly made available as a public resource. n/a",An Integrative Analysis of Structural Variation for the 1000 Genomes Project,8589933,U41HG007497,"['Accounting', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Benchmarking', 'Biology', 'Chromosomes', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'DNA', 'DNA Insertion Elements', 'Data', 'Demography', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Future', 'Gene Conversion', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Haplotypes', 'Health', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nucleotides', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Process', 'Reading', 'Repetitive Sequence', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Statistical Models', 'Technology', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'design', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'improved', 'method development', 'novel', 'research study', 'tool']",NHGRI,JACKSON LABORATORY,U41,2013,2766009,0.012219207735488265
"International Case Control Study of Malignant Glioma    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Glioma comprises about 40% of all primary brain tumors accounting for as many as 26,000 U.S. and European deaths annually. Inherited susceptibility plays a role with 2-fold increased risk of glioma among first-degree relatives of glioma cases. We initiated a multi-center, international linkage study: ""Genetic Epidemiology of Glioma International Consortium"" in 2007 to address the role of inherited susceptibility. Since this study does not allow us currently to address the role of genetic susceptibility in sporadic cases, we propose this case- control study to address this gap. Members of the consortium have conducted genome wide association studies (GWAS) that will be the discovery phase (phase I). While of high value for discovery, we propose to recruit 6,000 newly diagnosed glioma cases and 6,000 age-gender-ethnicity-matched controls, and collect detailed epidemiologic data and biologic samples from the 13 participating Gliogene sites. We hypothesize that novel inherited variation influencing the susceptibility to glioma can be identified by high density SNP analysis, and propose the following specific aims: SA1: Identify common genetic variants contributing to the risk of glioma. We plan to conduct phases 2 and 3 of the 3 phase approach, specifically we will: (SA1a) Validate GWAS findings from the discovery sets, and replicate the top hits (~23,000 SNPs) with lowest p- values from the two phase GWA studies in a series of 2,000 cases and 2,000 controls (phase 2, validation). Validate the top hits from the test set (aim 1a). From stage 2, genes with SNPs displaying an association at pd10-4 (including the complete haplotype tagging - approximately 100 SNPs) will then be genotyped in a further series of 4,000 cases and 4,000 controls (stage 3, validation). SNPs significant at 10-7 or better will be considered in the final analyses. (SA1b). Using an a priori hypothesis that DNA repair in inflammation contribute to glioma risk, we will selectively interrogate DNA repair and inflammation pathway genes using data for select genes derived from the high-density array. We will conduct a hypothesis driven genetic association in DNA repair and in inflammation/immune function related genes with glioma risk using functional genomic and bioinformatic tools to interrogate available databases. (SA2): Evaluate gene-gene (G-G) and gene- environmental (G-E) interactions with strong biologic relevance to identify G-G and G-E interactions for glioma risk using machine-learning tools (MDR, FITF, and CART) in these exploratory analyses. There are no existing glioma case-control studies with sufficient numbers of biological samples and common epidemiologic data to conduct a comprehensive validation and replication study, or to address the issues of tumor heterogeneity as we will in this study.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Gliomas are a rare and understudied disease that is rapidly fatal. The proposed case-control study of primary malignant glioma (Gliogene Consortium) includes 13-centers, and will address the role of genetic susceptibility in sporadic cases. It will identify common genetic variants contributing to the risk of glioma from a genome wide association study.

"Predictive Modeling with Clinical and Genomic Data in COPD Candidate: Dr. Peter Castaldi is a physician completing a period of F32-funded support. On July 1st, 2009 he will begin a full-time position at Tufts Medical Center and the Institute for Clinical Research and Health Policy Studies (ICRHPS). This position involves a 25% clinical commitment. His principal research interests are the genetic epidemiology of COPD and the translation of genomic discoveries into clinical practice and public health. His particular interests are genetic meta-analysis, gene-environment interaction, and predictive modeling with regression-based and machine-learning methods.  His immediate goals are 1.) to identify novel genetic associations with COPD susceptibility and COPD- related phenotypes through the combined analysis of multiple genome-wide association (GWA) studies, 2.) to identify epistatic and gene-by-smoking interactions, and 3.) to develop accurate predictive models in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) using clinical and genomic information. His long-term goal is to be an independent investigator with expertise in bioinformatics. His vision for achieving this goal involves developing expertise in bioinformatics so as to be able to participate in and eventually lead multidisciplinary teams in the application of computational methods to genomic datasets in order to answer important clinical questions that will improve the care of patients and population health.    Environment: Dr. Castaldi will receive training in a rich, interdisciplinary environment. His principal mentor, Dr. Joseph Lau, is the head of the Center for Clinical Evidence Synthesis in the ICRHPS, and he is a worldwide leader in the field of meta-analysis and evidence synthesis. At Tufts, in addition to regular meetings with Dr. Lau, Peter will receive training in genetic evidence synthesis from leaders in the field, including Drs. John Ioannidis and Tom Trikalinos. The co-mentor of this application, Dr. Edwin Silverman, is a leading researcher in COPD genetics at the Channing Laboratory. At the Channing Laboratory, Peter will receive excellent training in respiratory genetics and genetic epidemiology, and he will have resources to state of the art high-throughput genotyping, next-generation sequencing technologies, and bioinformatics support. Dr. Castaldi will also continue his collaboration with Dr. Donna Slonim in the Tufts Computer Science Department, who will provide assistance with application of computational algorithms to genomic data and guidance as Dr. Castaldi continues to build a practical and theoretical foundation in Bioinformatics.    Research: COPD is a major cause of morbidity and mortality that is of increasing public health importance. While the principal risk factor for COPD, smoking, is well-established, there is variable susceptibility in the general population to the lung damage caused by cigarette smoke. There is strong evidence supporting a genetic component to COPD susceptibility. Understanding how genes and environment interact to produce clinical COPD will allow for more accurate diagnostic tools and open new avenues of investigation for the development of COPD therapies. We propose to 1.) identify novel genetic associations with COPD susceptibility and 4 COPD-related phenotypes by performing meta-analysis on patient-level data from 4 large COPD GWA studies, 2.) identify gene-by-smoking and gene-gene interactions, and 3.) develop predictive models for COPD susceptibility and COPD-related phenotypes. In order to maximize the information obtained from genomic data, we will combine data from multiple studies (the National Emphysema Treatment Trial Genetics Ancillary Study, the Norway Case-Control Study, COPDGene, and ECLIPSE - total sample size=7,962) to increase power and employ regression-based and machine-learning methods to identify complex patterns of interaction in genotype data. Our study is designed to both explore and subsequently rigorously validate discovered main effect and interaction associations. Using predictive models, we will quantify the incremental predictive benefit of including genetic main effects and genetic interaction data to traditional clinical variables.    Relevance: The proposed work will identify new genes associated with COPD and place them in a multivariate context so as to develop a better understanding of how genetic differences and environmental exposures contribute to the development of COPD. The models generated by this work will facilitate the translation of genomic discoveries to clinical practice and public health, in keeping with the NHLBI's mission to promote the prevention and treatment of heart, lung, and blood diseases and enhance the health of all individuals so that they can live longer and more fulfilling lives.

"Genetic predictors of anti-TNF treatment response and infections in IBD     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) affect over 1.4 million Americans. Over the past 15 years, considerable progress has been made in the therapy of CD and UC with monoclonal antibodies against tumor necrosis factor ¿ (anti-TNF) representing the most significant therapeutic breakthrough. However, many patients fail to respond adequately. Recent genome wide associations studies (GWAS) have significantly increased our understanding of the pathogenesis of CD and UC. The role of these genetic variants in predicting response to anti-TNF therapy is yet to be defined adequately. In addition, significant safety concerns remain with the use of these agents with serious infections occurring in up to 10% of patients. There is a strong genetic component to susceptibility to infections, in particular involving polymorphisms in innate immunity. Given the key role of innate immunity in IBD pathogenesis, whether such shared polymorphisms also influence risk of infections on anti-TNF therapy has not been examined previously. Thus, the development of tools to define likelihood of treatment response and infections are a key unmet need in the field. Our overarching objective is to identify clinical and genetic predictors of both short-term and long-term response as well as infectious complications of anti-TNF therapy. To achieve these aims, we will utilize the complementary strengths of two large cohorts - a prospective registry cohort of over 1200 patients with CD or UC, and a novel EMR-based cohort of over 11,000 patients with CD or UC linked to a biospecimen repository. This proposal utilizes the mentorship and significant expertise in key areas including analytical genetics, translational immunology, and bioinformatics and allows the candidate to develop fundamental skills in these novel content areas and research methods. The access to expertise at the NIH-funded center Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside, the Center for Study of Inflammatory Bowel Disease, and the Broad Institute is a key strength of this application. This career development award will be critical in providing training in bioinformatics and genetic epidemiology, thus contributing to the candidate's long-term goal of establishing an independent IBD research career with focus on defining at-risk cohorts and personalizing therapy. The training component of the award includes graduate-level courses in the relevant content areas in genetic epidemiology, and bioinformatics at the Harvard Medical School, School of Public Health, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The candidate will continue to actively engage with an established group of multidisciplinary researchers who have demonstrated the utility of the EMR-based approach to accurately define autoimmune diseases, link it to biospecimen collection, and use it successfully for genotyping-phenotype research. This will help foster collaborative development of future proposals as the work proposed in this application has the potential for applicability in other cohorts.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The novel information gained from this study regarding genetic predictors of treatment response and infectious complications has the potential to transform clinical practice by leading to clinical trials focused on selected cohorts of patients most likely to respond to therapies with low risk of adverse events, thus preventing unnecessary exposure to potentially toxic therapies with low likelihood of benefit. Such work is a step toward developing personalized medicine approaches to tailor therapy based on likelihood of benefit and risk. The methodology developed here will also have applications in other EMR-based cohorts to investigate novel therapeutic agents and disease outcomes.                  ",Genetic predictors of anti-TNF treatment response and infections in IBD,8545840,K23DK097142,"['Address', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor Therapy', 'Antibodies', 'Area', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Award', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'CD14 gene', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Comorbidity', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Crohn&apos', 's disease', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease remission', 'Exposure to', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Research', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Human Genetics', 'IL1R1 gene', 'Immune response', 'Immunology', 'Immunosuppressive Agents', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Informatics', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Interferons', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Massachusetts', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Monoclonal Antibodies', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Immunity', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Pneumonia', 'Predisposition', 'Public Health Schools', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Sepsis', 'Source', 'Structure', 'TNF gene', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha', 'Ulcerative Colitis', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'adaptive immunity', 'base', 'career', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'cost', 'genetic epidemiology', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'immune function', 'medical schools', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient registry', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'repository', 'response', 'skills', 'tool development', 'treatment response']",NIDDK,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K23,2013,168632,0.00042750634871423476
"Discovery and analysis of structural variation in whole genome sequences     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     The whole genome sequencing of large cohorts of individuals is quickly becoming a common tool for researchers to investigate the genetic basis of many disease phenotypes. The primary goals are to discover the underlying genetic variation that cause or contribute to these diseases as well as to correctly identify these variants in a diagnostic setting. These differences typicall consist of single base changes (SNPs), but can also encompass larger, more complex chromosomal rearrangements in the form of structural variation (SV) which are much more difficult to detect even with modern sequencing technologies. A number of approaches have been published that have studied this problem, but even the largest scale endeavors have only focused on deletion events and reported a sensitivity of <70%. Complex chromosomal rearrangements are even less well studied. Thus, it is paramount that accurate methods are developed which can detect all types of SVs at high specificity from sequence data. This proposal aims to improve the overall ability of researchers to identify and analyze genetic variation from whole genome sequences. An important, and often overlooked, aspect of SV discovery is the fact that typical paired-end, read depth, and split read approaches will identify different sets of non-overlapping variants at varying degrees of accuracy. In Aim 1, we will develop a unified SV discovery algorithm that can incorporate all of these different sources of information in a probabilistic fashion. Such a method would be useful for research, in particular with the identification of rare variants, as well as clinical applications which require a great del of accuracy and have thus far been limited to older karyotyping and microarray approaches. This would identify the majority of structural variants, however there are many regions in genomic sequences which are complex in nature, defined as consisting of multiple neighboring or overlapping chromosomal rearrangements that are challenging to resolve with typical SV detection approaches. In Aim 2, we propose methods to resolve these complex regions and assess their frequency and impact. Furthermore, a crucial step in medical genetics is the comparison of identified genetic mutations to databases of known pathogenic and benign variants. This is currently problematic with SVs, as they have often been originally reported with varying degrees of breakpoint resolution that can hamper the correct assignment of the variant. This issue is compounded further in more complex regions with multiple breakpoints, for which simplistic comparison methods do not work well. In Aim 3, we will develop and implement a system that describes and utilizes variant profiles to identify whether an individual's sequence data contains a variant of interest. Overall, this project will advance our understanding of the human genome as well as provide tools for use in the general research and clinical communities.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     The rearrangement of chromosomal material in the form of structural variation is directly responsible for many disease phenotypes, however our ability to detect and resolve these events from whole genome sequence data is currently limited. We propose a number of strategies for improving the detection and analysis of structural genomic variation between individuals and resolving their underlying structure and function. These approaches will have direct application to the clinical diagnosis of such events and the future of personalized genomics.            ",Discovery and analysis of structural variation in whole genome sequences,8528145,R01HG007068,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Area', 'Benign', 'Chromosomal Rearrangement', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'DNA Sequence Rearrangement', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Karyotype determination procedure', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Genetics', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Organism', 'Pathogenicity', 'Population', 'Publishing', 'Reading', 'Records', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Scanning', 'Seeds', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical application', 'cohort', 'direct application', 'disease phenotype', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'improved', 'interest', 'markov model', 'public health relevance', 'structural genomics', 'tool', 'virtual']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2013,382699,0.0024190465716892825
"Bioinformatics Approaches to Visual Disease Genetics     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is now recognized that many visual diseases are influenced by complex interactions between multiple different genetic variants. As a result, our ability to predict susceptibility to visual diseases will depend critically on the computational, mathematical and statistical modeling methods and software that are available for making sense of high-dimensional genetic data. We propose here a bioinformatics research project to develop network modeling approaches for identifying combinations of genetic biomarkers associated with visual disease endpoints. Our working hypothesis is that a systems-based bioinformatics approach using network modeling will play a very important role in confronting the complexity of the relationship between genomic variation and visual diseases. We will first develop and evaluate modeling methods to infer large-scale genetic interaction networks from genome-wide association studies (AIM 1). We will then apply the modeling methods developed in AIM 1 to the inference of genetic interaction networks from genome-wide association data in subjects with and without visual diseases (AIM 2).

"Informatic profiling of clinically relevant mutation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our group focuses on genetic variants that disrupt molecular functions that cause human disease. In this renewal R01 application, we propose to begin the process of realizing our long-term goals, and to expand our original scope of research to include the challenge of understanding genetic disease mutations and polymorphisms that affect gene expression regulation in noncoding regions. Additionally, we have formed collaborations with genetic data managers and will apply these methods to aid in their research and identify new testable hypotheses. We will do this in three aims. First, we will integrate predictions of protein-disease associations with mutation predictions to develop a new quantitative model of genotype and phenotype. Second, we will integrate each of these together to develop a systems level, molecular function genome annotator with functionality to import into the genome databases. Finally, we will continue to build new methods for characterization of mutations using sequence, function and structure and begin testing our published hypotheses. Each of these aims will include collaboration with the maintainers of genetic datasets to better understand their underlying molecular effects.

The innovative research plan details an approach to mapping risk for a strongly genetic subtype of obsessive compulsive (OCD) and comorbid tic disorders by generating and analyzing whole-exome sequence in select families to identify risk alleles. These efforts will be guided by pilot identity-by-descent, homozygosity, and copy number variant data in the comprehensively phenotyped OCD Collaborative Genetic Study (OCGS) multiplex family dataset. The OCD+tic phenotype is an ideal complex disorder for next generation genetic mapping. The clear phenotype, possibly reduced heterogeneity, and strong genetic effects make it an excellent candidate for the application of methodologies recently proven successful in Mendelian disorders. While the principle investigator has a strong background in child psychiatry and molecular genetics, the knowledge and skills required to master emerging genetic technologies such as next generation sequencing (NGS) are novel and complex. The short-term goals of this application are to gain proficiency in the methods that will drive the field over the coming decades, learn the statistical, computational, and informatics tools that will support this research, continue to develop skills in study design and interpretation, and refine and incorporate clinical and phenotyping skills. A program of coursework, supervision, and hands-on application of these approaches will equip the applicant in the long-term to integrate molecular, computational, and phenotypic data to make meaningful contributions to the field of psychiatric genetics.

"Mechanisms underlying complex trait human disease     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is now an explosion of new genome scale data relating genetic variation within the human population to phenotype, and particularly to common disease. Microarray technology has identified 100s of loci where the presence of particular variants is associated with altered risk of many common diseases; complete sequencing of individual exomes in cancer samples has discovered many somatic mutations in a variety of genes; and sequencing of 1000 human genomes has provided an almost complete inventory of common population variants. Further, these data are only the first in an ever-increasing flood, as even faster and cheaper sequencing technologies come on line. The results hold promise for major advances in treatment and diagnosis of common human diseases. Extracting the expected benefits is not straightforward, and will necessitate acquiring detailed knowledge of the mechanisms linking genetic variation to disease. This project focuses on one aspect of this challenge - using the new genomic data to identify new therapeutic opportunities. We will investigate those principles underlying complex trait disease that are particularly relevant to tha goal. We introduce a three stage mechanistic framework, relating genomic variation to the function of impacted gene products, the impact of these altered functions on pathways, processes and subsystems; and finally the consequences for complex trait disease phenotypes. We will develop computational methods to address key questions concerning three major aspects of the framework (1) How large are the changes in protein function brought about by the genomic variants underlying complex trait disease? What role do different classes of genomic and protein level mechanism, such as expression, non-synonymous changes and splicing, play in these variants? (2) How complete is the set genes with strong influence on the disease phenotypes discovered by current technologies, and how can missing genes be imputed from the genomic and network data? (3) What is the distribution of coupling between the activity of genes involved in disease mechanism and disease phenotypes? The results will deepen understanding of these aspects of complex disease, and provide a basis for identifying potential new drug targets from GWAS and other genomic studies.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: New technologies are now providing extensive information on human genetic variation associated with increased risk of a wide range of common human disease, such as Alzheimer's, diabetes, heart disease, and many cancers. These data hold the promise for the development of new therapies, and realizing those benefits requires the acquisition of complementary knowledge of the mechanisms that link genetic variation to disease risk. This project is focused on analysis of the relationship between genetic variation and common disease with the goal of identifying new therapeutic opportunities.                ",Mechanisms underlying complex trait human disease,8431505,R01GM104436,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coupled', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Drug Targeting', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Explosion', 'Floods', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Information Networks', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Minor', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Other Genetics', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'RNA Splicing', 'Relative (related person)', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Staging', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Translations', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder risk', 'exome', 'exome sequencing', 'gene function', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'human disease', 'improved', 'insight', 'new technology', 'novel therapeutics', 'protein function', 'public health relevance', 'risk variant', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'trait']",NIGMS,"UNIV OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK",R01,2013,278213,-0.007878348773601971
"NHGRI PAGE Coordinating Center     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): NHGRI developed the Population Architecture Using Genomics and Epidemiology (PAGE) research program to identify and characterize genomic variants in non-European populations. To support the complexities of such an ambitious effort, we have convened a strong team of statistical, population, and molecular geneticists, computer and information scientists, biostatisticians, and project management staff with many years of related experience to serve as a Coordinating Center (CC). Specifically, the CC will serve as a centralized resource to facilitate and support the activities of the program and Study Investigators focused on characterization of causal variants by: (1) coordinating phenotype harmonization efforts, including mapping phenotype variables across studies and to the PhenX measures; (2) synthesizing individual-level data into centralized datasets to facilitate sharing of data within and outside of PAGE; (3) utilizing state-of-the-art computer and information science support and scientific workflows that will facilitate analyses, ancestry deconvolution, genotype calling and imputation, SNP annotation, and data synthesis; (4) rapidly disseminating all study data via dbGaP and/or the PAGE website or other applicable databases; and (5) serving as a centralized resource to facilitate, support, and manage program activities and logistics as requested by the Steering Committee or Project Office and as needed for successful coordination of the program. Coordination of the program will be done in a spirit of collaboration using creative and flexible approaches, while providing leadership in statistical genetic methodologies and approaches to project management. The ultimate goal of our CC is to facilitate the identification and characterization of genotype-phenotype associations, especially as relevant to non-European populations, thereby accelerating our understanding of ancestral differences in the genetic and environmental causes of common diseases. Critical to achieving this mission is the deployment of powerful methods for ancestry deconvolution, multi- and trans-ethnic mapping, and imputation. Building upon our success as the PAGE I CC, we have added additional investigators with expertise in these areas and consortium experience with next-generation sequence analysis of both whole-genome and exome data. Our collaborative team is ideally staffed to meet the challenges of the new round of PAGE.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The PAGE study focuses on analysis of existing large samples of primarily non- European ancestry to broaden our understanding of the ethnic differences in the genetic basis of complex disease.

"Multivariate Pattern Analysis Methods for Neuroimaging Genetics Studies    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Common mental disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia are largely heritable with complex genetic underpinnings. Large-scale genome-wide association studies that contrast DNA sequence data from patients and controls have recently identified novel genetic risk variants for these disorders. Nevertheless, the processes through which genotype increases risk are yet to be fully characterized.  Neuroimaging offers a richer picture of the underlying disease processes than a clinical diagnosis. Thus the joint analysis of neuroimaging and genetics data promises to advance our understanding of these processes. Today, neuroimaging genetics studies however face important challenges that obstruct progress: small sample sizes, modest effect sizes, and the extreme dimensionality of the data limit statistical power and thus our ability to explore the complex and subtle associations between genes, neuroanatomy and clinical decline. Currently, the prevalent approach in neuroimaging genetics is to concentrate the analysis on a small number of anatomic regions of interest and/or candidate genes and often ignore a large portion of the data. The core goal of the proposed project is to develop computational tools that will take full advantage of the richness in the datasets and facilitate the exploration of the multifaceted associations between genotype, neuroimaging measurements and clinical phenotype. The proposed project will use advanced multivariate pattern analysis methods such as support vector machines to compute image-based and genetic scores that reflect pathology. We will validate the tools based on their association with classical biomarkers of disease. Finally, we will develop a model that uses both imaging and genotype data to predict future clinical outcome. We expect these tools will enable progress along three directions relevant to complex mental disorders, e.g. late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD): (1) confirming and characterizing risk genes, (2) identifying disease-specific anatomical alterations in healthy individuals, and (3) early diagnosis and prognosis. The project will (1) use three already-collected large-scale datasets to apply the developed tools to AD, (2) build on cutting-edge image processing algorithms that we have been developing, and (3) allow the candidate to receive further training in neuroanatomy, mental disorders and genetics, forming the foundation for his future career as an independent researcher.       n/a",Multivariate Pattern Analysis Methods for Neuroimaging Genetics Studies,8535152,K25EB013649,"['Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Anatomy', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Face', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Research', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Late Onset Alzheimer Disease', 'Lead', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Schizophrenia', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Training', 'base', 'career', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical phenotype', 'computerized tools', 'data modeling', 'disorder risk', 'entorhinal cortex', 'genetic risk factor', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'high risk', 'image processing', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'molecular pathology', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'pre-clinical', 'programs', 'risk variant', 'tool']",NIBIB,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K25,2013,175392,-0.018311287788248046
"Whole-Genome Prediction of Type-2 Diabetes Susceptibility in Various Populations     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The applicant's career goal is to become a productive independent investigator in the area of statistical genetics, particularly in the area of genomic-based prediction of type-2 diabetes (T2D) risk. To meet this goal, the applicant proposes a career development plan that includes hands- on and didactic training in statistical learning as applied to quantitative genetics, categorical and case-control data analysis, informatics as applied to high dimensional genetic data, and the biology and genetics of T2D. A highly accomplished and diverse set of investigators with proven track records of successful mentoring will oversee the applicant's career development. The research component of this project seeks to improve our ability to use genetic information to predict an individual's risk of developing T2D Publically available genetic and phenotypic data from sources such as dbGaP (The database of Phenotypes and Genotypes) will be used to develop and test various models for prediction of T2D risk among three racial/ethnic groups. This project will capitalize on newly developed statistical methods that are able to incorporate information from tens of thousands of genetic markers at once, which represent a major advance over current methods that typically take fewer than 100 markers into account. The aims of the study are: 1) To test the hypothesis, in different populations, that individualized whole-genome prediction of T2D (along with standard covariates of sex, age, and BMI) will offer major improvements over current genetics-based prediction models, and will offer equal or greater accuracy than prediction based on family history; 2) To impute additional genetic markers to determine whether prediction can be improved, and to identify the subset of markers that is most useful in predicting T2D; 3) To develop prediction models for T2D risk given a certain body mass index (BMI), by including as predictors the interaction of BMI and genotypes. This project will greatly enhance our ability to predict an individual's susceptibility to T2D within various populations, leading to earlier and targeted prevention strategies, will increase our understanding of the genetic basis of T2D, and will provide critical training for Dr. Klimentidis' development as an independent scientist.      Genetic factors are known to play a substantial role in the etiology of type-2 diabetes (T2D), which is a growing health challenge facing developed and developing countries. In this application, we propose to use state-of-the-art statistical methods that enable us to account for thousands of genetic variants simultaneously, in order to build and test predictive models for T2D susceptibility among individuals of European, Mexican, and African descent. This project has the potential to greatly improve prediction of T2D susceptibility in several ethnic groups, provide a better understanding of the specific genetic factors that play a role in T2D susceptibility, and ultimately bring us closer to the era of personalized medicine in which improved prediction ability results in earlier patient-oriented prevention and treatment.

"Genome Wide Association Study of Head and Neck Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Head and neck cancers have well-documented associations with tobacco and alcohol exposure, but the disease develops in only a small fraction of users, which implies an important role for genetic susceptibility. Therefore, head and neck cancers are an excellent model for studying genetic susceptibility to environmental carcinogens. The primary goal of this R01 application is to perform a comprehensive two-stage, high-density, genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis of head and neck cancer cases and corresponding frequency matched controls to identify novel genetic risk factors for head and neck cancer. This proposal builds upon a well-annotated existing DNA repository of cases and controls. One of the unique features of our study is the availability of DNA repair assay data on most of the cases and controls in this study, which will allow us to conduct genotype/phenotype analyses. We also have access to genome-wide association data from 1200 white control subjects from the same source population. In aim 1, we will perform genotyping on 1000 randomly selected head and neck cancer cases and 500 controls using a 370K Illumina Infinium HapMap HumanCNV370-Duo SNP Chip. We will perform association analyses (1000 cases and 1700 controls) in the first stage using outcome variable as case-control status as well as DNA repair capacity assay data. Our second aim is to perform second-stage analysis of the SNPs selected in stage 1 using 900 additional cases and corresponding controls from the same source and from UCLA. We will use efficient joint analysis of cases and controls from the first and second aims, for a total of 1900 cases and 2600 controls. Finally, in aim 3, we will apply novel statistical tools such as the latent variable approach with Tukey's one-degree-of-freedom test and support vector machines to identify gene-gene and gene-environment (using environmental factors such as smoking and alcohol use) interactions that contribute to the risk of head and neck cancer. We are an experienced investigative team proposing a comprehensive analysis that incorporates epidemiological, behavioral, and functional data. Identification of novel genetic risk factors and their interactions with environmental factors will contribute to the early diagnosis of head and neck cancers.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The identification of novel genetic risk factors and their interactions with environmental factors will contribute to the early diagnosis of the disease and help identify individuals at highest risk for the development of head and neck cancer on the basis of their personal exposure patterns and their genetic risk profiles.

"Genome Wide Association Study for Childhood Obesity     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Obesity is a major risk factor for type 2 diabetes, which in turn has serious complications including accelerated development of cardiovascular disease. The prevalence of obesity in children and adults in the United States has increased by more than 30% over the past decade.  We previously successfully argued in our application for the R01 HD056465 award that distillation of the genetic component in this complex phenotype should thus be easier to determine in children, where environmental exposure and impact has been for a relatively short period of their lifetime; indeed the resulting work did pan out to be successful in this regard. We carried out a non-hypothesis-driven study that was directed at uncovering genes and genetic variants that predispose to childhood obesity by conducting a genome-wide association study (GWAS) using a high density tag-SNP array. Employing a powered two-stage study design in a consortium setting, where cases were defined as being in the e95th percentile of BMI, we identified novel association signals which we subsequently replicated. This NICHD funded study was ultimately published in Nature Genetics (with the PI as senior author) and received widespread press attention, including with CNN, Time and the front page of USA Today.  The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia is now poised to determine additional genetic factors conferring risk to the pathogenesis of childhood obesity through the leveraging of new ultra-high-throughput sequencing technology, and also allow for fine-mapping of the already uncovered loci to determine the actual causal mechanism of action. Combining our accurately phenotyped cohort, which represents the largest pediatric obesity DNA collection in the world, with access to familial childhood obesity, availability of existing genome wide singl nucleotide polymorphism genotypes and the application of whole exome sequencing, this renewal application of R01 HD056465 proposes to broaden the list of novel genetic loci that are associated with this trait in order to get further insights in to the genetic etiology of common pediatric obesity.  We are well positioned to extend our knowledge of the genetic etiology of childhood obesity. It is unclear if these additional variants are common in the population, a set o private mutations in families or a mixture of both. Irrespective of the nature of the variant(s) we are well positioned to look for both types of event, with common variants detectable through leveraging the GWAS dataset of well powered cohorts and private mutations detectable through whole exome sequencing of many multi-case pedigrees. This represents a major follow-up to the Principal Investigator's original grant application and this renewal will allow for adding extr value to the already substantial findings made funded by the original grant.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The prevalence of obesity in children and adults in the United States has increased by more than 30% over the past decade. We are seeking to renew R01 HD056465 to expand on the successful findings made previously and to further characterize the genetic etiology of childhood obesity and pediatric BMI trajectory. Combining our recruited accurately phenotyped and largest pediatric obesity cohort in the world, access to familial childhood obesity, availability of existing genome wide single nucleotide polymorphism genotypes and the application of whole exome sequencing, this renewal proposes to broaden the list of novel genetic loci that are associated with this trait.            ",Genome Wide Association Study for Childhood Obesity,8582416,R01HD056465,"['Adult', 'Applications Grants', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Body mass index', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'DNA', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Impact', 'Event', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genotype', 'Grant', 'Knowledge', 'Maps', 'Mutation', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Nature', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Normal Statistical Distribution', 'Nucleotides', 'Obesity', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Phenotype', 'Philadelphia', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Principal Investigator', 'Publishing', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research Design', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Staging', 'Technology', 'Time', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'Work', 'cohort', 'density', 'exome sequencing', 'follow-up', 'genetic pedigree', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'insight', 'longitudinal analysis', 'novel', 'obesity in children', 'public health relevance', 'trait']",NICHD,CHILDREN'S HOSP OF PHILADELPHIA,R01,2013,691234,-0.013995076157517045
"Machine Learning Prediction of Cancer Susceptibility    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Susceptibility to sporadic forms of cancer is determined by numerous genetic factors that interact in a nonlinear manner in the context of an individual's age and environmental exposure. This complex genetic architecture has important implications for the use of genome-wide association studies for identifying susceptibility genes. The assumption of a simple architecture supports a strategy of testing each single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) individually using traditional univariate statistics followed by a correction for multiple tests. However, a complex genetic architecture that is characteristic of most types of cancer requires analytical methods that specifically model combinations of SNPs and environmental exposures. While new and novel methods are available for modeling interactions, exhaustive testing of all combinations of SNPs is not feasible on a genome- wide scale because the number of comparisons is effectively infinite. Thus, it is critical that we develop intelligent strategies for selecting subsets of SNPs prior to combinatorial modeling. The objective of this renewal application is to continue the development of a research strategy for the detection, characterization, and interpretation of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions in genome-wide association studies of bladder cancer susceptibility. To accomplish this objective, we will continue developing and evaluating modifications and extensions to the ReliefF family of algorithms for selecting or filtering subsets of single- nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) analysis of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions (AIM 1). We will continue developing and evaluating a stochastic wrapper or search strategy for MDR analysis of interactions that utilizes ReliefF values as a heuristic (AIM 2). We will continue to make available ReliefF algorithms as part of our open-source MDR software package (AIM 3). Finally, we will apply the best ReliefF-MDR analysis strategies to the detection, characterization, and interpretation of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions in large genome-wide association studies of bladder cancer susceptibility (AIM 4). We anticipate the proposed machine learning methods will provide powerful new approaches for identifying genetic variations that are predictive of cancer susceptibility.              PROJECT NARRATIVE The technology to measure information about the human genome is advancing at a rapid pace. Despite these advance, the computational methods for analyzing the data have not kept pace. We will develop new computer algorithms and software that can be used to identify genetic biomarkers of common human diseases. We will then apply these new computational methods to identifying genetic biomarkers of bladder cancer in an epidemiological study from New Hampshire.",Machine Learning Prediction of Cancer Susceptibility,8324692,R01LM009012,"['Age', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Biological Markers', 'Characteristics', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Goals', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'New Hampshire', 'Predisposition', 'Research', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Validation', 'analytical method', 'base', 'cancer type', 'combinatorial', 'gene environment interaction', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'heuristics', 'human disease', 'improved', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'population based', 'programs', 'statistics']",NLM,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2012,369433,0.007952624610959597
"Microbial Diversity and Genetic Characterization of Cariogenic Biofilms    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed studies are anticipated to yield important new information as to the presence of specific genetic determinants found in Streptococcus mutans, a microbe strongly associated with a severe dental caries in affecting young children called severe early childhood caries or S-ECC. The long-term benefit of such information should lead researchers toward devising both diagnostic and preventive strategies against dental though better understanding its microbial causation. Using a powerful technique of suppressive subtraction DNA hybridization, the first specific aim is to test the hypothesis that strains of S. mutans found in S-ECC children differ in genetic composition compared to strains found in caries-free (CF) children. Unique genetic loci that are specific to S-ECC strains will be identified and characterized. Some of these genetic loci will prove informative as biomarkers for health or disease. Using the power of multiple test analyses derived artificial intelligence programming; biomarkers will be used as the basis for a modeling algorithm capable of classifying strains of S. mutans in one of two categories (S-ECC or CF). The second aim of this study is to survey strains of S. mutans associated with either S-ECC or CF status for known or suspected genetic elements thought to influence the pathogenesis or virulence of S. mutans. The third aim is to survey a larger, racial/ethnical diverse population of S-ECC or CF children for the presence or absence of the biomarkers identified in the first two aims. It is anticipated that this research will yield genetic markers for disease capable of providing clinicians with a diagnostic test that can assess risk for developing S-ECC. 7.           n/a",Microbial Diversity and Genetic Characterization of Cariogenic Biofilms,8205040,R01DE013937,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological Markers', 'Categories', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Coupling', 'DNA', 'Dental', 'Dental caries', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Dot Immunoblotting', 'Effectiveness', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomic Islands', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'Hispanics', 'Infant', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Microbe', 'Microbial Biofilms', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mothers', 'Pathogenesis', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevention strategy', 'Process', 'Programmed Learning', 'Public Health', 'Pulsed-Field Gel Electrophoresis', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'SHH gene', 'Series', 'Severity of illness', 'Streptococcus mutans', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Virulence', 'Virulence Factors', 'base', 'early childhood', 'experience', 'genetic element', 'microbial', 'programs', 'research study', 'tool']",NIDCR,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R01,2012,364134,0.015845786354051677
"Optimizing Genetic Testing for Deafness for Clinical Diagnostics   Project Summary  In this goal-driven proposal, submitted in response to Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) Number PAR-11-003, we will make comprehensive genetic testing for deafness available to clinicians for under $500 per person. The driving force behind this initiative is the frequency of hearing impairment. As the most common sensory impairment, it is diagnosed in 1 of every 500 newborns and 50% of octogenarians (Morton Ann N Y Acad Sci 1991). With 57 genes implicated in nonsyndromic hearing loss (NSHL), it is also an extremely heterogeneous trait and presents a tremendous challenge to diagnosis.  Current strategies for genetic testing for deafness are inadequate. For most, only a minority of genes is included, with selection criteria typically reflecting: 1) high prevalence as a cause of deafness (i.e. GJB2); 2) association with another recognizable feature (i.e. SLC26A4 and enlarged vestibular aqueduct); or 3) a recognizable audioprofile (i.e. low frequency hearing loss as seen with WFS1) (Hilgert et al Mut Res 2009).  The recent advent of powerful DNA target enrichment and sequencing technologies, however, makes it possible to provide comprehensive genetic testing for deafness that is efficient and cost-effective. We have shown that it is possible to analyze all deafness genes simultaneously on a single platform (called OtoSCOPE) (Shearer et al PNAS 2010). Related to this endeavor, we have also validated AudioGene as a phenotypic tool that uses patient audiograms to predict the genetic cause of ADNSHL (Hildebrand et al Genet Med 2008; Hildebrand et al Laryngoscope 2009).  Building on these findings, in this proposal we will complete two specific aims.  Specific Aim 1: To provide comprehensive, high-throughput, low-cost DNA sequence generation and analysis for deafness genetic testing  Goal 1: Comprehensive, high-throughput, low-cost DNA sequence analysis for genetic testing for deafness is possible at sensitivities and specificities comparable to Sanger sequencing by using targeted sequence enrichment followed by massively parallel sequencing.  Specific Aim 2: To optimize both machine learning-based audioprofiling of audiometric data and phenotypic filtering of genotypic data by expanding and improving the platform we have developed called AudioGene  Goal 2: As a phenome tool, a machine-learning software system trained on an extensive set of audiometric data can be used to predict and to eliminate specific genes or gene variants as causes of deafness based on audiometric data.  Achieving these specific aims will change the clinical evaluation of deaf and hard-of-hearing persons by making genetic testing the most important diagnostic test after a history, physical examination and audiological assessment.   In this goal-driven proposal, submitted in response to Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) Number PAR-11-003, we will make comprehensive genetic testing for deafness available to clinicians for under $500 per person.

"DEVELOPING STRATEGIES FOR JOINT GENE-ENVIRONMENT ANALYSIS    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A key challenge for genetic analysis today is to account for the bulk of the phenotypic variance in complex traits that is attributable to genetic factors, but remains unexplained after multiple well-powered GWAS (Goldstein 2009; Hirschhorn 2009; Kraft and Hunter 2009). Many believe that systematically testing datasets for joint gene-environment effects (GxE) and gene-gene (GxG) effects will be essential in order to understand the genetics of complex phenotypes. However, the new era of high throughput, high-density genomic data (genotypes and sequencing) has given rise to serious computational and statistical challenges for the analysis of joint effects. The goal of this project is to develop effective strategies for the statistical analysis of joint-gene environment effects. The specific aims are to (1) identify strengths and weaknesses of multiple analytic approaches to joint GxE effects, and (2) develop new methods for coordinated meta-analysis. To accomplish Aim 1, we will systematically examine and compare traditional (e.g. regression based) and modern (e.g. partitioning, machine learning, information theoretic) analysis methods for case-control and quantitative phenotypes. The primary product will be specific guidance as to the conditions under which each method performs well. To accomplish Aim 2, we will extend recent joint-effects methods to a meta-analytic framework and develop improvements to currently used methods. For both aims, we will also analyze real data related to smoking, thereby improving our understanding of genetic and environmental contributors to smoking and addiction risk. These analyses of real data will be guided by bioinformatics-based variant prioritization. This study therefore will provide both guidance and tools needed to move the field of joint effects analysis forward. As a result, it will ultimately have a significant impact on our ability to account for the currently unexplained genetic contribution to phenotypic variance for complex traits.        Many diseases that greatly impact public health (such as heart disease, diabetes, and nicotine addiction) are the result of a complex interplay between genes and environmental factors. The purpose of this grant is to improve data analysis strategies (applicable to a wide variety of diseases) for the detection of joint effects of genes and environment. We will apply these methods to analyze existing data on smokers to improve our understanding of gene-environment effects on nicotine addiction.

"Information Explorer: a Suite of Tools for Cross-study Genetic Loci Discovery    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Databases such as dbGaP represent extremely valuable resources of data that have been assembled across multiple cohorts. The increasing development of cost-effective high-throughput genotyping and sequencing technologies are resulting in vast amounts of genetic data. While such databases were formed in order to archive and distribute the results of previously performed genetic association analyses, an increasing number of studies have provided de-identified individual-level genotypic and phenotypic data that are made available to outside researchers who have obtained the appropriate authorization. While the amount of data made available has increased dramatically in recent years, relatively little has been done in order to facilitate phenotype harmonization across studies. Many genetic epidemiologic studies of cardiovascular disease have multiple variables related to any given phenotype, resulting from different definitions and multiple measurements or subsets of data. A researcher searching such databases for the availability of phenotype and genotype combinations is confronted with a veritable mountain of variables to sift through. This often requires visiting multiple websites to gain additional information about variables that are listed on databases, and examination of data distributions to assess similarities across cohorts. While the naming strategy for genetic variants is largely standardized across studies (e.g. ""rs"" numbers for single nucleotide polymorphisms or SNPs), this is often not the case for phenotype variables. For a given study, there are often numerous versions of phenotypic variables. Researchers currently have to analyze and compare increasingly larger numbers of variables that have varying degrees of documentation associated with them to obtain the desired information. This is a time-consuming process that may still miss the most appropriate variables. Moreover, every researcher that wants to compare the same datasets often needs to start from scratch since there are no tools to share the phenotype comparison results. The availability of informatic tools to make phenotype mapping more efficient and improve its accuracy, along with intuitive phenotype query tools, would provide a major resource for researchers utilizing these databases. The tools we are proposing would allow researchers to (1) Quickly obtain the information needed to assess whether a specific study will be useful for the hypothesis of interest; (2) Exclude variables that do not meet research criteria; (3) Ascertain which studies have combinations of phenotype and genetic information of interest; and (4) More easily expand research questions beyond the most basic main-effects to more complex analyses such as gene-by-environment interactions and multivariate tests incorporating multiple phenotypes. The increased utility will also enable larger meta-analyses to be performed, as researchers will be able to more quickly hone in on outcomes, exclusionary variables and covariates of interest, leading to increased statistical power to detect genetic associations.        While the amount of genomic data (e.g., GWAS, sequencing, etc.) made available has increased dramatically in recent years, relatively little has been done in order to facilitate phenotype harmonization across studies.

"Statistical Modeling of Complex Traits in Genetic Reference Super-Populations     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Genetic crosses in model organisms play an essential role in understanding the heritable architecture of medically relevant phenotypes. Traditionally, such crosses have tended to be on a small scale with either limited power to detect genetic effects or limited resolution to localize causal variants. Recently, however, the emergence of larger-scale interdisciplinary research, cheaper genotyping and parallel advances in human genetics, have spurred the development of more sophisticated and powerful experimental designs. Genetic Resource Populations (GRPs) use economies of scale to provide cost-effective and replicable platforms for genetic studies. This project concerns the largest, most ambitious GRP in mouse genetics to date, the Collaborative Cross (CC), and a series of crosses and designs related to or derived from it: the Diversity Outbred (DO) cross, the CC Recombinant Inbred Cross (CC-RIX) and the diallel. Experiments on each separate cross provide distinct information about the heritable architecture of a target complex disease. In combination, this Genetic Reference Super-Population (GRSP) potentially provides an unparalleled basis for cross-study replication and integration in mouse genetics. This project aims to develop statistical methods that advance the current state of complex trait analysis of these populations separately, and, by exploiting the unique structure that connects them, proposes to develop a statistical framework that allows for their joint use.  Aim 1 develops a Bayesian probabilistic framework for haplotype-based analysis of quantitative trait loci (QTL). Aim 1a develops a statistical software module for flexible haplotype-based analysis, which can be ex- tended by the researcher to model a rich variety of designs and disease types. Aim 1b will adapt machine learning techniques to provide posterior inference of the allelic series of a QTL. Aim 1c will incorporate Bayesian modeling of polygenic effects.  Aim 2 and 3 concern joint analysis, building on the foundation set by Aim 1. Aim 2 develops methods to optimize experimental design of follow-up studies in one population given results from another. Aim 2a uses the diallel to inform design of CC/CC-RIX/DO experiments. Aim 2b uses partial data on CC/CC-RIX/DO to guide collection of additional data. Aim 3 explores models for jointly analyzing multiple populations in the GRSP, using complementary datasets to stabilize analysis at single QTL (Aim 3a) and across multiple QTL (Aim 3b).  These aims address specific and persistent challenges in the cost-effective design and efficient analysis of multiparent genetic data, in particular the CC, DO, CC-RIX and diallel. The project will generate tools useful for a wide range of model organism crosses and can be applied to the genetic study of any complex disease.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     The proposed research will lead to improvements in the analysis and design of genetic studies on animal models of human disease.

"Computational Strategies for Quantitative Mapping of Genetic Interaction Networks    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent studies suggest that many diseases, particularly those that commonly afflict our population, result from interactions among multiple alleles. In an attempt to understand these complex phenotypes, recent experimental efforts in model organisms have focused on measuring such interactions by engineering combinatorial genetic perturbations. Due to the enormous space of possible mutants, brute-force experimental investigation is simply not feasible, and thus, there is a critical need for computational strategies for intelligent exploration of genetic interaction networks. The specific objective of this application is to develop a computational framework for leveraging the existing genomic or proteomic data to enable intelligent direction of combinatorial perturbation studies. The rationale for the proposed research is that although current knowledge of genetic interactions is sparse, the integration of existing genomic and proteomic data can enable the inference of network models that suggest promising candidates for high-throughput interaction screens. Using such computational guidance should enable more efficient characterization of network structure, and ultimately, better understanding of how genes contribute to complex phenotypes.  Based on strong findings in preliminary studies, this objective will be accomplished through two specific aims: (1) development of critical normalization methods and quantitative models for colony array-based interaction assays, and (2) novel machine learning-based approaches for iterative model refinement and optimal interaction screen selection.  The proposed research is innovative because it would represent one of the first efforts to couple genomic data integration and network inference technology with a large-scale experimental effort, where several months of experimental investigation are based entirely on computational direction. Such an approach will yield insight into how combinatorial perturbations can be used to characterize global modularity and organization, and more generally, would serve as a prototype for hybrid computational-experimental strategies in other genomic contexts.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Many common diseases result from interactions among multiple genes. One approach to studying multigenic interactions is to introduce combinations of mutations in model organisms and observe how they affect the cell.

"Methods for high-dimensional data in HIV/CVD research    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent technological advances have yielded vast quantities of molecular and cellular data, affording unprecedented opportunities to understand complex disease etiologies and to inform clinical management strategies. However, in order to derive information from these rich stores of data we need to develop sound and appropriate analytic techniques. This need is especially relevant in studies at the intersection of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and cardiovascular disease (CVD), which are characterized by an elaborate set of interactions among viral and host factors. These factors include viral and host genetic profiles, as well as markers of caloric metabolism, immune activation and inflammation, which work together to determine response to therapy and overall disease progression. A comprehensive assessment of these markers presents several analytical challenges owing to the large number of potentially informative variables and the largely uncharacterized relationship among them. We propose a multi-faceted strategy that focuses on the development and application of integrative statistical approaches. Such approaches will allow us to explore and characterize novel hypotheses relating to the complex relationships among multiple genetic, environmental, demographic, and clinical factors and measures of disease progression. Specifically, this continuation application focuses on advancing and applying statistical methods in two settings: first, we consider population-based genetic association studies of innate-immunity, adipokine, drug metabolism and drug transport genes and markers of immune reconstitution, inflammation and risk of CVD in HIV-infected individuals; and second, we address investigations of metabolic and immunologic profiles that associate with immune recovery, inflammation and risk of CVD. The Specific Aims of the proposed research are to develop and evaluate: (1) Latent class and mixture modeling paradigms for (a) discovering and characterizing multi-locus genotype-trait associations and (b) evaluating unobservable haplotype-trait associations in candidate-gene investigations; and (2) Hierarchical mixture models and machine learning approaches for (a) monitoring quantitative biomarkers in resource-limited settings and (b) characterizing high- dimensional predictors of immune reconstitution and inflammation. IMPACT: This research will lead to the creation of appropriate and carefully evaluated analytic tools to derive information from the rich array of molecular and cellular data now available. Ultimately, this research will advance our ability to translate molecular and cellular level data for clinical decision making, serving at the cornerstone of personalized medicine.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The newly available array of data on genetic polymorphisms and cellular level immune factors promises unprecedented opportunities to elucidate complex disease etiology and inform clinical management strategies. Using human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) as our model systems, we propose to develop, evaluate and apply new analytic approaches for high-dimensional data. Ultimately, these methods will allow us to derive information from the vast quantities of molecular and cellular data for personalized, clinical decisions and thus serve as a central component of translational medicine.

"International Case Control Study of Malignant Glioma    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Glioma comprises about 40% of all primary brain tumors accounting for as many as 26,000 U.S. and European deaths annually. Inherited susceptibility plays a role with 2-fold increased risk of glioma among first-degree relatives of glioma cases. We initiated a multi-center, international linkage study: ""Genetic Epidemiology of Glioma International Consortium"" in 2007 to address the role of inherited susceptibility. Since this study does not allow us currently to address the role of genetic susceptibility in sporadic cases, we propose this case- control study to address this gap. Members of the consortium have conducted genome wide association studies (GWAS) that will be the discovery phase (phase I). While of high value for discovery, we propose to recruit 6,000 newly diagnosed glioma cases and 6,000 age-gender-ethnicity-matched controls, and collect detailed epidemiologic data and biologic samples from the 13 participating Gliogene sites. We hypothesize that novel inherited variation influencing the susceptibility to glioma can be identified by high density SNP analysis, and propose the following specific aims: SA1: Identify common genetic variants contributing to the risk of glioma. We plan to conduct phases 2 and 3 of the 3 phase approach, specifically we will: (SA1a) Validate GWAS findings from the discovery sets, and replicate the top hits (~23,000 SNPs) with lowest p- values from the two phase GWA studies in a series of 2,000 cases and 2,000 controls (phase 2, validation). Validate the top hits from the test set (aim 1a). From stage 2, genes with SNPs displaying an association at pd10-4 (including the complete haplotype tagging - approximately 100 SNPs) will then be genotyped in a further series of 4,000 cases and 4,000 controls (stage 3, validation). SNPs significant at 10-7 or better will be considered in the final analyses. (SA1b). Using an a priori hypothesis that DNA repair in inflammation contribute to glioma risk, we will selectively interrogate DNA repair and inflammation pathway genes using data for select genes derived from the high-density array. We will conduct a hypothesis driven genetic association in DNA repair and in inflammation/immune function related genes with glioma risk using functional genomic and bioinformatic tools to interrogate available databases. (SA2): Evaluate gene-gene (G-G) and gene- environmental (G-E) interactions with strong biologic relevance to identify G-G and G-E interactions for glioma risk using machine-learning tools (MDR, FITF, and CART) in these exploratory analyses. There are no existing glioma case-control studies with sufficient numbers of biological samples and common epidemiologic data to conduct a comprehensive validation and replication study, or to address the issues of tumor heterogeneity as we will in this study.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Gliomas are a rare and understudied disease that is rapidly fatal. The proposed case-control study of primary malignant glioma (Gliogene Consortium) includes 13-centers, and will address the role of genetic susceptibility in sporadic cases. It will identify common genetic variants contributing to the risk of glioma from a genome wide association study.

"Predictive Modeling with Clinical and Genomic Data in COPD Candidate: Dr. Peter Castaldi is a physician completing a period of F32-funded support. On July 1st, 2009 he will begin a full-time position at Tufts Medical Center and the Institute for Clinical Research and Health Policy Studies (ICRHPS). This position involves a 25% clinical commitment. His principal research interests are the genetic epidemiology of COPD and the translation of genomic discoveries into clinical practice and public health. His particular interests are genetic meta-analysis, gene-environment interaction, and predictive modeling with regression-based and machine-learning methods.  His immediate goals are 1.) to identify novel genetic associations with COPD susceptibility and COPD- related phenotypes through the combined analysis of multiple genome-wide association (GWA) studies, 2.) to identify epistatic and gene-by-smoking interactions, and 3.) to develop accurate predictive models in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) using clinical and genomic information. His long-term goal is to be an independent investigator with expertise in bioinformatics. His vision for achieving this goal involves developing expertise in bioinformatics so as to be able to participate in and eventually lead multidisciplinary teams in the application of computational methods to genomic datasets in order to answer important clinical questions that will improve the care of patients and population health.    Environment: Dr. Castaldi will receive training in a rich, interdisciplinary environment. His principal mentor, Dr. Joseph Lau, is the head of the Center for Clinical Evidence Synthesis in the ICRHPS, and he is a worldwide leader in the field of meta-analysis and evidence synthesis. At Tufts, in addition to regular meetings with Dr. Lau, Peter will receive training in genetic evidence synthesis from leaders in the field, including Drs. John Ioannidis and Tom Trikalinos. The co-mentor of this application, Dr. Edwin Silverman, is a leading researcher in COPD genetics at the Channing Laboratory. At the Channing Laboratory, Peter will receive excellent training in respiratory genetics and genetic epidemiology, and he will have resources to state of the art high-throughput genotyping, next-generation sequencing technologies, and bioinformatics support. Dr. Castaldi will also continue his collaboration with Dr. Donna Slonim in the Tufts Computer Science Department, who will provide assistance with application of computational algorithms to genomic data and guidance as Dr. Castaldi continues to build a practical and theoretical foundation in Bioinformatics.    Research: COPD is a major cause of morbidity and mortality that is of increasing public health importance. While the principal risk factor for COPD, smoking, is well-established, there is variable susceptibility in the general population to the lung damage caused by cigarette smoke. There is strong evidence supporting a genetic component to COPD susceptibility. Understanding how genes and environment interact to produce clinical COPD will allow for more accurate diagnostic tools and open new avenues of investigation for the development of COPD therapies. We propose to 1.) identify novel genetic associations with COPD susceptibility and 4 COPD-related phenotypes by performing meta-analysis on patient-level data from 4 large COPD GWA studies, 2.) identify gene-by-smoking and gene-gene interactions, and 3.) develop predictive models for COPD susceptibility and COPD-related phenotypes. In order to maximize the information obtained from genomic data, we will combine data from multiple studies (the National Emphysema Treatment Trial Genetics Ancillary Study, the Norway Case-Control Study, COPDGene, and ECLIPSE - total sample size=7,962) to increase power and employ regression-based and machine-learning methods to identify complex patterns of interaction in genotype data. Our study is designed to both explore and subsequently rigorously validate discovered main effect and interaction associations. Using predictive models, we will quantify the incremental predictive benefit of including genetic main effects and genetic interaction data to traditional clinical variables.    Relevance: The proposed work will identify new genes associated with COPD and place them in a multivariate context so as to develop a better understanding of how genetic differences and environmental exposures contribute to the development of COPD. The models generated by this work will facilitate the translation of genomic discoveries to clinical practice and public health, in keeping with the NHLBI's mission to promote the prevention and treatment of heart, lung, and blood diseases and enhance the health of all individuals so that they can live longer and more fulfilling lives.

"Genetic predictors of anti-TNF treatment response and infections in IBD     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) affect over 1.4 million Americans. Over the past 15 years, considerable progress has been made in the therapy of CD and UC with monoclonal antibodies against tumor necrosis factor ¿ (anti-TNF) representing the most significant therapeutic breakthrough. However, many patients fail to respond adequately. Recent genome wide associations studies (GWAS) have significantly increased our understanding of the pathogenesis of CD and UC. The role of these genetic variants in predicting response to anti-TNF therapy is yet to be defined adequately. In addition, significant safety concerns remain with the use of these agents with serious infections occurring in up to 10% of patients. There is a strong genetic component to susceptibility to infections, in particular involving polymorphisms in innate immunity. Given the key role of innate immunity in IBD pathogenesis, whether such shared polymorphisms also influence risk of infections on anti-TNF therapy has not been examined previously. Thus, the development of tools to define likelihood of treatment response and infections are a key unmet need in the field. Our overarching objective is to identify clinical and genetic predictors of both short-term and long-term response as well as infectious complications of anti-TNF therapy. To achieve these aims, we will utilize the complementary strengths of two large cohorts - a prospective registry cohort of over 1200 patients with CD or UC, and a novel EMR-based cohort of over 11,000 patients with CD or UC linked to a biospecimen repository. This proposal utilizes the mentorship and significant expertise in key areas including analytical genetics, translational immunology, and bioinformatics and allows the candidate to develop fundamental skills in these novel content areas and research methods. The access to expertise at the NIH-funded center Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside, the Center for Study of Inflammatory Bowel Disease, and the Broad Institute is a key strength of this application. This career development award will be critical in providing training in bioinformatics and genetic epidemiology, thus contributing to the candidate's long-term goal of establishing an independent IBD research career with focus on defining at-risk cohorts and personalizing therapy. The training component of the award includes graduate-level courses in the relevant content areas in genetic epidemiology, and bioinformatics at the Harvard Medical School, School of Public Health, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The candidate will continue to actively engage with an established group of multidisciplinary researchers who have demonstrated the utility of the EMR-based approach to accurately define autoimmune diseases, link it to biospecimen collection, and use it successfully for genotyping-phenotype research. This will help foster collaborative development of future proposals as the work proposed in this application has the potential for applicability in other cohorts.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The novel information gained from this study regarding genetic predictors of treatment response and infectious complications has the potential to transform clinical practice by leading to clinical trials focused on selected cohorts of patients most likely to respond to therapies with low risk of adverse events, thus preventing unnecessary exposure to potentially toxic therapies with low likelihood of benefit. Such work is a step toward developing personalized medicine approaches to tailor therapy based on likelihood of benefit and risk. The methodology developed here will also have applications in other EMR-based cohorts to investigate novel therapeutic agents and disease outcomes.                    The novel information gained from this study regarding genetic predictors of treatment response and infectious complications has the potential to transform clinical practice by leading to clinical trials focused on selected cohorts of patients most likely to respond to therapies with low risk of adverse events, thus preventing unnecessary exposure to potentially toxic therapies with low likelihood of benefit.

"Genome-Wide Association Analysis of Bladder Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       This proposal builds on a rich resource of bladder cancer (BC) cases and controls derived from two ongoing BC studies at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, and from two large independent U.S. BC studies - the New England BC Study and the New Hampshire BC Study. The goal is to identify genetic loci that predispose individuals to BC through a genome-wide scanning approach. There are five specific aims. Aim 1 is to first perform genome-wide, high-density SNP genotyping using the Illumina HumanHap550 SNP platform on 800 cases and 800 controls from M.D. Anderson, with a target of candidate SNPs of about 28,000; followed by an internal validation to narrow down candidate SNPs to about 1,536 using additional 800 pairs of cases and controls. Illumina's Custom Infinium array will be the genotyping format. In this aim, in addition to individual SNP analysis, we will also implement haplotype-based analyses and pathway aggregation analysis to identify additional genetic loci that might have been overlooked using individual SNP analysis. Aim 2 is the first external validation of the 1,536 SNPs from Aim 1 using 1,000 pairs of cases and controls from the New England BC Study. Illumina's GoldenGate assay will be the genotyping format. After this stage, the candidate SNPs will be narrowed down to about 100. Aim 3 is the second independent external validation using 750 pairs of cases and controls form the New Hampshire BC Study. In this aim, the 100 top candidate SNPs passed from Aims 1 and 2 plus additional functional SNPs in genes containing these SNPs will be genotyped. GoldenGate assay will be used for this aim. Aim 4 is to perform fine mapping studies in the flanking regions of each of the top 25 SNP loci confirmed in Aim 3 to identify causative loci. This will utilize all 6,700 cases and controls. An average of 15 additional SNPs (tagging SNPs and functional SNPs) per gene is expected. Aim 5 is to apply novel machine-learning tools to identify any gene-environment and gene-gene interactions greatly influencing risk for BC in all the 6700 subjects. These analyses will be utilized to examine SNP main effect and develop and validate algorithms that will identify individuals at highest risk for BC, given their personal exposure patterns and their genetic risk profiles. This proposal applies state of art technology to perform a multistage, genome-wide SNP analysis in three largest, well-characterized U.S. population of BC cases and controls, and incorporates complete epidemiologic data and rich and unique functional data. In addition, results from this study will be provided to the International Consortium of BC Case Control Studies for future validation. The ability to identify genetically susceptible, high-risk subgroups that would benefit from intensive screening and/or chemopreventive interventions is of immense clinical and public health benefit. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Bladder cancer (BC) is a disease mainly caused by smoking and occupational exposure. However, only a small percentage of exposed individuals develop BC. Inherited host genetic factors may play an important role in determining an individual's susceptibility to BC. This proposal builds on three largest well-characterized U.S. populations of BC cases and controls - the M. D. Anderson BC study, the New England BC Study and the New Hampshire BC Study. A total of 6700 cases and controls will be used. The goal is to identify genetic loci that predispose individuals to BC through a non-biased, discovery- driven, genome-wide scanning approach and to incorporate complete epidemiologic data and rich and unique functional data. About 550,000 genetic variations of human genome will be initially screened in an M.D. Anderson population consisting of an equal number of BC cases and normal controls. About 28,000 top candidate variations that are potentially associated with increased BC risk will be first narrowed down and internally replicated in a second M.D. Anderson population, and then be validated in the other two independent U.S. BC populations. Finally, the causative genetic loci that predispose individuals to BC will be mapped. This study is significant because by identifying BC susceptibility loci, it will shed light into the biological mechanisms of BC etiology. Furthermore, it may facilitate identifying high-risk subgroups of individuals for BC, given their genetic makeup and environmental exposures. The ability to identify high-risk subgroups of individuals for BC will provide immense public health benefit for those high- risk people who may be subjected to close surveillance and chemoprevention.          n/a",Genome-Wide Association Analysis of Bladder Cancer,8242887,U01CA127615,"['Adopted', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Bladder', 'Cancer Center', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Case Series', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Cycle Regulation', 'Chemoprevention', 'Chemopreventive Agent', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Custom', 'Cytogenetics', 'DNA', 'DNA Repair', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dietary Practices', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Haplotypes', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Inherited', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Length', 'Light', 'Location', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder', 'Maps', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutagens', 'New England', 'New Hampshire', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Occupational Exposure', 'One-Step dentin bonding system', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Penetrance', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Plasma Cells', 'Play', 'Polymorphism Analysis', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Public Health', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Resources', 'Review Literature', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Serum', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Smoking', 'Specimen', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Subgroup', 'Suspension substance', 'Suspensions', 'TNFRSF5 gene', 'Technology', 'University of Texas M D Anderson Cancer Center', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'aggregation pathway', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'carcinogenesis', 'case control', 'college', 'computer based statistical methods', 'cost', 'density', 'design', 'epidemiologic data', 'follow-up', 'gene interaction', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'high risk', 'medical specialties', 'novel', 'parent grant', 'repository', 'telomere', 'tool']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,U01,2012,769079,0.005077224210517462
"Bioinformatics Approaches to Visual Disease Genetics     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is now recognized that many visual diseases are influenced by complex interactions between multiple different genetic variants. As a result, our ability to predict susceptibility to visual diseases will depend critically on the computational, mathematical and statistical modeling methods and software that are available for making sense of high-dimensional genetic data. We propose here a bioinformatics research project to develop network modeling approaches for identifying combinations of genetic biomarkers associated with visual disease endpoints. Our working hypothesis is that a systems-based bioinformatics approach using network modeling will play a very important role in confronting the complexity of the relationship between genomic variation and visual diseases. We will first develop and evaluate modeling methods to infer large-scale genetic interaction networks from genome-wide association studies (AIM 1). We will then apply the modeling methods developed in AIM 1 to the inference of genetic interaction networks from genome-wide association data in subjects with and without visual diseases (AIM 2). Next, we will utilize the inferred genetic interaction networks to guide the development of predictive genetic models of visual diseases (AIM 3). Finally, all network modeling methods will be released to the vision research community as part of a popular user-friendly, freely available and open-source software package (AIM 4). We anticipate that the network modeling methods and software developed and distributed as part of this project will play an important role in the development of the genetic tests that will be necessary to identify those at risk for visual diseases.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The network modeling methods and software developed and distributed as part of this bioinformatics research project will play an important role in the development of the genetic tests that will be necessary to identify those at risk for common diseases such as glaucoma and age-related macular degeneration.                  The network modeling methods and software developed and distributed as part of this bioinformatics research project will play an important role in the development of the genetic tests that will be necessary to identify those at risk for common diseases such as glaucoma and age-related macular degeneration.                ",Bioinformatics Approaches to Visual Disease Genetics,8264613,R01EY022300,"['Age related macular degeneration', 'Algorithms', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Entropy', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Models', 'Genetic Structures', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Glaucoma', 'Goals', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Network-based', 'Ontology', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Predisposition', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Simulate', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Statistical Models', 'System', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Vision research', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'database of Genotypes and Phenotypes', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'mathematical model', 'network models', 'open source', 'predictive modeling', 'protein protein interaction', 'software development', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NEI,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2012,322000,0.0052824700007220214
"Molecular Genetic Investigation of Pediatric Myelodysplastic Syndrome     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pediatric Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS) is a heterogeneous group of clonal stem cell disorders characterized by varying degrees of cytopenias, and ineffective and dysplastic hematopoiesis. MDS can be classified as primary de novo MDS with no apparent underlying cause and secondary MDS following congenital or acquired bone marrow failure (BMF) disorders or cytotoxic therapies. Little is known about initiating events leading to pediatric MDS. As a result, no targeted therapies exist and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation remains the only therapeutic option.  The heterogeneous clinical and laboratory presentation and limited availability of clinically well-annotated patient samples and in vivo models have posed significant obstacles to study the disease and to identify genetic alterations unique to pediatric MDS. Therefore pediatric MDS remains largely classified by morphologic and cytogenetic criteria that provide few clues as to the molecular basis. Over the last 18 months, we have developed the first nationwide comprehensive Pediatric MDS and BMF Disorder Patient Registry and Tissue Repository now involving 3 institutions and continuing to grow. The registry has collected samples from > 60 individual patients in addition to biological material from 3 unique kindreds with pediatric MDS. These samples form the basis for our first genomic sequencing analysis to gather preliminary data for future experiments and represent the power of this registry to elucidate pathogenic mutations associated with MDS.  Our unique team of investigators will exploit the registry and catalyze our efforts to determine the fundamental underpinnings of pediatric MDS. The team includes David Williams (clinical/translational hematology), Mark Fleming (pediatric hematopathology /hematological genetics), Benjamin Ebert (high throughput genomic technologies in adult MDS) and Kyriacos Markinanos (genetic linkage analysis). We will undertake preliminary studies to demonstrate feasibility, and generate genomic data that will provide the basis for future hypothesis-driven translational and clinical research studies on a national level.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The underlying genetics and pathophysiology of pediatric MDS is poorly understood. By exploiting several well-characterized families with inherited MDS, we will aim to identify the genetic basis for this disorder.

"Genetic Factors in Keratoconus    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this grant is to identify susceptibility genes involved in the pathogenesis of keratoconus (KC). We will achieve our goal by: 1) refining criteria for the early detection of KC using videokeratography and wavefront Zernike variables; 2) comprehensively testing genes under newly identified linkage peaks generated through genome wide linkage scans of KC families, and performing comprehensive positional candidate gene association studies; and 3) characterizing specific genetic variants that predispose an individual to developing KC. We will study a cohort comprising: normal controls, patients with 'early' KC, KC 'suspect', and KC relatives with videokeratography and aberrometry in order to determine the best combination of variables that discriminate KC 'suspects' from normals. Study subjects will be followed longitudinally to determine which combination of variables is predictive of progression to KC, and thus define subclinical KC (Aim 1). After genome-wide linkage scan of multiplex KC families, we identified regions with significant or suggestive linkage on chromosomes 4, 5, 9, 11, 12, and 14, confirmed by subsequent fine mapping studies. To follow-up these positive linkage findings, we will conduct a comprehensive positional candidate gene association study by testing all genes in these regions with tagSNPs. Any positive association results will be tested in an independent sample for confirmation (Aim 2). Additionally, using newly identified criteria for defining subclinical markers for KC (combination of videokeratography and aberrometry), we will refine our linkage analysis on families with KC in an attempt identify new linkage peaks which may encompass new potential candidate genes for study. Genes identified by both genetic association studies and expression studies published in the literature to date will be prioritized for further study to identify specific genetic variants that contribute to the susceptibility of KC (Aim 3).  Refining criteria for early detection of KC will provide the tools to prevent many patients from under- going unnecessary surgery and developing post-lasik ectasia, a significant public health issue. It will also facilitate identification of susceptibility genes for KC, which may provide an understanding of the mechanisms contributing to corneal thinning in KC.

"Informatic profiling of clinically relevant mutation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our group focuses on genetic variants that disrupt molecular functions that cause human disease. In this renewal R01 application, we propose to begin the process of realizing our long-term goals, and to expand our original scope of research to include the challenge of understanding genetic disease mutations and polymorphisms that affect gene expression regulation in noncoding regions. Additionally, we have formed collaborations with genetic data managers and will apply these methods to aid in their research and identify new testable hypotheses. We will do this in three aims. First, we will integrate predictions of protein-disease associations with mutation predictions to develop a new quantitative model of genotype and phenotype. Second, we will integrate each of these together to develop a systems level, molecular function genome annotator with functionality to import into the genome databases. Finally, we will continue to build new methods for characterization of mutations using sequence, function and structure and begin testing our published hypotheses. Each of these aims will include collaboration with the maintainers of genetic datasets to better understand their underlying molecular effects.

"Multivariate Pattern Analysis Methods for Neuroimaging Genetics Studies    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Common mental disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia are largely heritable with complex genetic underpinnings. Large-scale genome-wide association studies that contrast DNA sequence data from patients and controls have recently identified novel genetic risk variants for these disorders. Nevertheless, the processes through which genotype increases risk are yet to be fully characterized.  Neuroimaging offers a richer picture of the underlying disease processes than a clinical diagnosis. Thus the joint analysis of neuroimaging and genetics data promises to advance our understanding of these processes. Today, neuroimaging genetics studies however face important challenges that obstruct progress: small sample sizes, modest effect sizes, and the extreme dimensionality of the data limit statistical power and thus our ability to explore the complex and subtle associations between genes, neuroanatomy and clinical decline. Currently, the prevalent approach in neuroimaging genetics is to concentrate the analysis on a small number of anatomic regions of interest and/or candidate genes and often ignore a large portion of the data. The core goal of the proposed project is to develop computational tools that will take full advantage of the richness in the datasets and facilitate the exploration of the multifaceted associations between genotype, neuroimaging measurements and clinical phenotype. The proposed project will use advanced multivariate pattern analysis methods such as support vector machines to compute image-based and genetic scores that reflect pathology. We will validate the tools based on their association with classical biomarkers of disease. Finally, we will develop a model that uses both imaging and genotype data to predict future clinical outcome. We expect these tools will enable progress along three directions relevant to complex mental disorders, e.g. late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD): (1) confirming and characterizing risk genes, (2) identifying disease-specific anatomical alterations in healthy individuals, and (3) early diagnosis and prognosis. The project will (1) use three already-collected large-scale datasets to apply the developed tools to AD, (2) build on cutting-edge image processing algorithms that we have been developing, and (3) allow the candidate to receive further training in neuroanatomy, mental disorders and genetics, forming the foundation for his future career as an independent researcher.       n/a",Multivariate Pattern Analysis Methods for Neuroimaging Genetics Studies,8308347,K25EB013649,"['Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Anatomy', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Face', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Research', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Late Onset Alzheimer Disease', 'Lead', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Schizophrenia', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Training', 'Variant', 'base', 'career', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical phenotype', 'computerized tools', 'data modeling', 'disorder risk', 'entorhinal cortex', 'genetic risk factor', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'high risk', 'image processing', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'mild neurocognitive impairment', 'molecular pathology', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'pre-clinical', 'programs', 'tool']",NIBIB,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K25,2012,175392,-0.018311287788248046
"Methods for high-resolution analysis of genetic effects on gene expression    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Summary Gene expression is a fundamental function of any cell. It is the main mechanism by which information is transmitted from the nucleus to the rest of the cell and eventually to other cells and the body of the organism. Genetic variation in components of the transcriptional machinery and signals that regulate gene function generates variation in transcriptional response and consequently variation in phenotypes. It has become apparent that many of the common genetic signals associated with disease are found away from the DNA sequence that encodes for protein sequence and is likely to be functioning in regulating gene expression. In this project we propose to develop methodologies that will explore the consequences of genetic variation in gene expression. There are three main goals of this project. First we will explore and develop methodologies to mine information from experiments that perform deep sequencing of the human transcriptome. The new sequencing technologies are providing us with unprecedented resolution into the transcriptome but are also raising challenges in the computational and biological models to use to interpret such large amounts of data. Secondly, we will use high-resolution genetic data to develop and use methodologies to dissect the fine structure of genetic variants that affect regulation of gene expression. Finally, we will implement and test models to infer the higher-order interactions of genome function so as to dig deeply into the biological consequences of genetic variants and how the signal is transmitted from the DNA sequence to higher levels of cell and body function. Our goals is to develop methodologies that will significantly improve our insight to the variability in human populations and assist in interpreting predisposition to genetic diseases.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:    Project narrative The proposed project aims at the development of statistical methods for the interpretation and study of the impact of genetic variants in cell function.

"Whole-Genome Prediction of Type-2 Diabetes Susceptibility in Various Populations     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The applicant's career goal is to become a productive independent investigator in the area of statistical genetics, particularly in the area of genomic-based prediction of type-2 diabetes (T2D) risk. To meet this goal, the applicant proposes a career development plan that includes hands- on and didactic training in statistical learning as applied to quantitative genetics, categorical and case-control data analysis, informatics as applied to high dimensional genetic data, and the biology and genetics of T2D. A highly accomplished and diverse set of investigators with proven track records of successful mentoring will oversee the applicant's career development. The research component of this project seeks to improve our ability to use genetic information to predict an individual's risk of developing T2D Publically available genetic and phenotypic data from sources such as dbGaP (The database of Phenotypes and Genotypes) will be used to develop and test various models for prediction of T2D risk among three racial/ethnic groups. This project will capitalize on newly developed statistical methods that are able to incorporate information from tens of thousands of genetic markers at once, which represent a major advance over current methods that typically take fewer than 100 markers into account. The aims of the study are: 1) To test the hypothesis, in different populations, that individualized whole-genome prediction of T2D (along with standard covariates of sex, age, and BMI) will offer major improvements over current genetics-based prediction models, and will offer equal or greater accuracy than prediction based on family history; 2) To impute additional genetic markers to determine whether prediction can be improved, and to identify the subset of markers that is most useful in predicting T2D; 3) To develop prediction models for T2D risk given a certain body mass index (BMI), by including as predictors the interaction of BMI and genotypes. This project will greatly enhance our ability to predict an individual's susceptibility to T2D within various populations, leading to earlier and targeted prevention strategies, will increase our understanding of the genetic basis of T2D, and will provide critical training for Dr. Klimentidis' development as an independent scientist.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Genetic factors are known to play a substantial role in the etiology of type-2 diabetes (T2D), which is a growing health challenge facing developed and developing countries. In this application, we propose to use state-of-the-art statistical methods that enable us to account for thousands of genetic variants simultaneously, in order to build and test predictive models for T2D susceptibility among individuals of European, Mexican, and African descent. This project has the potential to greatly improve prediction of T2D susceptibility in several ethnic groups, provide a better understanding of the specific genetic factors that play a role in T2D susceptibility, and ultimately bring us closer to the era of personalized medicine in which improved prediction ability results in earlier patient-oriented prevention and treatment.              Genetic factors are known to play a substantial role in the etiology of type-2 diabetes (T2D), which is a growing health challenge facing developed and developing countries.

"Genome Wide Association Study of Head and Neck Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Head and neck cancers have well-documented associations with tobacco and alcohol exposure, but the disease develops in only a small fraction of users, which implies an important role for genetic susceptibility. Therefore, head and neck cancers are an excellent model for studying genetic susceptibility to environmental carcinogens. The primary goal of this R01 application is to perform a comprehensive two-stage, high-density, genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis of head and neck cancer cases and corresponding frequency matched controls to identify novel genetic risk factors for head and neck cancer. This proposal builds upon a well-annotated existing DNA repository of cases and controls. One of the unique features of our study is the availability of DNA repair assay data on most of the cases and controls in this study, which will allow us to conduct genotype/phenotype analyses. We also have access to genome-wide association data from 1200 white control subjects from the same source population. In aim 1, we will perform genotyping on 1000 randomly selected head and neck cancer cases and 500 controls using a 370K Illumina Infinium HapMap HumanCNV370-Duo SNP Chip. We will perform association analyses (1000 cases and 1700 controls) in the first stage using outcome variable as case-control status as well as DNA repair capacity assay data. Our second aim is to perform second-stage analysis of the SNPs selected in stage 1 using 900 additional cases and corresponding controls from the same source and from UCLA. We will use efficient joint analysis of cases and controls from the first and second aims, for a total of 1900 cases and 2600 controls. Finally, in aim 3, we will apply novel statistical tools such as the latent variable approach with Tukey's one-degree-of-freedom test and support vector machines to identify gene-gene and gene-environment (using environmental factors such as smoking and alcohol use) interactions that contribute to the risk of head and neck cancer. We are an experienced investigative team proposing a comprehensive analysis that incorporates epidemiological, behavioral, and functional data.

"Machine Learning Prediction of Cancer Susceptibility    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Susceptibility to sporadic forms of cancer is determined by numerous genetic factors that interact in a nonlinear manner in the context of an individual's age and environmental exposure. This complex genetic architecture has important implications for the use of genome-wide association studies for identifying susceptibility genes. The assumption of a simple architecture supports a strategy of testing each single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) individually using traditional univariate statistics followed by a correction for multiple tests. However, a complex genetic architecture that is characteristic of most types of cancer requires analytical methods that specifically model combinations of SNPs and environmental exposures. While new and novel methods are available for modeling interactions, exhaustive testing of all combinations of SNPs is not feasible on a genome- wide scale because the number of comparisons is effectively infinite. Thus, it is critical that we develop intelligent strategies for selecting subsets of SNPs prior to combinatorial modeling. The objective of this renewal application is to continue the development of a research strategy for the detection, characterization, and interpretation of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions in genome-wide association studies of bladder cancer susceptibility. To accomplish this objective, we will continue developing and evaluating modifications and extensions to the ReliefF family of algorithms for selecting or filtering subsets of single- nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) analysis of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions (AIM 1). We will continue developing and evaluating a stochastic wrapper or search strategy for MDR analysis of interactions that utilizes ReliefF values as a heuristic (AIM 2). We will continue to make available ReliefF algorithms as part of our open-source MDR software package (AIM 3). Finally, we will apply the best ReliefF-MDR analysis strategies to the detection, characterization, and interpretation of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions in large genome-wide association studies of bladder cancer susceptibility (AIM 4). We anticipate the proposed machine learning methods will provide powerful new approaches for identifying genetic variations that are predictive of cancer susceptibility.              PROJECT NARRATIVE The technology to measure information about the human genome is advancing at a rapid pace. Despite these advance, the computational methods for analyzing the data have not kept pace. We will develop new computer algorithms and software that can be used to identify genetic biomarkers of common human diseases.

"Microbial Diversity and Genetic Characterization of Cariogenic Biofilms    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed studies are anticipated to yield important new information as to the presence of specific genetic determinants found in Streptococcus mutans, a microbe strongly associated with a severe dental caries in affecting young children called severe early childhood caries or S-ECC. The long-term benefit of such information should lead researchers toward devising both diagnostic and preventive strategies against dental though better understanding its microbial causation. Using a powerful technique of suppressive subtraction DNA hybridization, the first specific aim is to test the hypothesis that strains of S. mutans found in S-ECC children differ in genetic composition compared to strains found in caries-free (CF) children. Unique genetic loci that are specific to S-ECC strains will be identified and characterized. Some of these genetic loci will prove informative as biomarkers for health or disease. Using the power of multiple test analyses derived artificial intelligence programming; biomarkers will be used as the basis for a modeling algorithm capable of classifying strains of S. mutans in one of two categories (S-ECC or CF). The second aim of this study is to survey strains of S. mutans associated with either S-ECC or CF status for known or suspected genetic elements thought to influence the pathogenesis or virulence of S. mutans. The third aim is to survey a larger, racial/ethnical diverse population of S-ECC or CF children for the presence or absence of the biomarkers identified in the first two aims. It is anticipated that this research will yield genetic markers for disease capable of providing clinicians with a diagnostic test that can assess risk for developing S-ECC. 7.           n/a",Microbial Diversity and Genetic Characterization of Cariogenic Biofilms,8004929,R01DE013937,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological Markers', 'Categories', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Coupling', 'DNA', 'Dental', 'Dental caries', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Dot Immunoblotting', 'Effectiveness', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomic Islands', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'Hispanics', 'Infant', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Microbe', 'Microbial Biofilms', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mothers', 'Pathogenesis', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevention strategy', 'Process', 'Programmed Learning', 'Public Health', 'Pulsed-Field Gel Electrophoresis', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'SHH gene', 'Series', 'Severity of illness', 'Streptococcus mutans', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Virulence', 'Virulence Factors', 'base', 'early childhood', 'experience', 'genetic element', 'microbial', 'programs', 'research study', 'tool']",NIDCR,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R01,2011,353329,0.015845786354051677
"Assessment of Gene Effects on the Brain and Disease Risk through Machine Learning    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Several neuroimaging modalities such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are becoming increasingly important for diagnostic classification, prognostic evaluation and tracking treatment response in patients with brain disorders. They provide detailed, quantitative information about brain structure and function, and aspects of ongoing disease processes. Measures derived from these neuroimaging modalities have been studied through automated algorithms as potential predictors of disease outcomes. This proposal aims to introduce and evaluate new computerized algorithms, based on the field of machine learning that would incorporate not only brain imaging measures, but also biochemical and genetic information to create more powerful predictions of diagnostic and prognostic outcomes. Such novel, automated, multimodal predictors, we propose, may have important applications in future clinical decision making and clinical trial design. Brain imaging offers new quantitative measures that may be closer than cognitive assessments to the underlying biological mechanisms that lead to disease. By studying the associations of genetic factors with phenotypes based on cutting edge imaging techniques such as diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), we plan to examine mechanistically meaningful genetic contributions to brain disorders. The rapidly expanding field of neuroimaging genetics will provide the nexus for the applicant's intensive training in the world-class imaging and genetics programs at the UCLA School of Medicine. This proposal will introduce new automated algorithms for gene discovery and risk prediction into the field of neuroimaging genetics. Algorithms that consider multiple genetic variants jointly, we propose, are likely to (1) more powerfully detect new gene effects on brain images, and (2) identify profiles of candidate genetic variants to assist prediction of an individual's brain integrity and risk for disease.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Neuropsychiatric disorders are the leading causes of disability across the world.

"Optimizing Genetic Testing for Deafness for Clinical Diagnostics     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  In this goal-driven proposal, submitted in response to Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) Number PAR-11-003, we will make comprehensive genetic testing for deafness available to clinicians for under $500 per person. The driving force behind this initiative is the frequency of hearing impairment. As the most common sensory impairment, it is diagnosed in 1 of every 500 newborns and 50% of octogenarians (Morton Ann N Y Acad Sci 1991). With 57 genes implicated in nonsyndromic hearing loss (NSHL), it is also an extremely heterogeneous trait and presents a tremendous challenge to diagnosis.  Current strategies for genetic testing for deafness are inadequate. For most, only a minority of genes is included, with selection criteria typically reflecting: 1) high prevalence as a cause of deafness (i.e. GJB2); 2) association with another recognizable feature (i.e. SLC26A4 and enlarged vestibular aqueduct); or 3) a recognizable audioprofile (i.e. low frequency hearing loss as seen with WFS1) (Hilgert et al Mut Res 2009).  The recent advent of powerful DNA target enrichment and sequencing technologies, however, makes it possible to provide comprehensive genetic testing for deafness that is efficient and cost-effective. We have shown that it is possible to analyze all deafness genes simultaneously on a single platform (called OtoSCOPE) (Shearer et al PNAS 2010). Related to this endeavor, we have also validated AudioGene as a phenotypic tool that uses patient audiograms to predict the genetic cause of ADNSHL (Hildebrand et al Genet Med 2008; Hildebrand et al Laryngoscope 2009).  Building on these findings, in this proposal we will complete two specific aims.  Specific Aim 1: To provide comprehensive, high-throughput, low-cost DNA sequence generation and analysis for deafness genetic testing  Goal 1: Comprehensive, high-throughput, low-cost DNA sequence analysis for genetic testing for deafness is possible at sensitivities and specificities comparable to Sanger sequencing by using targeted sequence enrichment followed by massively parallel sequencing.  Specific Aim 2: To optimize both machine learning-based audioprofiling of audiometric data and phenotypic filtering of genotypic data by expanding and improving the platform we have developed called AudioGene  Goal 2: As a phenome tool, a machine-learning software system trained on an extensive set of audiometric data can be used to predict and to eliminate specific genes or gene variants as causes of deafness based on audiometric data.  Achieving these specific aims will change the clinical evaluation of deaf and hard-of-hearing persons by making genetic testing the most important diagnostic test after a history, physical examination and audiological assessment.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  In this goal-driven proposal, submitted in response to Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) Number PAR-11-003, we will make comprehensive genetic testing for deafness available to clinicians for under $500 per person.

"DEVELOPING STRATEGIES FOR JOINT GENE-ENVIRONMENT ANALYSIS    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A key challenge for genetic analysis today is to account for the bulk of the phenotypic variance in complex traits that is attributable to genetic factors, but remains unexplained after multiple well-powered GWAS (Goldstein 2009; Hirschhorn 2009; Kraft and Hunter 2009). Many believe that systematically testing datasets for joint gene-environment effects (GxE) and gene-gene (GxG) effects will be essential in order to understand the genetics of complex phenotypes. However, the new era of high throughput, high-density genomic data (genotypes and sequencing) has given rise to serious computational and statistical challenges for the analysis of joint effects. The goal of this project is to develop effective strategies for the statistical analysis of joint-gene environment effects. The specific aims are to (1) identify strengths and weaknesses of multiple analytic approaches to joint GxE effects, and (2) develop new methods for coordinated meta-analysis. To accomplish Aim 1, we will systematically examine and compare traditional (e.g. regression based) and modern (e.g. partitioning, machine learning, information theoretic) analysis methods for case-control and quantitative phenotypes. The primary product will be specific guidance as to the conditions under which each method performs well. To accomplish Aim 2, we will extend recent joint-effects methods to a meta-analytic framework and develop improvements to currently used methods. For both aims, we will also analyze real data related to smoking, thereby improving our understanding of genetic and environmental contributors to smoking and addiction risk. These analyses of real data will be guided by bioinformatics-based variant prioritization. This study therefore will provide both guidance and tools needed to move the field of joint effects analysis forward. As a result, it will ultimately have a significant impact on our ability to account for the currently unexplained genetic contribution to phenotypic variance for complex traits.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Many diseases that greatly impact public health (such as heart disease, diabetes, and nicotine addiction) are the result of a complex interplay between genes and environmental factors. The purpose of this grant is to improve data analysis strategies (applicable to a wide variety of diseases) for the detection of joint effects of genes and environment. We will apply these methods to analyze existing data on smokers to improve our understanding of gene-environment effects on nicotine addiction.              Many diseases that greatly impact public health (such as heart disease, diabetes, and nicotine addiction) are the result of a complex interplay between genes and environmental factors.

"Information Explorer: a Suite of Tools for Cross-study Genetic Loci Discovery    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Databases such as dbGaP represent extremely valuable resources of data that have been assembled across multiple cohorts. The increasing development of cost-effective high-throughput genotyping and sequencing technologies are resulting in vast amounts of genetic data. While such databases were formed in order to archive and distribute the results of previously performed genetic association analyses, an increasing number of studies have provided de-identified individual-level genotypic and phenotypic data that are made available to outside researchers who have obtained the appropriate authorization. While the amount of data made available has increased dramatically in recent years, relatively little has been done in order to facilitate phenotype harmonization across studies. Many genetic epidemiologic studies of cardiovascular disease have multiple variables related to any given phenotype, resulting from different definitions and multiple measurements or subsets of data. A researcher searching such databases for the availability of phenotype and genotype combinations is confronted with a veritable mountain of variables to sift through. This often requires visiting multiple websites to gain additional information about variables that are listed on databases, and examination of data distributions to assess similarities across cohorts. While the naming strategy for genetic variants is largely standardized across studies (e.g. ""rs"" numbers for single nucleotide polymorphisms or SNPs), this is often not the case for phenotype variables. For a given study, there are often numerous versions of phenotypic variables. Researchers currently have to analyze and compare increasingly larger numbers of variables that have varying degrees of documentation associated with them to obtain the desired information. This is a time-consuming process that may still miss the most appropriate variables. Moreover, every researcher that wants to compare the same datasets often needs to start from scratch since there are no tools to share the phenotype comparison results. The availability of informatic tools to make phenotype mapping more efficient and improve its accuracy, along with intuitive phenotype query tools, would provide a major resource for researchers utilizing these databases. The tools we are proposing would allow researchers to (1) Quickly obtain the information needed to assess whether a specific study will be useful for the hypothesis of interest; (2) Exclude variables that do not meet research criteria; (3) Ascertain which studies have combinations of phenotype and genetic information of interest; and (4) More easily expand research questions beyond the most basic main-effects to more complex analyses such as gene-by-environment interactions and multivariate tests incorporating multiple phenotypes. The increased utility will also enable larger meta-analyses to be performed, as researchers will be able to more quickly hone in on outcomes, exclusionary variables and covariates of interest, leading to increased statistical power to detect genetic associations.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: While the amount of genomic data (e.g., GWAS, sequencing, etc.) made available has increased dramatically in recent years, relatively little has been done in order to facilitate phenotype harmonization across studies.

"Genome-Transcription-Phenome-Wide Association: a new paradigm for association stu DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many complex disease syndromes consist of a large number of highly related, rather than independent, clinical phenotypes. Differences between these syndromes involve the complex interplay of a large number of genomic variations that perturb the function of disease-related genes in the context of a regulatory network, rather than individually. Thus unraveling the causal genetic variations and understanding the mechanisms of consequent cell and tissue transformation requires an analysis that jointly considers the epistatic, pleiotropic, and plastic interactions of elements and modules within and between the genome (G), transcriptome (T), and phenome (P). Most conventional methods focus on associations between every individual marker genotype and every single phenotype; they have limited statistical power and overlook the complex omit structures. We propose a systematic attempt on methodological development for the largely unexplored but practically important problem of structured associations between the ""-omes"". Rather than testing each SNP separately for association and then applying a correction by multiple hypothesis test, a structured association analysis identifies associations between groups of entities each with its own sophisticated structure that can not be ignored, such as blocks of SNPs with high LD, modules of genes in the same pathway, and clusters of phenotypes belong to a system of clinical descriptors of a disease. We will develop a mathematically rigorous and computationally efficient machine learning platform and software to address the methodological challenges involved with unraveling the interplay between disease-relevant elements in the G, T, and P omes. Our technical innovations include novel statistical models and algorithms for haplotype inference, recombination hotspot detection, gene network and phenotype network inference, admixture association mapping, and most importantly, a family of new structured regression techniques such as the graph-regularized regression, graph- guided fused lasso and extensions, that perform functional approximations to the association functions among structural elements in the G, T, and P omes, and have provable guarantee on consistency and sparsistency. We envisage our proposed research will open a new paradigm for association studies of complex diseases, which facilitates: 1) Intra- and inter-omic integration of data for association mapping and disease gene/pathway discovery, 2) Thorough explorations of the internal structures within different omic data, so that cryptic associations that are not possibly detectable in unstructured analysis due to their weak statistical power can be now inferred. 3) Joint statistical inference of mechanisms and pathways of how variations in DNA lead to variations in complex traits flows through molecular networks, and inference of condition-specific state of gene function in the molecular networks, and 4) Development of faster and automated computational algorithm with greater scalability and robustness to large-scale inter-omic analysis, and more convenient software package and user interface. All the software tools will be made available for free to the public. Project Narrative  We propose a systematic attempt on methodological development for the largely unexplored but practically  important problem of structured association mapping between disease-relevant elements in the genome,  transcriptome, and phenome. Since many complex diseases involve composite phenotypes that are the  outcome of intricate perturbation of molecular network underlying gene regulatory resulted from complex and  interdependent genome variations, structured association analysis at multi-omic level is not only needed, but  also necessary, but it is beyond the grasp of convention methods and requires the methodological innovations  we propose. Characterizing such interactions can provide a more comprehensive genetic and molecular view  of complex diseases, which may lead to the identification of genes underlying disease processes; in addition,  such an approach will allow us to formulate hypotheses regarding the roles of these genes with respect to  disease pathogenesis, and to develop improved diagnostic biomarkers for multivariate clinical phenotypes.",Genome-Transcription-Phenome-Wide Association: a new paradigm for association stu,8054816,R01GM087694,"['Address', 'Admixture', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Asthma', 'Biological Markers', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Descriptor', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Family', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Recombination', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Graph', 'Haplotypes', 'Indium', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Lasso', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Analysis', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Plastics', 'Population', 'Process', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research', 'Role', 'Software Tools', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Study Subject', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transcript', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical phenotype', 'data integration', 'data mining', 'disorder control', 'gene function', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic linkage analysis', 'grasp', 'improved', 'innovation', 'novel', 'phenome', 'trait']",NIGMS,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R01,2011,513100,-0.021338651331230044
"Computational Strategies for Quantitative Mapping of Genetic Interaction Networks    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent studies suggest that many diseases, particularly those that commonly afflict our population, result from interactions among multiple alleles. In an attempt to understand these complex phenotypes, recent experimental efforts in model organisms have focused on measuring such interactions by engineering combinatorial genetic perturbations. Due to the enormous space of possible mutants, brute-force experimental investigation is simply not feasible, and thus, there is a critical need for computational strategies for intelligent exploration of genetic interaction networks. The specific objective of this application is to develop a computational framework for leveraging the existing genomic or proteomic data to enable intelligent direction of combinatorial perturbation studies. The rationale for the proposed research is that although current knowledge of genetic interactions is sparse, the integration of existing genomic and proteomic data can enable the inference of network models that suggest promising candidates for high-throughput interaction screens. Using such computational guidance should enable more efficient characterization of network structure, and ultimately, better understanding of how genes contribute to complex phenotypes.  Based on strong findings in preliminary studies, this objective will be accomplished through two specific aims: (1) development of critical normalization methods and quantitative models for colony array-based interaction assays, and (2) novel machine learning-based approaches for iterative model refinement and optimal interaction screen selection.  The proposed research is innovative because it would represent one of the first efforts to couple genomic data integration and network inference technology with a large-scale experimental effort, where several months of experimental investigation are based entirely on computational direction. Such an approach will yield insight into how combinatorial perturbations can be used to characterize global modularity and organization, and more generally, would serve as a prototype for hybrid computational-experimental strategies in other genomic contexts.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Many common diseases result from interactions among multiple genes. One approach to studying multigenic interactions is to introduce combinations of mutations in model organisms and observe how they affect the cell. This project proposes to develop computational strategies to guide and interpret these combinatorial perturbation studies, which will ultimately help us better understand and treat multigenic diseases.           Project Narrative: Computational Strategies for Mapping Genetic Interaction Networks Many common diseases result from interactions among multiple genes.

"Methods for high-dimensional data in HIV/CVD research    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent technological advances have yielded vast quantities of molecular and cellular data, affording unprecedented opportunities to understand complex disease etiologies and to inform clinical management strategies. However, in order to derive information from these rich stores of data we need to develop sound and appropriate analytic techniques. This need is especially relevant in studies at the intersection of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and cardiovascular disease (CVD), which are characterized by an elaborate set of interactions among viral and host factors. These factors include viral and host genetic profiles, as well as markers of caloric metabolism, immune activation and inflammation, which work together to determine response to therapy and overall disease progression. A comprehensive assessment of these markers presents several analytical challenges owing to the large number of potentially informative variables and the largely uncharacterized relationship among them. We propose a multi-faceted strategy that focuses on the development and application of integrative statistical approaches. Such approaches will allow us to explore and characterize novel hypotheses relating to the complex relationships among multiple genetic, environmental, demographic, and clinical factors and measures of disease progression. Specifically, this continuation application focuses on advancing and applying statistical methods in two settings: first, we consider population-based genetic association studies of innate-immunity, adipokine, drug metabolism and drug transport genes and markers of immune reconstitution, inflammation and risk of CVD in HIV-infected individuals; and second, we address investigations of metabolic and immunologic profiles that associate with immune recovery, inflammation and risk of CVD. The Specific Aims of the proposed research are to develop and evaluate: (1) Latent class and mixture modeling paradigms for (a) discovering and characterizing multi-locus genotype-trait associations and (b) evaluating unobservable haplotype-trait associations in candidate-gene investigations; and (2) Hierarchical mixture models and machine learning approaches for (a) monitoring quantitative biomarkers in resource-limited settings and (b) characterizing high- dimensional predictors of immune reconstitution and inflammation. IMPACT: This research will lead to the creation of appropriate and carefully evaluated analytic tools to derive information from the rich array of molecular and cellular data now available. Ultimately, this research will advance our ability to translate molecular and cellular level data for clinical decision making, serving at the cornerstone of personalized medicine.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The newly available array of data on genetic polymorphisms and cellular level immune factors promises unprecedented opportunities to elucidate complex disease etiology and inform clinical management strategies.

"International Case Control Study of Malignant Glioma    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Glioma comprises about 40% of all primary brain tumors accounting for as many as 26,000 U.S. and European deaths annually. Inherited susceptibility plays a role with 2-fold increased risk of glioma among first-degree relatives of glioma cases. We initiated a multi-center, international linkage study: ""Genetic Epidemiology of Glioma International Consortium"" in 2007 to address the role of inherited susceptibility. Since this study does not allow us currently to address the role of genetic susceptibility in sporadic cases, we propose this case- control study to address this gap. Members of the consortium have conducted genome wide association studies (GWAS) that will be the discovery phase (phase I). While of high value for discovery, we propose to recruit 6,000 newly diagnosed glioma cases and 6,000 age-gender-ethnicity-matched controls, and collect detailed epidemiologic data and biologic samples from the 13 participating Gliogene sites. We hypothesize that novel inherited variation influencing the susceptibility to glioma can be identified by high density SNP analysis, and propose the following specific aims: SA1: Identify common genetic variants contributing to the risk of glioma. We plan to conduct phases 2 and 3 of the 3 phase approach, specifically we will: (SA1a) Validate GWAS findings from the discovery sets, and replicate the top hits (~23,000 SNPs) with lowest p- values from the two phase GWA studies in a series of 2,000 cases and 2,000 controls (phase 2, validation). Validate the top hits from the test set (aim 1a). From stage 2, genes with SNPs displaying an association at pd10-4 (including the complete haplotype tagging - approximately 100 SNPs) will then be genotyped in a further series of 4,000 cases and 4,000 controls (stage 3, validation). SNPs significant at 10-7 or better will be considered in the final analyses. (SA1b). Using an a priori hypothesis that DNA repair in inflammation contribute to glioma risk, we will selectively interrogate DNA repair and inflammation pathway genes using data for select genes derived from the high-density array. We will conduct a hypothesis driven genetic association in DNA repair and in inflammation/immune function related genes with glioma risk using functional genomic and bioinformatic tools to interrogate available databases. (SA2): Evaluate gene-gene (G-G) and gene- environmental (G-E) interactions with strong biologic relevance to identify G-G and G-E interactions for glioma risk using machine-learning tools (MDR, FITF, and CART) in these exploratory analyses. There are no existing glioma case-control studies with sufficient numbers of biological samples and common epidemiologic data to conduct a comprehensive validation and replication study, or to address the issues of tumor heterogeneity as we will in this study.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Gliomas are a rare and understudied disease that is rapidly fatal.

"Predictive Modeling with Clinical and Genomic Data in COPD    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Candidate: Dr. Peter Castaldi is a physician completing a period of F32-funded support. On July 1st, 2009 he will begin a full-time position at Tufts Medical Center and the Institute for Clinical Research and Health Policy Studies (ICRHPS). This position involves a 25% clinical commitment. His principal research interests are the genetic epidemiology of COPD and the translation of genomic discoveries into clinical practice and public health. His particular interests are genetic meta-analysis, gene-environment interaction, and predictive modeling with regression-based and machine-learning methods.  His immediate goals are 1.) to identify novel genetic associations with COPD susceptibility and COPD- related phenotypes through the combined analysis of multiple genome-wide association (GWA) studies, 2.) to identify epistatic and gene-by-smoking interactions, and 3.) to develop accurate predictive models in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) using clinical and genomic information. His long-term goal is to be an independent investigator with expertise in bioinformatics. His vision for achieving this goal involves developing expertise in bioinformatics so as to be able to participate in and eventually lead multidisciplinary teams in the application of computational methods to genomic datasets in order to answer important clinical questions that will improve the care of patients and population health. Environment: Dr. Castaldi will receive training in a rich, interdisciplinary environment. His principal mentor, Dr. Joseph Lau, is the head of the Center for Clinical Evidence Synthesis in the ICRHPS, and he is a worldwide leader in the field of meta-analysis and evidence synthesis. At Tufts, in addition to regular meetings with Dr. Lau, Peter will receive training in genetic evidence synthesis from leaders in the field, including Drs. John Ioannidis and Tom Trikalinos. The co-mentor of this application, Dr. Edwin Silverman, is a leading researcher in COPD genetics at the Channing Laboratory. At the Channing Laboratory, Peter will receive excellent training in respiratory genetics and genetic epidemiology, and he will have resources to state of the art high-throughput genotyping, next-generation sequencing technologies, and bioinformatics support. Dr. Castaldi will also continue his collaboration with Dr. Donna Slonim in the Tufts Computer Science Department, who will provide assistance with application of computational algorithms to genomic data and guidance as Dr. Castaldi continues to build a practical and theoretical foundation in Bioinformatics. Research: COPD is a major cause of morbidity and mortality that is of increasing public health importance. While the principal risk factor for COPD, smoking, is well-established, there is variable susceptibility in the general population to the lung damage caused by cigarette smoke. There is strong evidence supporting a genetic component to COPD susceptibility. Understanding how genes and environment interact to produce clinical COPD will allow for more accurate diagnostic tools and open new avenues of investigation for the development of COPD therapies. We propose to 1.) identify novel genetic associations with COPD susceptibility and 4 COPD-related phenotypes by performing meta-analysis on patient-level data from 4 large COPD GWA studies, 2.) identify gene-by-smoking and gene-gene interactions, and 3.) develop predictive models for COPD susceptibility and COPD-related phenotypes. In order to maximize the information obtained from genomic data, we will combine data from multiple studies (the National Emphysema Treatment Trial Genetics Ancillary Study, the Norway Case-Control Study, COPDGene, and ECLIPSE - total sample size=7,962) to increase power and employ regression-based and machine-learning methods to identify complex patterns of interaction in genotype data. Our study is designed to both explore and subsequently rigorously validate discovered main effect and interaction associations. Using predictive models, we will quantify the incremental predictive benefit of including genetic main effects and genetic interaction data to traditional clinical variables. Relevance: The proposed work will identify new genes associated with COPD and place them in a multivariate context so as to develop a better understanding of how genetic differences and environmental exposures contribute to the development of COPD.

"Genome-Wide Association Analysis of Bladder Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       This proposal builds on a rich resource of bladder cancer (BC) cases and controls derived from two ongoing BC studies at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, and from two large independent U.S. BC studies - the New England BC Study and the New Hampshire BC Study. The goal is to identify genetic loci that predispose individuals to BC through a genome-wide scanning approach. There are five specific aims. Aim 1 is to first perform genome-wide, high-density SNP genotyping using the Illumina HumanHap550 SNP platform on 800 cases and 800 controls from M.D. Anderson, with a target of candidate SNPs of about 28,000; followed by an internal validation to narrow down candidate SNPs to about 1,536 using additional 800 pairs of cases and controls. Illumina's Custom Infinium array will be the genotyping format. In this aim, in addition to individual SNP analysis, we will also implement haplotype-based analyses and pathway aggregation analysis to identify additional genetic loci that might have been overlooked using individual SNP analysis. Aim 2 is the first external validation of the 1,536 SNPs from Aim 1 using 1,000 pairs of cases and controls from the New England BC Study. Illumina's GoldenGate assay will be the genotyping format. After this stage, the candidate SNPs will be narrowed down to about 100. Aim 3 is the second independent external validation using 750 pairs of cases and controls form the New Hampshire BC Study. In this aim, the 100 top candidate SNPs passed from Aims 1 and 2 plus additional functional SNPs in genes containing these SNPs will be genotyped. GoldenGate assay will be used for this aim. Aim 4 is to perform fine mapping studies in the flanking regions of each of the top 25 SNP loci confirmed in Aim 3 to identify causative loci. This will utilize all 6,700 cases and controls. An average of 15 additional SNPs (tagging SNPs and functional SNPs) per gene is expected. Aim 5 is to apply novel machine-learning tools to identify any gene-environment and gene-gene interactions greatly influencing risk for BC in all the 6700 subjects. These analyses will be utilized to examine SNP main effect and develop and validate algorithms that will identify individuals at highest risk for BC, given their personal exposure patterns and their genetic risk profiles. This proposal applies state of art technology to perform a multistage, genome-wide SNP analysis in three largest, well-characterized U.S. population of BC cases and controls, and incorporates complete epidemiologic data and rich and unique functional data. In addition, results from this study will be provided to the International Consortium of BC Case Control Studies for future validation. The ability to identify genetically susceptible, high-risk subgroups that would benefit from intensive screening and/or chemopreventive interventions is of immense clinical and public health benefit. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Bladder cancer (BC) is a disease mainly caused by smoking and occupational exposure. However, only a small percentage of exposed individuals develop BC. Inherited host genetic factors may play an important role in determining an individual's susceptibility to BC. This proposal builds on three largest well-characterized U.S. populations of BC cases and controls - the M. D. Anderson BC study, the New England BC Study and the New Hampshire BC Study. A total of 6700 cases and controls will be used. The goal is to identify genetic loci that predispose individuals to BC through a non-biased, discovery- driven, genome-wide scanning approach and to incorporate complete epidemiologic data and rich and unique functional data. About 550,000 genetic variations of human genome will be initially screened in an M.D. Anderson population consisting of an equal number of BC cases and normal controls. About 28,000 top candidate variations that are potentially associated with increased BC risk will be first narrowed down and internally replicated in a second M.D. Anderson population, and then be validated in the other two independent U.S. BC populations. Finally, the causative genetic loci that predispose individuals to BC will be mapped. This study is significant because by identifying BC susceptibility loci, it will shed light into the biological mechanisms of BC etiology. Furthermore, it may facilitate identifying high-risk subgroups of individuals for BC, given their genetic makeup and environmental exposures. The ability to identify high-risk subgroups of individuals for BC will provide immense public health benefit for those high- risk people who may be subjected to close surveillance and chemoprevention.          n/a",Genome-Wide Association Analysis of Bladder Cancer,8054297,U01CA127615,"['Adopted', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Bladder', 'Cancer Center', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Case Series', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Cycle Regulation', 'Chemoprevention', 'Chemopreventive Agent', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Custom', 'Cytogenetics', 'DNA', 'DNA Repair', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dietary Practices', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Haplotypes', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Inherited', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Length', 'Light', 'Location', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder', 'Maps', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutagens', 'New England', 'New Hampshire', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Occupational Exposure', 'One-Step dentin bonding system', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Penetrance', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Plasma Cells', 'Play', 'Polymorphism Analysis', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Public Health', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Resources', 'Review Literature', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Serum', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Smoking', 'Specimen', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Subgroup', 'Suspension substance', 'Suspensions', 'TNFRSF5 gene', 'Technology', 'University of Texas M D Anderson Cancer Center', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'aggregation pathway', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'carcinogenesis', 'case control', 'college', 'computer based statistical methods', 'cost', 'density', 'design', 'epidemiologic data', 'follow-up', 'gene interaction', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'high risk', 'medical specialties', 'novel', 'parent grant', 'repository', 'telomere', 'tool']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,U01,2011,669490,0.005077224210517462
"Genetic Factors in Keratoconus    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this grant is to identify susceptibility genes involved in the pathogenesis of keratoconus (KC). We will achieve our goal by: 1) refining criteria for the early detection of KC using videokeratography and wavefront Zernike variables; 2) comprehensively testing genes under newly identified linkage peaks generated through genome wide linkage scans of KC families, and performing comprehensive positional candidate gene association studies; and 3) characterizing specific genetic variants that predispose an individual to developing KC. We will study a cohort comprising: normal controls, patients with 'early' KC, KC 'suspect', and KC relatives with videokeratography and aberrometry in order to determine the best combination of variables that discriminate KC 'suspects' from normals. Study subjects will be followed longitudinally to determine which combination of variables is predictive of progression to KC, and thus define subclinical KC (Aim 1). After genome-wide linkage scan of multiplex KC families, we identified regions with significant or suggestive linkage on chromosomes 4, 5, 9, 11, 12, and 14, confirmed by subsequent fine mapping studies. To follow-up these positive linkage findings, we will conduct a comprehensive positional candidate gene association study by testing all genes in these regions with tagSNPs. Any positive association results will be tested in an independent sample for confirmation (Aim 2). Additionally, using newly identified criteria for defining subclinical markers for KC (combination of videokeratography and aberrometry), we will refine our linkage analysis on families with KC in an attempt identify new linkage peaks which may encompass new potential candidate genes for study. Genes identified by both genetic association studies and expression studies published in the literature to date will be prioritized for further study to identify specific genetic variants that contribute to the susceptibility of KC (Aim 3).  Refining criteria for early detection of KC will provide the tools to prevent many patients from under- going unnecessary surgery and developing post-lasik ectasia, a significant public health issue. It will also facilitate identification of susceptibility genes for KC, which may provide an understanding of the mechanisms contributing to corneal thinning in KC. Ultimately, this work may improve our ability to treat KC and/or prevent the development of KC.          n/a",Genetic Factors in Keratoconus,8018102,R01EY009052,"['Affect', 'Biological Markers', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 4', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Cornea', 'Corneal Diseases', 'Data', 'Data Linkages', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Epidemiology', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Etiology', 'Family', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Haplotypes', 'Individual', 'Keratoconus', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathological Dilatation', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Predisposition', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Relative (related person)', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Screening procedure', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Study Subject', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transplantation', 'Unnecessary Surgery', 'Videokeratographies', 'Work', 'aquaporin 5', 'case control', 'cohort', 'corneal epithelium', 'follow-up', 'forest', 'genetic association', 'genetic linkage analysis', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide linkage', 'improved', 'indexing', 'prevent', 'success', 'tool']",NEI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2011,672532,-0.019982374133320564
"Informatic profiling of clinically relevant mutation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our group focuses on genetic variants that disrupt molecular functions that cause human disease. In this renewal R01 application, we propose to begin the process of realizing our long-term goals, and to expand our original scope of research to include the challenge of understanding genetic disease mutations and polymorphisms that affect gene expression regulation in noncoding regions. Additionally, we have formed collaborations with genetic data managers and will apply these methods to aid in their research and identify new testable hypotheses. We will do this in three aims. First, we will integrate predictions of protein-disease associations with mutation predictions to develop a new quantitative model of genotype and phenotype. Second, we will integrate each of these together to develop a systems level, molecular function genome annotator with functionality to import into the genome databases. Finally, we will continue to build new methods for characterization of mutations using sequence, function and structure and begin testing our published hypotheses.

"Type IV Secretion Determinants in Effector Proteins of Coxiella burnetii    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The transport of virulence factors from bacterium to the eukaryotic host cell has emerged as a fundamental strategy in pathogenesis. Several relevant Gram-negative pathogens use type IV secretion systems (T4SS) for 'effector' protein translocation. Coxiella burnetii, a Category B select agent and the causative agent of 'Q' fever is an obligate intracellular vacuolar parasite in vertebrates. After internalization by phagocytes, C.burnetii remodels its vacuole to replicate in a harsh phagolysosomal compartment, likely attributable to the translocation of effector proteins by a T4SS. Due to its obligate intracellular lifestyle, genetic manipulation of C.burnetii remains severely limited. Genomic information revealed however that C.burnetii harbors the genes encoding a T4SS found in Legionella pneumophila called Dot/Icm. Recent studies indicated that expression of C.burnetii (Cb) homologs of the dot/icm components IcmS and IcmW could complement intracellular growth defects of L.pneumophila (Lp) icmS or icmW mutants. We have established that IcmS and IcmW form a complex in the Legionella cytoplasm, and are important for early stages of substrate recognition. The goal of this study is to use L.pneumophila as a surrogate host for the characterization of specific secretion determinants of recently identified effector proteins from C.burnetii. Using molecular, genetic, and biochemical strategies, we will determine secretion signal signatures on Coxiella effector proteins, and define Cb IcmSW binding sites on Cb effectors. Determination of consensus secretion determinants will be applied to systematic computational approaches through the development of new search algorithms to identify novel effector proteins harbored on the C.burnetii genome. Outcomes from these studies will provide novel targets for antimicrobial development to combat critical stages of effector protein recognition and transport by the T4SS.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Q fever bacterium Coxiella burnetii is an obligate intracellular pathogen whose lifestyle has impeded the development of reliable genetic tractability. We are using Legionella pneumophila, a related bacterium with pathogenic strategies predicted to be conserved, to identify and characterize critical transport determinants on virulence factors.

"Multivariate Pattern Analysis Methods for Neuroimaging Genetics Studies    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Common mental disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia are largely heritable with complex genetic underpinnings. Large-scale genome-wide association studies that contrast DNA sequence data from patients and controls have recently identified novel genetic risk variants for these disorders. Nevertheless, the processes through which genotype increases risk are yet to be fully characterized.  Neuroimaging offers a richer picture of the underlying disease processes than a clinical diagnosis. Thus the joint analysis of neuroimaging and genetics data promises to advance our understanding of these processes. Today, neuroimaging genetics studies however face important challenges that obstruct progress: small sample sizes, modest effect sizes, and the extreme dimensionality of the data limit statistical power and thus our ability to explore the complex and subtle associations between genes, neuroanatomy and clinical decline. Currently, the prevalent approach in neuroimaging genetics is to concentrate the analysis on a small number of anatomic regions of interest and/or candidate genes and often ignore a large portion of the data. The core goal of the proposed project is to develop computational tools that will take full advantage of the richness in the datasets and facilitate the exploration of the multifaceted associations between genotype, neuroimaging measurements and clinical phenotype. The proposed project will use advanced multivariate pattern analysis methods such as support vector machines to compute image-based and genetic scores that reflect pathology. We will validate the tools based on their association with classical biomarkers of disease. Finally, we will develop a model that uses both imaging and genotype data to predict future clinical outcome. We expect these tools will enable progress along three directions relevant to complex mental disorders, e.g. late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD): (1) confirming and characterizing risk genes, (2) identifying disease-specific anatomical alterations in healthy individuals, and (3) early diagnosis and prognosis. The project will (1) use three already-collected large-scale datasets to apply the developed tools to AD, (2) build on cutting-edge image processing algorithms that we have been developing, and (3) allow the candidate to receive further training in neuroanatomy, mental disorders and genetics, forming the foundation for his future career as an independent researcher.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Project Narrative/Relevance We will develop computational tools for analyzing complex associations between images, genotype and clinical phenotype.

"Methods for high-resolution analysis of genetic effects on gene expression    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Summary Gene expression is a fundamental function of any cell. It is the main mechanism by which information is transmitted from the nucleus to the rest of the cell and eventually to other cells and the body of the organism. Genetic variation in components of the transcriptional machinery and signals that regulate gene function generates variation in transcriptional response and consequently variation in phenotypes. It has become apparent that many of the common genetic signals associated with disease are found away from the DNA sequence that encodes for protein sequence and is likely to be functioning in regulating gene expression. In this project we propose to develop methodologies that will explore the consequences of genetic variation in gene expression. There are three main goals of this project. First we will explore and develop methodologies to mine information from experiments that perform deep sequencing of the human transcriptome. The new sequencing technologies are providing us with unprecedented resolution into the transcriptome but are also raising challenges in the computational and biological models to use to interpret such large amounts of data. Secondly, we will use high-resolution genetic data to develop and use methodologies to dissect the fine structure of genetic variants that affect regulation of gene expression. Finally, we will implement and test models to infer the higher-order interactions of genome function so as to dig deeply into the biological consequences of genetic variants and how the signal is transmitted from the DNA sequence to higher levels of cell and body function. Our goals is to develop methodologies that will significantly improve our insight to the variability in human populations and assist in interpreting predisposition to genetic diseases.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:    Project narrative The proposed project aims at the development of statistical methods for the interpretation and study of the impact of genetic variants in cell function.

"T1D:Investigating the Gut Microbiome, Urinary Proteome and Metabolome    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disorder characterized by the loss of function of insulin producing pancreatic cells leading to myriad manifestations of the disease in affected individuals. When left untreated this can lead to death. Many studies have shown that development of the disease is the result of interactions between immunological, genetic, and environmental factors. Although, many environmental factors have been implicated, the mechanisms of involvement or major determinants are yet to be clearly identified. Published studies have suggested that T1D results from environmental triggers acting on genetically susceptible individuals and that microbial infection and their immunological consequences are suspected to take part in the pathogenesis. Several mechanisms have been proposed for the causation of beta-cell damage by microbes. Data from retrospective and prospective epidemiological studies strongly suggest the involvement of enteroviruses in the development of T1D. Altered microbial diversity in the gut microbiota has been shown to trigger an abnormal mucosal immune response to further the progression of T1D. Genetic susceptibility traits for T1D are becoming more numerous, including loci for HLA, insulin, protein tyrosine phosphatase-22, cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4, the interleukin-2 receptor and C- type lectin. This complexity renders them less desirable as predictive tests. Although genetic susceptibility genes are known to play a substantial role in the development of T1D, cellular changes as well as environmental triggers may serve as excellent, potentially more universal biomarkers for risk assessment. For this study, we propose to analyze blood, stool and urine samples from children and adolescent patient populations who have been recently diagnosed with T1D, their siblings, and at-risk cohorts from the TrialNet network (www.diabetestrialnet.org). We propose to apply high-throughput genomics, proteomics and metabolomics techniques to identify molecular signatures discriminating these cohorts. By deconvolution of high-resolution molecular data, we expect to identify viral-microbial specific correlated patterns of proteins and metabolites. Our aim is to discover and verify candidate biomarkers from a large number of biological constituents; from genomic, proteomic and metabolomic datasets through correlation of host microbiome data and genotype. Our purpose is to advance non-invasive clinical tests by applying novel molecular methods to correlate disease status for early diagnosis and prediction of T1D onset, setting the stage for potential therapies or intervention strategies.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The incidence of Type I Diabetes (T1D) has been rising rapidly in children and adolescents over the last 20 years. T1D is an autoimmune disease that occurs when a child's body cannot produce insulin, and genetics as well as environmental factors play a role in the development of this disease.

"Genome Wide Association Study of Head and Neck Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Head and neck cancers have well-documented associations with tobacco and alcohol exposure, but the disease develops in only a small fraction of users, which implies an important role for genetic susceptibility. Therefore, head and neck cancers are an excellent model for studying genetic susceptibility to environmental carcinogens. The primary goal of this R01 application is to perform a comprehensive two-stage, high-density, genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis of head and neck cancer cases and corresponding frequency matched controls to identify novel genetic risk factors for head and neck cancer. This proposal builds upon a well-annotated existing DNA repository of cases and controls. One of the unique features of our study is the availability of DNA repair assay data on most of the cases and controls in this study, which will allow us to conduct genotype/phenotype analyses. We also have access to genome-wide association data from 1200 white control subjects from the same source population. In aim 1, we will perform genotyping on 1000 randomly selected head and neck cancer cases and 500 controls using a 370K Illumina Infinium HapMap HumanCNV370-Duo SNP Chip. We will perform association analyses (1000 cases and 1700 controls) in the first stage using outcome variable as case-control status as well as DNA repair capacity assay data. Our second aim is to perform second-stage analysis of the SNPs selected in stage 1 using 900 additional cases and corresponding controls from the same source and from UCLA. We will use efficient joint analysis of cases and controls from the first and second aims, for a total of 1900 cases and 2600 controls. Finally, in aim 3, we will apply novel statistical tools such as the latent variable approach with Tukey's one-degree-of-freedom test and support vector machines to identify gene-gene and gene-environment (using environmental factors such as smoking and alcohol use) interactions that contribute to the risk of head and neck cancer. We are an experienced investigative team proposing a comprehensive analysis that incorporates epidemiological, behavioral, and functional data. Identification of novel genetic risk factors and their interactions with environmental factors will contribute to the early diagnosis of head and neck cancers. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The identification of novel genetic risk factors and their interactions with environmental factors will contribute to the early diagnosis of the disease and help identify individuals at highest risk for the development of head and neck cancer on the basis of their personal exposure patterns and their genetic risk profiles.              The identification of novel genetic risk factors and their interactions with environmental factors will contribute to the early diagnosis of the disease and help identify individuals at highest risk for the development of head and neck cancer on the basis of their personal exposure patterns and their genetic risk profiles.",Genome Wide Association Study of Head and Neck Cancer,8059620,R01CA131324,"['African American', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohols', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Benzo(a)pyrene', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'CCRL2 gene', 'Cancer Center', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Case Study', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Caucasians', 'Caucasoid Race', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Chromosome abnormality', 'Classification', 'Clinic Visits', 'Control Groups', 'County', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'DNA Adducts', 'DNA Repair', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Environmental Carcinogens', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Exposure to', 'Freedom', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Gender', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genes', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Haplotypes', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Head and neck structure', 'Health', 'Hispanic Americans', 'Histologic', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Joints', 'Larynx', 'Lung', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant Squamous Cell Neoplasm', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Measures', 'Mutagens', 'Oral cavity', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharyngeal structure', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Polymorphism Analysis', 'Population', 'Population Control', 'Questionnaires', 'Reporter Genes', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Residencies', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Source', 'Squamous Cell', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Study models', 'Testing', 'Tobacco', 'Trees', 'Trust', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'adduct', 'alcohol exposure', 'base', 'cancer genome', 'cancer risk', 'case control', 'density', 'disease phenotype', 'experience', 'gene environment interaction', 'genetic risk factor', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'high risk', 'metropolitan', 'novel', 'plasmid DNA', 'population based', 'repository', 'sex', 'text searching', 'tobacco exposure', 'tool']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,R01,2011,594620,0.018154884050252843
"International Cohort Collection for Bipolar Disorder    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Bipolar disorder (BPD) is a major public health priority, responsible for a vast burden of disability, personal suffering, and economic cost. Genetic susceptibility is the strongest known risk factor for BPD, and the identification of specific susceptibility genes would have enormous implications for advancing our understanding of the biology of BPD and revealing novel targets for treatment. The limited success to date of genetic studies of BPD has been due to its complex genetic architecture that likely includes many contributing loci of modest effect. Advances in population genetics and genotyping technologies have recently made the genetic dissection of complex disorders like BPD a feasible project. Genomewide association studies (GWAS) have already identified susceptibility variants underlying a range of other common medical disorders. However, it has become clear that much larger samples than are currently available will be needed to achieve such successes for BPD. This application is a response by an international consortium of investigators to RFA-MH-08-130: ""Genomic Parsing of Bipolar Disorder and Schizophrenia: Studies of Large Cohorts in the U.S. and Across the Globe."" The proposed International Cohort Collection for Bipolar Disorder (ICCBD) will address the need for large-scale DNA and data resources by establishing a uniquely large collection of samples and data from individuals with BPD. The specific aims of this application are 1) to ascertain and collect a large cohort of BPD cases (N = 9000) and unaffected controls (N = 9000) over five years at two U.S. sites (Boston and Los Angeles) using novel high-throughput phenotyping methods; and 2) to construct a harmonized data resource for genetic studies combining phenotypic data from the U.S. case-control sample with a parallel, separately funded European case-control sample (10,000 cases and 10,000 controls) obtained from the UK and Sweden. Separately funded genotyping and genetic analyses of these resources will fully characterize common polymorphisms and copy number variants in the full sample to detect novel risk variants and attempt replication of the most compelling prior findings. This resource, augmented by existing samples, will provide an unprecedented platform for the discovery of the genetic determinants of BPD.

"A new paradigm for quantifying animal behavior in a model genetic system    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Progress toward understanding and curing many human neurological diseases is hindered by a lack of methods for objective and quantitative assessment of the connections between genes and behavior. Traditional studies of animal behavior probe only a small subset of user-defined behaviors in low- dimensional data and are inappropriate for the discovery of subtle phenotypes or complex relationships between genes and behavior. To move beyond these simple representations of animal behavior, we propose to build a high-resolution, three-dimensional imaging system that can track single behaving animals. This system will quantitatively connect behavior to genetics using a data-driven method for the discovery of stereotyped motions. Our specific aims are to 1) develop a new standard for behavioral observation and automatic phenotyping to quantify the behavior of freely moving fruit flies, 2) demonstrate the sensitivity and accuracy of our new technology by studying Drosophila models of neurodegenerative diseases and the behavior of closely-related species of Drosophila fruit flies and 3) expand our system to enable simultaneous tracking and analysis of two independent flies in a single arena and test this system with assays of courtship behavior between male and female flies. The ability to measure subtle changes in behavior in a model genetic organism will bring us closer than we have ever been to understanding neurological diseases and behavioral disorders at the genetic and molecular level.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Many mental health problems and neurological diseases are linked to genetic risk factors. We propose to build new types of instrumentation and analyses for studying the intricate link between genes and behavior in animal models of human disease.           Many mental health problems and neurological diseases are linked to genetic risk factors.

"Machine Learning Prediction of Cancer Susceptibility    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Susceptibility to sporadic forms of cancer is determined by numerous genetic factors that interact in a nonlinear manner in the context of an individual's age and environmental exposure. This complex genetic architecture has important implications for the use of genome-wide association studies for identifying susceptibility genes. The assumption of a simple architecture supports a strategy of testing each single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) individually using traditional univariate statistics followed by a correction for multiple tests. However, a complex genetic architecture that is characteristic of most types of cancer requires analytical methods that specifically model combinations of SNPs and environmental exposures. While new and novel methods are available for modeling interactions, exhaustive testing of all combinations of SNPs is not feasible on a genome- wide scale because the number of comparisons is effectively infinite. Thus, it is critical that we develop intelligent strategies for selecting subsets of SNPs prior to combinatorial modeling. The objective of this renewal application is to continue the development of a research strategy for the detection, characterization, and interpretation of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions in genome-wide association studies of bladder cancer susceptibility. To accomplish this objective, we will continue developing and evaluating modifications and extensions to the ReliefF family of algorithms for selecting or filtering subsets of single- nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) analysis of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions (AIM 1). We will continue developing and evaluating a stochastic wrapper or search strategy for MDR analysis of interactions that utilizes ReliefF values as a heuristic (AIM 2). We will continue to make available ReliefF algorithms as part of our open-source MDR software package (AIM 3). Finally, we will apply the best ReliefF-MDR analysis strategies to the detection, characterization, and interpretation of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions in large genome-wide association studies of bladder cancer susceptibility (AIM 4). We anticipate the proposed machine learning methods will provide powerful new approaches for identifying genetic variations that are predictive of cancer susceptibility.              PROJECT NARRATIVE The technology to measure information about the human genome is advancing at a rapid pace. Despite these advance, the computational methods for analyzing the data have not kept pace.

"Microbial Diversity and Genetic Characterization of Cariogenic Biofilms    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed studies are anticipated to yield important new information as to the presence of specific genetic determinants found in Streptococcus mutans, a microbe strongly associated with a severe dental caries in affecting young children called severe early childhood caries or S-ECC. The long-term benefit of such information should lead researchers toward devising both diagnostic and preventive strategies against dental though better understanding its microbial causation. Using a powerful technique of suppressive subtraction DNA hybridization, the first specific aim is to test the hypothesis that strains of S. mutans found in S-ECC children differ in genetic composition compared to strains found in caries-free (CF) children. Unique genetic loci that are specific to S-ECC strains will be identified and characterized. Some of these genetic loci will prove informative as biomarkers for health or disease. Using the power of multiple test analyses derived artificial intelligence programming; biomarkers will be used as the basis for a modeling algorithm capable of classifying strains of S. mutans in one of two categories (S-ECC or CF). The second aim of this study is to survey strains of S. mutans associated with either S-ECC or CF status for known or suspected genetic elements thought to influence the pathogenesis or virulence of S. mutans. The third aim is to survey a larger, racial/ethnical diverse population of S-ECC or CF children for the presence or absence of the biomarkers identified in the first two aims. It is anticipated that this research will yield genetic markers for disease capable of providing clinicians with a diagnostic test that can assess risk for developing S-ECC. 7.           n/a",Microbial Diversity and Genetic Characterization of Cariogenic Biofilms,7763788,R01DE013937,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological Markers', 'Categories', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Coupling', 'DNA', 'Dental', 'Dental caries', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Dot Immunoblotting', 'Effectiveness', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomic Islands', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'Hispanics', 'Infant', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Microbe', 'Microbial Biofilms', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mothers', 'Pathogenesis', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevention strategy', 'Process', 'Programmed Learning', 'Public Health', 'Pulsed-Field Gel Electrophoresis', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Series', 'Severity of illness', 'Streptococcus mutans', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Virulence', 'Virulence Factors', 'base', 'early childhood', 'experience', 'genetic element', 'microbial', 'programs', 'research study', 'tool']",NIDCR,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R01,2010,361911,0.015845786354051677
"Novel Statistical Methods for Human Gene Mapping    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many common human diseases originate in part from the complicated effects of multiple genetic variants found throughout the genome. Given the enormous impact of such diseases on public health, it is imperative to map relevant genetic variants to improve our understanding of the molecular basis of such diseases, as well as improve screening techniques for disease prevention. To this end, successful human gene mapping of complex diseases requires the development and application of powerful statistical methods that fully utilize the resources of the Human Genome Project. This grant proposes a set of such statistical methods that either address novel problems or improve existing solutions to problems in human gene mapping studies. These proposed methods are applicable to a variety of genetic studies as they address topics in linkage, linkage disequilibrium, and high-dimensional genetic analyses of complex diseases and disease-related quantitative traits. The methods can be partitioned into the two general groups: mixed-modeling procedures and case-control likelihood procedures. The mixed-modeling procedures considered include a general variance-component (VC) mapping framework for continuous and discrete trait data and a modified VC mapping framework that allows for haplotypes. Also considered is a novel linear-mixed-model framework that identifies a large combination of genetic variants that influence a quantitative trait using support-vector- machine regression. The case-control likelihood procedures considered are extensions of the approach of Epstein and Satten (2003) for haplotype inference on disease. Extensions considered include allowing for covariates and haplotype-covariate interactions, and also categorical disease outcomes. The proposed statistical methods in this grant have the potential to increase the power to identify genetic variants that influence complex diseases and disease-related quantitative traits. This project will evaluate the performance of these methods using simulations based on the study design and data from an existing gene mapping study of type 2 diabetes. Also, this grant will implement the proposed statistical methods in user- friendly, efficient software for public distribution. Finally, this project will be opportunistic in identifying and addressing unforseen statistical problems arising in human gene mapping studies.           n/a",Novel Statistical Methods for Human Gene Mapping,7930715,R01HG003618,"['Address', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biochemical Reaction', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Categories', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Chromosomes', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Finland', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Grant', 'Haplotypes', 'Human Gene Mapping', 'Human Genome Project', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Nature', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Normal Statistical Distribution', 'Other Genetics', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Screening procedure', 'Series', 'Severity of illness', 'Solutions', 'Statistical Methods', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'United States', 'Variant', 'base', 'case control', 'disorder prevention', 'flexibility', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic variant', 'human disease', 'improved', 'interest', 'non-genetic', 'novel', 'programs', 'simulation', 'trait', 'user-friendly']",NHGRI,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2010,288566,0.012542252317915014
"Machine learning to identify predictive SNPs and complex interaction effects    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Susceptibility to complex diseases is determined by the coordinated function of multiple genetic variants and environmental factors interacting in a composite and potentially nonlinear manner. Although the genome-wide views provided by advanced single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays present an opportunity to discover previously unrecognized genomic patterns, the ability to recognize such complex features of genetic architecture has important implications for the use of genome-wide association study to discover genetic determinants of health and disease from massive genomic data. The focus of this application is the development and validation of effective computational statistics approaches to detect complex interaction effects of multi-locus SNPs which could be useful for classification and prediction of disease or dysfunction, and provide novel insights into the pathogenesis of complex phenotypes. Based on very promising preliminary studies, the specific aims of this R21 application are carefully designed: (1) to refine and evaluate the recently developed significant conditional association (SCA) criterion and heuristic combinatorial interaction growing (HCIG) search strategy (specifically designed to discover complex interaction effects of multi-locus jointly-predictive SNPs), test and validate on real SNP based realistic simulations and compare with a panel of most relevant existing methods; and (2) to apply SCA- HCIG method to the real SNP data of NIAMS-funded FMS cohort in relationship to metabolic syndrome etc. and develop SNP marker based classification/ prediction models, assessed by the prediction power and initial biological plausibility of the implicated SNP subsets. This proposal represents a unique cross-disciplinary collaboration focusing on the development of new analytical methods to more effectively identify interacting susceptibility SNPs and environmental factors that can be used to determine individual risk to a specific disease and to estimate prognosis and response to treatment. The results could also suggest novel preventive intervetions and therapeutic targets, reduce the burden of diseases, and accelerate the realization of truly personalized medicine.           Principal Investigator/Program Director (Last, First, Middle): Wang, Yue (Joseph), Ph.D. Machine learning to identify predictive SNPs and complex interaction effects Project Narrative  Susceptibility to complex diseases is determined by the coordinated function of multiple genetic and environmental factors.

"Computational Strategies for Quantitative Mapping of Genetic Interaction Networks    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent studies suggest that many diseases, particularly those that commonly afflict our population, result from interactions among multiple alleles. In an attempt to understand these complex phenotypes, recent experimental efforts in model organisms have focused on measuring such interactions by engineering combinatorial genetic perturbations. Due to the enormous space of possible mutants, brute-force experimental investigation is simply not feasible, and thus, there is a critical need for computational strategies for intelligent exploration of genetic interaction networks. The specific objective of this application is to develop a computational framework for leveraging the existing genomic or proteomic data to enable intelligent direction of combinatorial perturbation studies. The rationale for the proposed research is that although current knowledge of genetic interactions is sparse, the integration of existing genomic and proteomic data can enable the inference of network models that suggest promising candidates for high-throughput interaction screens. Using such computational guidance should enable more efficient characterization of network structure, and ultimately, better understanding of how genes contribute to complex phenotypes.  Based on strong findings in preliminary studies, this objective will be accomplished through two specific aims: (1) development of critical normalization methods and quantitative models for colony array-based interaction assays, and (2) novel machine learning-based approaches for iterative model refinement and optimal interaction screen selection.  The proposed research is innovative because it would represent one of the first efforts to couple genomic data integration and network inference technology with a large-scale experimental effort, where several months of experimental investigation are based entirely on computational direction. Such an approach will yield insight into how combinatorial perturbations can be used to characterize global modularity and organization, and more generally, would serve as a prototype for hybrid computational-experimental strategies in other genomic contexts.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Many common diseases result from interactions among multiple genes.

"Genome-Transcription-Phenome-Wide Association: a new paradigm for association stu    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many complex disease syndromes consist of a large number of highly related, rather than independent, clinical phenotypes. Differences between these syndromes involve the complex interplay of a large number of genomic variations that perturb the function of disease-related genes in the context of a regulatory network, rather than individually. Thus unraveling the causal genetic variations and understanding the mechanisms of consequent cell and tissue transformation requires an analysis that jointly considers the epistatic, pleiotropic, and plastic interactions of elements and modules within and between the genome (G), transcriptome (T), and phenome (P). Most conventional methods focus on associations between every individual marker genotype and every single phenotype; they have limited statistical power and overlook the complex omit structures. We propose a systematic attempt on methodological development for the largely unexplored but practically important problem of structured associations between the ""-omes"". Rather than testing each SNP separately for association and then applying a correction by multiple hypothesis test, a structured association analysis identifies associations between groups of entities each with its own sophisticated structure that can not be ignored, such as blocks of SNPs with high LD, modules of genes in the same pathway, and clusters of phenotypes belong to a system of clinical descriptors of a disease. We will develop a mathematically rigorous and computationally efficient machine learning platform and software to address the methodological challenges involved with unraveling the interplay between disease-relevant elements in the G, T, and P omes. Our technical innovations include novel statistical models and algorithms for haplotype inference, recombination hotspot detection, gene network and phenotype network inference, admixture association mapping, and most importantly, a family of new structured regression techniques such as the graph-regularized regression, graph- guided fused lasso and extensions, that perform functional approximations to the association functions among structural elements in the G, T, and P omes, and have provable guarantee on consistency and sparsistency. We envisage our proposed research will open a new paradigm for association studies of complex diseases, which facilitates: 1) Intra- and inter-omic integration of data for association mapping and disease gene/pathway discovery, 2) Thorough explorations of the internal structures within different omic data, so that cryptic associations that are not possibly detectable in unstructured analysis due to their weak statistical power can be now inferred. 3) Joint statistical inference of mechanisms and pathways of how variations in DNA lead to variations in complex traits flows through molecular networks, and inference of condition-specific state of gene function in the molecular networks, and 4) Development of faster and automated computational algorithm with greater scalability and robustness to large-scale inter-omic analysis, and more convenient software package and user interface. All the software tools will be made available for free to the public. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose a systematic attempt on methodological development for the largely unexplored but practically important problem of structured association mapping between disease-relevant elements in the genome, transcriptome, and phenome. Since many complex diseases involve composite phenotypes that are the outcome of intricate perturbation of molecular network underlying gene regulatory resulted from complex and interdependent genome variations, structured association analysis at multi-omic level is not only needed, but also necessary, but it is beyond the grasp of convention methods and requires the methodological innovations we propose. Characterizing such interactions can provide a more comprehensive genetic and molecular view of complex diseases, which may lead to the identification of genes underlying disease processes; in addition, such an approach will allow us to formulate hypotheses regarding the roles of these genes with respect to disease pathogenesis, and to develop improved diagnostic biomarkers for multivariate clinical phenotypes.          Project Narrative  We propose a systematic attempt on methodological development for the largely unexplored but practically  important problem of structured association mapping between disease-relevant elements in the genome,  transcriptome, and phenome.

"Genetics of Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis and Subtypes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA) is a childhood onset autoimmune arthropathy characterized by inflammation of joints and other tissues. It is a debilitating disorder in which progressive joint damage and resulting growth disorders may occur. It is the most common chronic childhood rheumatic disease in the Western world. There are at least seven subtypes that comprise JIA and these subtypes clearly differ by age of onset and gender. JIA has a strong genetic influence with sibling risk ratios of approximately 20 (S=20). However, genetic influences vary by subtypes, age of onset and gender. We propose to analyze existing genome-wide association (GWA) data on 800 JIA cases and greater than 3,000 controls of European ancestry and genotyped on the Affymetrix 500K and Affymetrix 6.0 platforms for targeted hypotheses beyond the current case:control study. We hypothesize that loci contributing to the risk of JIA can be identified through contrasting and partitioning into more homogeneous subtypes of JIA and testing for the modifying effects on these loci's risks through interactions with HLA polymorphisms, age of onset and gender. We propose to identify genetic factors of JIA via 1) the use of imputation methods to test for association with JIA and subtypes for all HapMap SNPs with minor allele frequency greater than 2%; 2) computing GWA analysis for age of onset, SNP-by-gender interaction, SNP-by-HLA interaction and SNP-by-SNP interactions; 3) identifying regions of loss of heterozygosity and copy number variation predictive of JIA and its subtypes; and 4) computing GWA for expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) in individuals with both Affymetrix 6.0 and existing global gene expression data. The proposal includes well powered GWA analyses for JIA, novel methods such as statistical machine learning for interaction analyses, and integration of expression and genotype data. The proposed series of analyses will assist in our long- term goal of understanding JIA, while recognizing the diversity of conditions known as JIA and making the discoveries of greater relevance for diagnosis, prognosis and treatment.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:    Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA) is a childhood onset autoimmune disease characterized by inflammation of joints and other tissues.

"International Case Control Study of Malignant Glioma    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Glioma comprises about 40% of all primary brain tumors accounting for as many as 26,000 U.S. and European deaths annually. Inherited susceptibility plays a role with 2-fold increased risk of glioma among first-degree relatives of glioma cases. We initiated a multi-center, international linkage study: ""Genetic Epidemiology of Glioma International Consortium"" in 2007 to address the role of inherited susceptibility. Since this study does not allow us currently to address the role of genetic susceptibility in sporadic cases, we propose this case- control study to address this gap. Members of the consortium have conducted genome wide association studies (GWAS) that will be the discovery phase (phase I). While of high value for discovery, we propose to recruit 6,000 newly diagnosed glioma cases and 6,000 age-gender-ethnicity-matched controls, and collect detailed epidemiologic data and biologic samples from the 13 participating Gliogene sites. We hypothesize that novel inherited variation influencing the susceptibility to glioma can be identified by high density SNP analysis, and propose the following specific aims: SA1: Identify common genetic variants contributing to the risk of glioma. We plan to conduct phases 2 and 3 of the 3 phase approach, specifically we will: (SA1a) Validate GWAS findings from the discovery sets, and replicate the top hits (~23,000 SNPs) with lowest p- values from the two phase GWA studies in a series of 2,000 cases and 2,000 controls (phase 2, validation). Validate the top hits from the test set (aim 1a). From stage 2, genes with SNPs displaying an association at pd10-4 (including the complete haplotype tagging - approximately 100 SNPs) will then be genotyped in a further series of 4,000 cases and 4,000 controls (stage 3, validation). SNPs significant at 10-7 or better will be considered in the final analyses. (SA1b). Using an a priori hypothesis that DNA repair in inflammation contribute to glioma risk, we will selectively interrogate DNA repair and inflammation pathway genes using data for select genes derived from the high-density array. We will conduct a hypothesis driven genetic association in DNA repair and in inflammation/immune function related genes with glioma risk using functional genomic and bioinformatic tools to interrogate available databases. (SA2): Evaluate gene-gene (G-G) and gene- environmental (G-E) interactions with strong biologic relevance to identify G-G and G-E interactions for glioma risk using machine-learning tools (MDR, FITF, and CART) in these exploratory analyses. There are no existing glioma case-control studies with sufficient numbers of biological samples and common epidemiologic data to conduct a comprehensive validation and replication study, or to address the issues of tumor heterogeneity as we will in this study.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Gliomas are a rare and understudied disease that is rapidly fatal. The proposed case-control study of primary malignant glioma (Gliogene Consortium) includes 13-centers, and will address the role of genetic susceptibility in sporadic cases.

"A National Consortium to Explore the Genotypic Basis for ESRD in Lupus    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): End stage renal disease (ESRD), one of the most serious and costly complications of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), occurs in a sub-set of patients with SLE-related renal involvement. Factors predisposing to ESRD presumably include both genetics and environmental factors, and there is unequivocal evidence that ESRD disproportionately affects lupus persons of African American descent. Data in SLE-related ESRD suggest that at least two genetic factors, -- certain allelic variants of the genes FCGR3A and MYH9, -- contribute to ESRD risk. However, two genes alone do not define the scope of genetic risk for ESRD. Therefore, building on our precedent data for genetic contributions, it is timely to undertake a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify the genetic risk factors for ESRD in European American (EA) and African Americans (AA) with lupus nephritis (LN/ESRD). Until now, two major barriers have precluded such a study. Technical limitations in genotyping platform and coverage have been overcome with the Illumina Human Omni- 1 Quad BeadChip. To surmount the second barrier of limited study populations, we have assembled an unprecedented team of rheumatologists, nephrologists and statistical geneticists with IRB protocols active, the clinical studies infrastructure in place and the patient collections and clinical data more than 75% in hand. Thus (1) Our first aim is to characterize the genetic susceptibility factors associated with ESRD by performing a  GWAS with 800 EA LN/ESRD and 800 AA LN/ESRD compared to lupus subjects of each ethnicity but  without nephritis and normal control subjects.  (2) We propose that [gene x gene] and [gene x environment] interactions are biologically important and may be more easily detectable using the machine learning and more modern likelihood-based approaches. Therefore, our second aim is to apply novel approaches to gene discovery and biological pathway characterization including Bayesian networks, alternative decision trees, HyperLasso, and penalized logistic regression.  (3) Finally, our third aim is to build an essential resource, consistent with NIH specimen and data sharing guidelines and supported by the institution. This resource will enable follow-up studies in fine-mapping, deep-sequencing, SNP identification, pathway analysis and methods development. Our consortium leverages current resources and investments by NIAMS, NIDDK, NIEHS, NCRR, CDCP and private foundations to create a unique opportunity to address a major health care challenge. We have a substantial head start, drawing on established networks and clinical research infrastructure, and are poised to identify genetic risk factors, leading to strategies for ESRD reduction, which would enable substantial cost savings and reduction in morbidity and mortality as it reduces ethnic disparities in health outcomes.           7. PROJECT NARRATIVE Drawing on established networks and clinical research infrastructure, this study is uniquely positioned to capitalize on a multidisciplinary team to leverage existing resources to address important questions about the underlying genetic influences on susceptibility to end stage renal disease (ESRD) in lupus. This understanding may lead to strategies for ESRD intervention, may reduce ethnic disparities in health outcome, and may enable substantial cost savings in the health care industry.

"Predictive Modeling with Clinical and Genomic Data in COPD    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Candidate: Dr. Peter Castaldi is a physician completing a period of F32-funded support. On July 1st, 2009 he will begin a full-time position at Tufts Medical Center and the Institute for Clinical Research and Health Policy Studies (ICRHPS). This position involves a 25% clinical commitment. His principal research interests are the genetic epidemiology of COPD and the translation of genomic discoveries into clinical practice and public health. His particular interests are genetic meta-analysis, gene-environment interaction, and predictive modeling with regression-based and machine-learning methods.  His immediate goals are 1.) to identify novel genetic associations with COPD susceptibility and COPD- related phenotypes through the combined analysis of multiple genome-wide association (GWA) studies, 2.) to identify epistatic and gene-by-smoking interactions, and 3.) to develop accurate predictive models in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) using clinical and genomic information. His long-term goal is to be an independent investigator with expertise in bioinformatics. His vision for achieving this goal involves developing expertise in bioinformatics so as to be able to participate in and eventually lead multidisciplinary teams in the application of computational methods to genomic datasets in order to answer important clinical questions that will improve the care of patients and population health. Environment: Dr. Castaldi will receive training in a rich, interdisciplinary environment. His principal mentor, Dr. Joseph Lau, is the head of the Center for Clinical Evidence Synthesis in the ICRHPS, and he is a worldwide leader in the field of meta-analysis and evidence synthesis. At Tufts, in addition to regular meetings with Dr. Lau, Peter will receive training in genetic evidence synthesis from leaders in the field, including Drs. John Ioannidis and Tom Trikalinos. The co-mentor of this application, Dr. Edwin Silverman, is a leading researcher in COPD genetics at the Channing Laboratory. At the Channing Laboratory, Peter will receive excellent training in respiratory genetics and genetic epidemiology, and he will have resources to state of the art high-throughput genotyping, next-generation sequencing technologies, and bioinformatics support. Dr. Castaldi will also continue his collaboration with Dr. Donna Slonim in the Tufts Computer Science Department, who will provide assistance with application of computational algorithms to genomic data and guidance as Dr. Castaldi continues to build a practical and theoretical foundation in Bioinformatics. Research: COPD is a major cause of morbidity and mortality that is of increasing public health importance. While the principal risk factor for COPD, smoking, is well-established, there is variable susceptibility in the general population to the lung damage caused by cigarette smoke. There is strong evidence supporting a genetic component to COPD susceptibility. Understanding how genes and environment interact to produce clinical COPD will allow for more accurate diagnostic tools and open new avenues of investigation for the development of COPD therapies. We propose to 1.) identify novel genetic associations with COPD susceptibility and 4 COPD-related phenotypes by performing meta-analysis on patient-level data from 4 large COPD GWA studies, 2.) identify gene-by-smoking and gene-gene interactions, and 3.) develop predictive models for COPD susceptibility and COPD-related phenotypes. In order to maximize the information obtained from genomic data, we will combine data from multiple studies (the National Emphysema Treatment Trial Genetics Ancillary Study, the Norway Case-Control Study, COPDGene, and ECLIPSE - total sample size=7,962) to increase power and employ regression-based and machine-learning methods to identify complex patterns of interaction in genotype data. Our study is designed to both explore and subsequently rigorously validate discovered main effect and interaction associations. Using predictive models, we will quantify the incremental predictive benefit of including genetic main effects and genetic interaction data to traditional clinical variables. Relevance: The proposed work will identify new genes associated with COPD and place them in a multivariate context so as to develop a better understanding of how genetic differences and environmental exposures contribute to the development of COPD. The models generated by this work will facilitate the translation of genomic discoveries to clinical practice and public health, in keeping with the NHLBI's mission to promote the prevention and treatment of heart, lung, and blood diseases and enhance the health of all individuals so that they can live longer and more fulfilling lives.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The proposed work will identify new genes associated with COPD and place them in a multivariate context so as to develop a better understanding of how genetic differences and environmental exposures contribute to the development of COPD.

"Population Genetics Theory    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Four areas of theoretical population genetics will be studied. In the first, we will develop mathematical and statistical framework for studying the evolution of genes that affect how other sets of genes interact with one another. This theory helps in understanding conditions under which the genome can be expected to become modular in its production of phenotypes, as well as when synergy between mutations in different genes should be produced by evolution. We shall study how the pattern of interaction between deleterious mutations evolves as a function of the mutation rate, the recombination rate, and the degree of fitness loss of each mutation. We shall also study buildup of statistical association between genes that influence culturally transmitted traits that are associated either through transmission or through fitness. The second area of study concerns the evolution of pathogens such as influenza. Here we build models to predict the accumulation of mutations during epidemics and pandemics in a way that can assist in guiding vaccination strategies. We will develop algorithms that search for potential recombinants and reassortants among a collection of up to 1000 viral sequences. Here we aim to devise a statistical test to indicate whether identified recombinants or reassortants are spurious or statistically significant. Our recent theory of niche construction will form the basis of studies of how pathogens might evolve in response to human actions that they induce, such as use of antibiotics. The final research area will develop multiple-gene models for sex-linked control of genomic imprinting. These will include cis and trans modifiers of imprinting.

"Population Genetics Theory    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Four areas of theoretical population genetics will be studied. In the first, we will develop mathematical and statistical framework for studying the evolution of genes that affect how other sets of genes interact with one another. This theory helps in understanding conditions under which the genome can be expected to become modular in its production of phenotypes, as well as when synergy between mutations in different genes should be produced by evolution. We shall study how the pattern of interaction between deleterious mutations evolves as a function of the mutation rate, the recombination rate, and the degree of fitness loss of each mutation. We shall also study buildup of statistical association between genes that influence culturally transmitted traits that are associated either through transmission or through fitness. The second area of study concerns the evolution of pathogens such as influenza. Here we build models to predict the accumulation of mutations during epidemics and pandemics in a way that can assist in guiding vaccination strategies. We will develop algorithms that search for potential recombinants and reassortants among a collection of up to 1000 viral sequences. Here we aim to devise a statistical test to indicate whether identified recombinants or reassortants are spurious or statistically significant. Our recent theory of niche construction will form the basis of studies of how pathogens might evolve in response to human actions that they induce, such as use of antibiotics. The final research area will develop multiple-gene models for sex-linked control of genomic imprinting. These will include cis and trans modifiers of imprinting. Fertility selection as well as sex- specific viabilities will be studied in order to clarify the role of multiple paternities, which has been proposed as a driving force in the evolution of genomic imprinting.

"Genome-Wide Association Analysis of Bladder Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       This proposal builds on a rich resource of bladder cancer (BC) cases and controls derived from two ongoing BC studies at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, and from two large independent U.S. BC studies - the New England BC Study and the New Hampshire BC Study. The goal is to identify genetic loci that predispose individuals to BC through a genome-wide scanning approach. There are five specific aims. Aim 1 is to first perform genome-wide, high-density SNP genotyping using the Illumina HumanHap550 SNP platform on 800 cases and 800 controls from M.D. Anderson, with a target of candidate SNPs of about 28,000; followed by an internal validation to narrow down candidate SNPs to about 1,536 using additional 800 pairs of cases and controls. Illumina's Custom Infinium array will be the genotyping format. In this aim, in addition to individual SNP analysis, we will also implement haplotype-based analyses and pathway aggregation analysis to identify additional genetic loci that might have been overlooked using individual SNP analysis. Aim 2 is the first external validation of the 1,536 SNPs from Aim 1 using 1,000 pairs of cases and controls from the New England BC Study. Illumina's GoldenGate assay will be the genotyping format. After this stage, the candidate SNPs will be narrowed down to about 100. Aim 3 is the second independent external validation using 750 pairs of cases and controls form the New Hampshire BC Study. In this aim, the 100 top candidate SNPs passed from Aims 1 and 2 plus additional functional SNPs in genes containing these SNPs will be genotyped. GoldenGate assay will be used for this aim. Aim 4 is to perform fine mapping studies in the flanking regions of each of the top 25 SNP loci confirmed in Aim 3 to identify causative loci. This will utilize all 6,700 cases and controls. An average of 15 additional SNPs (tagging SNPs and functional SNPs) per gene is expected. Aim 5 is to apply novel machine-learning tools to identify any gene-environment and gene-gene interactions greatly influencing risk for BC in all the 6700 subjects. These analyses will be utilized to examine SNP main effect and develop and validate algorithms that will identify individuals at highest risk for BC, given their personal exposure patterns and their genetic risk profiles. This proposal applies state of art technology to perform a multistage, genome-wide SNP analysis in three largest, well-characterized U.S. population of BC cases and controls, and incorporates complete epidemiologic data and rich and unique functional data. In addition, results from this study will be provided to the International Consortium of BC Case Control Studies for future validation. The ability to identify genetically susceptible, high-risk subgroups that would benefit from intensive screening and/or chemopreventive interventions is of immense clinical and public health benefit. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Bladder cancer (BC) is a disease mainly caused by smoking and occupational exposure. However, only a small percentage of exposed individuals develop BC. Inherited host genetic factors may play an important role in determining an individual's susceptibility to BC. This proposal builds on three largest well-characterized U.S. populations of BC cases and controls - the M. D. Anderson BC study, the New England BC Study and the New Hampshire BC Study. A total of 6700 cases and controls will be used. The goal is to identify genetic loci that predispose individuals to BC through a non-biased, discovery- driven, genome-wide scanning approach and to incorporate complete epidemiologic data and rich and unique functional data. About 550,000 genetic variations of human genome will be initially screened in an M.D. Anderson population consisting of an equal number of BC cases and normal controls. About 28,000 top candidate variations that are potentially associated with increased BC risk will be first narrowed down and internally replicated in a second M.D. Anderson population, and then be validated in the other two independent U.S. BC populations. Finally, the causative genetic loci that predispose individuals to BC will be mapped. This study is significant because by identifying BC susceptibility loci, it will shed light into the biological mechanisms of BC etiology. Furthermore, it may facilitate identifying high-risk subgroups of individuals for BC, given their genetic makeup and environmental exposures. The ability to identify high-risk subgroups of individuals for BC will provide immense public health benefit for those high- risk people who may be subjected to close surveillance and chemoprevention.          n/a",Genome-Wide Association Analysis of Bladder Cancer,7799290,U01CA127615,"['Adopted', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Arts', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Bladder', 'Cancer Center', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Case Series', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Cycle Regulation', 'Chemoprevention', 'Chemopreventive Agent', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Custom', 'Cytogenetics', 'DNA', 'DNA Repair', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dietary Practices', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Haplotypes', 'Health Benefit', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Inherited', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Length', 'Light', 'Location', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder', 'Maps', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutagens', 'New England', 'New Hampshire', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Occupational Exposure', 'One-Step dentin bonding system', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Penetrance', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Plasma Cells', 'Play', 'Polymorphism Analysis', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Public Health', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reproduction spores', 'Resources', 'Review Literature', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Serum', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Smoking', 'Specimen', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Subgroup', 'Suspension substance', 'Suspensions', 'TNFRSF5 gene', 'Technology', 'University of Texas M D Anderson Cancer Center', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'aggregation pathway', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'carcinogenesis', 'case control', 'college', 'computer based statistical methods', 'cost', 'density', 'design', 'epidemiologic data', 'follow-up', 'gene interaction', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'high risk', 'medical specialties', 'novel', 'parent grant', 'public health relevance', 'repository', 'telomere', 'tool']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,U01,2010,1196434,0.005077224210517462
"Genetic Factors in Keratoconus    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this grant is to identify susceptibility genes involved in the pathogenesis of keratoconus (KC). We will achieve our goal by: 1) refining criteria for the early detection of KC using videokeratography and wavefront Zernike variables; 2) comprehensively testing genes under newly identified linkage peaks generated through genome wide linkage scans of KC families, and performing comprehensive positional candidate gene association studies; and 3) characterizing specific genetic variants that predispose an individual to developing KC. We will study a cohort comprising: normal controls, patients with 'early' KC, KC 'suspect', and KC relatives with videokeratography and aberrometry in order to determine the best combination of variables that discriminate KC 'suspects' from normals. Study subjects will be followed longitudinally to determine which combination of variables is predictive of progression to KC, and thus define subclinical KC (Aim 1). After genome-wide linkage scan of multiplex KC families, we identified regions with significant or suggestive linkage on chromosomes 4, 5, 9, 11, 12, and 14, confirmed by subsequent fine mapping studies. To follow-up these positive linkage findings, we will conduct a comprehensive positional candidate gene association study by testing all genes in these regions with tagSNPs. Any positive association results will be tested in an independent sample for confirmation (Aim 2). Additionally, using newly identified criteria for defining subclinical markers for KC (combination of videokeratography and aberrometry), we will refine our linkage analysis on families with KC in an attempt identify new linkage peaks which may encompass new potential candidate genes for study. Genes identified by both genetic association studies and expression studies published in the literature to date will be prioritized for further study to identify specific genetic variants that contribute to the susceptibility of KC (Aim 3).  Refining criteria for early detection of KC will provide the tools to prevent many patients from under- going unnecessary surgery and developing post-lasik ectasia, a significant public health issue. It will also facilitate identification of susceptibility genes for KC, which may provide an understanding of the mechanisms contributing to corneal thinning in KC. Ultimately, this work may improve our ability to treat KC and/or prevent the development of KC.          n/a",Genetic Factors in Keratoconus,7780356,R01EY009052,"['Affect', 'Biological Markers', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 4', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Cornea', 'Corneal Diseases', 'Data', 'Data Linkages', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Epidemiology', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Etiology', 'Family', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Haplotypes', 'Individual', 'Keratoconus', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathological Dilatation', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Predisposition', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Relative (related person)', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Screening procedure', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Study Subject', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transplantation', 'Unnecessary Surgery', 'Videokeratographies', 'Work', 'aquaporin 5', 'case control', 'cohort', 'corneal epithelium', 'follow-up', 'forest', 'genetic association', 'genetic linkage analysis', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide linkage', 'improved', 'indexing', 'prevent', 'success', 'tool']",NEI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2010,680924,-0.019982374133320564
"Type IV Secretion Determinants in Effector Proteins of Coxiella burnetii    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The transport of virulence factors from bacterium to the eukaryotic host cell has emerged as a fundamental strategy in pathogenesis. Several relevant Gram-negative pathogens use type IV secretion systems (T4SS) for 'effector' protein translocation. Coxiella burnetii, a Category B select agent and the causative agent of 'Q' fever is an obligate intracellular vacuolar parasite in vertebrates. After internalization by phagocytes, C.burnetii remodels its vacuole to replicate in a harsh phagolysosomal compartment, likely attributable to the translocation of effector proteins by a T4SS. Due to its obligate intracellular lifestyle, genetic manipulation of C.burnetii remains severely limited. Genomic information revealed however that C.burnetii harbors the genes encoding a T4SS found in Legionella pneumophila called Dot/Icm. Recent studies indicated that expression of C.burnetii (Cb) homologs of the dot/icm components IcmS and IcmW could complement intracellular growth defects of L.pneumophila (Lp) icmS or icmW mutants. We have established that IcmS and IcmW form a complex in the Legionella cytoplasm, and are important for early stages of substrate recognition. The goal of this study is to use L.pneumophila as a surrogate host for the characterization of specific secretion determinants of recently identified effector proteins from C.burnetii. Using molecular, genetic, and biochemical strategies, we will determine secretion signal signatures on Coxiella effector proteins, and define Cb IcmSW binding sites on Cb effectors. Determination of consensus secretion determinants will be applied to systematic computational approaches through the development of new search algorithms to identify novel effector proteins harbored on the C.burnetii genome. Outcomes from these studies will provide novel targets for antimicrobial development to combat critical stages of effector protein recognition and transport by the T4SS.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Q fever bacterium Coxiella burnetii is an obligate intracellular pathogen whose lifestyle has impeded the development of reliable genetic tractability. We are using Legionella pneumophila, a related bacterium with pathogenic strategies predicted to be conserved, to identify and characterize critical transport determinants on virulence factors. This work will lead to the identification of a new catalog of virulence factors associated with establishment of Q fever, and provide novel targets for antimicrobial development              RELEVANCE STATEMENT The Q fever bacterium Coxiella burnetii is an obligate intracellular pathogen whose lifestyle has impeded the development of reliable genetic tractability.

"Analysis Tool for Heritable and Envirnonmental Network Associations    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The efforts of the human genome project are beginning to provide important findings for human health. Technological advances in the laboratory, particularly in characterizing human genomic variation, have created new approaches for studying the human genome. However, current statistical and computational strategies are taking only partial advantage of this wealth of information. In the quest for disease susceptibility genes for common, complex disease, we are faced with many challenges. Selecting genetic, clinical, and environmental factors important for the trait of interest is increasingly more difficult as high throughput data generation technologies are developed. We know that genes do not act in isolation, thus numerous other factors are likely important in complex disease phenotypes. However, techniques for robust statistical modeling of important variables to predict clinical outcomes are limited in their capability for interaction effects. Ultimately, we want to know what factors are important to provide superior prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of human disease. Unfortunately, interpretation of statistical models in a meaningful way for biomedical research has been lacking due to the inherent difficulty in making such connections. Thus, a technology that embraces the complexity of human disease and integrates multiple data sources including biological knowledge from the public domain, through a powerful analytical framework is essential for dissecting the architecture of common diseases. ATHENA: the Analysis Tool for Heritable and Environmental Network Associations is a novel framework that incorporates variable selection, modeling, and interpretation to learn more about diseases of public health interest. As the field gains experience in analyzing large scale genomic data, it is crucial that we learn from each other and develop and codify the best strategies.            Many common, complex diseases are likely due to a combination of genetic and environmental risk factors. Out ability to extract all of the meaningful information from very large genomic and phenotypic datasets has been limited by our analytic strategies.

"VARIABLE SELECTION IN GENETIC EPIDEMIOLOGICAL STUDIES OF CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) affect millions of people in US and across the world. There is strong evidence of a genetic component in cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and related traits. An emerging consensus is that both genes and environment and, perhaps more importantly, their interactions are responsible for this complex disease. As a result, many genetic epidemiological (GE) studies of CVD use a study design that tests hundreds of thousands of genetic predictors (e.g., single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers) and hundreds of (related) disease phenotypes and environmental covariates. This has brought tremendous analytical challenges, particularly the high dimensionality of the data and the obscure interactions among the many variables. As a result, searching for CVD disease genes has become a task of selecting important variables from a vast number of SNPs and other predictor variables. Our real data analyses in several ongoing large scale CVD related studies motivated us to consider new methodological solutions to the variable selection problem. This application is developed upon these positive preliminary findings. Our main idea is to develop a strategy for selecting important predictors of CVD by integrating multiple sources of information via the method of statistical learning (i.e., optimizing the selection by repeated learning from examples). In this strategy, we will first develop a method for selecting significant SNPs in moderate-dimensional data (e.g., lower thousands of SNPs, in candidate genes studies) by an integrated classifier. The method will build upon existing techniques assessing information of SNPs in haplotype similarity, imputed functional potential, and gene-gene interactions. We then scale up the new method to the high-dimensional setting of genome-wide association studies (e.g., at least hundreds of thousands of SNPs), by dimension reduction that utilizes the local linkage-disequilibrium (LD) structure in SNPs and by combining latent factor analysis of correlated CVD traits and pathway-based analysis to account for gene-environment (GxE) interactions. A fast-search algorithm will also be developed based on an existing search heuristic that was successfully applied in high-dimensional data of gene expression and genomic sequence analysis. The new methods and algorithms will be coded into R programs and distributed as tool set for an association analysis pipeline. Evaluations of the new methods will be performed by intensive simulation studies and by applying to existing datasets in ongoing studies of CVD and related diseases. Results from evaluation studies, together with the ancillary databases generated by the study such as imputed functional scores of potential or known CVD SNPs will be distributed on a dedicated project website. By doing so, we believe that the utilities resulted from the proposed research will make a significant contribution to many ongoing genetic epidemiological studies of CVD and related traits.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project is aimed at timely development of computational tools for emerging large-scale genome-wide association studies of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) that affect millions of people in US and across the world. The new methods deal with the analytical challenges brought forth by the high dimensionality of the data and the obscure interactions among the many variables in these studies, and the tools will be applied to ongoing studies of CVD and related diseases.

"Methods for high-resolution analysis of genetic effects on gene expression    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Summary Gene expression is a fundamental function of any cell. It is the main mechanism by which information is transmitted from the nucleus to the rest of the cell and eventually to other cells and the body of the organism. Genetic variation in components of the transcriptional machinery and signals that regulate gene function generates variation in transcriptional response and consequently variation in phenotypes. It has become apparent that many of the common genetic signals associated with disease are found away from the DNA sequence that encodes for protein sequence and is likely to be functioning in regulating gene expression. In this project we propose to develop methodologies that will explore the consequences of genetic variation in gene expression. There are three main goals of this project. First we will explore and develop methodologies to mine information from experiments that perform deep sequencing of the human transcriptome. The new sequencing technologies are providing us with unprecedented resolution into the transcriptome but are also raising challenges in the computational and biological models to use to interpret such large amounts of data. Secondly, we will use high-resolution genetic data to develop and use methodologies to dissect the fine structure of genetic variants that affect regulation of gene expression. Finally, we will implement and test models to infer the higher-order interactions of genome function so as to dig deeply into the biological consequences of genetic variants and how the signal is transmitted from the DNA sequence to higher levels of cell and body function. Our goals is to develop methodologies that will significantly improve our insight to the variability in human populations and assist in interpreting predisposition to genetic diseases.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:    Project narrative The proposed project aims at the development of statistical methods for the interpretation and study of the impact of genetic variants in cell function.

"Genome Wide Association Study of Head and Neck Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Head and neck cancers have well-documented associations with tobacco and alcohol exposure, but the disease develops in only a small fraction of users, which implies an important role for genetic susceptibility. Therefore, head and neck cancers are an excellent model for studying genetic susceptibility to environmental carcinogens. The primary goal of this R01 application is to perform a comprehensive two-stage, high-density, genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis of head and neck cancer cases and corresponding frequency matched controls to identify novel genetic risk factors for head and neck cancer. This proposal builds upon a well-annotated existing DNA repository of cases and controls. One of the unique features of our study is the availability of DNA repair assay data on most of the cases and controls in this study, which will allow us to conduct genotype/phenotype analyses. We also have access to genome-wide association data from 1200 white control subjects from the same source population. In aim 1, we will perform genotyping on 1000 randomly selected head and neck cancer cases and 500 controls using a 370K Illumina Infinium HapMap HumanCNV370-Duo SNP Chip. We will perform association analyses (1000 cases and 1700 controls) in the first stage using outcome variable as case-control status as well as DNA repair capacity assay data. Our second aim is to perform second-stage analysis of the SNPs selected in stage 1 using 900 additional cases and corresponding controls from the same source and from UCLA. We will use efficient joint analysis of cases and controls from the first and second aims, for a total of 1900 cases and 2600 controls. Finally, in aim 3, we will apply novel statistical tools such as the latent variable approach with Tukey's one-degree-of-freedom test and support vector machines to identify gene-gene and gene-environment (using environmental factors such as smoking and alcohol use) interactions that contribute to the risk of head and neck cancer. We are an experienced investigative team proposing a comprehensive analysis that incorporates epidemiological, behavioral, and functional data. Identification of novel genetic risk factors and their interactions with environmental factors will contribute to the early diagnosis of head and neck cancers.

"Pathway-based analysis of addiction susceptibility genes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Susceptibility to alcohol and substance dependence is known to be influenced by genetic factors. However, few specific genetic variations that alter susceptibility to addiction have been identified. This is partly because addiction is a polygenic trait, influenced by many genetic variations, each with a small marginal effect. Phenotypic characteristics are controlled by networks of interacting biochemical and physiological pathways influenced by the products of specific genes. While single genetic variants result in small changes in susceptibility to complex diseases, it is the combined effects of genes within a biochemical pathway that likely drive phenotype expression.  The research proposed in this application aims to apply novel pathway-based methods to analyze existing data from a genome wide association study of alcoholism. Case-control alcohol dependence data from the Study of Addiction: Genetics and Environment (SAGE), collected by Dr. Laura Bierut and colleagues, will be analyzed. The methods that will be applied take into account known relationships between genes and their products and assess the effect of gene-sets that represent biological pathways, rather than assessing individual gene effects. Once significant pathways are identified, comprehensive analyses of genes within these pathways will be performed, to characterize the genetic effects, including interactions between genetic variations. These analyses will utilize random forest methods and LASSO logistic regression with gene-gene interaction effects.  The long term goals of this research are to improve the detection of interacting genetic risk factors for substance addiction and subtypes of substance use disorders, by applying optimal statistical techniques. While studying all possible interactions between SNPs from a genome-wide scan may not be practical, a focused approach of investigating genetic interactions within a relevant pathway is expected to be more powerful and yield interpretable results.  Analysis of existing data using new statistical methods that account for the relationships between genes that act as part of common neural or molecular pathways has great potential to identify genetic variations that contribute to individual differences in addiction susceptibility. Discovery of such genetic risk factors has important implications including increasing our understanding of the pathways of development of addiction and risk prediction. Perhaps more importantly, this knowledge is expected to help identify subtypes of addiction that require different interventions leading to personalized treatment with increased success rates.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Although progress has been made in terms of understanding the heritable aspects of alcoholism and other substance use disorders, few specific genetic risk factors have been identified. Recently, new methods for analyzing genetic data have been proposed that take into account known relationships between genes that contribute to common biological pathways. The research proposed in this application will apply such approaches to analyze data from a genetic study of alcoholism. Results of this study are expected to help identify sets of genes that contribute to individual differences in susceptibility to substance dependence, leading to improved diagnosis and management of addiction based on an individualized treatment approach.           Project Narrative: Although progress has been made in terms of understanding the heritable aspects of alcoholism and other substance use disorders, few specific genetic risk factors have been identified.

"Multigenic Dissection of Nonsyndromic Oral Clefts    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed 5-year career development award will provide training and experience in bioinformatics and the administration of large-scale epidemiologic studies and will prepare the applicant for a leadership role in the field of complex diseases. One of the strengths of the proposed plan is the commitment of three mentors with diverse and unique areas of expertise. They will oversee a phased development program to provide new and enhanced multidisciplinary skills in study management, the statistical genetics of complex disease, bioinformatics and computational biology, and the ethical issues associated with public health genomics. It will provide the specific and varied skills required to succeed in a career devoted to responsibly-conducted epidemiologic studies that employ state-of-the-art molecular and computational methods to elucidate the mechanisms of complex human diseases. In her research, the applicant will use DNA from mothers and infants enrolled in a large-scale birth defects surveillance study to investigate the multigenic origins of nonsyndromic oral clefts (NOC) using a novel application of a proven analytical approach, Bayesian networks. In accomplishing the first aim, she will identify and validate the most probable network linking the phenotype of isolated NOC to the candidate maternal and subject single nucleotide polymorphisms and environmental exposures among the majority race/ethnicity. Through the second aim, she will validate two approaches to phenotying non-isolated NOC. Finally, she will determine whether the model(s) generated in Aims 1 and 2 can be generalized to minority race/ethnicity groups. This project will provide the framework upon which the investigator will prepare for an independent research career. Additionally, by being the first investigation to concurrently consider the candidate environmental exposures and SNPs in several candidate genes previously associated with NOC in association studies, this work has the potential to move the study of NOC dramatically forward. Relevance: Cleft lip and/or cleft palate are among the most common birth defects have serious physical, psychological, and financial consequences for those affected. Despite this, little is known about the causes of these anomalies because clefts are the result of genetic and environmental risk factors, rather than a single factor. The proposed research has the potential to make a unique contribution to our understanding clefts because it uses novel analytical approaches that allow the simultaneous examination of many potential risk factors.           n/a",Multigenic Dissection of Nonsyndromic Oral Clefts,7809627,K08DE016956,"['Affect', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Arts', 'Bioinformatics', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Cleaved cell', 'Cleft Lip', 'Cleft Palate', 'Cleft lip with or without cleft palate', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Enrollment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Ethical Issues', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Ethnic group', 'Etiology', 'Exposure to', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Infant', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Leadership', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Mentors', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mothers', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Program Development', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'career', 'computer based statistical methods', 'experience', 'heuristics', 'human disease', 'innovation', 'meetings', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'oral cleft', 'psychologic', 'skills', 'surveillance study']",NIDCR,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,K08,2010,129456,0.010083889695131562
"International Cohort Collection for Bipolar Disorder    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Bipolar disorder (BPD) is a major public health priority, responsible for a vast burden of disability, personal suffering, and economic cost. Genetic susceptibility is the strongest known risk factor for BPD, and the identification of specific susceptibility genes would have enormous implications for advancing our understanding of the biology of BPD and revealing novel targets for treatment. The limited success to date of genetic studies of BPD has been due to its complex genetic architecture that likely includes many contributing loci of modest effect. Advances in population genetics and genotyping technologies have recently made the genetic dissection of complex disorders like BPD a feasible project. Genomewide association studies (GWAS) have already identified susceptibility variants underlying a range of other common medical disorders. However, it has become clear that much larger samples than are currently available will be needed to achieve such successes for BPD. This application is a response by an international consortium of investigators to RFA-MH-08-130: ""Genomic Parsing of Bipolar Disorder and Schizophrenia: Studies of Large Cohorts in the U.S. and Across the Globe."" The proposed International Cohort Collection for Bipolar Disorder (ICCBD) will address the need for large-scale DNA and data resources by establishing a uniquely large collection of samples and data from individuals with BPD. The specific aims of this application are 1) to ascertain and collect a large cohort of BPD cases (N = 9000) and unaffected controls (N = 9000) over five years at two U.S. sites (Boston and Los Angeles) using novel high-throughput phenotyping methods; and 2) to construct a harmonized data resource for genetic studies combining phenotypic data from the U.S. case-control sample with a parallel, separately funded European case-control sample (10,000 cases and 10,000 controls) obtained from the UK and Sweden. Separately funded genotyping and genetic analyses of these resources will fully characterize common polymorphisms and copy number variants in the full sample to detect novel risk variants and attempt replication of the most compelling prior findings. This resource, augmented by existing samples, will provide an unprecedented platform for the discovery of the genetic determinants of BPD.

"Computational system to predict novel genetic disease associations    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): High-throughput genotyping, expression, and sequencing technologies and the development of increasingly sophisticated methods for predicting gene-disease interactions have given the new field of genomic-based personalized medicine a wealth of data: more, in fact, than can easily be processed and interpreted. Omicia is in the business of developing computational tools and diagnostics in the field of personalized medicine for cardiovascular disease (CVD). As part of that effort we are developing a software infrastructure that uses these abundant data to identify and prioritize candidate genes and their sequence variations for clinical evaluation. The research proposed in this application has three aims. In Phase II, we will enhance and optimize Omicia's Gene Inference System (GIS), prototyped during the SBIR Phase I project. In Phase II we will add additional capabilities to its candidate gene identification methods. This will build upon the Omicia Disease Genes (ODG) ontology built in Phase I, and add pathway and protein-interaction data and include ""top"" candidates from external publicaly-available clinical studies. In Aim 2, we will enhance the ability of GIS to prioritize sequence variations by improving our novel paralogous-gene variation identification algorithm (iDIP) and by integrating existing amino-acid substitution (AAS) methods. By running these algorithms over all known human genes via dbSNP, we expect to identify a list of candidate variations that will be evaluated in Aim 3 including an in vitro experiment. The goal of Aim 3 is to test the gene- and variant-predictive power of GIS and to compare it to other selection methods. The clinical study will be a single-stage case control design to test the ""top"" variant candidates from Aims 1 & 2 and compare the potential association to well-established genetic markers for the risk of myocardial infarction (MI). With approximately 700 cases and 700 matched controls, our association study will be well powered to test our predicted functional markers for MI. The GIS infrastructure is an integral part of the commercial workflow of Omicia, and will form the basis of the product pipeline. As such, it will serve as licensable commercial technology for the company by helping other biotechnology companies to develop their genetic biomarkers for diagnostic and therapeutic developments (theranostics). In addition, any novel variants drawn from this Phase II study will be licensable and exploitable intellectual property, useful both as the basis for future products in our internal pipeline, as well as potentially valuable additions to our patent portfolio. The Phase II goals of enhancing and clinically validating GIS serve three purposes: proving our methodology as applied to CVD and opening the door to applications in other disease areas; showcasing GIS as a key technology for managing complexity in the post-genomic era and providing clinically-relevant insights; and finally, potentially identifying valuable IP in the form of novel genetic markers for MI.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The outcome of this project will be an evaluated gene inference system (GIS) for identifying gene-disease interactions, with a focus in the area of cardiovascular disease (CVD). This system will be used as part of the Omicia product pipeline, and can also be licensed to third parties. In addition, any novel genetic markers identified as part of the validation study will themselves be valuable additions to the Omicia product and IP portfolio. Omicia's goal is to provide content and analysis tools for molecular diagnostic tests for cardiovascular conditions, with the promise of identifying patients at high risk to enable them to begin preventive care before symptoms appear. Given the prevalence of CVD in the developed world, these products are potentially a great boon to public health, as well as being significant commercial opportunities.           NARRATIVE The outcome of this project will be an evaluated gene inference system (GIS) for identifying gene-disease interactions, with a focus in the area of cardiovascular disease (CVD).

"Microbial Diversity and Genetic Characterization of Cariogenic Biofilms    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed studies are anticipated to yield important new information as to the presence of specific genetic determinants found in Streptococcus mutans, a microbe strongly associated with a severe dental caries in affecting young children called severe early childhood caries or S-ECC. The long-term benefit of such information should lead researchers toward devising both diagnostic and preventive strategies against dental though better understanding its microbial causation. Using a powerful technique of suppressive subtraction DNA hybridization, the first specific aim is to test the hypothesis that strains of S. mutans found in S-ECC children differ in genetic composition compared to strains found in caries-free (CF) children. Unique genetic loci that are specific to S-ECC strains will be identified and characterized. Some of these genetic loci will prove informative as biomarkers for health or disease. Using the power of multiple test analyses derived artificial intelligence programming; biomarkers will be used as the basis for a modeling algorithm capable of classifying strains of S. mutans in one of two categories (S-ECC or CF). The second aim of this study is to survey strains of S. mutans associated with either S-ECC or CF status for known or suspected genetic elements thought to influence the pathogenesis or virulence of S. mutans. The third aim is to survey a larger, racial/ethnical diverse population of S-ECC or CF children for the presence or absence of the biomarkers identified in the first two aims. It is anticipated that this research will yield genetic markers for disease capable of providing clinicians with a diagnostic test that can assess risk for developing S-ECC. 7.           n/a",Microbial Diversity and Genetic Characterization of Cariogenic Biofilms,7568847,R01DE013937,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological Markers', 'Categories', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Coupling', 'DNA', 'Dental', 'Dental caries', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Dot Immunoblotting', 'Effectiveness', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomic Islands', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'Hispanics', 'Infant', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Microbe', 'Microbial Biofilms', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mothers', 'Pathogenesis', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevention strategy', 'Process', 'Programmed Learning', 'Public Health', 'Pulsed-Field Gel Electrophoresis', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Series', 'Severity of illness', 'Streptococcus mutans', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Virulence', 'Virulence Factors', 'base', 'early childhood', 'experience', 'genetic element', 'microbial', 'programs', 'research study', 'tool']",NIDCR,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R01,2009,370919,0.015845786354051677
"Machine Learning Analysis of Genetic Modulators of Vaccine Immune Response Abstract Machine Learning Analysis of Genetic Modulators of Vaccine Immune Response. This proposal describes the development of a machine-learning strategy to identify interacting susceptibility loci in polygenic biological endpoints, with a focus on smallpox and anthrax vaccine-related adverse events (AEs) and variation in serologic antibody response. The appearance of AEs following smallpox vaccination stems from excess stimulation of inflammatory pathways and is likely affected by multiple, interacting genetic factors. Some of these gene-gene interactions may be epistatic, having no distinct marginal effect for any single variant. Analytical approaches are needed for testing association in genome-wide data to account for conditional dependencies between genetic variants while still accounting for co-occurring variants with high marginal effects. We have introduced a machine-learning feature selection and optimization method called Evaporative Cooling (EC), which is based on information theory and the statistical thermodynamics of cooling a system of interacting particles by evaporation. The objective of the EC learner is the identification of susceptibility or protective genes in genome-wide DNA sequence data. This novel filter method, which includes no assumptions regarding gene interaction architecture or interaction order, has been shown to identify a spectrum of disease susceptibility models, including marginal main effects and pure interaction effects. Characterizing the genetic basis of multifactorial phenotypes in genome-wide sequence data is also computationally challenging due to the presence of a large number of noise variants, or variants that are irrelevant to the phenotype. Thus, the EC algorithm evaporates (i.e., removes) noise variants, leaving behind a minimal collection of variants enriched for relevance to the given phenotype. We propose to advance this method to characterize and interpret singe-gene, gene-gene and gene-environment interactions all of which may modulate complex phenotypes such as vaccine-associated AEs and human immune response. This strategy will be developed with the aid of artificial data, simulated under a variety of conditions observed in real data, and the strategy will be tested on single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and clinical data from volunteers from a NIAID/NIH-sponsored trial to evaluate the Aventis Pasteur Smallpox Vaccine and a Center for Disease Control sponsored trial to evaluate Anthrax Vaccine Adsorbed. Susceptibility to common complex disorders is likely due to a combination of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions as well as single-gene associations. In this proposal, we will develop a new bioinformatics strategy for identifying networks of single- nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that influence susceptibility to complex disorders from genome-wide data. The proposed strategy will be developed to identify networks associated with adverse events and the human immune response following smallpox and anthrax vaccination.",Machine Learning Analysis of Genetic Modulators of Vaccine Immune Response,7919847,R56AI080932,"['Accounting', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anthrax Vaccines', 'Anthrax disease', 'Antibody Formation', 'Appearance', 'Architecture', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Classification', 'Clinical Data', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Coupling', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Decision Trees', 'Dependency', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Engineering', 'Gases', 'Gene Combinations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Epistasis', 'Genetic Models', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Immune response', 'Immunity', 'Inflammatory', 'Information Theory', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Noise', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Predisposition', 'Research', 'Sample Size', 'Serological', 'Simulate', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Smallpox', 'Smallpox Vaccine', 'Software Tools', 'Statistical Methods', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'System', 'Testing', 'Thermodynamics', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccines', 'Variant', 'abstracting', 'base', 'evaporation', 'forest', 'gene environment interaction', 'gene interaction', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic association', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genome-wide analysis', 'novel', 'open source', 'particle', 'stem', 'user-friendly', 'volunteer']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF TULSA,R56,2009,346329,-0.0054958178594724325
"Machine Learning Prediction of Cancer Susceptibility    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Susceptibility to sporadic forms of cancer is determined by numerous genetic factors that interact in a nonlinear manner in the context of an individual's age and environmental exposure. This complex genetic architecture has important implications for the use of genome-wide association studies for identifying susceptibility genes. The assumption of a simple architecture supports a strategy of testing each single- nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) individually using traditional univariate statistics followed by a correction for multiple tests. However, a complex genetic architecture that is characteristic of most types of cancer requires analytical methods that specifically model combinations of SNPs and environmental exposures. While new and novel methods are available for modeling interactions, exhaustive testing of all combinations of SNPs is not feasible on a genome-wide scale because the number of comparisons is effectively infinite. Thus, it is critical that we develop intelligent strategies for selecting subsets of SNPs prior to combinatorial modeling. Our objective is to develop a research strategy for the detection, characterization, and interpretation of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions in a genome-wide association study of bladder cancer susceptibility. To accomplish this objective, we will develop and evaluate modifications and extensions to the ReliefF algorithm for selecting or filtering subsets of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for multifactor dimensionality reduction. (MDR) analysis of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions (AIM 1). We will develop and evaluate a stochastic wrapper or search strategy for MDR analysis of interactions that utilizes ReliefF values as a heuristic (AIM 2). The filter approach will be statisyically compared to the wrapper approach. The best ReliefF strategies will be provided as part of our open-source MDR software package (AIM 3).

"Machine Learning to Identify Complex Interactions in Genome-Wide Association Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The focus of this application is the development and validation of new computational approaches to identify complex interactions among genetic and environmental factors (features) which could be used to help identify individuals at high risk for a specific disease or dysfunction, and provide novel insights into the pathophysiology of the conditions in question. Specific Aims of the application include: 1 )To adapt a variety of statistical machine learning methods to the analysis of simulated high density genome scan and environmental exposure data and to evaluate their ability to identify SNPs and environmental factors that are jointly predictive of a binary trait; 2)To apply the described feature selection and model building techniques to the genome-wide SNP genotype data collected from two NHLBI-funded genome-wide association studies: a) the SNPs and Atherosclerosis (SEA) study predicting premature atherosclerosis, and b) the Cholesterol and Pharmacogenetics of Statins (CAPS) Study predicting LDL cholesterol; 3) to develop a study-specific publicly accessible web-site designed to help disseminate the methods and results of the project and 4) to support the NIH-wide Genes and Environment Initiative (GEI). This proposal represents a unique collaboration focusing on the development of new methods to more effectively identify interacting genetic and environmental factors that account for variation in risk for common cardiovascular and other disease phenotypes. If the risk is determined, in part by a gene-environment interaction, the preventive intervention could include altering the environmental exposure. Furthermore, determining specific genetic and/or environmental factors that jointly influence risk may reveal new biologic pathways that would be appropriate targets for novel therapeutic interventions. Together, improved risk stratification and new pathophysiologic insights would be expected to reduce the burden of disease and accelerate the realization of true personalized medicine. Relevance of this research to public health: This project aims to develop new approaches to identify the relationship between genetic and environmental factors which could then be used to identify people at high risk for a disease. Determining specific genetic and/or environmental factors that influence a person's risk of disease may help doctors reduce risk for disease and reveal new treatments for disease.

"Novel Statistical Methods for Human Gene Mapping    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many common human diseases originate in part from the complicated effects of multiple genetic variants found throughout the genome. Given the enormous impact of such diseases on public health, it is imperative to map relevant genetic variants to improve our understanding of the molecular basis of such diseases, as well as improve screening techniques for disease prevention. To this end, successful human gene mapping of complex diseases requires the development and application of powerful statistical methods that fully utilize the resources of the Human Genome Project. This grant proposes a set of such statistical methods that either address novel problems or improve existing solutions to problems in human gene mapping studies. These proposed methods are applicable to a variety of genetic studies as they address topics in linkage, linkage disequilibrium, and high-dimensional genetic analyses of complex diseases and disease-related quantitative traits. The methods can be partitioned into the two general groups: mixed-modeling procedures and case-control likelihood procedures. The mixed-modeling procedures considered include a general variance-component (VC) mapping framework for continuous and discrete trait data and a modified VC mapping framework that allows for haplotypes. Also considered is a novel linear-mixed-model framework that identifies a large combination of genetic variants that influence a quantitative trait using support-vector- machine regression. The case-control likelihood procedures considered are extensions of the approach of Epstein and Satten (2003) for haplotype inference on disease. Extensions considered include allowing for covariates and haplotype-covariate interactions, and also categorical disease outcomes. The proposed statistical methods in this grant have the potential to increase the power to identify genetic variants that influence complex diseases and disease-related quantitative traits. This project will evaluate the performance of these methods using simulations based on the study design and data from an existing gene mapping study of type 2 diabetes. Also, this grant will implement the proposed statistical methods in user- friendly, efficient software for public distribution. Finally, this project will be opportunistic in identifying and addressing unforseen statistical problems arising in human gene mapping studies.           n/a",Novel Statistical Methods for Human Gene Mapping,7682282,R01HG003618,"['Address', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biochemical Reaction', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Categories', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Chromosomes', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Finland', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Grant', 'Haplotypes', 'Human Gene Mapping', 'Human Genome Project', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Nature', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Normal Statistical Distribution', 'Other Genetics', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Screening procedure', 'Series', 'Severity of illness', 'Solutions', 'Statistical Methods', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'United States', 'Variant', 'base', 'case control', 'disorder prevention', 'flexibility', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic variant', 'human disease', 'improved', 'interest', 'non-genetic', 'novel', 'programs', 'simulation', 'trait', 'user-friendly']",NHGRI,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2009,291480,0.012542252317915014
"Machine learning to identify predictive SNPs and complex interaction effects    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Susceptibility to complex diseases is determined by the coordinated function of multiple genetic variants and environmental factors interacting in a composite and potentially nonlinear manner. Although the genome-wide views provided by advanced single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays present an opportunity to discover previously unrecognized genomic patterns, the ability to recognize such complex features of genetic architecture has important implications for the use of genome-wide association study to discover genetic determinants of health and disease from massive genomic data. The focus of this application is the development and validation of effective computational statistics approaches to detect complex interaction effects of multi-locus SNPs which could be useful for classification and prediction of disease or dysfunction, and provide novel insights into the pathogenesis of complex phenotypes. Based on very promising preliminary studies, the specific aims of this R21 application are carefully designed: (1) to refine and evaluate the recently developed significant conditional association (SCA) criterion and heuristic combinatorial interaction growing (HCIG) search strategy (specifically designed to discover complex interaction effects of multi-locus jointly-predictive SNPs), test and validate on real SNP based realistic simulations and compare with a panel of most relevant existing methods; and (2) to apply SCA- HCIG method to the real SNP data of NIAMS-funded FMS cohort in relationship to metabolic syndrome etc. and develop SNP marker based classification/ prediction models, assessed by the prediction power and initial biological plausibility of the implicated SNP subsets. This proposal represents a unique cross-disciplinary collaboration focusing on the development of new analytical methods to more effectively identify interacting susceptibility SNPs and environmental factors that can be used to determine individual risk to a specific disease and to estimate prognosis and response to treatment. The results could also suggest novel preventive intervetions and therapeutic targets, reduce the burden of diseases, and accelerate the realization of truly personalized medicine.           Principal Investigator/Program Director (Last, First, Middle): Wang, Yue (Joseph), Ph.D. Machine learning to identify predictive SNPs and complex interaction effects Project Narrative  Susceptibility to complex diseases is determined by the coordinated function of multiple genetic and environmental factors.

"Informatic profiling of clinically relevant mutation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       We are submitting this proposal pursuant to NOT-0D-09-058, NIH Announces the Availability of Recovery Act Funds for Competitive Revision Applications.       Our group focuses on understanding how amino acid substitutions disrupt molecular functions that cause human disease. In our currently funded R01, we are developing methods we call in silico functional profiling. This method works by learning residue-specific protein function and then estimates when it is disrupted. This research funds our efforts to characterize what the underlying molecular disruption a protein mutation is causing and thereby improve accuracy of these approaches. In this competitive revision application, we are proposing to expand our efforts to the challenge of understanding genetic disease mutations and polymorphisms that affect gene expression regulation or transcript splicing. Additionally, we have formed collaborations with genetic data managers and will apply all of our methods to aid in their research and identify new testable hypotheses. We will do this in three supplemental aims. First, we will evaluate genomic features for prediction of regulatory nucleotide substitutions and construct new methods to aid in their classification. Second, we will collaboratively work to develop machine learning methods for classification of nucleotide substitutions that disrupt transcript splicing. Finally, we will work to collaboratively annotate genetic data found in inherited disease, pharmacogenetics and somatic mutations in cancer. Together this Recovery Act proposal will fund two groups in bioinformatics and will support trainees, technical staff, and two faculty members.           7.

"Genetics of Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis and Subtypes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA) is a childhood onset autoimmune arthropathy characterized by inflammation of joints and other tissues. It is a debilitating disorder in which progressive joint damage and resulting growth disorders may occur. It is the most common chronic childhood rheumatic disease in the Western world. There are at least seven subtypes that comprise JIA and these subtypes clearly differ by age of onset and gender. JIA has a strong genetic influence with sibling risk ratios of approximately 20 (S=20). However, genetic influences vary by subtypes, age of onset and gender. We propose to analyze existing genome-wide association (GWA) data on 800 JIA cases and greater than 3,000 controls of European ancestry and genotyped on the Affymetrix 500K and Affymetrix 6.0 platforms for targeted hypotheses beyond the current case:control study. We hypothesize that loci contributing to the risk of JIA can be identified through contrasting and partitioning into more homogeneous subtypes of JIA and testing for the modifying effects on these loci's risks through interactions with HLA polymorphisms, age of onset and gender. We propose to identify genetic factors of JIA via 1) the use of imputation methods to test for association with JIA and subtypes for all HapMap SNPs with minor allele frequency greater than 2%; 2) computing GWA analysis for age of onset, SNP-by-gender interaction, SNP-by-HLA interaction and SNP-by-SNP interactions; 3) identifying regions of loss of heterozygosity and copy number variation predictive of JIA and its subtypes; and 4) computing GWA for expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) in individuals with both Affymetrix 6.0 and existing global gene expression data. The proposal includes well powered GWA analyses for JIA, novel methods such as statistical machine learning for interaction analyses, and integration of expression and genotype data. The proposed series of analyses will assist in our long- term goal of understanding JIA, while recognizing the diversity of conditions known as JIA and making the discoveries of greater relevance for diagnosis, prognosis and treatment.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:    Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA) is a childhood onset autoimmune disease characterized by inflammation of joints and other tissues.

"A National Consortium to Explore the Genotypic Basis for ESRD in Lupus    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): End stage renal disease (ESRD), one of the most serious and costly complications of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), occurs in a sub-set of patients with SLE-related renal involvement. Factors predisposing to ESRD presumably include both genetics and environmental factors, and there is unequivocal evidence that ESRD disproportionately affects lupus persons of African American descent. Data in SLE-related ESRD suggest that at least two genetic factors, -- certain allelic variants of the genes FCGR3A and MYH9, -- contribute to ESRD risk. However, two genes alone do not define the scope of genetic risk for ESRD. Therefore, building on our precedent data for genetic contributions, it is timely to undertake a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify the genetic risk factors for ESRD in European American (EA) and African Americans (AA) with lupus nephritis (LN/ESRD). Until now, two major barriers have precluded such a study. Technical limitations in genotyping platform and coverage have been overcome with the Illumina Human Omni- 1 Quad BeadChip. To surmount the second barrier of limited study populations, we have assembled an unprecedented team of rheumatologists, nephrologists and statistical geneticists with IRB protocols active, the clinical studies infrastructure in place and the patient collections and clinical data more than 75% in hand. Thus (1) Our first aim is to characterize the genetic susceptibility factors associated with ESRD by performing a  GWAS with 800 EA LN/ESRD and 800 AA LN/ESRD compared to lupus subjects of each ethnicity but  without nephritis and normal control subjects.  (2) We propose that [gene x gene] and [gene x environment] interactions are biologically important and may be more easily detectable using the machine learning and more modern likelihood-based approaches. Therefore, our second aim is to apply novel approaches to gene discovery and biological pathway characterization including Bayesian networks, alternative decision trees, HyperLasso, and penalized logistic regression.  (3) Finally, our third aim is to build an essential resource, consistent with NIH specimen and data sharing guidelines and supported by the institution. This resource will enable follow-up studies in fine-mapping, deep-sequencing, SNP identification, pathway analysis and methods development. Our consortium leverages current resources and investments by NIAMS, NIDDK, NIEHS, NCRR, CDCP and private foundations to create a unique opportunity to address a major health care challenge. We have a substantial head start, drawing on established networks and clinical research infrastructure, and are poised to identify genetic risk factors, leading to strategies for ESRD reduction, which would enable substantial cost savings and reduction in morbidity and mortality as it reduces ethnic disparities in health outcomes.           7. PROJECT NARRATIVE Drawing on established networks and clinical research infrastructure, this study is uniquely positioned to capitalize on a multidisciplinary team to leverage existing resources to address important questions about the underlying genetic influences on susceptibility to end stage renal disease (ESRD) in lupus. This understanding may lead to strategies for ESRD intervention, may reduce ethnic disparities in health outcome, and may enable substantial cost savings in the health care industry.

"Population Genetics Theory    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Four areas of theoretical population genetics will be studied. In the first, we will develop mathematical and statistical framework for studying the evolution of genes that affect how other sets of genes interact with one another. This theory helps in understanding conditions under which the genome can be expected to become modular in its production of phenotypes, as well as when synergy between mutations in different genes should be produced by evolution. We shall study how the pattern of interaction between deleterious mutations evolves as a function of the mutation rate, the recombination rate, and the degree of fitness loss of each mutation. We shall also study buildup of statistical association between genes that influence culturally transmitted traits that are associated either through transmission or through fitness. The second area of study concerns the evolution of pathogens such as influenza. Here we build models to predict the accumulation of mutations during epidemics and pandemics in a way that can assist in guiding vaccination strategies. We will develop algorithms that search for potential recombinants and reassortants among a collection of up to 1000 viral sequences. Here we aim to devise a statistical test to indicate whether identified recombinants or reassortants are spurious or statistically significant. Our recent theory of niche construction will form the basis of studies of how pathogens might evolve in response to human actions that they induce, such as use of antibiotics. The final research area will develop multiple-gene models for sex-linked control of genomic imprinting. These will include cis and trans modifiers of imprinting. Fertility selection as well as sex- specific viabilities will be studied in order to clarify the role of multiple paternities, which has been proposed as a driving force in the evolution of genomic imprinting. Genomic data from mammalian species will be analyzed using tools from statistical learning in order to predict which genes are likely to be imprinted. Correlations between DMA sequence properties and predicted imprinting status based on life history characteristics will also be sought.           n/a",Population Genetics Theory,7631265,R01GM028016,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Antibiotics', 'Antigens', 'Area', 'Bacteria', 'Bacteriophages', 'Characteristics', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Development', 'Drug Formulations', 'Epidemic', 'Evolution', 'Fertility', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Epistasis', 'Genetic Models', 'Genetic Recombination', 'Genome', 'Genomic Imprinting', 'Genomics', 'Haploidy', 'Human', 'Influenza', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Mutation', 'Organism', 'Pan Genus', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population Genetics', 'Production', 'Property', 'Recombinants', 'Research', 'Role', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Taxon', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tweens', 'Vaccination', 'Variant', 'Viral', 'Virus', 'base', 'driving force', 'father role', 'fitness', 'gene function', 'genome sequencing', 'imprint', 'influenza epidemic', 'life history', 'pandemic disease', 'pathogen', 'research study', 'response', 'sex', 'social', 'theories', 'tool', 'trait', 'transmission process', 'vaccination strategy']",NIGMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2009,259841,0.0031485842093570745
"Genome-Wide Association Analysis of Bladder Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       This proposal builds on a rich resource of bladder cancer (BC) cases and controls derived from two ongoing BC studies at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, and from two large independent U.S. BC studies - the New England BC Study and the New Hampshire BC Study. The goal is to identify genetic loci that predispose individuals to BC through a genome-wide scanning approach. There are five specific aims. Aim 1 is to first perform genome-wide, high-density SNP genotyping using the Illumina HumanHap550 SNP platform on 800 cases and 800 controls from M.D. Anderson, with a target of candidate SNPs of about 28,000; followed by an internal validation to narrow down candidate SNPs to about 1,536 using additional 800 pairs of cases and controls. Illumina's Custom Infinium array will be the genotyping format. In this aim, in addition to individual SNP analysis, we will also implement haplotype-based analyses and pathway aggregation analysis to identify additional genetic loci that might have been overlooked using individual SNP analysis. Aim 2 is the first external validation of the 1,536 SNPs from Aim 1 using 1,000 pairs of cases and controls from the New England BC Study. Illumina's GoldenGate assay will be the genotyping format. After this stage, the candidate SNPs will be narrowed down to about 100. Aim 3 is the second independent external validation using 750 pairs of cases and controls form the New Hampshire BC Study. In this aim, the 100 top candidate SNPs passed from Aims 1 and 2 plus additional functional SNPs in genes containing these SNPs will be genotyped. GoldenGate assay will be used for this aim. Aim 4 is to perform fine mapping studies in the flanking regions of each of the top 25 SNP loci confirmed in Aim 3 to identify causative loci. This will utilize all 6,700 cases and controls. An average of 15 additional SNPs (tagging SNPs and functional SNPs) per gene is expected. Aim 5 is to apply novel machine-learning tools to identify any gene-environment and gene-gene interactions greatly influencing risk for BC in all the 6700 subjects. These analyses will be utilized to examine SNP main effect and develop and validate algorithms that will identify individuals at highest risk for BC, given their personal exposure patterns and their genetic risk profiles. This proposal applies state of art technology to perform a multistage, genome-wide SNP analysis in three largest, well-characterized U.S. population of BC cases and controls, and incorporates complete epidemiologic data and rich and unique functional data. In addition, results from this study will be provided to the International Consortium of BC Case Control Studies for future validation. The ability to identify genetically susceptible, high-risk subgroups that would benefit from intensive screening and/or chemopreventive interventions is of immense clinical and public health benefit. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Bladder cancer (BC) is a disease mainly caused by smoking and occupational exposure. However, only a small percentage of exposed individuals develop BC. Inherited host genetic factors may play an important role in determining an individual's susceptibility to BC. This proposal builds on three largest well-characterized U.S. populations of BC cases and controls - the M. D. Anderson BC study, the New England BC Study and the New Hampshire BC Study. A total of 6700 cases and controls will be used. The goal is to identify genetic loci that predispose individuals to BC through a non-biased, discovery- driven, genome-wide scanning approach and to incorporate complete epidemiologic data and rich and unique functional data. About 550,000 genetic variations of human genome will be initially screened in an M.D. Anderson population consisting of an equal number of BC cases and normal controls. About 28,000 top candidate variations that are potentially associated with increased BC risk will be first narrowed down and internally replicated in a second M.D. Anderson population, and then be validated in the other two independent U.S. BC populations. Finally, the causative genetic loci that predispose individuals to BC will be mapped. This study is significant because by identifying BC susceptibility loci, it will shed light into the biological mechanisms of BC etiology. Furthermore, it may facilitate identifying high-risk subgroups of individuals for BC, given their genetic makeup and environmental exposures. The ability to identify high-risk subgroups of individuals for BC will provide immense public health benefit for those high- risk people who may be subjected to close surveillance and chemoprevention.          n/a",Genome-Wide Association Analysis of Bladder Cancer,7591153,U01CA127615,"['Adopted', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Arts', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Bladder', 'Cancer Center', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Case Series', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Cycle Regulation', 'Chemoprevention', 'Chemopreventive Agent', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Custom', 'Cytogenetics', 'DNA', 'DNA Repair', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dietary Practices', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Haplotypes', 'Health Benefit', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Inherited', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Length', 'Light', 'Location', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder', 'Maps', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutagens', 'New England', 'New Hampshire', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Occupational Exposure', 'One-Step dentin bonding system', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Penetrance', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Plasma Cells', 'Play', 'Polymorphism Analysis', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Public Health', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reproduction spores', 'Resources', 'Review Literature', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Serum', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Smoking', 'Specimen', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Subgroup', 'Suspension substance', 'Suspensions', 'TNFRSF5 gene', 'Technology', 'University of Texas M D Anderson Cancer Center', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'aggregation pathway', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'carcinogenesis', 'case control', 'college', 'computer based statistical methods', 'cost', 'density', 'design', 'epidemiologic data', 'follow-up', 'gene interaction', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'high risk', 'medical specialties', 'novel', 'parent grant', 'public health relevance', 'repository', 'telomere', 'tool']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,U01,2009,1090595,0.005077224210517462

"Machine vision analysis of C.elegans phenotypic patterns    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The nematode C. elegans has powerful genetics, a well-described nervous system, and a complete genome sequence; thus, it is well suited to analysis of behavior and development at the molecular and cellular levels. In particular, the ability to functionally map the influence of particular genes to specific behavioral consequences makes it possible to use genetic analysis to functionally dissect the molecular mechanisms underlying poorly understood aspects of nervous system function. However, many genes with critical roles in neuronal function have effects on behavior that to a casual observer appear very subtle or difficult to describe precisely. Therefore, to fully realize the potential of C. elegans for the genetic analysis of nervous system function, it is necessary to develop sophisticated methods for the rapid and consistent quantitation of mutant phenotypes, especially those related to behavior.       The goal of this proposed work is to develop computer vision tools for quantitatively characterizing the phenotypic patterns caused by mutations or pharmacological treatments in C. elegans. By making it possible to precisely characterize the behavioral phenotypes of mutants with abnormal locomotion or egglaying, these tools will be particularly useful for correlating specific neurotransmission defects with characteristic behavioral patterns. These analytical tools will also be used to generate a comprehensive database containing complex behavioral data on a large set of mutant strains. This database will make it possible to identify groups of mutants and pharmacological treatments that have similar effects on behavior or development. With the accumulation of increasing phenotypic data on known mutants, it should ultimately be possible to record from unknown mutant or drug-treated animals and make informed initial hypotheses about the functions of uncharacterized genes and the targets of uncharacterized drugs.         n/a",Machine vision analysis of C.elegans phenotypic patterns,7633295,R01DA018341,"['Animals', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Calibration', 'Characteristics', 'Coiled Bodies', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Databases', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Image Analysis', 'Locomotion', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Nematoda', 'Nervous System Physiology', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'Partner in relationship', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Posture', 'Reproducibility', 'Role', 'System', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'egg', 'genetic analysis', 'genome sequencing', 'loss of function', 'mutant', 'neurotransmission', 'rapid technique', 'tool']",NIDA,CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2009,293485,0.02040244639354858
"Genetic Factors in Keratoconus    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this grant is to identify susceptibility genes involved in the pathogenesis of keratoconus (KC). We will achieve our goal by: 1) refining criteria for the early detection of KC using videokeratography and wavefront Zernike variables; 2) comprehensively testing genes under newly identified linkage peaks generated through genome wide linkage scans of KC families, and performing comprehensive positional candidate gene association studies; and 3) characterizing specific genetic variants that predispose an individual to developing KC. We will study a cohort comprising: normal controls, patients with 'early' KC, KC 'suspect', and KC relatives with videokeratography and aberrometry in order to determine the best combination of variables that discriminate KC 'suspects' from normals. Study subjects will be followed longitudinally to determine which combination of variables is predictive of progression to KC, and thus define subclinical KC (Aim 1). After genome-wide linkage scan of multiplex KC families, we identified regions with significant or suggestive linkage on chromosomes 4, 5, 9, 11, 12, and 14, confirmed by subsequent fine mapping studies. To follow-up these positive linkage findings, we will conduct a comprehensive positional candidate gene association study by testing all genes in these regions with tagSNPs. Any positive association results will be tested in an independent sample for confirmation (Aim 2). Additionally, using newly identified criteria for defining subclinical markers for KC (combination of videokeratography and aberrometry), we will refine our linkage analysis on families with KC in an attempt identify new linkage peaks which may encompass new potential candidate genes for study. Genes identified by both genetic association studies and expression studies published in the literature to date will be prioritized for further study to identify specific genetic variants that contribute to the susceptibility of KC (Aim 3).  Refining criteria for early detection of KC will provide the tools to prevent many patients from under- going unnecessary surgery and developing post-lasik ectasia, a significant public health issue. It will also facilitate identification of susceptibility genes for KC, which may provide an understanding of the mechanisms contributing to corneal thinning in KC.

"Genome-Transcription-Phenome-Wide Association: a new paradigm for association stu    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many complex disease syndromes consist of a large number of highly related, rather than independent, clinical phenotypes. Differences between these syndromes involve the complex interplay of a large number of genomic variations that perturb the function of disease-related genes in the context of a regulatory network, rather than individually. Thus unraveling the causal genetic variations and understanding the mechanisms of consequent cell and tissue transformation requires an analysis that jointly considers the epistatic, pleiotropic, and plastic interactions of elements and modules within and between the genome (G), transcriptome (T), and phenome (P). Most conventional methods focus on associations between every individual marker genotype and every single phenotype; they have limited statistical power and overlook the complex omit structures. We propose a systematic attempt on methodological development for the largely unexplored but practically important problem of structured associations between the ""-omes"". Rather than testing each SNP separately for association and then applying a correction by multiple hypothesis test, a structured association analysis identifies associations between groups of entities each with its own sophisticated structure that can not be ignored, such as blocks of SNPs with high LD, modules of genes in the same pathway, and clusters of phenotypes belong to a system of clinical descriptors of a disease. We will develop a mathematically rigorous and computationally efficient machine learning platform and software to address the methodological challenges involved with unraveling the interplay between disease-relevant elements in the G, T, and P omes. Our technical innovations include novel statistical models and algorithms for haplotype inference, recombination hotspot detection, gene network and phenotype network inference, admixture association mapping, and most importantly, a family of new structured regression techniques such as the graph-regularized regression, graph- guided fused lasso and extensions, that perform functional approximations to the association functions among structural elements in the G, T, and P omes, and have provable guarantee on consistency and sparsistency. We envisage our proposed research will open a new paradigm for association studies of complex diseases, which facilitates: 1) Intra- and inter-omic integration of data for association mapping and disease gene/pathway discovery, 2) Thorough explorations of the internal structures within different omic data, so that cryptic associations that are not possibly detectable in unstructured analysis due to their weak statistical power can be now inferred. 3) Joint statistical inference of mechanisms and pathways of how variations in DNA lead to variations in complex traits flows through molecular networks, and inference of condition-specific state of gene function in the molecular networks, and 4) Development of faster and automated computational algorithm with greater scalability and robustness to large-scale inter-omic analysis, and more convenient software package and user interface. All the software tools will be made available for free to the public. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose a systematic attempt on methodological development for the largely unexplored but practically important problem of structured association mapping between disease-relevant elements in the genome, transcriptome, and phenome. Since many complex diseases involve composite phenotypes that are the outcome of intricate perturbation of molecular network underlying gene regulatory resulted from complex and interdependent genome variations, structured association analysis at multi-omic level is not only needed, but also necessary, but it is beyond the grasp of convention methods and requires the methodological innovations we propose. Characterizing such interactions can provide a more comprehensive genetic and molecular view of complex diseases, which may lead to the identification of genes underlying disease processes; in addition, such an approach will allow us to formulate hypotheses regarding the roles of these genes with respect to disease pathogenesis, and to develop improved diagnostic biomarkers for multivariate clinical phenotypes.           Project Narrative We propose a systematic attempt on methodological development for the largely unexplored but practically important problem of structured association mapping between disease-relevant elements in the genome, transcriptome, and phenome.

"Analysis Tool for Heritable and Envirnonmental Network Associations    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The efforts of the human genome project are beginning to provide important findings for human health. Technological advances in the laboratory, particularly in characterizing human genomic variation, have created new approaches for studying the human genome. However, current statistical and computational strategies are taking only partial advantage of this wealth of information. In the quest for disease susceptibility genes for common, complex disease, we are faced with many challenges. Selecting genetic, clinical, and environmental factors important for the trait of interest is increasingly more difficult as high throughput data generation technologies are developed. We know that genes do not act in isolation, thus numerous other factors are likely important in complex disease phenotypes. However, techniques for robust statistical modeling of important variables to predict clinical outcomes are limited in their capability for interaction effects. Ultimately, we want to know what factors are important to provide superior prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of human disease. Unfortunately, interpretation of statistical models in a meaningful way for biomedical research has been lacking due to the inherent difficulty in making such connections. Thus, a technology that embraces the complexity of human disease and integrates multiple data sources including biological knowledge from the public domain, through a powerful analytical framework is essential for dissecting the architecture of common diseases. ATHENA: the Analysis Tool for Heritable and Environmental Network Associations is a novel framework that incorporates variable selection, modeling, and interpretation to learn more about diseases of public health interest. As the field gains experience in analyzing large scale genomic data, it is crucial that we learn from each other and develop and codify the best strategies.            Many common, complex diseases are likely due to a combination of genetic and environmental risk factors. Out ability to extract all of the meaningful information from very large genomic and phenotypic datasets has been limited by our analytic strategies. The methodology described in this proposal is a powerful new approach to maximize the information learned from large datasets to improve prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of diseases of public health interest.",Analysis Tool for Heritable and Envirnonmental Network Associations,7642231,R01LM010040,"['Architecture', 'Arts', 'Base Pairing', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Clinical', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Models', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Human Genome Project', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Prevention', 'Proteomics', 'Public Domains', 'Public Health', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Simulate', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Solutions', 'Statistical Models', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'follow-up', 'gene environment interaction', 'gene interaction', 'genetic analysis', 'genome wide association study', 'human disease', 'improved', 'interest', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'simulation', 'success', 'tool', 'tool development', 'trait']",NLM,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,R01,2009,922959,0.002955125246813117
"VARIABLE SELECTION IN GENETIC EPIDEMIOLOGICAL STUDIES OF CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) affect millions of people in US and across the world. There is strong evidence of a genetic component in cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and related traits. An emerging consensus is that both genes and environment and, perhaps more importantly, their interactions are responsible for this complex disease. As a result, many genetic epidemiological (GE) studies of CVD use a study design that tests hundreds of thousands of genetic predictors (e.g., single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers) and hundreds of (related) disease phenotypes and environmental covariates. This has brought tremendous analytical challenges, particularly the high dimensionality of the data and the obscure interactions among the many variables. As a result, searching for CVD disease genes has become a task of selecting important variables from a vast number of SNPs and other predictor variables. Our real data analyses in several ongoing large scale CVD related studies motivated us to consider new methodological solutions to the variable selection problem. This application is developed upon these positive preliminary findings. Our main idea is to develop a strategy for selecting important predictors of CVD by integrating multiple sources of information via the method of statistical learning (i.e., optimizing the selection by repeated learning from examples). In this strategy, we will first develop a method for selecting significant SNPs in moderate-dimensional data (e.g., lower thousands of SNPs, in candidate genes studies) by an integrated classifier. The method will build upon existing techniques assessing information of SNPs in haplotype similarity, imputed functional potential, and gene-gene interactions. We then scale up the new method to the high-dimensional setting of genome-wide association studies (e.g., at least hundreds of thousands of SNPs), by dimension reduction that utilizes the local linkage-disequilibrium (LD) structure in SNPs and by combining latent factor analysis of correlated CVD traits and pathway-based analysis to account for gene-environment (GxE) interactions. A fast-search algorithm will also be developed based on an existing search heuristic that was successfully applied in high-dimensional data of gene expression and genomic sequence analysis. The new methods and algorithms will be coded into R programs and distributed as tool set for an association analysis pipeline. Evaluations of the new methods will be performed by intensive simulation studies and by applying to existing datasets in ongoing studies of CVD and related diseases. Results from evaluation studies, together with the ancillary databases generated by the study such as imputed functional scores of potential or known CVD SNPs will be distributed on a dedicated project website. By doing so, we believe that the utilities resulted from the proposed research will make a significant contribution to many ongoing genetic epidemiological studies of CVD and related traits.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project is aimed at timely development of computational tools for emerging large-scale genome-wide association studies of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) that affect millions of people in US and across the world.

"Identification and Development of Genetic Polymorphisms as Biomarkers of Graft ve    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant continues to be associated with a high morbidity and mortality. Fifteen to 50% of patients die from complications related to the procedure. Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) affects 20-80% of transplant recipients and is the major cause of post transplant non-relapse mortality. While some clinical parameters (e.g. age, donor: recipient histocompatibility) can predict GVHD, no biological factors have been identified that reliably predict the incidence and severity of GVHD and its associated mortality, as well as allow an understanding of the underlying pathogenesis of the disease, which, in turn could inform innovative treatment approaches. Hence, there exists a critical need to identify reliable biomarkers for the disease. We hypothesize that polymorphisms in genes regulating biological pathways of GVHD are associated with GVHD and transplant related mortality (TRM). We propose a candidate gene approach to analyze, in 838 subjects (donors and recipients), the relationship of 427 genetic polymorphisms which may modulate the immune response, inflammatory amplification and the metabolism of therapeutic agents with the incidence and course of GVHD and transplant related mortality. We will use conventional multiple variable regression analysis to identify relevant polymorphisms and will test novel machine based learning and graph based algorithms to identify gene patterns or interactions not recognizable with usual statistical techniques. Reliable genetic biomarkers would permit identification of high risk patients who need more effective prophylaxis or preemptive screening or therapeutic interventions to limit the severity of their graft versus host disease and ultimately to improve survival. Validation of our findings in a subsequent multicenter cohort could provide important data useful to inform the management of allograft patients and improve their outcomes.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Graft-versus-host disease is a devastating disease that affects 20-70% of blood and marrow transplant (BMT) recipients. The disease is caused by an immune attack by donor cells on patient tissue. Some genetic factors, including polymorphisms (changes in amino acids in genes that alter their function) may predict patients at high risk of these complications. We aim to identify patients at high risk of complications and death, and subsequently modify their treatment, using the information we learn from our genetic studies, to alter their course. Our long term goal is to improve survival in these patients by determining groups at high risk towards whom intensive therapy should be targeted.          n/a",Identification and Development of Genetic Polymorphisms as Biomarkers of Graft ve,7648231,R21AI079354,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Acute Graft Versus Host Disease', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Allogenic', 'Allografting', 'Amino Acids', 'Biological', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cell Transplants', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Cytokine Gene', 'DNA Library', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Pathway', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Variation', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Hematopoietic', 'Histocompatibility', 'Immune', 'Immune System Diseases', 'Immune response', 'Immunosuppressive Agents', 'Incidence', 'Inflammatory', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Marrow', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Minor Histocompatibility Antigens', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Population Study', 'Procedures', 'Prophylactic treatment', 'Publishing', 'Rare Diseases', 'Regression Analysis', 'Regulator Genes', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Severities', 'Supportive care', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissues', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Transplantation', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'chronic graft versus host disease', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'design', 'drug metabolism', 'follow-up', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'graft vs host disease', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'receptor', 'tool', 'validation studies']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R21,2009,221910,0.015070309473120328
"Genome Wide Association Study of Head and Neck Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Head and neck cancers have well-documented associations with tobacco and alcohol exposure, but the disease develops in only a small fraction of users, which implies an important role for genetic susceptibility. Therefore, head and neck cancers are an excellent model for studying genetic susceptibility to environmental carcinogens. The primary goal of this R01 application is to perform a comprehensive two-stage, high-density, genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis of head and neck cancer cases and corresponding frequency matched controls to identify novel genetic risk factors for head and neck cancer. This proposal builds upon a well-annotated existing DNA repository of cases and controls. One of the unique features of our study is the availability of DNA repair assay data on most of the cases and controls in this study, which will allow us to conduct genotype/phenotype analyses. We also have access to genome-wide association data from 1200 white control subjects from the same source population. In aim 1, we will perform genotyping on 1000 randomly selected head and neck cancer cases and 500 controls using a 370K Illumina Infinium HapMap HumanCNV370-Duo SNP Chip. We will perform association analyses (1000 cases and 1700 controls) in the first stage using outcome variable as case-control status as well as DNA repair capacity assay data. Our second aim is to perform second-stage analysis of the SNPs selected in stage 1 using 900 additional cases and corresponding controls from the same source and from UCLA. We will use efficient joint analysis of cases and controls from the first and second aims, for a total of 1900 cases and 2600 controls. Finally, in aim 3, we will apply novel statistical tools such as the latent variable approach with Tukey's one-degree-of-freedom test and support vector machines to identify gene-gene and gene-environment (using environmental factors such as smoking and alcohol use) interactions that contribute to the risk of head and neck cancer. We are an experienced investigative team proposing a comprehensive analysis that incorporates epidemiological, behavioral, and functional data. Identification of novel genetic risk factors and their interactions with environmental factors will contribute to the early diagnosis of head and neck cancers.

"Pathway-based analysis of addiction susceptibility genes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Susceptibility to alcohol and substance dependence is known to be influenced by genetic factors. However, few specific genetic variations that alter susceptibility to addiction have been identified. This is partly because addiction is a polygenic trait, influenced by many genetic variations, each with a small marginal effect. Phenotypic characteristics are controlled by networks of interacting biochemical and physiological pathways influenced by the products of specific genes. While single genetic variants result in small changes in susceptibility to complex diseases, it is the combined effects of genes within a biochemical pathway that likely drive phenotype expression.  The research proposed in this application aims to apply novel pathway-based methods to analyze existing data from a genome wide association study of alcoholism. Case-control alcohol dependence data from the Study of Addiction: Genetics and Environment (SAGE), collected by Dr. Laura Bierut and colleagues, will be analyzed. The methods that will be applied take into account known relationships between genes and their products and assess the effect of gene-sets that represent biological pathways, rather than assessing individual gene effects. Once significant pathways are identified, comprehensive analyses of genes within these pathways will be performed, to characterize the genetic effects, including interactions between genetic variations. These analyses will utilize random forest methods and LASSO logistic regression with gene-gene interaction effects.  The long term goals of this research are to improve the detection of interacting genetic risk factors for substance addiction and subtypes of substance use disorders, by applying optimal statistical techniques. While studying all possible interactions between SNPs from a genome-wide scan may not be practical, a focused approach of investigating genetic interactions within a relevant pathway is expected to be more powerful and yield interpretable results.  Analysis of existing data using new statistical methods that account for the relationships between genes that act as part of common neural or molecular pathways has great potential to identify genetic variations that contribute to individual differences in addiction susceptibility. Discovery of such genetic risk factors has important implications including increasing our understanding of the pathways of development of addiction and risk prediction. Perhaps more importantly, this knowledge is expected to help identify subtypes of addiction that require different interventions leading to personalized treatment with increased success rates.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Although progress has been made in terms of understanding the heritable aspects of alcoholism and other substance use disorders, few specific genetic risk factors have been identified. Recently, new methods for analyzing genetic data have been proposed that take into account known relationships between genes that contribute to common biological pathways. The research proposed in this application will apply such approaches to analyze data from a genetic study of alcoholism. Results of this study are expected to help identify sets of genes that contribute to individual differences in susceptibility to substance dependence, leading to improved diagnosis and management of addiction based on an individualized treatment approach.           Project Narrative: Although progress has been made in terms of understanding the heritable aspects of alcoholism and other substance use disorders, few specific genetic risk factors have been identified.

"Beyond Association: Predictive Modeling of Nicotine Dependance    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tobacco use, primarily cigarette smoking, is the greatest source of preventable mortality in the world and costs over $160 million in health-related economic losses in the U.S. alone. Nicotine dependence is the primary reason that smokers continue smoking and that most unassisted quit attempts fail within a single week. It is known that nicotine dependence has a genetic component, but that it is a complex trait, i.e., no single gene is responsible for nicotine dependence. Thus, researchers and funding agencies have devoted considerable effort and support to identifying the genetic underpinnings of the trait through whole genome scans, putting us in a unique position to identify global genetic predictors of nicotine dependence. This study proposes to realize the promise of the NIDA-funded Collaborative Genetic Study of Nicotine Dependence (COGEND) whole genome data through the accomplishment of two specific aims: (1) to identify the set of genetic variations underlying the complex trait of nicotine dependence using a cutting-edge computational method called Bayesian networks and (2) to validate the prognostic model in an entirely independent population. This proposal represents the very first step of a broader research program aimed at discovering the complex network of interactions underpinning nicotine dependence. The ultimate result of this program will provide a clinical tool, which will accurately assess the risk of dependency, allow for individualized preventive measures, elucidate the molecular processes of dependence and nominate novel targets for the pharmaceutical treatment of nicotine addiction. Nicotine dependence places an enormous burden on individuals and society. Genetic factors are responsible for at least some part of the condition, and the NIDA has already funded a study, called COGEND, that examined over 40,000 genetic variations in people who were nicotine dependent and who were not nicotine dependent. We propose to use cutting-edge techniques to analyze this large dataset to identify a valid predictive model of nicotine dependence that will help us predict, diagnose, and treat this condition.        n/a",Beyond Association: Predictive Modeling of Nicotine Dependance,7617627,R21DA025168,"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dental Schools', 'Dependence', 'Dependency', 'Diagnosis', 'Economics', 'Enrollment', 'Funding', 'Funding Agency', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Nicotine', 'Nicotine Dependence', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Physiological Processes', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Preventive', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Site', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Techniques', 'Tobacco use', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'cigarette smoking', 'clinical practice', 'computer based statistical methods', 'cost', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'smoking cessation', 'statistics', 'tool', 'trait']",NIDA,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R21,2009,175000,0.03333851436873564
"Multigenic Dissection of Nonsyndromic Oral Clefts    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed 5-year career development award will provide training and experience in bioinformatics and the administration of large-scale epidemiologic studies and will prepare the applicant for a leadership role in the field of complex diseases. One of the strengths of the proposed plan is the commitment of three mentors with diverse and unique areas of expertise. They will oversee a phased development program to provide new and enhanced multidisciplinary skills in study management, the statistical genetics of complex disease, bioinformatics and computational biology, and the ethical issues associated with public health genomics. It will provide the specific and varied skills required to succeed in a career devoted to responsibly-conducted epidemiologic studies that employ state-of-the-art molecular and computational methods to elucidate the mechanisms of complex human diseases. In her research, the applicant will use DNA from mothers and infants enrolled in a large-scale birth defects surveillance study to investigate the multigenic origins of nonsyndromic oral clefts (NOC) using a novel application of a proven analytical approach, Bayesian networks. In accomplishing the first aim, she will identify and validate the most probable network linking the phenotype of isolated NOC to the candidate maternal and subject single nucleotide polymorphisms and environmental exposures among the majority race/ethnicity. Through the second aim, she will validate two approaches to phenotying non-isolated NOC. Finally, she will determine whether the model(s) generated in Aims 1 and 2 can be generalized to minority race/ethnicity groups. This project will provide the framework upon which the investigator will prepare for an independent research career. Additionally, by being the first investigation to concurrently consider the candidate environmental exposures and SNPs in several candidate genes previously associated with NOC in association studies, this work has the potential to move the study of NOC dramatically forward. Relevance: Cleft lip and/or cleft palate are among the most common birth defects have serious physical, psychological, and financial consequences for those affected. Despite this, little is known about the causes of these anomalies because clefts are the result of genetic and environmental risk factors, rather than a single factor. The proposed research has the potential to make a unique contribution to our understanding clefts because it uses novel analytical approaches that allow the simultaneous examination of many potential risk factors.           n/a",Multigenic Dissection of Nonsyndromic Oral Clefts,7616441,K08DE016956,"['Affect', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Arts', 'Bioinformatics', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Cleaved cell', 'Cleft Lip', 'Cleft Palate', 'Cleft lip with or without cleft palate', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Enrollment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Ethical Issues', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Ethnic group', 'Etiology', 'Exposure to', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Infant', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Leadership', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Mentors', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mothers', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Program Development', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'career', 'computer based statistical methods', 'experience', 'heuristics', 'human disease', 'innovation', 'meetings', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'oral cleft', 'psychologic', 'skills', 'surveillance study']",NIDCR,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,K08,2009,129470,0.010083889695131562
"International Cohort Collection for Bipolar Disorder    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Bipolar disorder (BPD) is a major public health priority, responsible for a vast burden of disability, personal suffering, and economic cost. Genetic susceptibility is the strongest known risk factor for BPD, and the identification of specific susceptibility genes would have enormous implications for advancing our understanding of the biology of BPD and revealing novel targets for treatment. The limited success to date of genetic studies of BPD has been due to its complex genetic architecture that likely includes many contributing loci of modest effect. Advances in population genetics and genotyping technologies have recently made the genetic dissection of complex disorders like BPD a feasible project. Genomewide association studies (GWAS) have already identified susceptibility variants underlying a range of other common medical disorders. However, it has become clear that much larger samples than are currently available will be needed to achieve such successes for BPD. This application is a response by an international consortium of investigators to RFA-MH-08-130: ""Genomic Parsing of Bipolar Disorder and Schizophrenia: Studies of Large Cohorts in the U.S. and Across the Globe."" The proposed International Cohort Collection for Bipolar Disorder (ICCBD) will address the need for large-scale DNA and data resources by establishing a uniquely large collection of samples and data from individuals with BPD. The specific aims of this application are 1) to ascertain and collect a large cohort of BPD cases (N = 9000) and unaffected controls (N = 9000) over five years at two U.S. sites (Boston and Los Angeles) using novel high-throughput phenotyping methods; and 2) to construct a harmonized data resource for genetic studies combining phenotypic data from the U.S. case-control sample with a parallel, separately funded European case-control sample (10,000 cases and 10,000 controls) obtained from the UK and Sweden. Separately funded genotyping and genetic analyses of these resources will fully characterize common polymorphisms and copy number variants in the full sample to detect novel risk variants and attempt replication of the most compelling prior findings. This resource, augmented by existing samples, will provide an unprecedented platform for the discovery of the genetic determinants of BPD. Bipolar disorder (BPD) is a major public health priority, responsible for a vast burden of disability, personal suffering, and economic cost. Genetic susceptibility is the strongest known risk factor for BPD, and the identification of specific susceptibility genes would have enormous implications for advancing our understanding of the biology of BPD and revealing novel targets for treatment.

"Computational system to predict novel genetic disease associations    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): High-throughput genotyping, expression, and sequencing technologies and the development of increasingly sophisticated methods for predicting gene-disease interactions have given the new field of genomic-based personalized medicine a wealth of data: more, in fact, than can easily be processed and interpreted. Omicia is in the business of developing computational tools and diagnostics in the field of personalized medicine for cardiovascular disease (CVD). As part of that effort we are developing a software infrastructure that uses these abundant data to identify and prioritize candidate genes and their sequence variations for clinical evaluation. The research proposed in this application has three aims. In Phase II, we will enhance and optimize Omicia's Gene Inference System (GIS), prototyped during the SBIR Phase I project. In Phase II we will add additional capabilities to its candidate gene identification methods. This will build upon the Omicia Disease Genes (ODG) ontology built in Phase I, and add pathway and protein-interaction data and include ""top"" candidates from external publicaly-available clinical studies. In Aim 2, we will enhance the ability of GIS to prioritize sequence variations by improving our novel paralogous-gene variation identification algorithm (iDIP) and by integrating existing amino-acid substitution (AAS) methods. By running these algorithms over all known human genes via dbSNP, we expect to identify a list of candidate variations that will be evaluated in Aim 3 including an in vitro experiment. The goal of Aim 3 is to test the gene- and variant-predictive power of GIS and to compare it to other selection methods. The clinical study will be a single-stage case control design to test the ""top"" variant candidates from Aims 1 & 2 and compare the potential association to well-established genetic markers for the risk of myocardial infarction (MI). With approximately 700 cases and 700 matched controls, our association study will be well powered to test our predicted functional markers for MI. The GIS infrastructure is an integral part of the commercial workflow of Omicia, and will form the basis of the product pipeline. As such, it will serve as licensable commercial technology for the company by helping other biotechnology companies to develop their genetic biomarkers for diagnostic and therapeutic developments (theranostics). In addition, any novel variants drawn from this Phase II study will be licensable and exploitable intellectual property, useful both as the basis for future products in our internal pipeline, as well as potentially valuable additions to our patent portfolio. The Phase II goals of enhancing and clinically validating GIS serve three purposes: proving our methodology as applied to CVD and opening the door to applications in other disease areas; showcasing GIS as a key technology for managing complexity in the post-genomic era and providing clinically-relevant insights; and finally, potentially identifying valuable IP in the form of novel genetic markers for MI.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The outcome of this project will be an evaluated gene inference system (GIS) for identifying gene-disease interactions, with a focus in the area of cardiovascular disease (CVD). This system will be used as part of the Omicia product pipeline, and can also be licensed to third parties. In addition, any novel genetic markers identified as part of the validation study will themselves be valuable additions to the Omicia product and IP portfolio. Omicia's goal is to provide content and analysis tools for molecular diagnostic tests for cardiovascular conditions, with the promise of identifying patients at high risk to enable them to begin preventive care before symptoms appear. Given the prevalence of CVD in the developed world, these products are potentially a great boon to public health, as well as being significant commercial opportunities.           NARRATIVE The outcome of this project will be an evaluated gene inference system (GIS) for identifying gene-disease interactions, with a focus in the area of cardiovascular disease (CVD).

"Microbial Diversity and Genetic Characterization of Cariogenic Biofilms    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed studies are anticipated to yield important new information as to the presence of specific genetic determinants found in Streptococcus mutans, a microbe strongly associated with a severe dental caries in affecting young children called severe early childhood caries or S-ECC. The long-term benefit of such information should lead researchers toward devising both diagnostic and preventive strategies against dental though better understanding its microbial causation. Using a powerful technique of suppressive subtraction DNA hybridization, the first specific aim is to test the hypothesis that strains of S. mutans found in S-ECC children differ in genetic composition compared to strains found in caries-free (CF) children. Unique genetic loci that are specific to S-ECC strains will be identified and characterized. Some of these genetic loci will prove informative as biomarkers for health or disease. Using the power of multiple test analyses derived artificial intelligence programming; biomarkers will be used as the basis for a modeling algorithm capable of classifying strains of S. mutans in one of two categories (S-ECC or CF). The second aim of this study is to survey strains of S. mutans associated with either S-ECC or CF status for known or suspected genetic elements thought to influence the pathogenesis or virulence of S. mutans. The third aim is to survey a larger, racial/ethnical diverse population of S-ECC or CF children for the presence or absence of the biomarkers identified in the first two aims. It is anticipated that this research will yield genetic markers for disease capable of providing clinicians with a diagnostic test that can assess risk for developing S-ECC. 7.           n/a",Microbial Diversity and Genetic Characterization of Cariogenic Biofilms,7372919,R01DE013937,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological Markers', 'Categories', 'Causations', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Class', 'Classification', 'Coupling', 'DNA', 'Dental', 'Dental caries', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Dot Immunoblotting', 'Effectiveness', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomic Islands', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'Hispanics', 'Infant', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Microbe', 'Microbial Biofilms', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mothers', 'Numbers', 'Pathogenesis', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevention strategy', 'Process', 'Programmed Learning', 'Public Health', 'Pulsed-Field Gel Electrophoresis', 'Purpose', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Score', 'Series', 'Severity of illness', 'Streptococcus mutans', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Virulence', 'Virulence Factors', 'base', 'early childhood', 'experience', 'genetic element', 'microbial', 'programs', 'research study', 'tool']",NIDCR,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R01,2008,366775,0.015845786354051677
"Machine Learning Prediction of Cancer Susceptibility    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Susceptibility to sporadic forms of cancer is determined by numerous genetic factors that interact in a nonlinear manner in the context of an individual's age and environmental exposure. This complex genetic architecture has important implications for the use of genome-wide association studies for identifying susceptibility genes. The assumption of a simple architecture supports a strategy of testing each single- nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) individually using traditional univariate statistics followed by a correction for multiple tests. However, a complex genetic architecture that is characteristic of most types of cancer requires analytical methods that specifically model combinations of SNPs and environmental exposures. While new and novel methods are available for modeling interactions, exhaustive testing of all combinations of SNPs is not feasible on a genome-wide scale because the number of comparisons is effectively infinite. Thus, it is critical that we develop intelligent strategies for selecting subsets of SNPs prior to combinatorial modeling. Our objective is to develop a research strategy for the detection, characterization, and interpretation of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions in a genome-wide association study of bladder cancer susceptibility. To accomplish this objective, we will develop and evaluate modifications and extensions to the ReliefF algorithm for selecting or filtering subsets of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for multifactor dimensionality reduction. (MDR) analysis of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions (AIM 1). We will develop and evaluate a stochastic wrapper or search strategy for MDR analysis of interactions that utilizes ReliefF values as a heuristic (AIM 2). The filter approach will be statisyically compared to the wrapper approach. The best ReliefF strategies will be provided as part of our open-source MDR software package (AIM 3). Finally, we will apply the best ReliefF-MDR analysis strategy to the detection, characterization, and interpretation of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions in a large genome-wide association study of bladder cancer susceptibility (AIM 4). The methods developed here will be applied to nearly 1500 haplotype tagging SNPs (tagSNPs) across approximately 300 cancer susceptibility genes measured in 542 subjects with bladder cancer and 745 healthy controls ascertained as part of a large epidemiological study from the state of New Hampshire.          n/a",Machine Learning Prediction of Cancer Susceptibility,7485154,R01LM009012,"['Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Boxing', 'Cancer-Predisposing Gene', 'Characteristics', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Detection', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Haplotypes', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'New Hampshire', 'Numbers', 'Predisposition', 'Purpose', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'Testing', 'analytical method', 'cancer type', 'combinatorial', 'gene environment interaction', 'gene interaction', 'genome wide association study', 'heuristics', 'human disease', 'improved', 'novel', 'open source', 'programs', 'statistics', 'tool']",NLM,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2008,304625,0.0021868268993755343
"Machine Learning to Identify Complex Interactions in Genome-Wide Association Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The focus of this application is the development and validation of new computational approaches to identify complex interactions among genetic and environmental factors (features) which could be used to help identify individuals at high risk for a specific disease or dysfunction, and provide novel insights into the pathophysiology of the conditions in question. Specific Aims of the application include: 1 )To adapt a variety of statistical machine learning methods to the analysis of simulated high density genome scan and environmental exposure data and to evaluate their ability to identify SNPs and environmental factors that are jointly predictive of a binary trait; 2)To apply the described feature selection and model building techniques to the genome-wide SNP genotype data collected from two NHLBI-funded genome-wide association studies: a) the SNPs and Atherosclerosis (SEA) study predicting premature atherosclerosis, and b) the Cholesterol and Pharmacogenetics of Statins (CAPS) Study predicting LDL cholesterol; 3) to develop a study-specific publicly accessible web-site designed to help disseminate the methods and results of the project and 4) to support the NIH-wide Genes and Environment Initiative (GEI). This proposal represents a unique collaboration focusing on the development of new methods to more effectively identify interacting genetic and environmental factors that account for variation in risk for common cardiovascular and other disease phenotypes. If the risk is determined, in part by a gene-environment interaction, the preventive intervention could include altering the environmental exposure. Furthermore, determining specific genetic and/or environmental factors that jointly influence risk may reveal new biologic pathways that would be appropriate targets for novel therapeutic interventions. Together, improved risk stratification and new pathophysiologic insights would be expected to reduce the burden of disease and accelerate the realization of true personalized medicine. Relevance of this research to public health: This project aims to develop new approaches to identify the relationship between genetic and environmental factors which could then be used to identify people at high risk for a disease. Determining specific genetic and/or environmental factors that influence a person's risk of disease may help doctors reduce risk for disease and reveal new treatments for disease.

"Novel Statistical Methods for Human Gene Mapping    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many common human diseases originate in part from the complicated effects of multiple genetic variants found throughout the genome. Given the enormous impact of such diseases on public health, it is imperative to map relevant genetic variants to improve our understanding of the molecular basis of such diseases, as well as improve screening techniques for disease prevention. To this end, successful human gene mapping of complex diseases requires the development and application of powerful statistical methods that fully utilize the resources of the Human Genome Project. This grant proposes a set of such statistical methods that either address novel problems or improve existing solutions to problems in human gene mapping studies. These proposed methods are applicable to a variety of genetic studies as they address topics in linkage, linkage disequilibrium, and high-dimensional genetic analyses of complex diseases and disease-related quantitative traits. The methods can be partitioned into the two general groups: mixed-modeling procedures and case-control likelihood procedures. The mixed-modeling procedures considered include a general variance-component (VC) mapping framework for continuous and discrete trait data and a modified VC mapping framework that allows for haplotypes. Also considered is a novel linear-mixed-model framework that identifies a large combination of genetic variants that influence a quantitative trait using support-vector- machine regression. The case-control likelihood procedures considered are extensions of the approach of Epstein and Satten (2003) for haplotype inference on disease. Extensions considered include allowing for covariates and haplotype-covariate interactions, and also categorical disease outcomes. The proposed statistical methods in this grant have the potential to increase the power to identify genetic variants that influence complex diseases and disease-related quantitative traits. This project will evaluate the performance of these methods using simulations based on the study design and data from an existing gene mapping study of type 2 diabetes. Also, this grant will implement the proposed statistical methods in user- friendly, efficient software for public distribution. Finally, this project will be opportunistic in identifying and addressing unforseen statistical problems arising in human gene mapping studies.           n/a",Novel Statistical Methods for Human Gene Mapping,7488003,R01HG003618,"['Address', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biochemical Reaction', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Categories', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Chromosomes', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease regression', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Finland', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Grant', 'Haplotypes', 'Human Gene Mapping', 'Human Genome Project', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Nature', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Normal Statistical Distribution', 'Numbers', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Rate', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Screening procedure', 'Series', 'Severity of illness', 'Solutions', 'Statistical Methods', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'United States', 'Variant', 'base', 'case control', 'disorder prevention', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic variant', 'human disease', 'improved', 'interest', 'novel', 'programs', 'simulation', 'trait', 'user-friendly']",NHGRI,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2008,291480,0.012542252317915014
"Polymorphisms in Inflammation Genes and Bladder Cancer Risk    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       This proposed study will build upon the extensive epidemiologic database and specimen repository derived from an ongoing bladder cancer study entitled ""Genetic Susceptibility to Bladder Cancer: A Molecular Epidemiologic Approach"" (RO1 CA74880, PI: Xifeng Wu). The parent grant involved a multidisciplinary group of researchers applying a molecular epidemiologic approach to identify inter-individual differences in susceptibility to bladder carcinogenesis, with a focus on genes involved in protecting against genomic instability, such as DNA repair, cell cycle, and telomere maintenance. It is increasing recognized that inflammation plays an important role in the etiology of many cancers, including bladder cancer (BC). We have recently shown that an IL-6 promoter SNP (G-174C) is associated with BC risk and progression. In this application, we will test the hypothesis that BC is modulated by common, low penetrance polymorphisms in inflammation related genes, interacting with each other and/or environmental factors. We will take a pathway based genotyping approach and apply novel statistical tools to address the hypothesis. There are 3 specific aims: Specific Aim 1: To identify candidate polymorphisms in inflammation related genes that predispose individuals to BC. We plan to perform genotyping of a comprehensive list of potential functional polymorphisms in inflammation genes (85 polymorphisms in 44 genes) on 1000 Caucasian cases and 1000 controls matched on age, gender, and ethnicity. Specific Aim 2: To perform genotyping on tagging SNPs for the top 8 candidate genes that were identified in Specific Aim 1 (using a significance level of 0.1) identified in Specific Aim 1. This will give us a complete picture of the role that the specific gene plays in BC etiology. We will implement haplotype-based analyses to identify any additional variants that might have been missed using individual SNP-based approaches. Specific Aim 3: To apply hierarchical models to refine risk assessment and to apply novel machine-learning tools to identify any gene-environment and gene- gene interactions influencing risk for BC. These analyses will examine SNP main effects and gene-gene interactions, gene-environment interaction and develop and validate algorithms, which will identify individuals at highest risk for BC, given their personal exposure patterns and their genetic risk profiles. The application will allow us to have a comprehensive picture of the effects of functional polymorphisms in inflammation related genes on BC risk.          n/a",Polymorphisms in Inflammation Genes and Bladder Cancer Risk,7458073,R03CA130063,"['Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Bladder', 'Cancer Center', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Caucasians', 'Caucasoid Race', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Cycle Regulation', 'Cells', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Cytogenetics', 'DNA', 'DNA Repair', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Erythrocytes', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Etiology', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Gender', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genomic Instability', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Haplotypes', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Inflammation', 'Interleukin-6', 'Length', 'Literature', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutagens', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Penetrance', 'Physicians', 'Plasma', 'Play', 'Predisposition', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Significance Level', 'Specimen', 'Statistical Methods', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'Suspension substance', 'Suspensions', 'Telomere Maintenance', 'Testing', 'Variant', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'carcinogenesis', 'college', 'follow-up', 'gene environment interaction', 'gene interaction', 'medical specialties', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'parent grant', 'promoter', 'repository', 'telomere', 'tool']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,R03,2008,77000,-0.009621210650651574
"Population Genetics Theory    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Four areas of theoretical population genetics will be studied. In the first, we will develop mathematical and statistical framework for studying the evolution of genes that affect how other sets of genes interact with one another. This theory helps in understanding conditions under which the genome can be expected to become modular in its production of phenotypes, as well as when synergy between mutations in different genes should be produced by evolution. We shall study how the pattern of interaction between deleterious mutations evolves as a function of the mutation rate, the recombination rate, and the degree of fitness loss of each mutation. We shall also study buildup of statistical association between genes that influence culturally transmitted traits that are associated either through transmission or through fitness. The second area of study concerns the evolution of pathogens such as influenza. Here we build models to predict the accumulation of mutations during epidemics and pandemics in a way that can assist in guiding vaccination strategies. We will develop algorithms that search for potential recombinants and reassortants among a collection of up to 1000 viral sequences. Here we aim to devise a statistical test to indicate whether identified recombinants or reassortants are spurious or statistically significant. Our recent theory of niche construction will form the basis of studies of how pathogens might evolve in response to human actions that they induce, such as use of antibiotics. The final research area will develop multiple-gene models for sex-linked control of genomic imprinting. These will include cis and trans modifiers of imprinting. Fertility selection as well as sex- specific viabilities will be studied in order to clarify the role of multiple paternities, which has been proposed as a driving force in the evolution of genomic imprinting. Genomic data from mammalian species will be analyzed using tools from statistical learning in order to predict which genes are likely to be imprinted. Correlations between DMA sequence properties and predicted imprinting status based on life history characteristics will also be sought.           n/a",Population Genetics Theory,7457930,R01GM028016,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Antibiotics', 'Antigens', 'Area', 'Bacteria', 'Bacteriophages', 'Characteristics', 'Class', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Condition', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Development', 'Drug Formulations', 'Epidemic', 'Evolution', 'Facility Construction Funding Category', 'Fertility', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Epistasis', 'Genetic Models', 'Genetic Recombination', 'Genome', 'Genomic Imprinting', 'Genomics', 'Haploidy', 'Human', 'Influenza', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Mutation', 'Numbers', 'Organism', 'Pan Genus', 'Pattern', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phenotype', 'Population Genetics', 'Production', 'Property', 'Purpose', 'Rate', 'Recombinants', 'Research', 'Role', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Statistically Significant', 'Taxon', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tweens', 'Vaccination', 'Variant', 'Viral', 'Virus', 'base', 'driving force', 'father role', 'fitness', 'gene function', 'genome sequencing', 'imprint', 'influenza epidemic', 'life history', 'pandemic disease', 'pathogen', 'research study', 'response', 'sex', 'social', 'theories', 'tool', 'trait', 'transmission process', 'vaccination strategy']",NIGMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2008,254996,0.0031485842093570745
"Genome-Wide Association Analysis of Bladder Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       This proposal builds on a rich resource of bladder cancer (BC) cases and controls derived from two ongoing BC studies at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, and from two large independent U.S. BC studies - the New England BC Study and the New Hampshire BC Study. The goal is to identify genetic loci that predispose individuals to BC through a genome-wide scanning approach. There are five specific aims. Aim 1 is to first perform genome-wide, high-density SNP genotyping using the Illumina HumanHap550 SNP platform on 800 cases and 800 controls from M.D. Anderson, with a target of candidate SNPs of about 28,000; followed by an internal validation to narrow down candidate SNPs to about 1,536 using additional 800 pairs of cases and controls. Illumina's Custom Infinium array will be the genotyping format. In this aim, in addition to individual SNP analysis, we will also implement haplotype-based analyses and pathway aggregation analysis to identify additional genetic loci that might have been overlooked using individual SNP analysis. Aim 2 is the first external validation of the 1,536 SNPs from Aim 1 using 1,000 pairs of cases and controls from the New England BC Study. Illumina's GoldenGate assay will be the genotyping format. After this stage, the candidate SNPs will be narrowed down to about 100. Aim 3 is the second independent external validation using 750 pairs of cases and controls form the New Hampshire BC Study. In this aim, the 100 top candidate SNPs passed from Aims 1 and 2 plus additional functional SNPs in genes containing these SNPs will be genotyped. GoldenGate assay will be used for this aim. Aim 4 is to perform fine mapping studies in the flanking regions of each of the top 25 SNP loci confirmed in Aim 3 to identify causative loci. This will utilize all 6,700 cases and controls. An average of 15 additional SNPs (tagging SNPs and functional SNPs) per gene is expected. Aim 5 is to apply novel machine-learning tools to identify any gene-environment and gene-gene interactions greatly influencing risk for BC in all the 6700 subjects. These analyses will be utilized to examine SNP main effect and develop and validate algorithms that will identify individuals at highest risk for BC, given their personal exposure patterns and their genetic risk profiles. This proposal applies state of art technology to perform a multistage, genome-wide SNP analysis in three largest, well-characterized U.S. population of BC cases and controls, and incorporates complete epidemiologic data and rich and unique functional data. In addition, results from this study will be provided to the International Consortium of BC Case Control Studies for future validation. The ability to identify genetically susceptible, high-risk subgroups that would benefit from intensive screening and/or chemopreventive interventions is of immense clinical and public health benefit. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Bladder cancer (BC) is a disease mainly caused by smoking and occupational exposure. However, only a small percentage of exposed individuals develop BC. Inherited host genetic factors may play an important role in determining an individual's susceptibility to BC. This proposal builds on three largest well-characterized U.S. populations of BC cases and controls - the M. D. Anderson BC study, the New England BC Study and the New Hampshire BC Study. A total of 6700 cases and controls will be used. The goal is to identify genetic loci that predispose individuals to BC through a non-biased, discovery- driven, genome-wide scanning approach and to incorporate complete epidemiologic data and rich and unique functional data. About 550,000 genetic variations of human genome will be initially screened in an M.D. Anderson population consisting of an equal number of BC cases and normal controls. About 28,000 top candidate variations that are potentially associated with increased BC risk will be first narrowed down and internally replicated in a second M.D. Anderson population, and then be validated in the other two independent U.S. BC populations. Finally, the causative genetic loci that predispose individuals to BC will be mapped. This study is significant because by identifying BC susceptibility loci, it will shed light into the biological mechanisms of BC etiology. Furthermore, it may facilitate identifying high-risk subgroups of individuals for BC, given their genetic makeup and environmental exposures. The ability to identify high-risk subgroups of individuals for BC will provide immense public health benefit for those high- risk people who may be subjected to close surveillance and chemoprevention.          n/a",Genome-Wide Association Analysis of Bladder Cancer,7387530,U01CA127615,"['Adopted', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Arts', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Bladder', 'Cancer Center', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Case Series', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Cycle Regulation', 'Chemoprevention', 'Chemopreventive Agent', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Custom', 'Cytogenetics', 'DNA', 'DNA Repair', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Haplotypes', 'Health Benefit', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Inherited', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Length', 'Light', 'Location', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder', 'Maps', 'Medical Surveillance', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutagens', 'New England', 'New Hampshire', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Numbers', 'Occupational Exposure', 'One-Step dentin bonding system', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Penetrance', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Plasma', 'Plasma Cells', 'Play', 'Polymorphism Analysis', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Public Health', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reproduction spores', 'Resources', 'Review Literature', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Smoking', 'Specimen', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Subgroup', 'Suspension substance', 'Suspensions', 'TNFRSF5 gene', 'Technology', 'University of Texas M D Anderson Cancer Center', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'aggregation pathway', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'carcinogenesis', 'case control', 'college', 'computer based statistical methods', 'cost', 'density', 'design', 'follow-up', 'gene interaction', 'genome wide association study', 'medical specialties', 'novel', 'parent grant', 'repository', 'telomere', 'tool']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,U01,2008,1077416,0.005077224210517462
"Machine vision analysis of C.elegans phenotypic patterns    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The nematode C. elegans has powerful genetics, a well-described nervous system, and a complete genome sequence; thus, it is well suited to analysis of behavior and development at the molecular and cellular levels. In particular, the ability to functionally map the influence of particular genes to specific behavioral consequences makes it possible to use genetic analysis to functionally dissect the molecular mechanisms underlying poorly understood aspects of nervous system function. However, many genes with critical roles in neuronal function have effects on behavior that to a casual observer appear very subtle or difficult to describe precisely. Therefore, to fully realize the potential of C. elegans for the genetic analysis of nervous system function, it is necessary to develop sophisticated methods for the rapid and consistent quantitation of mutant phenotypes, especially those related to behavior.       The goal of this proposed work is to develop computer vision tools for quantitatively characterizing the phenotypic patterns caused by mutations or pharmacological treatments in C. elegans. By making it possible to precisely characterize the behavioral phenotypes of mutants with abnormal locomotion or egglaying, these tools will be particularly useful for correlating specific neurotransmission defects with characteristic behavioral patterns. These analytical tools will also be used to generate a comprehensive database containing complex behavioral data on a large set of mutant strains. This database will make it possible to identify groups of mutants and pharmacological treatments that have similar effects on behavior or development. With the accumulation of increasing phenotypic data on known mutants, it should ultimately be possible to record from unknown mutant or drug-treated animals and make informed initial hypotheses about the functions of uncharacterized genes and the targets of uncharacterized drugs.         n/a",Machine vision analysis of C.elegans phenotypic patterns,7440354,R01DA018341,"['Animals', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Calibration', 'Characteristics', 'Coiled Bodies', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Databases', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Image Analysis', 'Locomotion', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Nematoda', 'Nervous System Physiology', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'Partner in relationship', 'Pattern', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Posture', 'Reproducibility', 'Role', 'System', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'egg', 'genetic analysis', 'genome sequencing', 'loss of function', 'mutant', 'neurotransmission', 'rapid technique', 'tool']",NIDA,CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2008,282792,0.02040244639354858
"Genetic Factors in Keratoconus    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this grant is to identify susceptibility genes involved in the pathogenesis of keratoconus (KC). We will achieve our goal by: 1) refining criteria for the early detection of KC using videokeratography and wavefront Zernike variables; 2) comprehensively testing genes under newly identified linkage peaks generated through genome wide linkage scans of KC families, and performing comprehensive positional candidate gene association studies; and 3) characterizing specific genetic variants that predispose an individual to developing KC. We will study a cohort comprising: normal controls, patients with 'early' KC, KC 'suspect', and KC relatives with videokeratography and aberrometry in order to determine the best combination of variables that discriminate KC 'suspects' from normals. Study subjects will be followed longitudinally to determine which combination of variables is predictive of progression to KC, and thus define subclinical KC (Aim 1). After genome-wide linkage scan of multiplex KC families, we identified regions with significant or suggestive linkage on chromosomes 4, 5, 9, 11, 12, and 14, confirmed by subsequent fine mapping studies. To follow-up these positive linkage findings, we will conduct a comprehensive positional candidate gene association study by testing all genes in these regions with tagSNPs. Any positive association results will be tested in an independent sample for confirmation (Aim 2). Additionally, using newly identified criteria for defining subclinical markers for KC (combination of videokeratography and aberrometry), we will refine our linkage analysis on families with KC in an attempt identify new linkage peaks which may encompass new potential candidate genes for study. Genes identified by both genetic association studies and expression studies published in the literature to date will be prioritized for further study to identify specific genetic variants that contribute to the susceptibility of KC (Aim 3).  Refining criteria for early detection of KC will provide the tools to prevent many patients from under- going unnecessary surgery and developing post-lasik ectasia, a significant public health issue. It will also facilitate identification of susceptibility genes for KC, which may provide an understanding of the mechanisms contributing to corneal thinning in KC. Ultimately, this work may improve our ability to treat KC and/or prevent the development of KC.          n/a",Genetic Factors in Keratoconus,7385160,R01EY009052,"['Affect', 'Biological Markers', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 4', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Cornea', 'Corneal Diseases', 'Data', 'Data Linkages', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Etiology', 'Family', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Haplotypes', 'Individual', 'Keratoconus', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathological Dilatation', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Predisposition', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Purpose', 'Relative (related person)', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Screening procedure', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Study Subject', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transplantation', 'Unnecessary Surgery', 'Videokeratographies', 'Work', 'aquaporin 5', 'case control', 'cohort', 'corneal epithelium', 'follow-up', 'forest', 'genetic association', 'genetic linkage analysis', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide linkage', 'improved', 'indexing', 'prevent', 'success', 'tool']",NEI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2008,649860,-0.019982374133320564
"VARIABLE SELECTION IN GENETIC EPIDEMIOLOGICAL STUDIES OF CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) affect millions of people in US and across the world. There is strong evidence of a genetic component in cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and related traits. An emerging consensus is that both genes and environment and, perhaps more importantly, their interactions are responsible for this complex disease. As a result, many genetic epidemiological (GE) studies of CVD use a study design that tests hundreds of thousands of genetic predictors (e.g., single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers) and hundreds of (related) disease phenotypes and environmental covariates. This has brought tremendous analytical challenges, particularly the high dimensionality of the data and the obscure interactions among the many variables. As a result, searching for CVD disease genes has become a task of selecting important variables from a vast number of SNPs and other predictor variables. Our real data analyses in several ongoing large scale CVD related studies motivated us to consider new methodological solutions to the variable selection problem. This application is developed upon these positive preliminary findings. Our main idea is to develop a strategy for selecting important predictors of CVD by integrating multiple sources of information via the method of statistical learning (i.e., optimizing the selection by repeated learning from examples). In this strategy, we will first develop a method for selecting significant SNPs in moderate-dimensional data (e.g., lower thousands of SNPs, in candidate genes studies) by an integrated classifier. The method will build upon existing techniques assessing information of SNPs in haplotype similarity, imputed functional potential, and gene-gene interactions. We then scale up the new method to the high-dimensional setting of genome-wide association studies (e.g., at least hundreds of thousands of SNPs), by dimension reduction that utilizes the local linkage-disequilibrium (LD) structure in SNPs and by combining latent factor analysis of correlated CVD traits and pathway-based analysis to account for gene-environment (GxE) interactions. A fast-search algorithm will also be developed based on an existing search heuristic that was successfully applied in high-dimensional data of gene expression and genomic sequence analysis. The new methods and algorithms will be coded into R programs and distributed as tool set for an association analysis pipeline. Evaluations of the new methods will be performed by intensive simulation studies and by applying to existing datasets in ongoing studies of CVD and related diseases. Results from evaluation studies, together with the ancillary databases generated by the study such as imputed functional scores of potential or known CVD SNPs will be distributed on a dedicated project website. By doing so, we believe that the utilities resulted from the proposed research will make a significant contribution to many ongoing genetic epidemiological studies of CVD and related traits.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project is aimed at timely development of computational tools for emerging large-scale genome-wide association studies of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) that affect millions of people in US and across the world. The new methods deal with the analytical challenges brought forth by the high dimensionality of the data and the obscure interactions among the many variables in these studies, and the tools will be applied to ongoing studies of CVD and related diseases. The results, together with the computer programs and ancillary databases will make a significant contribution to many ongoing and new genetic epidemiological studies of CVD and related diseases.             n/a",VARIABLE SELECTION IN GENETIC EPIDEMIOLOGICAL STUDIES OF CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES,7528626,R01HL091028,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Area', 'Blood Vessels', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Chromosomes', 'Chronic Disease', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Developed Countries', 'Developing Countries', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Environment', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Evaluation Studies', 'Exclusion', 'Factor Analysis', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Haplotypes', 'Heart failure', 'Hypertension', 'Hypertrophy', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Left Ventricular Hypertrophy', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Noise', 'Numbers', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Public Domains', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Score', 'Sea', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Solutions', 'Source', 'Statistical Computing', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'base', 'computer based statistical methods', 'computer program', 'computerized tools', 'disease phenotype', 'experience', 'gene interaction', 'genome wide association study', 'heuristics', 'hypertensive heart disease', 'improved', 'mortality', 'prevent', 'programs', 'scale up', 'simulation', 'tool', 'trait', 'ventricular hypertrophy']",NHLBI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2008,228000,0.0006571388949841742
"Identification and Development of Genetic Polymorphisms as Biomarkers of Graft ve    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant continues to be associated with a high morbidity and mortality. Fifteen to 50% of patients die from complications related to the procedure. Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) affects 20-80% of transplant recipients and is the major cause of post transplant non-relapse mortality. While some clinical parameters (e.g. age, donor: recipient histocompatibility) can predict GVHD, no biological factors have been identified that reliably predict the incidence and severity of GVHD and its associated mortality, as well as allow an understanding of the underlying pathogenesis of the disease, which, in turn could inform innovative treatment approaches. Hence, there exists a critical need to identify reliable biomarkers for the disease. We hypothesize that polymorphisms in genes regulating biological pathways of GVHD are associated with GVHD and transplant related mortality (TRM). We propose a candidate gene approach to analyze, in 838 subjects (donors and recipients), the relationship of 427 genetic polymorphisms which may modulate the immune response, inflammatory amplification and the metabolism of therapeutic agents with the incidence and course of GVHD and transplant related mortality. We will use conventional multiple variable regression analysis to identify relevant polymorphisms and will test novel machine based learning and graph based algorithms to identify gene patterns or interactions not recognizable with usual statistical techniques. Reliable genetic biomarkers would permit identification of high risk patients who need more effective prophylaxis or preemptive screening or therapeutic interventions to limit the severity of their graft versus host disease and ultimately to improve survival. Validation of our findings in a subsequent multicenter cohort could provide important data useful to inform the management of allograft patients and improve their outcomes.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Graft-versus-host disease is a devastating disease that affects 20-70% of blood and marrow transplant (BMT) recipients. The disease is caused by an immune attack by donor cells on patient tissue. Some genetic factors, including polymorphisms (changes in amino acids in genes that alter their function) may predict patients at high risk of these complications. We aim to identify patients at high risk of complications and death, and subsequently modify their treatment, using the information we learn from our genetic studies, to alter their course. Our long term goal is to improve survival in these patients by determining groups at high risk towards whom intensive therapy should be targeted.          n/a",Identification and Development of Genetic Polymorphisms as Biomarkers of Graft ve,7509654,R21AI079354,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Acute Graft Versus Host Disease', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Allogenic', 'Allografting', 'Amino Acids', 'Biological', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cell Transplants', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Cytokine Gene', 'DNA Library', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Pathway', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Variation', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Hematopoietic', 'Histocompatibility', 'Immune', 'Immune System Diseases', 'Immune response', 'Immunosuppressive Agents', 'Incidence', 'Inflammatory', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Marrow', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Minor Histocompatibility Antigens', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Numbers', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Population Study', 'Procedures', 'Prophylactic treatment', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Range', 'Rare Diseases', 'Regression Analysis', 'Regulator Genes', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Severities', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Supportive care', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissues', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Transplantation', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'chronic graft versus host disease', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'design', 'drug metabolism', 'follow-up', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'graft vs host disease', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'prevent', 'receptor', 'tool', 'validation studies']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R21,2008,188750,0.015070309473120328
"Beyond Association: Predictive Modeling of Nicotine Dependance    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tobacco use, primarily cigarette smoking, is the greatest source of preventable mortality in the world and costs over $160 million in health-related economic losses in the U.S. alone. Nicotine dependence is the primary reason that smokers continue smoking and that most unassisted quit attempts fail within a single week. It is known that nicotine dependence has a genetic component, but that it is a complex trait, i.e., no single gene is responsible for nicotine dependence. Thus, researchers and funding agencies have devoted considerable effort and support to identifying the genetic underpinnings of the trait through whole genome scans, putting us in a unique position to identify global genetic predictors of nicotine dependence. This study proposes to realize the promise of the NIDA-funded Collaborative Genetic Study of Nicotine Dependence (COGEND) whole genome data through the accomplishment of two specific aims: (1) to identify the set of genetic variations underlying the complex trait of nicotine dependence using a cutting-edge computational method called Bayesian networks and (2) to validate the prognostic model in an entirely independent population. This proposal represents the very first step of a broader research program aimed at discovering the complex network of interactions underpinning nicotine dependence. The ultimate result of this program will provide a clinical tool, which will accurately assess the risk of dependency, allow for individualized preventive measures, elucidate the molecular processes of dependence and nominate novel targets for the pharmaceutical treatment of nicotine addiction. Nicotine dependence places an enormous burden on individuals and society. Genetic factors are responsible for at least some part of the condition, and the NIDA has already funded a study, called COGEND, that examined over 40,000 genetic variations in people who were nicotine dependent and who were not nicotine dependent. We propose to use cutting-edge techniques to analyze this large dataset to identify a valid predictive model of nicotine dependence that will help us predict, diagnose, and treat this condition.        n/a",Beyond Association: Predictive Modeling of Nicotine Dependance,7509667,R21DA025168,"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Condition', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dental Schools', 'Dependence', 'Dependency', 'Diagnosis', 'Economics', 'Enrollment', 'Funding', 'Funding Agency', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Nicotine', 'Nicotine Dependence', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Physiological Processes', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Preventive', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Site', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Techniques', 'Tobacco use', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Week', 'base', 'cigarette smoking', 'computer based statistical methods', 'cost', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'smoking cessation', 'statistics', 'tool', 'trait']",NIDA,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R21,2008,175000,0.03333851436873564
"Multigenic Dissection of Nonsyndromic Oral Clefts    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed 5-year career development award will provide training and experience in bioinformatics and the administration of large-scale epidemiologic studies and will prepare the applicant for a leadership role in the field of complex diseases. One of the strengths of the proposed plan is the commitment of three mentors with diverse and unique areas of expertise. They will oversee a phased development program to provide new and enhanced multidisciplinary skills in study management, the statistical genetics of complex disease, bioinformatics and computational biology, and the ethical issues associated with public health genomics. It will provide the specific and varied skills required to succeed in a career devoted to responsibly-conducted epidemiologic studies that employ state-of-the-art molecular and computational methods to elucidate the mechanisms of complex human diseases. In her research, the applicant will use DNA from mothers and infants enrolled in a large-scale birth defects surveillance study to investigate the multigenic origins of nonsyndromic oral clefts (NOC) using a novel application of a proven analytical approach, Bayesian networks. In accomplishing the first aim, she will identify and validate the most probable network linking the phenotype of isolated NOC to the candidate maternal and subject single nucleotide polymorphisms and environmental exposures among the majority race/ethnicity. Through the second aim, she will validate two approaches to phenotying non-isolated NOC. Finally, she will determine whether the model(s) generated in Aims 1 and 2 can be generalized to minority race/ethnicity groups. This project will provide the framework upon which the investigator will prepare for an independent research career. Additionally, by being the first investigation to concurrently consider the candidate environmental exposures and SNPs in several candidate genes previously associated with NOC in association studies, this work has the potential to move the study of NOC dramatically forward. Relevance: Cleft lip and/or cleft palate are among the most common birth defects have serious physical, psychological, and financial consequences for those affected. Despite this, little is known about the causes of these anomalies because clefts are the result of genetic and environmental risk factors, rather than a single factor. The proposed research has the potential to make a unique contribution to our understanding clefts because it uses novel analytical approaches that allow the simultaneous examination of many potential risk factors.           n/a",Multigenic Dissection of Nonsyndromic Oral Clefts,7393693,K08DE016956,"['Affect', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Arts', 'Bioinformatics', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Child', 'Class', 'Classification', 'Cleaved cell', 'Cleft Lip', 'Cleft Palate', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Enrollment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Ethical Issues', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Ethnic group', 'Etiology', 'Exposure to', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Infant', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Leadership', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Logistic Models', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Medical Surveillance', 'Mentors', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mothers', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Program Development', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'career', 'computer based statistical methods', 'experience', 'heuristics', 'human disease', 'innovation', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'oral cleft', 'psychologic', 'skills']",NIDCR,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,K08,2008,129484,0.010083889695131562
"International Cohort Collection for Bipolar Disorder    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Bipolar disorder (BPD) is a major public health priority, responsible for a vast burden of disability, personal suffering, and economic cost. Genetic susceptibility is the strongest known risk factor for BPD, and the identification of specific susceptibility genes would have enormous implications for advancing our understanding of the biology of BPD and revealing novel targets for treatment. The limited success to date of genetic studies of BPD has been due to its complex genetic architecture that likely includes many contributing loci of modest effect. Advances in population genetics and genotyping technologies have recently made the genetic dissection of complex disorders like BPD a feasible project. Genomewide association studies (GWAS) have already identified susceptibility variants underlying a range of other common medical disorders. However, it has become clear that much larger samples than are currently available will be needed to achieve such successes for BPD. This application is a response by an international consortium of investigators to RFA-MH-08-130: ""Genomic Parsing of Bipolar Disorder and Schizophrenia: Studies of Large Cohorts in the U.S. and Across the Globe."" The proposed International Cohort Collection for Bipolar Disorder (ICCBD) will address the need for large-scale DNA and data resources by establishing a uniquely large collection of samples and data from individuals with BPD. The specific aims of this application are 1) to ascertain and collect a large cohort of BPD cases (N = 9000) and unaffected controls (N = 9000) over five years at two U.S. sites (Boston and Los Angeles) using novel high-throughput phenotyping methods; and 2) to construct a harmonized data resource for genetic studies combining phenotypic data from the U.S. case-control sample with a parallel, separately funded European case-control sample (10,000 cases and 10,000 controls) obtained from the UK and Sweden. Separately funded genotyping and genetic analyses of these resources will fully characterize common polymorphisms and copy number variants in the full sample to detect novel risk variants and attempt replication of the most compelling prior findings. This resource, augmented by existing samples, will provide an unprecedented platform for the discovery of the genetic determinants of BPD.

"Machine Learning Prediction of Cancer Susceptibility    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Susceptibility to sporadic forms of cancer is determined by numerous genetic factors that interact in a nonlinear manner in the context of an individual's age and environmental exposure. This complex genetic architecture has important implications for the use of genome-wide association studies for identifying susceptibility genes. The assumption of a simple architecture supports a strategy of testing each single- nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) individually using traditional univariate statistics followed by a correction for multiple tests. However, a complex genetic architecture that is characteristic of most types of cancer requires analytical methods that specifically model combinations of SNPs and environmental exposures. While new and novel methods are available for modeling interactions, exhaustive testing of all combinations of SNPs is not feasible on a genome-wide scale because the number of comparisons is effectively infinite. Thus, it is critical that we develop intelligent strategies for selecting subsets of SNPs prior to combinatorial modeling. Our objective is to develop a research strategy for the detection, characterization, and interpretation of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions in a genome-wide association study of bladder cancer susceptibility. To accomplish this objective, we will develop and evaluate modifications and extensions to the ReliefF algorithm for selecting or filtering subsets of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for multifactor dimensionality reduction. (MDR) analysis of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions (AIM 1). We will develop and evaluate a stochastic wrapper or search strategy for MDR analysis of interactions that utilizes ReliefF values as a heuristic (AIM 2). The filter approach will be statisyically compared to the wrapper approach. The best ReliefF strategies will be provided as part of our open-source MDR software package (AIM 3). Finally, we will apply the best ReliefF-MDR analysis strategy to the detection, characterization, and interpretation of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions in a large genome-wide association study of bladder cancer susceptibility (AIM 4). The methods developed here will be applied to nearly 1500 haplotype tagging SNPs (tagSNPs) across approximately 300 cancer susceptibility genes measured in 542 subjects with bladder cancer and 745 healthy controls ascertained as part of a large epidemiological study from the state of New Hampshire.          n/a",Machine Learning Prediction of Cancer Susceptibility,7279853,R01LM009012,"['Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Boxing', 'Cancer-Predisposing Gene', 'Characteristics', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Detection', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Haplotypes', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'New Hampshire', 'Numbers', 'Predisposition', 'Purpose', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'Testing', 'analytical method', 'cancer type', 'combinatorial', 'gene environment interaction', 'gene interaction', 'genome wide association study', 'heuristics', 'human disease', 'improved', 'novel', 'open source', 'programs', 'statistics', 'tool']",NLM,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2007,310526,0.0021868268993755343
"Machine Learning to Identify Complex Interactions in Genome-Wide Association Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The focus of this application is the development and validation of new computational approaches to identify complex interactions among genetic and environmental factors (features) which could be used to help identify individuals at high risk for a specific disease or dysfunction, and provide novel insights into the pathophysiology of the conditions in question. Specific Aims of the application include: 1 )To adapt a variety of statistical machine learning methods to the analysis of simulated high density genome scan and environmental exposure data and to evaluate their ability to identify SNPs and environmental factors that are jointly predictive of a binary trait; 2)To apply the described feature selection and model building techniques to the genome-wide SNP genotype data collected from two NHLBI-funded genome-wide association studies: a) the SNPs and Atherosclerosis (SEA) study predicting premature atherosclerosis, and b) the Cholesterol and Pharmacogenetics of Statins (CAPS) Study predicting LDL cholesterol; 3) to develop a study-specific publicly accessible web-site designed to help disseminate the methods and results of the project and 4) to support the NIH-wide Genes and Environment Initiative (GEI). This proposal represents a unique collaboration focusing on the development of new methods to more effectively identify interacting genetic and environmental factors that account for variation in risk for common cardiovascular and other disease phenotypes. If the risk is determined, in part by a gene-environment interaction, the preventive intervention could include altering the environmental exposure. Furthermore, determining specific genetic and/or environmental factors that jointly influence risk may reveal new biologic pathways that would be appropriate targets for novel therapeutic interventions. Together, improved risk stratification and new pathophysiologic insights would be expected to reduce the burden of disease and accelerate the realization of true personalized medicine. Relevance of this research to public health: This project aims to develop new approaches to identify the relationship between genetic and environmental factors which could then be used to identify people at high risk for a disease. Determining specific genetic and/or environmental factors that influence a person's risk of disease may help doctors reduce risk for disease and reveal new treatments for disease.

"Novel Statistical Methods for Human Gene Mapping    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many common human diseases originate in part from the complicated effects of multiple genetic variants found throughout the genome. Given the enormous impact of such diseases on public health, it is imperative to map relevant genetic variants to improve our understanding of the molecular basis of such diseases, as well as improve screening techniques for disease prevention. To this end, successful human gene mapping of complex diseases requires the development and application of powerful statistical methods that fully utilize the resources of the Human Genome Project. This grant proposes a set of such statistical methods that either address novel problems or improve existing solutions to problems in human gene mapping studies. These proposed methods are applicable to a variety of genetic studies as they address topics in linkage, linkage disequilibrium, and high-dimensional genetic analyses of complex diseases and disease-related quantitative traits. The methods can be partitioned into the two general groups: mixed-modeling procedures and case-control likelihood procedures. The mixed-modeling procedures considered include a general variance-component (VC) mapping framework for continuous and discrete trait data and a modified VC mapping framework that allows for haplotypes. Also considered is a novel linear-mixed-model framework that identifies a large combination of genetic variants that influence a quantitative trait using support-vector- machine regression. The case-control likelihood procedures considered are extensions of the approach of Epstein and Satten (2003) for haplotype inference on disease.

"Polymorphisms in Inflammation Genes and Bladder Cancer Risk    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       This proposed study will build upon the extensive epidemiologic database and specimen repository derived from an ongoing bladder cancer study entitled ""Genetic Susceptibility to Bladder Cancer: A Molecular Epidemiologic Approach"" (RO1 CA74880, PI: Xifeng Wu). The parent grant involved a multidisciplinary group of researchers applying a molecular epidemiologic approach to identify inter-individual differences in susceptibility to bladder carcinogenesis, with a focus on genes involved in protecting against genomic instability, such as DNA repair, cell cycle, and telomere maintenance. It is increasing recognized that inflammation plays an important role in the etiology of many cancers, including bladder cancer (BC). We have recently shown that an IL-6 promoter SNP (G-174C) is associated with BC risk and progression. In this application, we will test the hypothesis that BC is modulated by common, low penetrance polymorphisms in inflammation related genes, interacting with each other and/or environmental factors. We will take a pathway based genotyping approach and apply novel statistical tools to address the hypothesis. There are 3 specific aims: Specific Aim 1: To identify candidate polymorphisms in inflammation related genes that predispose individuals to BC. We plan to perform genotyping of a comprehensive list of potential functional polymorphisms in inflammation genes (85 polymorphisms in 44 genes) on 1000 Caucasian cases and 1000 controls matched on age, gender, and ethnicity. Specific Aim 2: To perform genotyping on tagging SNPs for the top 8 candidate genes that were identified in Specific Aim 1 (using a significance level of 0.1) identified in Specific Aim 1. This will give us a complete picture of the role that the specific gene plays in BC etiology. We will implement haplotype-based analyses to identify any additional variants that might have been missed using individual SNP-based approaches. Specific Aim 3: To apply hierarchical models to refine risk assessment and to apply novel machine-learning tools to identify any gene-environment and gene- gene interactions influencing risk for BC. These analyses will examine SNP main effects and gene-gene interactions, gene-environment interaction and develop and validate algorithms, which will identify individuals at highest risk for BC, given their personal exposure patterns and their genetic risk profiles. The application will allow us to have a comprehensive picture of the effects of functional polymorphisms in inflammation related genes on BC risk.          n/a",Polymorphisms in Inflammation Genes and Bladder Cancer Risk,7320980,R03CA130063,"['Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Bladder', 'Cancer Center', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Caucasians', 'Caucasoid Race', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Cycle Regulation', 'Cells', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Cytogenetics', 'DNA', 'DNA Repair', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Erythrocytes', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Etiology', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Gender', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genomic Instability', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Haplotypes', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Inflammation', 'Interleukin-6', 'Length', 'Literature', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutagens', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Penetrance', 'Physicians', 'Plasma', 'Play', 'Predisposition', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Significance Level', 'Specimen', 'Statistical Methods', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'Suspension substance', 'Suspensions', 'Telomere Maintenance', 'Testing', 'Variant', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'carcinogenesis', 'college', 'follow-up', 'gene environment interaction', 'gene interaction', 'medical specialties', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'parent grant', 'promoter', 'repository', 'telomere', 'tool']",NCI,UT MD ANDERSON CANCER CTR,R03,2007,77000,-0.009621210650651574
"Population Genetics Theory    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Four areas of theoretical population genetics will be studied. In the first, we will develop mathematical and statistical framework for studying the evolution of genes that affect how other sets of genes interact with one another. This theory helps in understanding conditions under which the genome can be expected to become modular in its production of phenotypes, as well as when synergy between mutations in different genes should be produced by evolution. We shall study how the pattern of interaction between deleterious mutations evolves as a function of the mutation rate, the recombination rate, and the degree of fitness loss of each mutation. We shall also study buildup of statistical association between genes that influence culturally transmitted traits that are associated either through transmission or through fitness. The second area of study concerns the evolution of pathogens such as influenza. Here we build models to predict the accumulation of mutations during epidemics and pandemics in a way that can assist in guiding vaccination strategies. We will develop algorithms that search for potential recombinants and reassortants among a collection of up to 1000 viral sequences. Here we aim to devise a statistical test to indicate whether identified recombinants or reassortants are spurious or statistically significant. Our recent theory of niche construction will form the basis of studies of how pathogens might evolve in response to human actions that they induce, such as use of antibiotics. The final research area will develop multiple-gene models for sex-linked control of genomic imprinting. These will include cis and trans modifiers of imprinting. Fertility selection as well as sex- specific viabilities will be studied in order to clarify the role of multiple paternities, which has been proposed as a driving force in the evolution of genomic imprinting. Genomic data from mammalian species will be analyzed using tools from statistical learning in order to predict which genes are likely to be imprinted. Correlations between DMA sequence properties and predicted imprinting status based on life history characteristics will also be sought.           n/a",Population Genetics Theory,7313297,R01GM028016,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Antibiotics', 'Antigens', 'Area', 'Bacteria', 'Bacteriophages', 'Characteristics', 'Class', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Condition', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Development', 'Drug Formulations', 'Epidemic', 'Evolution', 'Facility Construction Funding Category', 'Fertility', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Epistasis', 'Genetic Models', 'Genetic Recombination', 'Genome', 'Genomic Imprinting', 'Genomics', 'Haploidy', 'Human', 'Influenza', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Mutation', 'Numbers', 'Organism', 'Pan Genus', 'Pattern', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phenotype', 'Population Genetics', 'Production', 'Property', 'Purpose', 'Rate', 'Recombinants', 'Research', 'Role', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Statistically Significant', 'Taxon', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tweens', 'Vaccination', 'Variant', 'Viral', 'Virus', 'base', 'driving force', 'father role', 'fitness', 'gene function', 'genome sequencing', 'imprint', 'influenza epidemic', 'life history', 'pandemic disease', 'pathogen', 'research study', 'response', 'sex', 'social', 'theories', 'tool', 'trait', 'transmission process', 'vaccination strategy']",NIGMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2007,258957,0.0031485842093570745
"Machine vision analysis of C.elegans phenotypic patterns    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The nematode C. elegans has powerful genetics, a well-described nervous system, and a complete genome sequence; thus, it is well suited to analysis of behavior and development at the molecular and cellular levels. In particular, the ability to functionally map the influence of particular genes to specific behavioral consequences makes it possible to use genetic analysis to functionally dissect the molecular mechanisms underlying poorly understood aspects of nervous system function. However, many genes with critical roles in neuronal function have effects on behavior that to a casual observer appear very subtle or difficult to describe precisely. Therefore, to fully realize the potential of C. elegans for the genetic analysis of nervous system function, it is necessary to develop sophisticated methods for the rapid and consistent quantitation of mutant phenotypes, especially those related to behavior.       The goal of this proposed work is to develop computer vision tools for quantitatively characterizing the phenotypic patterns caused by mutations or pharmacological treatments in C. elegans. By making it possible to precisely characterize the behavioral phenotypes of mutants with abnormal locomotion or egglaying, these tools will be particularly useful for correlating specific neurotransmission defects with characteristic behavioral patterns. These analytical tools will also be used to generate a comprehensive database containing complex behavioral data on a large set of mutant strains. This database will make it possible to identify groups of mutants and pharmacological treatments that have similar effects on behavior or development.

"Machine Learning Prediction of Cancer Susceptibility    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Susceptibility to sporadic forms of cancer is determined by numerous genetic factors that interact in a nonlinear manner in the context of an individual's age and environmental exposure. This complex genetic architecture has important implications for the use of genome-wide association studies for identifying susceptibility genes. The assumption of a simple architecture supports a strategy of testing each single- nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) individually using traditional univariate statistics followed by a correction for multiple tests. However, a complex genetic architecture that is characteristic of most types of cancer requires analytical methods that specifically model combinations of SNPs and environmental exposures. While new and novel methods are available for modeling interactions, exhaustive testing of all combinations of SNPs is not feasible on a genome-wide scale because the number of comparisons is effectively infinite. Thus, it is critical that we develop intelligent strategies for selecting subsets of SNPs prior to combinatorial modeling. Our objective is to develop a research strategy for the detection, characterization, and interpretation of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions in a genome-wide association study of bladder cancer susceptibility.

"Text Mining Point Mutations for Genetic Diagnosis Array DESCRIPTION:    Text mining applications seek to alleviate the problems with identifying, searching, and extracting relevant information from large sets of literature. The goal of this proposal is to create a text mining application to extract protein point mutations from biomedical literature. The developed application will be used to extract point mutations from literature discussing human genetic disorders, and the retrieved database of point mutations used to design a DNA microarray chip for prenatal genetic diagnosis. First, the text mining application will be developed using machine learning and statistical natural language processing techniques. Second, the point mutation mining application will be applied to a large set of literature related to genetic disorders, and the retrieved point mutations deposited in an electronic database. This collection of point mutations will be examined to find polymorphisms in genes that are markers for genetic disorders. These polymorphic positions in the human genome will be gathered and used to design a DMA microarray chip that can genotype tens of thousands of single nucleotide polymorphisms. The microarray chip can be used for prenatal genetic diagnosis purposes to screen for hundreds of genetic disorders. n/a",Text Mining Point Mutations for Genetic Diagnosis Array,6993320,F37LM008883,"['biotechnology', 'information retrieval', 'microarray technology', 'molecular biology information system', 'point mutation', 'predoctoral investigator', 'technology /technique development']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SAN FRANCISCO,F37,2005,45812,0.021527571055040606
"Machine vision analysis of C.elegans phenotypic patterns    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The nematode C. elegans has powerful genetics, a well-described nervous system, and a complete genome sequence; thus, it is well suited to analysis of behavior and development at the molecular and cellular levels. In particular, the ability to functionally map the influence of particular genes to specific behavioral consequences makes it possible to use genetic analysis to functionally dissect the molecular mechanisms underlying poorly understood aspects of nervous system function. However, many genes with critical roles in neuronal function have effects on behavior that to a casual observer appear very subtle or difficult to describe precisely. Therefore, to fully realize the potential of C. elegans for the genetic analysis of nervous system function, it is necessary to develop sophisticated methods for the rapid and consistent quantitation of mutant phenotypes, especially those related to behavior.       The goal of this proposed work is to develop computer vision tools for quantitatively characterizing the phenotypic patterns caused by mutations or pharmacological treatments in C. elegans. By making it possible to precisely characterize the behavioral phenotypes of mutants with abnormal locomotion or egglaying, these tools will be particularly useful for correlating specific neurotransmission defects with characteristic behavioral patterns. These analytical tools will also be used to generate a comprehensive database containing complex behavioral data on a large set of mutant strains. This database will make it possible to identify groups of mutants and pharmacological treatments that have similar effects on behavior or development.

"LINKAGE AND ASSOCIATION OF GENETIC MARKERS AND DISEASE The proposed research aims to: a) Improve the understanding of the               genetics of inherited diseases with unclear modes of transmission.               Studies will evaluate the effectiveness of current methods of analysis,          including classical linkage analysis, sib-pair or affected-pedigree-             member analysis and the use of measures of association in understanding          the underlying genetic mechanisms of such traits.  Simulation studies            will continue to provide a source of family data reflecting confounding          factors thought to be a problem in linkage analysis of certain complex           traits, such as psychiatric or behavioral disorders.  Factors to be              considered include assortative mating, genetic heterogeneity and multi-          locus disease determination.  The ability of current methods to                  correctly analyze traits with one or more of these factors will be               assessed and, where appropriate, alternative methods will be developed           and tested.  b) Apply techniques of neural network pattern matching to           problems of genetic systems.  Applications include: aid in phenotype             definition for traits with multiple clinical problems of genetic                 systems.  Applications include: aid in phenotype definition for traits           with multiple clinical characteristics; determination of risk of disease         based on phenotype, known risk factors and disease profiles in                   relatives; determination of organ transplant success based on HLA                antigen matching patterns; definition of disease phenotype based on              quantitative factors.  c) Develop and apply strategies for ordering              multiple linked loci using pairwise recombination data, radiation hybrid         data, or other physical mapping data.  Some of these ordering strategies         may be adaptable to the development of techniques for integrating map            information obtained by different methods, an important step in                  organizing a comprehensive, reliable map.  d) Carry out classical                linkage analysis for specific genetic diseases.  Currently, a genome             scan is underway to identify a gene or genes for polycystic liver                disease.  Other diseases to be studied include lymphoma and prostate             cancer. Methods to be tested in the simulation studies can be applied            to these analyses in order to better understand the complete genetic             picture, including identification of heterogeneity, by detecting linkage         of different disease forms to different marker loci. Such                        differentiation will help sharpen the clinical definition of various             forms of the diseases.                                                                                                                                            As a result of advances from this work, better mathematical tools for            the study of diseases with complex or ill-defined inheritance patterns           will be available.  Applications to specific diseases will increase              understanding of interactions between clinical definition and                    predisposing genetic factors.  This will increase the precision of               genetic counseling and suggest useful approaches for studying the                mechanisms involved in determining disease state.                                 n/a",LINKAGE AND ASSOCIATION OF GENETIC MARKERS AND DISEASE,6385414,R01GM029177,"['alleles', ' artificial chromosomes', ' artificial intelligence', ' computational neuroscience', ' computer program /software', ' computer simulation', ' family genetics', ' gene expression', ' genetic disorder', ' genetic markers', ' genetic susceptibility', ' histocompatibility antigens', ' human data', ' human genetic material tag', ' linkage mapping', ' liver disorder', ' lymphoma', ' mathematical model', ' model design /development', ' phenotype', ' prostate neoplasms', ' quantitative trait loci', ' sequence tagged sites']",NIGMS,NEW YORK BLOOD CENTER,R01,2001,198845,0.022863291556581764

Applications include: aid in phenotype             definition for traits with multiple clinical problems of genetic                 systems.  Applications include: aid in phenotype definition for traits           with multiple clinical characteristics; determination of risk of disease         based on phenotype, known risk factors and disease profiles in                   relatives; determination of organ transplant success based on HLA                antigen matching patterns; definition of disease phenotype based on              quantitative factors.  c) Develop and apply strategies for ordering              multiple linked loci using pairwise recombination data, radiation hybrid         data, or other physical mapping data.  Some of these ordering strategies         may be adaptable to the development of techniques for integrating map            information obtained by different methods, an important step in                  organizing a comprehensive, reliable map.  d) Carry out classical                linkage analysis for specific genetic diseases.  Currently, a genome             scan is underway to identify a gene or genes for polycystic liver                disease.  Other diseases to be studied include lymphoma and prostate             cancer. Methods to be tested in the simulation studies can be applied            to these analyses in order to better understand the complete genetic             picture, including identification of heterogeneity, by detecting linkage         of different disease forms to different marker loci. Such                        differentiation will help sharpen the clinical definition of various             forms of the diseases.                                                                                                                                            As a result of advances from this work, better mathematical tools for            the study of diseases with complex or ill-defined inheritance patterns           will be available.  Applications to specific diseases will increase              understanding of interactions between clinical definition and                    predisposing genetic factors.  This will increase the precision of               genetic counseling and suggest useful approaches for studying the                mechanisms involved in determining disease state.                                 n/a",LINKAGE AND ASSOCIATION OF GENETIC MARKERS AND DISEASE,6179464,R01GM029177,"['alleles', ' artificial chromosomes', ' artificial intelligence', ' computational neuroscience', ' computer program /software', ' computer simulation', ' family genetics', ' gene expression', ' genetic disorder', ' genetic markers', ' genetic susceptibility', ' histocompatibility antigens', ' human data', ' human genetic material tag', ' linkage mapping', ' liver disorder', ' lymphoma', ' mathematical model', ' model design /development', ' phenotype', ' prostate neoplasms', ' quantitative trait loci', ' sequence tagged sites']",NIGMS,NEW YORK BLOOD CENTER,R01,2000,195932,0.022863291556581764
"MODELS IN POPULATION GENETICS The genes of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region control a variety          Of functions involved in the immune response, and influence                      susceptibility to over 40 diseases.  Our understanding of the structure          and function of the HLA genes, their disease associations, and the               evolutionary features of this multigene family has benefitted from recent        advances in molecular biology, immunology, disease modelling and                 population genetics.  Theoretical studies in the development of models to        determine the modes of inheritance of the HLA associated diseases have           led to a better understanding of the inheritance patterns in insulin             dependent diabetes mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis,           ankylosing spondylitis, hemochromatosis, celiac disease, and others.  It         is now clear that many of the HLA associated diseases involve                    heterogeneity in their HLA components, as well as non-HLA genetic                components.                                                                                                                                                       The specific aims of our research are to study the genetic components in         the etiology of the HLA associated diseases, and population genetic              features of the HLA system.  A variety of methods to test modes of               inheritance of diseases using marker allele information, will be                 developed.  Methods appropriate for the analysis of marker systems which         are not highly polymorphic, to both detect linkage and determine modes of        inheritance, will be investigated.  The information content of particular        pedigree types for LOD score analysis will be investigated.  Two methods         using patterns of linkage disequilibrium will be investigated to                 determine their usefulness in mapping disease predisposing genes.  A             number of large collaborative data sets of HLA associated diseases will          be analyzed.

"Clinical and genetic analysis of retinopathy of prematurity Project Summary The long-term goal of this project is to establish a quantitative framework for retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) care based on clinical, imaging, genetic, and informatics principles. In the previous grant period, we have developed artificial intelligence methods for ROP diagnosis, but real-world adoption has been limited by lack of prospective validation and by perception of these systems as “black boxes” that do not explain their rationale for diagnosis. Furthermore, although biomedical research data are being generated at an enormous pace, much less work has been done to integrate disparate scientific findings across the spectrum from genomics to imaging to clinical medicine. This renewal will address current gaps in knowledge in these areas. Our overall hypotheses are that developing a quantitative framework for ROP care using artificial intelligence and analytics will improve clinical disease management, that building “explainable” artificial intelligence systems will enhance clinical acceptance and educational opportunities, and that analysis of relationships among clinical, imaging, environmental, and genetic findings, in ROP will improve understanding of disease pathogenesis and risk. These hypotheses will be tested using three Specific Aims: (1) Evaluation performance of an artificial intelligence system for ROP diagnosis and screening prospectively. This will include: (a) recruit a target of over 2000 eye exams including wide-angle retinal images from 375 subjects at 5 centers, (b) optimize an image quality detection algorithm we have recently developed, and (c) analyze system accuracy for ROP diagnosis and screening (using a novel quantitative vascular severity scale). (2) Improve the interpretability of our existing artificial intelligence methods for ROP diagnosis. This will include: (a) increase “explainability” of systems by combining deep learning with traditional feature extraction methods, (b) develop neural networks to identify changes between serial images, and (c) evaluate these methods through systematic feedback by experts. (3) Develop integrated models for ROP pathogenesis and risk. This will include: (a) build and improve ROP risk prediction models based on clinical, image, and demographic features, and (b) integrate genetic, imaging, clinical, and environmental variables through genetic risk prediction by machine learning, by investigating casual relationships with genetic variants and genetic risk scores, and by incorporating SNP associations with gene expression measurements to identify functional genes of ROP. Ultimately, these studies will significantly reduce barriers to adoption of technologies such as artificial intelligence for clinicians, and will demonstrate a prototype for health information management which combines genotypic and phenotypic data. This project will be performed by a multi-disciplinary team of investigators who have worked successfully together for nearly 10 years, and who have expertise in ophthalmology, biomedical informatics, computer science, computational biology, ophthalmic genetics, genetic analysis, and statistical genetics. Project Narrative ROP is a leading cause of childhood blindness in the US and throughout the world, and the number of infants at risk for disease is increasing as the rate of premature birth rises. Rapidly-progressive changes associated with retinal vascular development may be visualized by clinical examination, captured by wide-angle imaging, and analyzed genetically. This project will develop, enhance, and validate artificial intelligence and analytic tools to help clinicians identify infants at risk for severe ROP using image analysis, genetic analysis, and integrative informatics that combines these factors – while also providing insight about disease pathogenesis.",Clinical and genetic analysis of retinopathy of prematurity,9974137,R01EY019474,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biomedical Research', 'Blindness', 'Blood Vessels', 'Caring', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Research', 'Cohort Studies', 'Computational Biology', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Expert Systems', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Infant', 'Informatics', 'Information Management', 'International', 'Knowledge', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Macular degeneration', 'Measurement', 'Medical Genetics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Network-based', 'Ophthalmic examination and evaluation', 'Ophthalmology', 'Other Genetics', 'Oxygen', 'Paper', 'Pathogenesis', 'Peer Review', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Predisposition', 'Premature Birth', 'Premature Infant', 'Publishing', 'Randomized', 'Reference Standards', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Retina', 'Retinopathy of Prematurity', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Severities', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'care delivery', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical examination', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical risk', 'clinically significant', 'computer science', 'data access', 'data integration', 'deep learning', 'diagnosis standard', 'disorder risk', 'feature extraction', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic variant', 'high risk', 'imaging genetics', 'improved', 'insight', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple data types', 'neovascular', 'neural network', 'novel', 'phenotypic data', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'real world application', 'recruit', 'retinal imaging', 'risk prediction model', 'screening', 'serial imaging']",NEI,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,764279,0.02085445750277663
"A Multivariate Mediation and Deep Learning Framework for Genome-Connectome -Substance Use Research Substance use and addiction are complex biopsychosocial disorders influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. A key challenge in addiction genetics research is to understand how multiple genetic variants interactively influence addiction traits through impacting the central nervous system. To address this challenge, we propose a large-scale mediation analysis framework to identify addiction-related gene-brain circuitry pathways, using nicotine addiction as the targeted disorder, although the platform will be readily applicable for other addiction-related disorders and phenotypes. We will fully leverage the complex and interactive interdependent relationships between the imaging-genetics data and perform multivariate statistical inference with simultaneously increased statistical power and reduce false positive rates. The results will precisely identify multiple sets of genetic variants that interactively alter brain functional and structural circuitries, and then influence nicotine addiction. We will further supplement the mediation results with deep learning algorithms to study how genetic variants non-linearly and interactively coordinate to influence nicotine addiction and explain the phenotypic variance. Novel network topology based convolutional and pooling functions will be developed to achieve optimal prediction accuracy of addiction traits using genome-connectome pathways. All models and findings will be carefully validated through multiple independent large-sample data sets of imaging-genetics studies for nicotine addiction for ensuring the replicability and reliability of our findings derived from this framework. We plan to produce a freely available and user-friendly software incorporating the mediation analysis framework and deep learning algorithms enabling the complex whole genome - connectome analysis for addiction genetics research. Nicotine addiction is a worldwide public health priority and imposing health and economic burden on millions of individuals and families. This proposal seeks to identify how multiple genetic variants interactively influence the nicotine addiction through impacting brain circuitries. The improved understanding of genome-connectome pathways of addiction could lead to more effective treatment and prevention.",A Multivariate Mediation and Deep Learning Framework for Genome-Connectome -Substance Use Research,9983690,DP1DA048968,"['Address', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Brain', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Economic Burden', 'Ensure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Family', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Research', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Mediation', 'Modeling', 'Neuraxis', 'Nicotine Dependence', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Prevention', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Structure', 'Substance Addiction', 'addiction', 'base', 'biopsychosocial', 'brain circuitry', 'connectome', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'effective therapy', 'genetic variant', 'health economics', 'imaging genetics', 'improved', 'nicotine use', 'novel', 'public health priorities', 'trait', 'user friendly software', 'whole genome']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,DP1,2020,463500,0.001731557230838351
"Integrating Machine Learning and Genomic Approaches to Understand Cerebral Small Vessel Disease Pathogenesis from White Matter Hyperintensity Patterns PROJECT SUMMARY  As a neurointensivist and neurologist at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis (WUSM), my career goal is to develop an independent research program as a computational biologist capable of using advanced bioinformatics and statistical methods to integrate analysis of large-scale neuroimaging and genetic data, with the aim of deepening understanding of the biological mechanisms influencing cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) and identifying new targets for therapeutic development. As a first step towards this goal, I have designed an innovative proposal that combine machine-learning (ML) methods and integrated imaging genetic analyses of large-scale neuroimaging and genetic data to improve characterization of SVD disease mechanisms.  The clinical, imaging, and etiologic heterogeneity of SVD have impeded efforts to uncover the pathophysiology of this common and debilitating neurological disease. White matter hyperintensities (WMH), a major imaging endpoint of SVD, are comprised of multiple SVD pathologic processes. Growing evidence suggests location-specific vulnerability of brain parenchyma to different underlying SVD pathologic processes, in which spatially localized WMH patterns may reflect distinct SVD etiologies. Characterizing WMH spatial pattern variations in SVD will not only provide insights into underlying pathogenesis, such as vascular amyloid deposition, arteriolosclerosis, and other less well defined or as-yet unknown disease mechanisms, but also lead to creation of novel imaging biomarkers of these SVD pathologic processes. This proposal addresses a key inadequacy, as existing WMH pattern definitions are determined empirically and cannot distinguish overlapping SVD etiologies and risk factors. In this proposal, I aim to capture WMH spatial pattern variations that reflect distinct SVD etiologies in an unbiased manner, by applying clustering analysis/ML methods to structural MRI data to create novel etiology-specific SVD imaging phenotypes. Moreover, given that genetics influence the variance of WMH, I will integrate genetic analyses of these WMH patterns to uncover novel mechanisms that influence SVD pathogenesis. My preliminary data demonstrate the feasibility of identifying data-driven WMH spatial pattern variations, which are specific to distinct SVD etiologies, and allow detection of genetic risk variants that may help inform SVD pathologic processes.  My career plan leverages the extensive resources and exceptional environments at WUSM, under the guidance of a multidisciplinary mentorship team with expertise across diverse fields including cerebrovascular physiology, neuroimaging, informatics, genetics, and machine learning (Drs. Jin-Moo Lee, Daniel Marcus, Carlos Cruchaga and Yasheng Chen). In this Career Development Award, I propose to: 1) determine distinct WMH spatial patterns that can discriminate underlying SVD pathology and/or risk factors by applying pattern analysis ML methods to structural MRI data from three unique cohorts (n=2,710) enriched for different SVD pathologies (Aim 1a), and examining if the ML-defined WMH patterns segregate individuals by well-defined SVD risk factors as biologic validation (Aim 1b), and 2) identify genetic variants (Aim 2a) associated with WMH patterns that reflect diverse pathologic processes influencing SVD using genome wide association and gene-based analyses; replicate the top variants (Aim 2b) in an independent population-based cohort (n=21,708); and use advanced bioinformatics tools to uncover new biologic pathways associated with WMH spatial patterns (Aim 2c).  This research proposal and accompanying development plan with focused training in machine learning, neuroimaging, and multivariate methods for integrated imaging genetics analysis, will build on my background in genetics towards a career investigating cerebrovascular disorders using translational bioinformatics. This Award will provide me with the necessary training to evolve into an independent investigator with a computational research program that can integrate large imaging and genetics datasets to derive results that are highly relevant to the prevention and treatment of cerebrovascular disease in my clinical patient population. PROJECT NARRATIVE Cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) is one of the most prevalent neurological conditions in older adults, and a leading cause of stroke and cognitive impairment, for which existing treatment and preventative options have been limited or lack efficacy. This project’s goal is to enhance our knowledge of the complex disease processes underlying SVD using machine learning and integrating individual imaging and genetic data from over 20,000 adults. By understanding these disease processes, we can design novel methods to more effectively treat and prevent stroke and dementia.",Integrating Machine Learning and Genomic Approaches to Understand Cerebral Small Vessel Disease Pathogenesis from White Matter Hyperintensity Patterns,10022173,K23NS110927,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amyloid deposition', 'Archives', 'Arteries', 'Award', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy', 'Cerebral hemisphere hemorrhage', 'Cerebral small vessel disease', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders', 'Cerebrovascular Physiology', 'Clinical', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Distal', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Failure', 'Functional disorder', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomic approach', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hypertension', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Lobar', 'Location', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Microvascular Dysfunction', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologist', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathologic', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stroke', 'Stroke prevention', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Washington', 'White Matter Hyperintensity', 'arteriole', 'base', 'biobank', 'bioinformatics tool', 'brain parenchyma', 'career', 'cohort', 'design', 'disorder subtype', 'effective therapy', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic association', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'hypertension control', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging genetics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'machine learning method', 'medical schools', 'multidisciplinary', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'patient population', 'population based', 'programs', 'racial and ethnic', 'risk variant', 'serial imaging', 'stroke therapy', 'success', 'therapeutic development', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'unsupervised learning']",NINDS,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,K23,2020,178809,0.012802764731123724
"Mobile Genetic Elements and Clinical Outcomes in Staphylococcus aureus Bacteremia Project Summary Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and its impact on health has been recognized as one of the most serious public health threats facing society. Significantly, the vast majority of acquired AMR genes are carried on mobile genetic elements (MGEs), which include plasmids, insertion sequences, and transposons. One of the most important hospital and community-associated pathogens harboring resistance genes is Staphylococcus aureus, which causes more than 80,000 infections and 11,000 deaths each year in the United States. S. aureus readily acquire MGEs, which encompass more than 20% of the genome for most strains, and these elements have been central to the establishment and broad spread of resistance to antibiotics such as oxacillin and vancomycin. Additionally, S. aureus is capable of causing a wide range of infections, including bacteremia, with a mortality rate up to 30%. Utilizing an unparalleled collection of S. aureus strains from a cohort of patients in Central and South America with bacteremia, I seek to develop a framework for the identification and comparison of circulating MGEs through the use of bacterial phylogenetics, clinical epidemiology, and machine learning. This dataset will serve as the foundation for my training to become an independent scientist. To begin interrogating this exceptional strain collection, we have generated Illumina short-read whole genome sequencing data on 1,087 S. aureus bacteremia isolates to identify MGEs, and will leverage novel ultra-long read sequencing methodologies to fully characterize the position and variations of these elements. The three aims within this proposal are designed to elucidate the role of MGEs in driving the genetic diversification of endemic S. aureus clades, and identify if they serve as adaptation hotspots when put under selective pressure from the host immune system or antibiotics. First, I will characterize the repertoire of MGEs within this large cohort of isolates and apply gene-order and Bayesian time-measured phylogenetics to identify the predominant MGEs within each clade and how frequently they are acquired and lost. Second, I will assess the MGE diversity within isolates collected serially from the same individual. I hypothesize these MGEs will be the primary variation points and will be more important than single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to the adaptation to selective pressures such as antibiotics. Third, I will identify the clinical (age, BMI, and present comorbidities) and genomic (SNPs, MGEs, and genes) features that are predictive of the 30-day mortality in the predominant clades of S. aureus within our dataset. I theorize these genetic and clinical signatures will be different for each clade as they possess different repertoires of MGEs. The Center for Antimicrobial Resistance and Microbial Genomics in The University of Texas Health Sciences Center at Houston has a firm commitment to understanding and reducing AMR and AMR infections. This provides an exceptional environment to conduct my research elucidating the role of MGEs in the clinical outcomes of S. aureus bacteremia, and to develop as an investigator and participate in the training offered to make the transition to independence. Project Narrative Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and its impact on health has been recognized as one of the most serious global public health threats facing our society. This proposal aims to clarify the role mobile genetic elements play in transmitting antimicrobial resistance and driving genetic diversity within endemic Staphylococcus aureus lineages causing bacteremia.

"Deep Learning Based Genetic Risk Prediction for Type 1 Diabetes Project Summary Type I diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disease of childhood caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. In a subset of individuals with a genetic predisposition to T1D, environmental triggers instigate an autoimmune response which targets and damages pancreatic islets, leading to pre-diabetes and ultimately diabetes. A critical barrier in T1D prevention research is to identify and directly enroll children with a strong genetic predisposition for developing T1D into prevention trials. A robust genetic risk score (GRS) would allow for the identification of children at high-risk of T1D, their recruitment into T1D prevention trials, and subsequent testing of novel interventions. I aim to 1) optimize a multi-layer feedforward neural network genetic risk predictor that can be used to enroll newborns directly into T1D prevention trials; and 2) identify putative, novel T1D-causing SNPs, and their interactions. Completion of aim 1 would provide a better GRS to the T1D research community, which can be used to identify children with higher genetic risk of T1D development, increasing the statistical power of future T1D prevention clinical trials. Completion of aim 2 will provide a deeper biological understanding of the molecular drivers of T1D development, and potential new therapeutic targets for T1D prevention trials. Successful completion of this project will both help understand the genetic causes of type 1 diabetes and help prevent the disease.

"Searching for missing heritability for cardiometabolic outcomes by race ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiometabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) are common global health conditions that carry a great public health burden for chronic disability and early death. African Americans are more likely to be disproportionately affected than Whites. Our proposed project will have an important impact because it has great potential to explain, 1) A measure of the genetic susceptibility of these cardiometabolic diseases and mortality, and 2) Interaction and mediation of a genetic risk score (GRS) with a low diet quality score and low physical activity levels on these adverse health outcomes. There are published reports of interaction (effect modification) but not mediation (indirectly through an intervening variable) of a GRS with nutritional factors and low physical activity levels on cardiometabolic conditions; however, these studies involving interaction were performed predominantly in Whites. Most of the genetic susceptibility for these outcomes remains unexplained for African Americans. Studies are lacking on the role of these lifestyle factors in terms of interaction and especially mediation with a GRS to increase risk for cardiometabolic outcomes among Whites and African Americans. Thus, several questions remain regarding the influence environmental factors have with genes to increase disease risk and mortality among different race/ethnic groups. To address our questions, we will use the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute Candidate Gene Association Resource dataset of about 50,000 subjects, including 13,000 African Americans. To account for a measure of the genetic susceptibility, we will capture multiplicative single nucleotide polymorphism effects by the re-weighted random forest statistical method to compute a disease-and-race-specific GRS. We will include functional reduction- oxidation and metabolic disruptive single nucleotide polymorphisms that are involved in the inflammation and nutrient-signaling pathways. We will then investigate interaction and mediation of a GRS with a low diet quality score and low physical activity levels on T2DM, CVD, and mortality at baseline and over time by performing a meta-analysis. Our data include information on genetic polymorphisms, cross-sectional and longitudinal measurements on phenotypes for T2DM, CVD, and mortality, as well as dietary intake, physical activity, and relevant covariates. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The purpose of the study is to find a measure of the genetic susceptibility for type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and mortality in Whites and especially African Americans. Our study will examine interaction and mediation of a genetic risk score with a low diet quality score and low physical activity levels on these cardiometabolic outcomes at baseline and over time by performing a meta-analysis. To address our aims we will use the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute Candidate Gene Association Resource dataset of approximately 50,000 subjects, including 13,000 African Americans.",Searching for missing heritability for cardiometabolic outcomes by race,9838243,K01HL127278,"['Address', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Biometry', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Competence', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diet', 'Dietary intake', 'Disease', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Ensure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic group', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heritability', 'Inflammation', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Metabolic', 'Modification', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Nutrient', 'Nutritional', 'Outcome', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Parents', 'Phenotype', 'Physical activity', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Race', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Secure', 'Signal Pathway', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Time', 'Visit', 'Writing', 'cardiometabolic risk', 'cardiometabolism', 'caucasian American', 'design', 'disability', 'disorder risk', 'gene interaction', 'global health', 'health disparity', 'high risk', 'lifestyle factors', 'mid-career faculty', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'nutrition', 'professor', 'public health relevance', 'random forest', 'response']",NHLBI,MOREHOUSE SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,K01,2020,142345,-0.006763709817661973
"Bioinformatics Strategies for Genome Wide Association Studies The promise of precision medicine is to edit a patient’s DNA and/or administer therapeutics targeting etiologic molecules that prevent or reverse the disease process using a tailored design. All of this happens at the level of the individual and requires precision knowledge of that patient’s biology. In stark contrast, much of the knowledge we possess about genomic risk factors comes from statistical measures of association from human populations. The conceptual and practical disconnect between the populations we study and the individuals we want to treat is a major source of confusion about how to move forward in an era driven by genome technology. The primary goal of this proposal is to develop novel informatics methodology and software to facilitate precision medicine by connecting population and individual genomic phenomena. We propose here a Virtual Genomic Medicine (VGMed) workbench where clinicians can carry out thought experiments about the treatment of individual patients using models of disease risk derived from population-level studies. This will be accomplished by first developing a novel Genomics-guided Automated Machine Learning (GAML) algorithm for deriving risk models from real data that is accessible to clinicians (AIM 1). We will then develop a novel simulation approach that is able to generate artificial data that preserves the distribution of genetic effects observed in the real data while maintaining other characteristics such as genotype frequencies (AIM 2). This will generate open data allowing anyone to perform virtual interventions on patients derived from a population- level risk distribution. The workbench will allow editing of individual genotypes and simulate the administration of drugs by editing machine learning parameters in the simulation model (AIM 3). The change in risk and disease status for the specific patient will be tracked in real time. Finally, we provide a feature in the workbench that will allow the clinician to generate specific hypotheses about individual genetic variants that can then be validated using integrated knowledge sources that include databases such as PubMed and ClinVar thus giving the user immediate feedback (AIM 4). All methods and software will be provided as open-source (AIM 5). Most genetic studies of common human diseases result in statistical summaries of risk derived from human populations. These statistical summaries are not that helpful for determining the health of an individual. This proposal will create new computer algorithms and software help clinicians and researchers connect population- level statistics with individual level genetic effects to advance our understanding of how to treat patients based on their own unique genetic makeup.",Bioinformatics Strategies for Genome Wide Association Studies,9886261,R01LM010098,"['Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Characteristics', 'ClinVar', 'Community Medicine', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Confusion', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Etiology', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Genetic', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Information Resources', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Online Systems', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Population Analysis', 'Population Study', 'Process', 'PubMed', 'Pythons', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Source', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Validation', 'base', 'data preservation', 'design', 'disorder risk', 'experimental study', 'genetic makeup', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'human disease', 'individual patient', 'machine learning algorithm', 'models and simulation', 'novel', 'open data', 'open source', 'phenotypic data', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'simulation', 'statistics', 'therapeutic target', 'virtual']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2020,371859,0.014468930546597111
"Advancing Multi-Omics and Electronic Health Records Computational Methodologies PROJECT SUMMARY  Phenomic advances from large-scale electronic health records (EHR) linked to DNA biobanks have pioneered an efficient approach to genetic discovery that has transformed human genetic studies, with the enormous potential to provide constraints on relevant biological mechanisms on a wide spectrum of human phenotypes. Nevertheless, our understanding of the downstream molecular consequences of genetic associations remains limited and impedes our ability to develop novel therapeutic strategies for complex diseases. Given their enormous discovery potential for human genomics and precision medicine, genetic analyses in diverse populations offer unprecedented opportunities to identify causal genetic mechanisms underlying human trait variation.  This research proposal aims to address these convergent developments and critical gaps and to exert a powerful influence on efforts to expand our understanding of disease mechanisms and therapeutic possibilities. Here we hypothesize that a comprehensive multi- omic, phenomic, and trans-ethnic computational methodology will provide a robust and rigorous framework. This proposal thus has the following aims: AIM 1: Develop a regularized regression based methodology and a deep learning framework to improve characterization of the genetic architecture of gene expression and to build robust prediction models, extending a Transcriptome-Wide Association Study (TWAS) methodology (called PrediXcan) that we developed. AIM 2: Develop statistical causal modeling of trait-associated genetic variation through a convergent TWAS and Mendelian Randomization approach and apply it to thousands of human traits with available GWAS and EHR data. AIM 3: Develop analytic approaches and software tools to further genetic analyses in admixed and multi-ethnic populations and to lay the groundwork for trans-ethnic multi-omic methodologies, using EHR data (e.g., BioVU, UK Biobank, All of Us). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE We will develop a comprehensive multi-omic, phenomic, and trans-ethnic computational methodology that bridges the gap between Genetic Epidemiology and Functional Genomics. This research provides a rigorous framework for investigating relevant mechanisms underlying complex traits, including disease risk and quantitative traits.

"Exploring Statin Pleiotropic Effects within a Very Large EHR Cohort Statins among the most widely prescribed agents worldwide for prevention of cardiovascular diseases, produce substantial pleiotropic effects. Pleiotropic effects are unanticipated outcomes other than those for which the drug was originally developed, either therapeutic (beneficial) or detrimental (adverse drug reactions). Statin pleiotropic effects are unanticipatedly broad, including increasing the risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus and cataract, decreasing cancer-related mortality, and reducing dementia. Many effects are still not determined. In addition, individual responses to statins are highly variable. Genetics studies have identified loci that are significantly associated with statin response. However, it is unclear if either of the genetic variants within these regions is also associated with statin pleiotropic effects. We propose to investigate statin pleiotropic effects using whole de-identified electronic health records (EHRs) of >2.5 million individuals at Vanderbilt, including >110,000 statin exposure individuals. By linking this cohort to BioVU, the Vanderbilt de-identified DNA biobank, >10,000 of these statin exposure individuals have extant genome-wide genotyping. We argue that 1) previous inconclusive results are largely caused by inconsistent phenotype definitions, and 2) using the EHR to develop a novel, drug-based phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS) provides an ideal approach to discover unknown statin effects. The still-growing Vanderbilt de-identified EHRs allow large amounts of individuals' clinical data shared to support validation of known pleiotropic effects and to enable novel discoveries. Our previous work demonstrated our ability to develop consistent EHR-based phenotype definitions that can be deployed across multiple EHRs and institutions. We have expertise leveraging state-of-the-art informatics techniques, including natural language processing and ontologies, for pharmacogenetic studies, including for statins. We first described the PheWAS approach to not only replicate genetic associations but also discover novel, pleiotropic associations. Our informatics expertise combined with an ideal EHR/DNA population, will enable us to validate and discover statin pleiotropic effects. Accordingly, we propose the following three aims: 1. develop and test EHR-based phenotype algorithms for four controversial statin pleiotropic effects, 2. conduct a PheWAS to discover unknown statin pleiotropic effects, and 3. evaluate and discover genetic predictors of statin pleiotropic effects. Project Narrative Statins (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors), among the most widely prescribed agents worldwide for prevention of cardiovascular diseases, produce substantial pleiotropic effects. Statin pleiotropic effects are unanticipatedly broad and the genetic variants associated with statin pleiotropic effects remain unclear. We propose to investigate statin pleiotropic effects using whole de-identified electronic health records (EHRs) of >2 million patients at Vanderbilt (including 10,000 genotyped statin recipients) to answer these questions.",Exploring Statin Pleiotropic Effects within a Very Large EHR Cohort,9881338,R01HL133786,"['Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Breast', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cataract', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cohort Analysis', 'Colorectal', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiologist', 'Exposure to', 'General Population', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genetic study', 'Genotype', 'Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Link', 'Lung', 'Lymphoma', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Oxidoreductase', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Prostate', 'Qi', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'TCF7L2 gene', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Work', 'adverse drug reaction', 'base', 'biobank', 'cancer risk', 'cardiovascular disorder prevention', 'cohort', 'data sharing', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic association', 'genetic predictors', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic locus', 'glutaryl coA', 'individual response', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'phenome', 'phenotyping algorithm', 'pleiotropism', 'response']",NHLBI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2020,395483,-0.016459168069406817
"Integrated Clinical and Transcriptomic Profiling to Characterize Disease Phenotype PROJECT SUMMARY Exome and whole-genome sequencing are becoming increasingly routine approaches in cancer[1], common disease[2]and rare disease diagnosis.[3] Despite their success, our ability to fully interpret the clinical relevance of personal genome variation remains a significant gap[4-6]. Considering this, the most crucial need is more genotype-phenotype data that link genetic variation with disease causation. The objective of this proposal is to improve the clinical interpretation of genetic variation; in particular, by developing integrative approaches that predict the effect of genetic variation on clinical phenotype. This proposal addresses the hypothesis, supported by preliminary data, that combining patient transcriptomic data with genotypic and clinical data (as opposed to each alone) offers a better mechanistic understanding of disease natural history, from initial presentation to progression. The specific aims are designed such that each independently add substantial functional genomic information, over and above previously available patient genetic data, to further resolve the clinical phenotype. Aim 1 establishes a comprehensive and widely-shared dataset of patient transcriptomic (and genetic) variation across multiple cancer, cardiovascular and thrombosis/bleeding phenotypes, in patients with somatically-acquired myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) and select other rare heritable blood diseases (HBD). Aim 2 methodically determines differential RNA expression and processing between clinically-relevant subgroups of MPN and HBD patients. Aim 3 brings these elements together – and applies two integrative Bayesian and machine learning approaches, RIVER[24] (RNA-informed variant effect on regulation) and LASSO[25] (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator), to resolve the functional and clinical relevance of rare variants; and identify signatures most predictive of disease risk or progression. Completion of these aims will contribute new scientific knowledge on how integrating transcriptomic data improves clinical genomic analyses in other genetic (and rare) diseases. In addition, this project will enable the Principal Investigator to develop expertise in the informatics and data science aspects of genomic medicine that complement her current background in biophysics, biochemistry and translational hematology. Combined with additional informatics training at Stanford University through coursework, seminars, one-on-one advising from project mentors, and interactions with the wider statistics, bioinformatics and genomics communities, this project will prepare the Principal Investigator to launch an independent academic career in genomic medicine. PROJECT NARRATIVE Accurate clinical interpretation of genetic variation in personal genome data is an essential component of personalized medicine approaches and the precise genetic diagnosis toward achieving improved public health. This project will integrate genetic and clinical modifiers with functional genomic information (RNA sequencing) from adequately-powered, disease-relevant cells; and provide direct insight into transcriptional perturbations caused by genetic variation.",Integrated Clinical and Transcriptomic Profiling to Characterize Disease Phenotype,9948713,K08HG010061,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Alleles', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Bayesian learning', 'Biochemistry', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Biophysics', 'Blood', 'Blood Cells', 'Blood Platelets', 'Blood specimen', 'Body mass index', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Demographic Factors', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease stratification', 'Elements', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Fusion', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Hematological Disease', 'Hematology', 'Hemorrhage', 'Heritability', 'Informatics', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lasso', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical Genetics', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Myeloproliferative disease', 'Other Genetics', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Public Health', 'RNA', 'RNA Processing', 'Rare Diseases', 'Reference Standards', 'Regulation', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Rivers', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Thrombosis', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Whole Blood', 'base', 'biobank', 'career', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'data integration', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'disease natural history', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder risk', 'driver mutation', 'exome', 'experience', 'functional genomics', 'genetic disorder diagnosis', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'informatics training', 'insight', 'knowledge base', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient stratification', 'personalized medicine', 'phenotypic data', 'prediction algorithm', 'prospective', 'rare cancer', 'rare variant', 'regression algorithm', 'statistics', 'success', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'variant of unknown significance', 'whole genome']",NHGRI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K08,2020,190941,0.019500625837389988
"Leveraging Common Fund data for feature selection in Kids First studies. Project Abstract This project will pilot a process for identifying multi-variant interactions contributing structural birth defect and childhood cancer disorders. This study will focus on analysis of oral-facial clefts, congenital diaphragmatic hernia, and congenital heart defects from whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data from family cohorts taken from Gabriella Miller Kids First Pediatric Research Project (KF).  Typically, tests to link disorders to genome-wide complex multivariate associations are computationally prohibitive. Thus, a first step to making such analyses more reasonable is to limit the number of variables (genes, variants) being tested together. We can reduce the number of possible tests by restricting what data should be tested. This study will seek to reduce the data for testing by utilizing biological knowledge from other two Common Fund datasets: the Knockout Mouse Phenotyping Program (KOMP2), and the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project. KOMP2 has generated extensive information on mouse knockout developmental phenotypes relevant for matching gene and phenotypes in KF WGS studies. GTEx can be merged with KF loci and relevant tissue-to-phenotype relationships. Thus, using features from other Common Fund data and annotations, we can generate selected subsets of KF variants and genes as feature-reduced KF data.  A comprehensive machine learning (ML) analysis pipeline will then be utilized for the identification of candidate risk factors and characterization of complex patterns of association between these feature-reduced KF data. In addition to performing the more traditional univariate association analyses of genotype vs. phenotype, this pipeline will also identify complex associations including (1) context-dependent genetic effects resulting from non-additive multi-variant interactions, i.e. epistasis, and (2) subgroup-specific associations, i.e. by phenotype and genotypic heterogeneity, where different etiological paths lead to the same/similar phenotypes in the selected KF subject group. This pipeline will include feature selection, modeling, and interpretation of multi-variant interactions.  The outcomes of this study will include (1) pipelines for integrating Common Fund data into Kids First datasets, (2) integrated KF-KOMP2-GTEx datasets including cross-species integration, (3) ML pipelines for multi-variant interaction analyses of phenotype vs genotype in selected, reduced-feature KF data, and (4) results from the aforementioned pipelines for multi-variant interactions for later hypothesis testing. Project Abstract This project will pilot a process for identifying interactions between genetic variants that contribute to structural birth defect and childhood cancer disorders by combining data from the Gabriella Miller Kids First Pediatric Research Project with biological knowledge from other two Common Fund datasets: the Knockout Mouse Phenotyping Program (KOMP2), and the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project.

"Integrating Neuroimaging, Multi-omics, and Clinical Data in Complex Disease ABSTRACT Rapid progress in biomedical informatics has generated massive high-dimensional data sets (“big data”), ranging from clinical information and medical imaging to genomic sequence data. The scale and complexity of these data sets hold great promise, yet present substantial challenges. To fully exploit the potential informativeness of big data, there is an urgent need to find effective ways to integrate diverse data from different levels of informatics technologies. Existing approaches and methods for data integration to date have several important limitations. In this project, we propose novel statistical methods and strategies to integrate neuroimaging, multi-omics, and clinical/behavioral data sets. To increase power for association analysis compared to existing methods, we propose a novel multi-phenotype multi-variant association method that can evaluate the cumulative effect of common and rare variants in genes or regions of interest, incorporate prior biological knowledge on the multiple phenotype structure, identify associated phenotypes among multiple phenotypes, and be computationally efficient for high-dimensional phenotypes. To improve the prediction of clinical outcomes, we propose a novel machine learning strategy that can integrate multimodal neuroimaging and multi-omics data into a mathematical model and can incorporate prior biological knowledge to identify genomic interactions associated with clinical outcomes. The ongoing Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and Indiana Memory and Aging Study (IMAS) projects as a test bed provide a unique opportunity to evaluate/validate the proposed methods. Specific Aims: Aim 1: to develop powerful statistical methods for multivariate tests of associations between multiple phenotypes and a single genetic variant or set of variants (common and rare) in regions of interest, and to develop methods for mediation analysis to integrate neuroimaging, genetic, and clinical data to test for direct and indirect genetic effects mediated through neuroimaging phenotypes on clinical outcomes; Aim 2: to develop a novel multivariate model that combines multi-omics and neuroimaging data using a machine learning strategy to predict individuals with disease or those at high-risk for developing disease, and to develop a novel multivariate model incorporating prior biological knowledge to identify genomic interactions associated with clinical outcomes; Aim 3: to evaluate and validate the proposed methods using real data from the ADNI and IMAS cohorts; and Aim 4: to disseminate and support publicly available user-friendly software that efficiently implements the proposed methods. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH: Alzheimer's disease (AD) as an exemplar is an increasingly common progressive neurodegenerative condition with no validated disease modifying treatment. The proposed multivariate methods are likely to help identify novel diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for AD. Identifying new susceptibility loci/biomarkers for AD has important implications for gaining greater insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying AD. NARRATIVE In this project, we propose novel statistical methods and strategies to integrate high-dimensional neuroimaging, multi-omics, and clinical/behavioral data sets, which aim to increase detection power for association analysis and improve the prediction of clinical outcomes. The development of an advanced integrative analysis platform will provide more comprehensive and integrated approaches to answering complex biological questions. The proposed multivariate analysis methods have a high potential impact on and important implications for gaining greater insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying complex diseases, as well as helping the development of earlier diagnostic tests and novel therapeutic targets.","Integrating Neuroimaging, Multi-omics, and Clinical Data in Complex Disease",9916801,R01LM012535,"['Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer’s disease biomarker', 'Beds', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Evaluation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Indiana', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Medical Imaging', 'Memory', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multiomic Data', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Outcome', 'Phenotype', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Science', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'cohort', 'data integration', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'disease classification', 'diverse data', 'endophenotype', 'epigenomics', 'genetic association', 'genetic variant', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'mathematical model', 'metabolomics', 'multidimensional data', 'multimodality', 'multiple omics', 'neuroimaging', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'predict clinical outcome', 'rare variant', 'risk variant', 'therapeutic target', 'transcriptomics', 'user friendly software']",NLM,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,R01,2020,341471,-0.03741748555384108
"Genomic and Phenomic Architecture of Heart Failure The overarching goal of this project is to improve care for patients with heart failure (HF). HF, whether with reduced (HFrEF) or preserved (HFpEF) ejection fraction, is associated with significant morbidity, mortality, and cost. In the U.S. alone, HF affects over 5 million adults, and the prevalence is projected to exceed 8 million by 2030. HF is the most frequent cause of hospitalization among Medicare recipients and results in over $30 billion in health care expenditures each year. Advances in management, especially for HFrEF, have modestly reduced death rates over time, but mortality continues to be high, with approximately half of patients dying within 5 years of diagnosis. Moreover, the pace of drug discovery has been slow, and there are no proven therapies for patients suffering with HFpEF. Among patients with established HF there is substantial variation in illness severity, degree of cardiac remodeling, disease progression, and response to therapy. These observations highlight the heterogeneity of the HF syndrome and suggest existence of subtypes with differing clinical and potentially genetic profiles, with subsequent differences in downstream disease mechanisms, overall risk, and therapeutic response. However, the understanding of the phenotypic, genetic, and pathophysiological heterogeneity of HF is incomplete. This project investigates the phenotypic substructure and genetic architecture of HF by leveraging a unique collection of interrelated datasets from Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC), including the de- identified electronic health record (EHR) and BioVU, a linked DNA biobank. The EHR contains ~2.6 million patients, including ~35,000 with HF, and BioVU currently houses >225,000 DNA samples. Dense genotype data are available in >28,000 subjects and an institutional genotyping project will increase this to >125,000 by mid- 2017; this includes >13,000 subjects with HF. The proposed research will: 1) identify HF subtypes from dense clinical data alone using advanced, unbiased, deep learning algorithms (Aim 1), 2) define the genetic architecture of HF and HF subtypes by using inferred gene expression, general linear mixed models, genetic risk scores, and traditional association testing to quantify heritability of and genetic correlations among HF subtypes, define the contribution of established risk factors to HF subtypes, and 3) discover subtype-specific genetic risk factors (Aim 2), and discover HF subtype-specific clinical outcomes, disease associations, and drug response phenotypes using advanced phenome scanning and network analysis (Aim 3). Heart failure (HF) is a complex, debilitating syndrome associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The heterogeneity of HF has limited success of prior efforts to understand HF pathobiology and develop effective interventions. By defining clinical and genetic modifiers of HF risk, disease course, and treatment response for clinically recognized and novel, data-driven HF subtypes, results from this work could result in a more sophisticated HF classification system based on underlying biology, and ultimately facilitate precision risk stratification, tailoring of therapeutic strategies, and rational HF clinical trials.",Genomic and Phenomic Architecture of Heart Failure,9841436,R01HL140074,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Architecture', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiomyopathies', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Death Rate', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'EFRAC', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Failure', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health Expenditures', 'Heart failure', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Link', 'Measures', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medical', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medicare', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial dysfunction', 'Natural History', 'Outcome', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Severity of illness', 'Subgroup', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'biobank', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'defined contribution', 'disease phenotype', 'drug discovery', 'effective intervention', 'genetic architecture', 'genetic association', 'genetic profiling', 'genetic risk factor', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'mortality', 'novel', 'phenome', 'phenomics', 'preservation', 'response', 'risk variant', 'success', 'treatment response']",NHLBI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2020,395000,0.022141210963339247
"The fitness effects of de novo structural variants PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This proposal for the NIH Pathway to Independence Award (K99/R00) focuses on the training of Dr. PingHsun Hsieh to become an independent investigator of large-scale genomics and human population genetics. Dr. Hsieh is a population geneticist by training, and the proposed studies will advance his training into long-read- based sequencing technologies and novel machine-learning approaches to study the fitness consequences of new mutations, with a focus on structural variants (SVs), in humans and nonhuman primates. Another essential piece will be the development of resources on which types of new SVs are most likely to be pathogenic and hence most worth further effort by medical researchers. The methods developed in this work will enable other researchers to do more hypothesis-free analysis of SVs in disease etiology. Specifically, the training program will center on the study of the distribution of fitness effects of new SVs in human and nonhuman primates using high-quality SV calls and genotypes from several large-scale long- and short-read sequencing projects. The mentored work will take place under the supervision of the primary mentor, Dr. Evan Eichler, and the co-mentor, Dr. Sharon Browning, both at the University of Washington (UW). The mentor and co-mentor are well-established experts in the characterization of genomic variations using high-throughput technologies and the development of stochastic modeling methods for large-scale genetic data, respectively. Dr. Hsieh will also gain advice from a formal advisory committee as well as through activities arranged by the Department of Genome Sciences (GS), which is an optimal place for the mentored training providing the candidate with access to outstanding scientists in areas including genetics of model organisms, disease, population genetics, and the development of high-throughput genomic technologies. While found in nature and yet generally deemed to be deleterious given their size, SVs can be beneficial, and thus, the distribution of fitness effects (DFE) of new SVs (i.e., the relative frequencies of beneficial, neutral, and deleterious SVs) remains elusive. In the proposed studies, we will infer the DFE of new SVs and other variants to assess their relative importance in nature, which in turn helps prioritize variants (e.g., SVs vs. single- nucleotide variants [SNVs]) in medical genetics. Specifically, in the K99/R00 phases we will (1) infer the DFE of new SVs and SNVs using a diverse panel of ~100 long-read and ~4,000 short-read high-coverage human and nonhuman primate genomes; (2) compare the DFE of new mutations among primates using contemporary and ancient DNA genomes; and (3) study the fitness effects and selective constraints on diseases in different mutation categories in large cohorts of >20,000 genomes. The skills learned in this proposal are on the cutting-edge and are tailored for the candidate to amass a great amount of knowledge in new areas of genomics, which will be applicable to many organisms and diseases and critical to the candidate’s future independent laboratory. NARRATIVE Understanding the relative abundance of beneficial, neutral, and deleterious mutations in different variant categories (e.g., genic vs. intergenic) provides useful guidance and resources for biomedical researchers to prioritize disease-causing mutations and strategize their efforts. To date, however, little effort has been made to study the full spectrum of fitness effects of new structural variants – an important but largely underappreciated genomic variation. The work proposed here seeks to leverage long-read sequencing technologies and develop novel machine-learning approaches to quantify the fitness effects of new mutation, with a focus on structural variants, and subsequently delineate the relative importance among different types of mutations in genetic diseases.",The fitness effects of de novo structural variants,9950314,K99HG011041,"['Advisory Committees', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Area', 'Award', 'Base Pairing', 'Benchmarking', 'Categories', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Copy Number Polymorphism', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Demography', 'Development', 'Diploidy', 'Disease', 'Etiology', 'Evolution', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Drift', 'Genetic Models', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Genetics', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Mutation', 'Natural Selections', 'Nature', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phase', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Population', 'Population Genetics', 'Primates', 'Public Health', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Development', 'Resources', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Uncertainty', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Washington', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'biological systems', 'biomedical resource', 'career', 'cohort', 'disease-causing mutation', 'expectation', 'fitness', 'genome sciences', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic locus', 'genomic variation', 'high throughput technology', 'human population genetics', 'improved', 'machine learning method', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'pressure', 'simulation', 'skills', 'technology development', 'trait']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,K99,2020,132244,-0.00610228536981963
"Statistical Modeling of Multiparental and Genetic Reference Populations PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Genetic crosses in model organisms play an essential role in understanding how heritable factors affect medically relevant traits. Such crosses have traditionally tended to be on a small scale with limited power to detect genetic effects, limited ability to localize causal variants, and limited options for replication. In the last decade, however, the emergence of larger-scale interdisciplinary research, cheaper genotyping and parallel advances in human genetics, has spurred the development of more sophisticated and powerful experimental designs. Foremost are those that incorporate two modern genetic design concepts: the multiparental population (MPP), whereby each subject is descended from a small, well-characterized set of genetically diverse inbred strains, with the goal of efficiently exploring a wide genetic landscape; and the genetic reference population (GRP), whereby subjects are drawn from a large and genetically diverse set of inbred strains, with the goal that the study population, and thereby the studies themselves, can be infinitely replicated. Their combination, the multiparental genetic reference population (MP-GRP), represents the state-of-the-art in complex trait genetics and has been implemented in a number of model organisms, including plants, flies, and rodents.  The proposed program of research focuses on the development of statistical and computational tools to advance the design and analysis of studies using MPPs, GRPs and MP-GRPs. It centers around addressing three interconnected questions.  1) How to take advantage of biological replicates in a genetically varying population? Directions considered include: more stable methods to detect genetically-induced phenotypic outliers; use of genetically-induced heteroskedasticity to improve statistical power and find variance-controlling genes; and more rigorous and expansive characterization of gene-by-treatment effects by using principles from causal inference.  2) How to navigate the complex design space of MP-GRPs and their derived crosses? Directions considered include: use of decision theory applied to Bayesian analysis of pilot data; incorporation of variance heterogeneity to control likely reproducibility.  3) How to approach quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis in MPPs and MP-GRPs? Directions considered include: making haplotype-based association more robust to uncertainty in haplotype state; combining haplotype- based with variant-based mapping; adaptive modeling of QTL complexity; machine learning of the allelic series; familywise error rate control through descent-based permutation.  Progress on these fronts will not only fill significant gaps in studies using MPPs, GRPs and MP-GRPs, but will also provide tools and insights that will allow these designs to be used in new and more powerful ways. PROJECT NARRATIVE (RELEVANCE) The proposed research will lead to improvements in the analysis and design of genetic studies on experimental models of human disease. Because the project focuses on statistical methodology applied to experimental model organism populations (including mouse, rats and Drosophila) the scientific output of the project is expected to be applicable to basic research focusing on any medical condition that can be studied in model organisms.",Statistical Modeling of Multiparental and Genetic Reference Populations,9893003,R35GM127000,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Alleles', 'Animal Model', 'Basic Science', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Biological', 'Complex', 'Complex Genetic Trait', 'Data', 'Decision Theory', 'Development', 'Drosophila genus', 'Experimental Designs', 'Experimental Models', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Crosses', 'Genetic study', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Haplotypes', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human Genetics', 'Inbred Strain', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Mus', 'Output', 'Phenotype', 'Plants', 'Play', 'Population', 'Population Genetics', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Rattus', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Series', 'Statistical Models', 'Uncertainty', 'Variant', 'base', 'causal variant', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'fly', 'human disease', 'human model', 'improved', 'insight', 'programs', 'study population', 'tool', 'trait', 'treatment effect']",NIGMS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R35,2020,336445,0.02520464712001771
"Statistical methods for early disease prediction and treatment strategy estimation using biomarker signatures Neuropsychiatric disorders pose an immense burden on patients, families, and health care systems, thus underscoring the urgent need to develop disease-modifying treatment. Research on neuropsychiatric disorders (e.g., Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease) faces unique challenges, including the fact that these disorders typically have a late onset and slow progression, the diagnostic criteria are based on subjective clinical symptoms, and there is substantial disease and subject heterogeneity. In the proposed work, we aim to tackle these challenges by leveraging complementary contributions from multiple biomarkers, including genome-wide polymorphisms, whole brain neuroimaging, biofluids, and comprehensive neuropsychiatric assessments. We develop sophisticated analytic tools with higher resolution and improved accuracy by accounting for biological mechanisms of disease, synthesizing dynamic system-wide information, and integrating multiple sources of biomarkers. These methods are applied to clinical data collected by the investigative team or available from large international consortia in order to model the earliest pathological changes of neurodegenerative disease, assess treatment responses, and inform the design of early-intervention clinical trials and the discovery of optimal personalized therapies. Specifically, in Aim 1, we develop efficient methods for multi-level semiparametric transformation models to estimate and test the risk of genetic variants on various types of complex phenotypes to inform genetic counseling and improve clinical trial efficiency. Our methods do not rely on full pedigree genotyping and provide family-specific substructure, in addition to population substructure, to better control confounding and reduce false discovery rates in genome-wide association studies. In Aim 2, we develop large-scale nonlinear dynamic systems through ordinary differential equations with random inflections to understand early pathological changes and identify subjects with preclinical signs. Our method provides multi-domain integration of ensembles of biomarker dynamics. In Aim 3, we develop dynamic hazards models and incorporate dynamic network structures to estimate biomarker profiles that evolve smoothly with disease progression for earlier disease diagnosis. We account for irregularly measured biomarkers and biological network dependence among biomarkers. In Aim 4, we develop doubly robust and efficient machine learning methods to identify predictive markers, estimate optimal individualized therapies, and identify subgroups who may receive the greatest benefit from therapy, with minimal risk. In each aim, we will validate the proposed methods through extensive simulation studies and demonstrate their practical value via application to real-world clinical studies. We establish theoretical properties of the proposed methods using modern empirical process theory and statistical learning theory. Together, the state-of-the-art analytic methods proposed here will substantially improve analytic accuracy, and our combined statistical and clinical expertise will ensure that our methods are translated directly back to the clinical and translational research community. Project Narrative:  The ultimate goal of neuropsychiatric research is to develop experimental therapeutics to delay disease on- set, slow disease progression, and provide effective treatment at each stage of disease. This proposal aims to develop new statistical approaches to integrate complementary sources of information from genomic measures, brain imaging biomarkers, and early clinical signs to characterize disease mechanism, progression, and treatment responses, and thereby inform the design of clinical trials and the discovery of optimal personalized therapies.",Statistical methods for early disease prediction and treatment strategy estimation using biomarker signatures,9927686,R01NS073671,"['Accounting', 'Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Back', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Differential Equation', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Ensure', 'Equilibrium', 'Event', 'Face', 'Family', 'Family health status', 'Family member', 'First Degree Relative', 'Funding', 'Genetic Counseling', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Hazard Models', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heterogeneity', 'Impact evaluation', 'Individual', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Investigational Therapies', 'Late-Onset Disorder', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Non-linear Models', 'Nonlinear Dynamics', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Radiation exposure', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Safety', 'Source', 'Spinal Puncture', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'dynamic system', 'effective therapy', 'genetic pedigree', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'machine learning method', 'minimal risk', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'randomized trial', 'semiparametric', 'simulation', 'statistical learning', 'theories', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'validation studies']",NINDS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2020,340025,-0.004080722632460401
"Investigating bacterial contributions to TB treatment response: a focus on in-host pathogen dynamics Project Summary/Abstract Rapid and accurate methods to monitor tuberculosis (TB) treatment response do not currently exist. Efforts to improve outcomes have focused on early identification of rifampicin susceptibility followed by prompt treatment initiation and adherence monitoring. The rapid molecular susceptibility tests most often used give dichotomous cutoffs. Recent studies though show that minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) just below these breakpoints also predict poor outcomes. Even if a patient takes most of their therapy, clinical response can still vary substantially. Delays in sputum clearance (culture conversion from growth to no growth) can range from a few days to 5 months and failure or relapse rates can be as high as 20% in drug-susceptible TB. During the weeks to months of human infection and antibiotic treatment, in host Mtb populations experience substantial measurable genetic changes. These changes may be neutral or allow pathogen adaption to immune, antibiotic or metabolic pressure, e.g. low iron or cobalamin levels that may result in heritable drug tolerance and resistance phenotypes. Here we propose to study in host longitudinal pathogen dynamics including changes in population diversity over time and identify genes under selection to shed light on host-pathogen interactions. The study of in host pathogen dynamics can improve our understanding of cure from infection and pave the way for the use of whole genome sequencing for monitoring treatment response, circumventing the delays and biohazards of traditional culture-based approaches. We additionally propose the development of a genome- based predictor of MIC and to assess if MIC predictions are associated with delays in culture conversion and poor clinical response. We will systematically study pathogen samples from a well characterized TB treatment patient cohort (NIAID TRUST TB cohort in Worcester, South Africa -PI Dr. Jacobson) combining long and deep short-read sequencing to resolve full genome assemblies and variants at low allele frequency. We have strong preliminary data that long-read sequencing unmasks more Mtb genetic diversity than detectable by short-read sequencing alone and have previously characterized directional selection in a subset of genes including resistance loci, the B12 biosynthesis pathway, and PPE genes known to interact with host innate defense. The proposed work is enabled by our methodological expertise in population genetics, machine learning and resistance prediction for clonal bacteria like Mtb and will allow, for the first time, the study of directional and diversifying selection on the full repertoire of Mtb genetic variation. It will also allow the training of an MIC prediction model on a large ~17,000 isolate dataset curated across studies and geographies. Both study aims promise to inform our understanding of how pathogen genetic variation affects Mtb survival in host and the response to treatment. Project Narrative Patients with tuberculosis (TB) can benefit greatly if we could identify signs of poor response earlier and adjust therapy intensity accordingly. Innovations in DNA isolation and sequencing technologies now enable the study of TB pathogen populations in an individual patient with very high resolution. Here, we propose to use these technologies and a highly well-characterized cohort of South African TB patients to investigate how pathogen population genetic changes link to pathogen survival and treatment response, laying the foundation for improvements in clinical treatment monitoring using DNA sequencing.",Investigating bacterial contributions to TB treatment response: a focus on in-host pathogen dynamics,10100014,R01AI155765,"['Adherence', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Aftercare', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Anabolism', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Attenuated', 'Bacteria', 'Biohazardous Substance', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Response Modifiers', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Cobalamin', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complex', 'DNA', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Drug Tolerance', 'Drug resistance', 'ELF3 gene', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Failure', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Recombination', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomic approach', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Geography', 'Growth', 'HIV', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunocompetence', 'Immunotherapeutic agent', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Integration Host Factors', 'Intervention', 'Iron', 'Isoniazid resistance', 'Knowledge', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurable', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Minimum Inhibitory Concentration measurement', 'Minor', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Mutation', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Population Genetics', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Predisposition', 'Race', 'Recurrent disease', 'Regulator Genes', 'Relapse', 'Resistance', 'Resistance development', 'Resolution', 'Rifampin', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Source', 'South Africa', 'South African', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specimen', 'Speed', 'Sputum', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Time Study', 'Training', 'Treatment Failure', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tuberculosis', 'Variant', 'Virulent', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'experience', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genomic variation', 'high risk', 'immunological status', 'immunoregulation', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'in silico', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'medication compliance', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'pathogen genomics', 'predictive modeling', 'pressure', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'real time monitoring', 'recruit', 'resistance gene', 'resistant strain', 'response', 'statistical and machine learning', 'treatment response', 'tuberculosis treatment', 'whole genome']",NIAID,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,R01,2020,781859,0.012963652784972898
"Novel statistical methods and tools to integrate multiple endophenotypes and functional annotation data to study the roles of rare variants in complex human diseases using sequencing data Project Summary In the past fifteen years, great efforts have been made to understand the genetic architecture of complex human diseases through genome-wide association studies. Although many genome-wide significant variants have been identified, the heritability or variance explained by these variants remains very small, suggesting substantial missing heritability that may yet be explained by common genetic variants with smaller effect sizes and/or rare and low frequency variants, which calls for the development and application of novel statistical methods to whole genome/exome sequencing data collected from deeply phenotyped cohorts. In this project, we will develop methods that leverage multiple correlated endophenotypes and further integrate functional annotation data to identify novel rare variants for complex traits. We will develop a set of new computational and analytical tools that are practically useful and broadly applicable to general sequencing studies, and the applications of our methods will likely identity novel rare variant associations and shed new lights on the genetics of cardiometabolic diseases. In Aim 1, we propose to develop novel statistical methods to integrate multiple endophenotypes to study the impact of rare variants on complex human diseases. Our methods will fill in the gap between the current practice of association studies and the practical needs of integrating endophenotypes for improved understanding and diagnosis of clinical outcomes. In Aim 2, we will extend the methods to meta-analyses across studies. In Aim 3, we will develop a novel kernel machine learning approach to integrating various functional information to annotate the whole genome region, and further integrate them to develop a dynamic whole-genome scan test to detect rare variant associations with multiple endophenotypes. We will leverage the NHLBI TOPMed whole genome sequencing (WGS) data and the UK Biobank whole exome sequencing (WES) data, and integrate the functional annotation data to identify and dissect the role of rare variants on the cardiometabolic traits (Aim 4). Our proposed work is cost-effective as it leverages the existing WGS/WES samples and functional annotation data while providing methods and tools that are broadly applicable to other studies, and builds on a strong team of scientists with proven track record in statistical genetics, large-scale genetic studies, and cardiometabolic traits. We expect our methods will lead to the discoveries of many more rare and low frequency variants for these traits. These results will offer new insights to help design more effective treatment and prevention strategies. All our proposed methods will be disseminated to the public through well-tested and publicly available software (Aim 5). Project Narrative We will develop statistical methods and computational software to analyze whole genome/exome sequencing data by integrating multiple phenotypes and functional annotations to identify novel genes associated with cardiometabolic diseases and allow researchers to better disentangle the impacts of rare variants on these complex human diseases.

"Direct measurement of gene-environment interactions by high-throughput precision genome editing Abstract  Modern genetics has identified many genetic variants that affect traits such as height, but most phenotypic variation still cannot be explained by these variants alone. Importantly, differences in environment often result in individual variation of traits—including disease risk and drug response—for different genotypes. These relationships are known as genotype by environment (GxE) interactions. For example, the sickle cell allele of hemoglobin S causes sickle cell anemia, but also provides a fitness advantage in the presence of malaria by conferring resistance to infection. However, there are few examples where the exact causal variants are known. Therefore, we need to develop new methodology for identifying more of these GxE interactions, to improve prediction of disease risk and treatment outcomes.  In this study, I will fill in the gap of knowledge in GxE interactions by establishing an experimental framework for identifying hundreds of causal GxE variants in parallel, providing the first comprehensive view of GxE causal variant landscape. Specifically, I will study how thousands of genetic variants between a laboratory yeast strain (BY) and a vineyard strain (RM) lead to their differences in growth upon stress and drug treatments, as one form of GxE interaction. In Aim 1, I will use a novel gene-editing technology that can detect the fitness effects of thousands of variants in one experiment, as shown in a pilot experiment. Using this method, I will be able to map hundreds of casual variants that contribute to growth differences under various conditions, such as carbon source, oxidative stress and drug treatment. In Aim 2, I will measure allele-specific mRNA expression (ASE) from BYxRM F1 hybrids in above-mentioned conditions and associate the mapped causal GxE variants, to identify GxE variants that influence growth rate through gene expression. Then, I will apply a machine learning model to predict causal GxE genes using the molecular features found in this study. By mapping causal GxE variants, linking them to gene expression and predicting causal genes through gene expression, I will establish a complete framework for accelerating the discovery of GxE interactions. Public Health Relevance The recent explosion of precision medicine based on genotype and mutations has enabled personalized treatment of diseases. However, how environmental factors influence the outcome of such treatments is not clear. By establishing a framework to study general principles and underlying molecular mechanisms of these gene-by-environment interactions, we will be able to integrate such knowledge in disease risk prediction and personalized treatment.",Direct measurement of gene-environment interactions by high-throughput precision genome editing,9905312,F31ES030282,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Alleles', 'Biological Models', 'Carbon', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Explosion', 'Exposure to', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Height', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Human Cell Line', 'Hybrid Cells', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lactase', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malaria', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Meiotic Recombination', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Nucleotides', 'Outcome', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Polygenic Traits', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Research', 'Resistance to infection', 'Resolution', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Scientist', 'Sickle Cell', 'Sickle Cell Anemia', 'Sickle Hemoglobin', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Source', 'Stress', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Yeasts', 'career', 'causal variant', 'disorder risk', 'experimental study', 'fitness', 'gene environment interaction', 'genetic variant', 'genome editing', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'individual variation', 'mRNA Expression', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'personalized medicine', 'precise genome editing', 'precision medicine', 'promoter', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'segregation', 'skills', 'trait', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NIEHS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,F31,2020,29520,-0.007315842020280445
"Optimizing Genetic Testing for Deafness for Clinical Diagnostics Project Summary  Hearing loss is the most common sensory deficit in humans. It is diagnosed in 1 in 500 newborns and affects half of all octogenarians. Although causality is multifactorial, in developed countries a large fraction of hearing loss is genetic and non-syndromic, i.e. not associated with other phenotypes.  During the prior granting period, we implemented and integrated comprehensive genetic testing as a cornerstone in the evaluation of the deaf and hard-of-hearing person. The American College of Medical Genetics has recognized the merit of this approach, and in 2014 included comprehensive genetic testing for the evaluation of deafness in their newest treatment guidelines. In the largest study to date to corroborate this decision, we found an underlying genetic cause for hearing loss in 440 (39%) of 1119 sequentially accrued patients chosen without exclusion criteria. Pathogenic variants were present in 49 genes and included missense variants (49%), copy number changes (18%), indels (18%), nonsense variants (8%), splice-site alterations (6%) and promoter variants (<1%), making comprehensive genetic testing the single best test to order in the diagnosis of hearing loss after an audiogram.  In this competitive renewal, we will build on these accomplishments by completing the following aims: • Specific Aim 1: To optimize phenotype-genotype integration in the analysis of hereditary hearing loss  by refining the use of hierarchical surface clustering and audioprofile surface analysis to determine  which types of genetic hearing loss are associated with clinically meaningful sub-clusters • Specific Aim 2: To validate and integrate physics-based protein modeling as a tool within the Deafness  Variation Database to predict variant effect and the molecular and patient phenotype • Specific Aim 3: To identify genetic modifiers of specific deafness-causing genes predicted by  hierarchical surface clustering and validated by physics-based potential free-energy modeling  The successful completion of this grant will improve the clinical care of persons with hearing loss by enhancing phenome-genome integration and by making variant interpretation more robust. Knowledge gained from this proposal will also lay the foundation for refined studies focused on the identification of genetic modifiers – both positive and negative – associated with complex phenotypes such as noise- induced and age-related hearing loss.

"Comprehensive Characterization of Missense Mutants in Factor IX SUMMARY Deficiencies in coagulation factor IX (FIX) cause the bleeding disorder hemophilia B, while high levels of FIX pose a risk for thrombosis. Thus, genetic variation in the F9 gene encoding FIX can impact bleeding by decreasing FIX expression or activity, or can impact thrombosis by increasing FIX expression or activity. However, when a new DNA variant is discovered in the F9 gene, we typically lack the evidence needed to confidently determine if the variant alters the function of the encoded FIX protein and, if so, how severely. For example, in the national hemophilia genotyping project MyLifeOurFuture, the majority of F9 missense variants (i.e. DNA changes predicted to change a FIX amino acid) discovered in patients with hemophilia B had insufficient evidence to be classified as pathogenic. Functional studies, where a FIX variant’s stability, activity or other properties are evaluated in vitro, can provide strong evidence to inform interpretation of F9 variants. However, traditional functional studies are time- and resource-intensive, so testing the hundreds of F9 variant we have observed so far would be impractical. Evaluating the thousands of possible FIX missense variants we could observe as more individuals are sequenced would be impossible. Instead, we propose a new approach to express and characterize nearly every possible missense variant in the FIX protein to advance our understanding of FIX biology, improve the interpretation of genetic variation in the F9 gene, and advance hemophilia care and treatments. To accomplish this goal, we will employ deep mutational scanning, a method we developed for measuring the effects of massive numbers of missense variants of a protein simultaneously. Here, we will display a library of nearly all possible FIX missense variants tethered to the surface of cultured human cells. We propose to exploit this FIX surface display library in two aims: 1) Quantifying the effect of nearly every possible F9 missense variant on FIX expression and secretion, and 2) Quantifying the effect of nearly every possible F9 missense variant on specific FIX functions including Gla-domain gamma-carboxylation and activation of FIX by factor XIa (FXIa). These aims will reveal how nearly all possible missense variants in FIX impact expression, secretion, gamma- carboxylation, and activation by FXIa. In aim 3, we will use these large-scale functional data to dissect the mechanism by which F9 pathogenic variants disrupt FIX function. We will also use machine learning, leveraging the functional data along with other features to predict pathogenicity for each missense variant in FIX. Taken together, the functional data we generate, the analyses we propose, and tools we build will transform the characterization of F9 variants. They will also serve as a resource to better understand FIX biology, improve the clinical translation of F9 genetic information, and inform new treatments. NARRATIVE DNA changes that affect the F9 gene that makes coagulation factor IX (FIX) can reduce FIX levels and cause the bleeding disorder hemophilia B, or increase the amount of active FIX and increase the risk of thrombosis. Although hundreds of variants have been detected in the F9 gene, there is often insufficient information to know how any one specific change will affect the protein, if that change will cause disease, or how severe disease will likely be. We will use new technologies to study the consequences of every possible amino acide change in FIX, with the goal of developing the information needed to understand the significance of new genetic changes as they are discovered in the future and to improve the care and treatment of patients.",Comprehensive Characterization of Missense Mutants in Factor IX,9946710,R01HL152066,"['Affect', 'Amino Acids', 'Antibodies', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Blood Coagulation Disorders', 'Caring', 'Cell surface', 'Cells', 'Clinic', 'Coagulation Process', 'Comprehension', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'F9 gene', 'Factor Analysis', 'Factor IX', 'Factor XIa', 'Fluorescence', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Future', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genetic study', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Hemophilia A', 'Hemophilia B', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hemostatic function', 'High-Throughput DNA Sequencing', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Peptides', 'Production', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thrombosis', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'carboxylation', 'clinical translation', 'experimental study', 'gain of function', 'genetic information', 'genetic variant', 'improved', 'mutant', 'mutation screening', 'new technology', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'predictive modeling', 'tool']",NHLBI,BLOODWORKS,R01,2020,418577,-0.007178359500524314
"Epilepsy Multiplatform Variant Prediction (EpiMVP) The advent of next generation DNA sequencing has revolutionized gene discovery in human diseases, including epilepsy. Hundreds of genes have been implicated in epilepsy in the last decade, revealing the diversity of biological mechanisms that can go awry in this disorder. However, the rate at which we are identifying new genes involved in epilepsy is now outpacing our ability to study disease mechanisms. Moreover, clinical gene panel or exome sequencing has become standard practice for patients with early-onset, familial, and refractory epilepsies. This rapid assimilation of genetic testing into clinical care has led to a surge in the number of genetic variants of uncertain significance (VUS), particularly the occurrence of missense VUS. These VUS are assigned to an indeterminate spectrum between pathogenic and benign, which complicate interpretation for genetic counselors, clinicians, patients and families, as well as assessment of the need for further testing. Here we propose a Center without Walls, entitled Epilepsy Multiplatform Variant Prediction (EpiMVP), spanning 5 institutions and incorporating expertise from geneticists, clinicians, computational biologists, neuroscientists, stem cell biologists, pharmacologists and electrophysiologists who have a proven track record of collaborative publications and grants, as well as stature as leaders of national and international epilepsy organizations. EpiMVP will develop a modular, highly integrated platform approach to accelerate determination of the functional, pharmacological, neuronal network and whole animal consequences of genetic variants implicated in a range of clinical epilepsy types. We will study non-ion-channel, non-receptor genes commonly implicated in epilepsy, and that are involved in diverse biological processes. Our ultimate goals are to devise an effective experimental platform for testing the pathogenicity of VUS in genes implicated in epilepsy and to generate a computational model (EpiPred) that predicts the likelihood that a variant is pathogenic or benign. This work is crucial in the pursuit of novel therapeutics and the promise of personalized medicine. The overall milestones of the Center are: 1. Evaluate genes associated with epilepsy and select candidates for analysis, model data for, and analyze all project data for development of EpiPred an iterative machine learning model to classify variants in genes implicated in epilepsy. 2. Test selected VUS using medium throughput, in vitro approaches. 3. Test selected VUS in human cortical neurons or human brain organoids using induced pluripotent stem cell approaches. 4. Test selected VUS in pre-clinical, in vivo models. The expected outcomes are: 1. Provide a freely available prediction tool for clinicians to differentiate between pathogenic and benign variants for genes implicated in epilepsy; 2. Provide experimental models to study the functional consequences of specific variants; 3. Provide a reclassification of VUS in ClinVar/ClinGen and to develop new guidelines for incorporating functional readouts into the ACMG criteria; 4. Inform the future development of novel therapeutics to treat epilepsy.

"Genetic Predisposition To Thoracic Aortic Aneurysms/Dissections Thoracic aortic aneurysms leading to acute aortic dissections (TAAD) are a cause of premature deaths, responsible for up to 8% of sudden deaths in industrialized countries. Identifying individuals at risk for TAAD allows for medical management that prevents deaths due to dissections. We determined that up to 20% of TAAD patients without a known genetic syndrome have a family history of TAAD, which is inherited primarily in an autosomal dominant manner (termed heritable thoracic aortic disease, HTAD). We established a cohort of HTAD families (842 families with two or more members with TAAD) and used this cohort to identify novel HTAD genes. Positional cloning and candidate gene approaches by our lab and others have successfully identified 18 genes for HTAD. We hypothesize that there are multiple altered genes yet to be identified, disrupting known and novel molecular pathways responsible for thoracic aortic disease, and responsible for disease in the unsolved HTAD families. The overarching goal of the project is to identify the remaining genes for HTAD, characterize the phenotype associated with these novel genes, perform initial molecular studies linking the mutant gene to aortic disease, and rapidly translate these findings into improved clinical care and prevention of premature deaths due to aortic dissection in HTAD families. The proposed aims are: (1) Recruit and characterize additional HTAD families to be used to identify novel genes, and delineate the clinical features and mutation spectrum associated with new genes; (2) Pursue exome/genome sequencing on HTAD cases and use the genetic strategies to identify novel genes, including segregation of rare variants in affected relatives and trios (affected proband and unaffected parents) and burden analyses; (3) Pursue a machine-learning approach using exome data from HTAD families and controls to identify novel disease genes; (4) Perform initial molecular and cellular biology studies of novel HTAD genes to confirm a link between the mutant gene and thoracic aortic disease. In summary, we are uniquely poised to identify novel HTAD genes using our assembled cohort and are proposing both proven and novel strategies to identify additional HTAD genes. Uncovering HTAD genes is crucial for identifying individuals at risk for aortic dissections and initiating gene-specific clinical management to prevent premature death due to dissections. PROJECT NARRATIVE Acute aortic dissections are a common cause of premature death in the United States. The goal of the proposed research is to prevent premature deaths due to dissections by identifying individuals who are predisposed by uncovering all the genetic variants in the human genome that trigger dissection.",Genetic Predisposition To Thoracic Aortic Aneurysms/Dissections,10053081,R01HL109942,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Age of Onset', 'Aorta', 'Aortic Diseases', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cell Survival', 'Cellular Metabolic Process', 'Cessation of life', 'Chest', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Management', 'Congenital Heart Defects', 'Data', 'Developed Countries', 'Disease', 'Disease Pathway', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Dissection', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'FBN1', 'FOXE3 gene', 'Family', 'Family history of', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Heritability', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Intracranial Aneurysm', 'LOX gene', 'LTBP2 gene', 'Link', 'MADH4 gene', 'MYH11 gene', 'MYLK gene', 'Machine Learning', 'Marfan Syndrome', 'Medical', 'Molecular', 'Molecular and Cellular Biology', 'Muscle Contraction', 'Mutation', 'Parents', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Penetrance', 'Phenotype', 'Prevention', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smooth Muscle Myocytes', 'Sudden Death', 'Surgical Management', 'Syndrome', 'TGFB2 gene', 'TGFBR1 gene', 'TGFBR2 gene', 'Thoracic Aortic Aneurysm', 'Toxic Environmental Substances', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta', 'Translating', 'United States', 'Vascular Diseases', 'base', 'bicuspid aortic valve', 'clinical care', 'cohort', 'early onset', 'exome', 'exome sequencing', 'family management', 'gene discovery', 'genetic approach', 'genetic pedigree', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'improved', 'insight', 'member', 'mutant', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'positional cloning', 'premature', 'prevent', 'proband', 'rare variant', 'recruit', 'segregation']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R01,2020,653552,-0.00977529804040065
"Center for Multi- and Trans-ethnic Mapping of Mendelian and Complex Diseases ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The NHGRI Genome Sequencing Program (GSP) will identify genomic variants relevant to health and disease by genome sequencing over 225,000 participants across a multitude of diseases. The GSP will also serve as a pilot for the Precision Medicine Initiative that aims to enroll and sequence more than a million people representative of U.S. ethnic diversity. Here, we propose a GSP analysis center focused on Multi- and Trans- ethnic Mapping of Mendelian and Complex Diseases. There is a growing recognition of the substantial scientific advantages, as well as public health importance, of conducting biomedical research across ethnically diverse cohorts. We propose to develop scalable methods that incorporate ancestry to optimize medical genomic study design and improve power for uncovering the role of common and rare variants in disease. Achieving this goal requires expertise across diverse domains of knowledge including: medical and population genomics, algorithm development for complex disease mapping, and expertise in management of large-scale databases. Here, we have assembled a world-class team of medical and population geneticists, computer scientists, statisticians and clinicians, with leading expertise in the development of novel and scalable strategies for characterizing sequence variants and their role in disease. Importantly, our group has been at the forefront of development of resources, study designs and methods to enable genomic research in U.S. minority populations. Our project has three main objectives. First, we will develop an Automated Scalable Ancestry Pipeline (ASAP) for common disease mapping in diverse populations. ASAP will improve the computational efficiency of existing state-of-the-art methods for ancestry inference and develop important extensions to linear mixed models (LMMs) and other mapping strategies leveraging local and global ancestry. We will also develop methods to refine phenotypes and identify common controls for disease studies and define endpoints. Secondly, we will develop tools and resources for trans- and multi-population rare variant discovery that incorporate patterns of local and sub-continental ancestry. We will also develop machine-learning tools for variant annotation that leverage ancestral information, patterns of sequence evolution, and protein structure in a unified framework. Furthermore, we will incorporate population-specific patterns of cellular phenotypes to improve functional prediction algorithms for non-coding and coding variants. Lastly, we will disseminate our results through web-based resource that empower the biomedical research community. We will augment existing resources including ClinGen by annotating and characterizing pathogenic variants across diverse populations. We will develop a secure web-server that allows sharing of summary statistics and analysis pipelines to enable discovery, fine-mapping and functional prediction of genetic variants. Our team has ample experience with NIH-funded consortia and is dedicated to meeting the overall GSP project goals through collaborative work with NHGRI leadership and other funded investigators. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE The goal of our project is to accelerate the discovery of DNA variation relevant to health and disease by analyzing data from over 225,000 ethnically and racially diverse patients that will undergo genome sequencing. Of particular importance is ensuring we have powerful statistical methods for analyzing data from underserved groups including U.S. minority populations.

"Discovering Novel Structural Genomic Rearrangements Using Deep Neural Networks Abstract Accurately detecting structural variation in the genome is a challenging task. Many approaches have been developed over the last few decades, yet it is estimated that tens of thousands of variants are still being missed in a given sample. Many of these variants are missed due to the limitations of using short-read sequencing to identify large variants. Although many of these missed variants are located within complex regions of the genome, it has been shown that some still have clinical relevance making their discovery important. New platforms have been developed for sequencing the genome using long-reads and show promise for overcoming many of these limitations creating the ability to identify the full spectrum of simple and complex structural variants. Because this technology is relatively young, new computational approaches to support the analysis of long-read sequencing data can aid in the discovery of these variants which are still being missed. In addition to detecting novel variation in samples with long-read sequencing data, computational approaches can be developed to leverage these novel variant calls to reanalyze the hundreds of thousands of short-read datasets currently available. In this proposal, we plan to develop new computational approaches to identify novel structural variation in the genome. In Aim 1, we will apply a recurrence approach to analyze long read sequencing datasets utilizing deep neural networks. In Aim 2, we will develop a tool to derive profiles of structural variants predicted in long- reads which can be used to identify and genotype structural variants calls in short read data-sets. Together, these approaches will allow researchers to accurately characterize structural variation in both long and short- read datasets. Narrative Structural variation has been implicated in numerous human diseases but there are still tens of thousands of variants being overlooked in the genome. The proposed research aims to detect novel variation by developing new computational tools to analyze data generated by state-of-the-art sequencing methods. These tools will aid in the discovery of variants associated with human health.",Discovering Novel Structural Genomic Rearrangements Using Deep Neural Networks,9911983,F31HG010569,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Sciences', 'Categories', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA', 'DNA Resequencing', 'DNA Sequence Rearrangement', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Future', 'Genome', 'Genotype', 'Haplotypes', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Label', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Computations', 'Pattern', 'Process', 'Recurrence', 'Repetitive Sequence', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'comparative', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'genome sequencing', 'human disease', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'new technology', 'novel', 'reference genome', 'structural genomics', 'tool', 'variant detection']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,F31,2020,37657,-0.016625118733071615
"ADPKD: Disease Spectrum & Genotype-Phenotype Correlations Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is a common monoallelic disorder associated with progressive cyst development and resulting in end stage renal failure (ESRD) in 50% of patients by 60y. However, there is considerable phenotypic variability, extending from in utero onset to patients with adequate renal function into old age. Autosomal dominant polycystic liver disease (ADPLD), as traditionally defined, results in PLD with minimal renal cysts. Classically there have been considered two ADPKD genes, PKD1 and PKD2, encoding PC1 and PC2, and two ADPLD genes, PRKCSH and SEC63, but in the past few years greater genetic heterogeneity has been described, with nine genes now implicated overall. Recent data also indicates an overlap in etiology and pathogenesis associated with ADPKD and ADPLD, with the efficient biogenesis and localization of the PC-complex central to both disorders. During the last funding period we identified a novel gene, GANAB, which is associated with both disorders, where the encoded protein, GII is involved in the maturation and trafficking of PC1.  In this proposal we will take advantage of advances in next generation sequencing (NGS) methodologies, and large populations of ADPKD and ADPLD patients that have been assembled and screened for the classic genes, to hunt for novel genes for these disorders (Aim 1). The phenotype associated with these genes will be characterized (Aim 3) along with their mechanism of action (Aim 2). NGS methods will be perfected to screen the segmentally duplicated locus, PKD1, and to identify missed mutations at the known loci, including those present in just some cells due to mosaicism (Aim 1). The significance of many PKD1 nontruncating variants has been difficult to evaluate (classed as variants of unknown significance; VUS), but recently evidence that some are incompletely penetrant alleles partially explains phenotypic variability in PKD1 populations. In Aim 2 improved in silico predictions, in combination with machine learning, will improve the understanding of the pathogenicity and penetrance of VUS. A cellular assay of the biogenesis and trafficking of this PC-complex will also be employed to quantify the penetrance of VUS. The mechanism of pathogenesis will be explored in animal models with ultralow penetrant (ULP) Pkd1 or Pkd2 alleles. Employing the large clinically, imaging, and genetically well-defined populations phenotypic groupings of patients will be defined that will then be compared to the genic and PKD1 allelic groups (Aim 3). This iterative process will allow the Variant Score (VS) associated with each PKD1 VUS to be refined. In a separate population the revised VS, alone and in combination with clinical, functional, and imaging data, will be employed to generate a comprehensive, predictive algorithm for ADPKD (Aim 3). Disease modifiers to severe disease, via biallelic ADPKD, and due to alleles at other loci will also be identified and characterized in the cellular assay and in vivo in combination with the Pkd1 hypomorphic, RC model. The final aim will exploit the newly identified information that some PKD1 and PKD2 VUS are rescuable, folding mutations that in a maturation-fostering environment can traffic and function appropriately. A screening scheme based on the level of cell surface PC1 will be improved and new chaperone drugs specific for the PC complex will be sought in collaboration with Sanford Burnham Prebys. A second mutation group that will be explored therapeutically are nonsense mutations. A cellular assay for readthrough efficiency is being developed and will be used for screening. Identified chaperone or readthrough drugs will be tested in available mouse models. Overall this proposal will better explain the etiology and the genetic causes of phenotypic variability in ADPKD/ADPLD, develop better prognostic tools for individual selection of patients for treatment that are now becoming available, and explore allele based treatments for ADPKD. ADPKD and ADPLD are genetic diseases associated with cyst development and loss of function in the kidney and liver cysts, where the disease severity varies greatly between patients. Here we will identify new genes that cause these disorders and evaluate mutations in silico, in a cellular assay, and in whole animals to better predict the disease course in each patient.

Identified chaperone or readthrough drugs will be tested in available mouse models. Overall this proposal will better explain the etiology and the genetic causes of phenotypic variability in ADPKD/ADPLD, develop better prognostic tools for individual selection of patients for treatment that are now becoming available, and explore allele based treatments for ADPKD. ADPKD and ADPLD are genetic diseases associated with cyst development and loss of function in the kidney and liver cysts, where the disease severity varies greatly between patients. Here we will identify new genes that cause these disorders and evaluate mutations in silico, in a cellular assay, and in whole animals to better predict the disease course in each patient.

"An Integrative Radiogenomic Approach to Design Genetically-Informed Image Biomarker for Characterizing COPD ! Abstract  Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is one of the leading causes of death worldwide with a devastating socio-economic burden impacting more than three million individuals per year in the US. The primary environmental risk factor in the susceptible population is smoking, which causes an exaggerated inflammatory response. However, many factors including several genetic risk variants substantially influence the susceptibility. Twin-based studies show that families with emphysema have a higher risk for the disease. The two different major phenotypes of COPD are small airway remodeling (airway disease) and alveolar destruction (emphysema). Although these two major phenotypes result in a similar deficiency in global lung function, the relationship between them is complicated and likely involves feedback mechanisms. Developing an objective method to characterize lung phenotypes is critical since treatment candidates vary based on phenotype. Measurements from High-Resolution Computed Tomography (HRCT) images are increasingly used to describe COPD since they can quantitatively describe the contribution of the phenotypes. To discover the genetic risk variants, Genome-Association Studies (GWAS) have focused on either the physiological lung function or a simple threshold-based measurement from lung CT, neither of which fully characterizes phenotypic subtypes or the distribution pattern of disease. The proposed studies will take advantage of the rich image and genetic data jointly to build a genetically-informed imaging biomarker to characterize each patient. For each patient, our method summarizes the CT image to a vector representation that accurately describes the severity of the disease. Also, a method to link the representation back to the genetic risk variants will be developed. If successful, these methods can be used to monitor the efficacy of treatment or progression of the disease using imaging data. Successful execution of the second aim will result in better understanding of the etiology of different disease subtypes and discovery of novel genetic pathways that could be used as potential drug targets. Furthermore, the patient representation enables the use of image data to construct a more powerful model to predict the so-called acute exacerbation event. Predicting the exacerbations is clinically important since they cause further damage to the lung.  In Aim 1, we develop and implement a novel image biomarker that is mutually informed by imaging and genetic data from each patient. Our statistical method in Aim 2 elucidates the underlying genetic pathways behind the abnormal anatomical variations explained by the biomarker. We validate our method on data from 10,300 patients in the COPDGene dataset. !

"Identifying Genetic Drivers of Expression Networks Causing Insulin Resistance Reduced insulin sensitivity or insulin resistance (IR) is a forerunner of Type 2 diabetes (T2D). Differences in the prevalence of IR among ethnic groups suggest its genetic etiology. However, recent studies implementing genetic association approaches were only nominally successful in defining the genetically-regulated molecular and cellular mechanisms of IR. Our physiologic and genomic studies suggest that (a) IR results from derangement in expression of thousands of genes in tissues involved in glucose homeostasis, and (b) genetic variants, such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), determine the expression level of a subset of IR-associated genes. Thus, transcript levels are key molecular phenotypes associated with IR and are proximal to the action of genetic variants. A subset of genetically-regulated transcript subnetworks that operate within the large highly interconnected global expression networks in disease-relevant tissues can cause IR, but remain poorly understood. We hypothesize that, regulatory SNPs in expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) determine transcript levels of key driver genes, configure the expression subnetworks in adipose and muscle tissue, and are causal determinants for IR. The genetic architecture of eQTLs determines the heterogeneity in causal mechanisms of IR. Our preliminary data support the concept of causal genetic regulators of subnetworks in modulating insulin sensitivity. Challenging the current paradigms, our Aim 1 is to implement our cutting-edge Multiscale Network Modelling Approach to integrate measures of glucose homeostasis (SI and Matsuda index from FSIVGT and OGTT, respectively); adipose and muscle tissue transcript profiles; eSNP data from African American participants in the AAGMEx cohort (N=260); and genetic and epigenetic regulation data from knowledge bases to discover subnetworks and genetic drivers that are causally linked to IR. In Aim 2, we will validate insulin sensitivity-associated genetically-regulated subnetworks, and determine common and ethnically-predominant genetic regulatory mechanisms of IR, using multi-omics data from similarly phenotyped European ancestry individuals from the METSIM (N=770) and AREA (N=99) cohorts. These results will be compared with those from the AAGMEx cohort. Key driver genes of insulin sensitivity-associated genetically regulated adipose and muscle tissue subnetworks from Aims 1-2 will then be prioritized based on statistical ranking to validate their regulatory roles. In Aim 3, we will focus on understanding molecular and cellular mechanisms modulated by 10 selected putative key regulatory genes. Using in vitro genetic perturbation experiments in relevant human cell models we have already established, we will modulate the expression of these genes, identify target pathways, and examine IR-determining cellular mechanisms (e.g. metabolism, signal transduction, differentiation, inflammation, cell-cell interaction) regulated by these genes. Our study will be among the first to define the genetic regulatory networks of IR, a key step towards development of novel therapeutic options for prevention of IR and subsequent T2D. Deciphering the underlying molecular defects and genetic regulatory mechanisms of insulin sensitivity is an unmet need to develop novel and safe therapeutic options to prevent insulin resistance and progression to type 2 diabetes and other diseases of major public health importance. Building on our success in recruiting cohorts of metabolically well-characterized and molecularly profiled non-diabetic African and European Ancestry individuals, and creating a data resource that is suitably powered to conduct integrative multi-omics analysis, we will implement a novel computational approach to discover fat and muscle tissue gene regulatory networks and driver genes that are causally linked to insulin resistance. Leveraging expertise of our multidisciplinary research team in cell and molecular biological studies this project will define mechanistic roles for the computationally predicted key regulatory genes in determining insulin resistance and thus help inform new strategies to treat and even prevent the rapidly growing public-health challenge of type 2 diabetes, particularly among African Americans.",Identifying Genetic Drivers of Expression Networks Causing Insulin Resistance,9959404,R01DK118243,"['Adipose tissue', 'African', 'African American', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell model', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Down-Regulation', 'Dyslipidemias', 'Ethnic group', 'European', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Glucose', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Multiomic Data', 'Muscle', 'Network-based', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'OGTT', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Regulator Genes', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Transcript', 'base', 'blood glucose regulation', 'causal model', 'causal variant', 'cohort', 'data resource', 'density', 'epigenetic regulation', 'experimental study', 'genetic architecture', 'genetic association', 'genetic variant', 'genome-wide', 'indexing', 'insulin sensitivity', 'knowledge base', 'metabolic phenotype', 'molecular phenotype', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple omics', 'network models', 'non-diabetic', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'overexpression', 'preservation', 'prevent', 'promoter', 'random forest', 'reconstruction', 'recruit', 'small hairpin RNA', 'success', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NIDDK,WAKE FOREST UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2020,378487,-0.03736204572992073
"Overall NIDA Core ""Center of Excellence"" in Transcriptomics, Systems Genetics and the Addictome Addiction is a highly complex disease with risk factors that include genetic variants and differences in development, sex, and environment. The long term potential of precision medicine to improve drug treatment and prevention depends on gaining a much better understanding how genetics, drugs, brain cells, and neuronal circuitry interact to influence behavior. There are serious technical barriers that prevent researchers and clinicians from incorporating more powerful computational and predictive methods in addiction research. The purpose of the NIDA P30 Core Center of Excellence in Omics, Systems Genetics, and the Addictome is to empower and train researchers supported by NIH, NIDA, NIAAA, and other federal and state institutions to use more quantitative and testable ways to analyze genetic, epigenetic, and the environmental factors that influence drug abuse risk and treatment. In the Transcriptome Informatics and Mechanisms research core we assemble and upgrade hundreds of large genome (DNA) and transcriptome (RNA) datasets for experimental rodent (rat) models of addiction. In the Systems Analytics and Modeling research core, we are using innovative systems genetics methods (gene mapping) to understand the linkage between DNA differences, environmental risks such as stress, and the differential risk of drug abuse and relapse. Our Pilot core is catalyzing new collaborations among young investigator in the field of addiction research. In sum the Center is a national resource for more reproducible research in addiction. We are centralizing, archiving, distributing, analyzing and integrating high quality data, metadata, using open software systems in collaboration with many other teams of researchers. Our goal is to help build toward an NIDA Addictome Portal that will include all genomic research relevant to addiction research. PROJECT NARRATIVE The NIDA Core Center of Excellence in Omics, Systems Genetics, and the Addictome (OSGA) provides genomic and computational support to a large number of research scientists working on mechanisms and treatment of addiction. The two main research cores of OSGA are providing support for transcriptome, epigenome, and metagenome studies of rat models of addiction at many levels of analysis. We are also creating open access tools and a powerful web portal to catalyze more effective and replicable use of massive datasets generated by programs in addiction biology and treatment.","Overall NIDA Core ""Center of Excellence"" in Transcriptomics, Systems Genetics and the Addictome",9929423,P30DA044223,"['Archives', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Cellular Assay', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consult', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug abuse', 'Educational workshop', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Joints', 'Leadership', 'Machine Learning', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Proteome', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Quantitative Genetics', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'RNA', 'Rattus', 'Relapse', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Models', 'Stress', 'Sum', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translations', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'Variant', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'behavior influence', 'brain cell', 'career', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'computing resources', 'data archive', 'data integration', 'data modeling', 'data tools', 'data warehouse', 'deep learning', 'digital imaging', 'drug relapse', 'epigenome', 'experience', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic variant', 'genomic variation', 'graphical user interface', 'health record', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'metagenome', 'mouse model', 'multiple omics', 'neurogenomics', 'neuronal circuitry', 'novel', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'programs', 'ranpirnase', 'rat genome', 'repository', 'sex', 'single cell analysis', 'software systems', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'web portal']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE HEALTH SCI CTR,P30,2020,754121,0.008990599639354498
"Single cell atlas as a roadmap for interpreting human genetic variation in complex disease Project Summary Genome wide association studies (GWAS) have successfully identified thousands of loci likely affecting human health. To translate these findings into therapeutic targets and disease treatments, we need to understand the cellular context and underlying biological mechanisms through which each disease associated variant disrupts function. Large scale, information rich datasets are being generated across multiple modalities including transcriptomics from single cell RNA-seq studies, traits and phenotypes from the UK Biobank and germline genetic variation from exome sequencing studies. Here, we propose to develop methods to integrate these amazing resources towards understanding the identifying biological and cellular mechanisms that are leading to disease. The objectives will be accomplished with the following specific aims: 1) Integrate population scale biological datasets including UK Biobank and single cell transcriptomics data to construct gene modules with the goal to recapitulate biological pathways. 2) Develop a statistical framework to measure mutational burden across each of the cell type specific gene modules. Together, this research proposal will increase the power in interpreting human genetic variation and help better understand the mechanism through which they act. These methods are being developed around an IBD dataset and will derive substantial molecular information about the mechanisms driving IBD. The lessons and methodological advances from this work will be directly applicable in many complex disease contexts. Project Narrative Genome wide association studies are highly successful identifying thousands of disease-associated loci but fall short at 1) pinpointing the biological mechanisms through which the variants effect disease and 2) capturing the effects of rare variants which may be having larger effect on disease outcomes. This research proposal details plans to integrate high-throughput single cell transcriptomics, population scale biobank datasets and exome sequencing from large disease cohorts to learn a prior on which genes are likely working together in which cell types and consequently improve the statistical power in interpreting rare human genetic variation.

"Unravelling genetic basis of comorbidity using EHR-linked biobank data Rapid progress in translational bioinformatics and clinical informatics for precision medicine has  provided many computing and informatics methodologies to provide better prediction, diagnosis and  treatment strategy as a clinical utility. In particular, high dimensional and large-scale  biomedical data sets, ranging from clinical data to ‘omics data, provide an unprecedented  opportunity for translating the newly found knowledge from biomedical big data analytics to  support clinical decisions. The complexity and scale of these big data sets hold great  promise, yet present substantial challenges. As one of important concerns for clinicians,  comorbidity is a well- documented phenomenon in medicine in which one or more medical conditions  exist and potentially interact with one another, thereby influencing the primary clinical  condition. Several studies show variability in the number of comorbid conditions that can  exist at one time, and patterns of disease presentation differ from one chronic condition to  another. Thus, there is a clear need to improve care for individuals with multiple  comorbidities, but doing so requires a much more detailed understanding of the trends of disease  associations than we currently possess. Previous studies have primarily focused on a  handful of specific comorbidities; investigating the underlying causes of broad disease  comorbidity across the human diseasome has been challenging. Fortunately, in the past  decade, comprehensive collections of disease diagnosis data have become available, primarily  in the form of data from electronic health records (EHRs). Retrospectively, we can use a patient’s  health history to identify comorbidities and apply a data-driven approach to studying disease  comorbidity patterns that considers all possible disease comorbidities. In particular, developing  computing and modeling of large-scale data that integrates newly defined comorbidity patterns with  genomics will hold great potential for uncovering molecular mechanisms of disease. Primarily, we  will elucidate the underlying genetic and non-genetic factors that influence disease comorbidity.  We will apply two orthogonal approaches to identify comorbidities: 1) deriving from disease  co-occurrence using EHR data alone, and 2) deriving from pleiotropic genetic associations using the  EHR-linked biobank dataset. Network-based approaches have the potential to uncover unexpected  relationships between diseases. One of the most significant advantages of our proposal is the  linking of a single-source EHR to genomic data; this provides the opportunity to  revisit individual-level genotype and phenotype data for the design of more targeted  studies and to ask more specific questions. Additionally, our results can be used to develop  a novel comorbidity risk score that combines both clinical data and genetic effects, which might  constitute a new tool for clinical prevention and monitoring. These goals are very much in keeping  with today’s climate of precision medicine, where treatment and prevention are ideally designed to  consider an individual patient’s variability in genetics, lifestyle, and environmental exposures. There is a clear need to improve care for individuals with multiple comorbidities, but this  requires a much more detailed understanding of the trends of disease associations than we  currently possess. An EHR-linked biobank data provides a unique opportunity to investigate  cross-phenotypes associations, and it might broaden the understanding of genetic architecture  that exists between diagnoses, genes, and pleiotropy. In this proposal, we will construct a  disease comorbidity map of 2.1 million patients using longitudinal EHRs in Penn Medicine (Aim 1),  construct a disease-gene map derived from phenome-wide association study using Penn Medicine  Biobank Participants (Aim 2), and develop a novel scoring system using graph-based  machine learning and predict comorbidity risk scores (CRS) for a given disease (Aim 3).",Unravelling genetic basis of comorbidity using EHR-linked biobank data,10034691,R01GM138597,"['Algorithms', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'Bioinformatics', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Climate', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Etiology', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Health', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'International Classification of Disease Codes', 'Knowledge', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Network-based', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Scoring Method', 'Source', 'System', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Variant', 'Veterans', 'base', 'big biomedical data', 'biobank', 'clinical decision support', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'electronic data', 'genetic architecture', 'genetic association', 'genetic information', 'genetic variant', 'genomic data', 'high dimensionality', 'human disease', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'interactive tool', 'large scale data', 'non-genetic', 'novel', 'patient variability', 'phenome', 'phenotypic data', 'pleiotropism', 'precision medicine', 'programs', 'rare variant', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'trend']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2020,486125,-0.013787961914468653
"Genetic Modulators of Glaucoma Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness in the world. While elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) is a major risk factor, damage and death of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) underlies visual field loss. However, a thorough understanding of this disease is a major challenge because its genetic basis is heterogeneous and it represents a family of age-related disorders resulting from intersecting gene-regulated pathophysiologic networks. We propose to continue to use the BXD (C57BL/6 x DBA/2J) family of recombinant inbred (RI) lines of mice as a genetic reference panel (GRP) and to combine our work with human genome wide association studies (GWAS), to uncover and clarify the genetic heterogeneity that underlies optic nerve (ON) damage. We have had recent success using this combined approach in the regulation of intraocular pressure (IOP). We are very well positioned to take the next step and apply this approach to define cellular targets of RGC damage and death. We propose to uncover phenotypic diversities of glaucoma-related ON damage and uncover common underlying mechanisms that are shared with IOP modulation. Our long-term research goal is to identify disease mechanisms and develop neuroprotective therapies to preserve retinal health in patients at risk for glaucoma. Our overall objective is to identify novel gene products and related mechanisms that lead to glaucomatous endophenotypes using multi-dimensional genetic analyses, cross-species comparisons (mouse, rat and human) and validation using novel murine glaucoma models. Our central hypothesis is that molecular processes leading to glaucoma associated-endophenotypes, such as elevated IOP and ON damage, are shared across species, and that species comparisons can uncover common underlying mechanisms, and efficient testing of targeted glaucoma therapeutics. In the current investigation, we perform a systematic analysis of ON damage, and an additional species—rat. We will mine the extensive databases of IOP and ON damage that we are generating for more than 70 BXD strains across five age cohorts with the goal of defining new models of glaucoma. An overall strength of this proposal is the combination of cutting-edge systems genetics methods, species comparisons of glaucoma phenotypes, and a strong interdisciplinary team that includes investigators with extensive experience in systems genetics, glaucoma, GWAS in human and rats, and advanced computational methods. To test our hypothesis, we will perform the following thress studies: 1) Identify the candidate gene on chromosome 12 that modulates ON damage; 2) Determine if modulation of IOP and/or ON damage is shared across rodent species; and 3) Identify novel spontaneous glaucoma models through a comprehensive analysis of our enlarged BXD GRP of 100 or more BXD strains. The outcomes of these studies will define novel genes and molecular networks that underlie glaucoma-associated phenotypes and also provide unique glaucoma models for future analysis. These results are expected to fundamentally advance the field of glaucoma disease mechanisms and enable targeted therapeutic development. Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness in the world and a thorough understanding of this disease is a major challenge because its genetic basis is heterogeneous, and it likely represents a family of disorders resulting from intersecting gene-regulated pathophysiologic pathways.

"Identify, Analyze, and Evaluate Potential Risk Factors for Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) - 2018 ABSTRACT ALS is a devastating and fatal neurodegenerative disease for which there is no cure or effective treatment. The causes of ALS likely involve interaction of environmental and genetic susceptibility factors. Exposure to the damaging environmental stressors likely occurs at particularly susceptible time-periods, and for a prolonged period. We will investigate the époques during which environmental exposures carry the greatest risk for later development of ALS. We will use questionnaire data, residential history, and DNA samples from our on-going epidemiologic studies in Northern New England and Ohio, the existing environmental and genetic variant data from the National ALS Registry for ALS patients nationwide, and both clinic- and random population-based controls. We will use geospatial algorithms to estimate residential exposures in years extending backwards for ~30 years derived from our databases of time-linked contents of sources of environmental toxins (cyanobacteria) and toxicants (landfills, municipal incinerators, Superfund and Brownfield sites, pesticide applications). We also propose to identify genetic risk factors for ALS that manifest effects specifically in the presence of an environmental stressor. We will use the existing Illumina NeuroChip data covering 500,000 genetic variants implicated in neurodegenerative illness on the National ALS Biorepository participants, and propose to assay our epidemiologic study DNA samples on the same panel to construct a large, pooled genotype dataset. Genetic imputation will allow genome-wide coverage for identification of novel variants. We will employ the machine- learning methods to identify gene x environment interactions, the genetic variants that synergize with environmental stressors to increase disease risk. This project has the potential to identify the environmental and genetic risk factors in periods of temporal susceptibility that will lead to disease prevention through exposure mitigation, early-identification, and development of interventions to block disease progression. PROJECT NARRATIVE/RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH The prevention and cure of ALS require identification of susceptibility genes and the most important environmental risk factors, their most sensitive period of exposure, and the implementation of steps to mitigate these exposures. We propose to use residential history to estimate exposures to waterbody cyanobacteria, pesticides, and polluted sites in ALS patients compared to healthy controls using time-linked databases. We expect these studies to reveal genetic variants that raise ALS susceptibility, and determine the periods of life that carry the greatest risk for developing ALS from exposures to environmental stressors.","Identify, Analyze, and Evaluate Potential Risk Factors for Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) - 2018",9973035,R01TS000288,[' '],ATSDR,DARTMOUTH-HITCHCOCK CLINIC,R01,2020,500000,0.025711471795514904
"Genetic Privacy and Identity in Community Settings - GetPreCiSe Genetic Privacy and Identity in Community Settings (GetPreCiSe), is an NHGRI Center of Excellence in ELSI Research (CEER) that, in its first four years, established an environment for multi-disciplinary study that produced innovative ways of studying genetic privacy and identity. Specifically, the center 1) parsed the concept of genetic privacy into its often conflated constituent components, including: the “right to be let alone,” control and governance of data, and concerns about downstream uses of data; 2) documented and critically assessed the privacy practices of direct to consumer genetic testing (DTC-GT) companies; 3) examined how and why people trade off personal privacy for other social goods and services; 4) used new techniques to explore how film, television, and social media reflect and affect public perceptions of genetic privacy; and 5) refined understanding of the risk that people will be re-identified from their genomic information. During this time, many developments raised new issues of privacy and identity for genetics. First is the growth of DTC-GT, which generates genetic information used to trace ancestry, acquire health information, find relatives, uncover parentage, and pursue law enforcement investigations, among other activities. Second, laws and regulations governing data privacy and security, particularly with respect to genomics, are changing rapidly in the U.S. and abroad. These often conflict and present new challenges as genomic data move across state and international borders. Third, the creation of ever larger cohorts, such as the NIH’s All of Us Research Program, raises further dilemmas because some or all of the genomic and other data participants provide will be made available to investigators working in a variety of settings and subject to different regulatory regimes. Moreover, participants in these studies may receive research results, which could be deposited in their electronic health records, making this data subject to clinical regulation and compelling action by clinical providers who may not have the knowledge or infrastructure to respond. Thus, as our understanding of genomics increases, so, too, do its multifarious roles and implications for individuals, families, and society evolve. Given the evolving landscape, in its next four years GetPreCiSe will address three complementary specific aims: 1) Apply multimodal methods to characterize how social practices affect, and are affected by, evolving notions of genetic privacy and identity and increased availability of data, 2) Characterize how emerging legal and regulatory frameworks influence genomic privacy and identity in the US and abroad, and 3) Engineer and evaluate new technologies and quantitative frameworks that have potential to intrude on, but also protect, genetic privacy and identity. Recognizing that genetic data processing opportunities and threats are evolving, GetPreCiSe is designed to be a multi-disciplinary center, focused on training the next generation of ELSI researchers, with sufficient agility to respond to emerging issues. We anticipate these aims will need to be refined, and possibly pivoted, over the next four years and so stand ready to seed new investigations into emerging issues and compose new teams for investigation as needed. The incorporation of genetics and genomics into medical care and the public domain raises new challenges for how we understand privacy and identity, concepts that have long been closely linked in American discourse. The Genetic Privacy and Identity in Community Settings (GetPreCiSe), an NHGRI Center of Excellence in Ethical, Legal, and Social Implications Research (CEER) will 1) characterize how social practices and genetic data access affect notions of genetic privacy and identity, 2) assess the impact of emerging laws and regulatory frameworks in the US and abroad, and 3) gauge how new technologies compromise but also uphold protections.",Genetic Privacy and Identity in Community Settings - GetPreCiSe,9982627,RM1HG009034,"['Address', 'Advertising', 'Affect', 'Age', 'All of Us Research Program', 'American', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Arts', 'Behavior', 'Big Data', 'CCL4 gene', 'California', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Conceptions', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Protection', 'Data Security', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'European Union', 'Family', 'Film', 'Gender', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Identity', 'Genetic Models', 'Genetic Privacy', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Imagination', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'International', 'Internet', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Law Enforcement', 'Laws', 'Legal', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Newspapers', 'Participant', 'Perception', 'Policies', 'Privacy', 'Provider', 'Public Domains', 'Publications', 'Race', 'Radio', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Seeds', 'Services', 'Social Network', 'Social Sciences', 'Societies', 'Technology', 'Television', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Use of New Techniques', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior influence', 'behavioral economics', 'blockchain', 'cohort', 'community setting', 'computerized data processing', 'data access', 'data privacy', 'data sharing', 'design', 'ethical legal social implication', 'genetic information', 'genetic testing', 'genomic data', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'legal implication', 'minimal risk', 'multidisciplinary', 'multimodality', 'new technology', 'news', 'next generation', 'sex', 'social', 'social media']",NHGRI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,RM1,2020,1112351,0.028263285957824253
"Neurovirulent HSV-1 Recombinants for vQTL Analysis Abstract Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) is a significant human pathogen and is the leading cause of sporadic encephalitis in the USA. Strains of virus display virulence phenotypes ranging from avirulent to highly pathogenic. There are indications that the virulence of a given strain of virus is actually determined by the “constellation” of genes carried by the virus and how they interact with each other; a phenomenon termed epistasis. Traditional methods for analyzing the function of viral genes are difficult to apply to studying epistatic interactions in virulence. Recently we described a novel approach, vQTLmap, that has allowed us to identify contributions of multiple genes to peripheral disease phenotypes. To date we have analyzed four quantitative phenotypes, blepharitis, stromal keratitis, corneal neovascularization, and weight loss. Surprisingly, there are distinct differences in the viral genes that appear to be driving each of these phenotypes. In order to carry out vQTLmap using quantitative measures of neurovirulence, we need to isolate additional neurovirulent recombinants between the OD4 and CJ994 parental viruses. The goals of this proposal are to generate the reagents (e.g., neurovirulent recombinants) needed to analyze neurovirulence genes driving HSV-1 encephalitis and identify epistatic interactions and carry out vQTLmap analysis of percent mortality, percent ataxia, percent head tilt, and percent limb paralysis. At the completion of this project, we will be able to submit an R01 application to carry out vQTLmap on features such as percent mortality, brain titers of virus, localization of the infection in the brain, and neuroinvasiveness. A better understanding of how viral genes work together to promote disease has the potential to identify novel targets that could assist antiviral drug or vaccine development efforts. Narrative The role played by viral genes in determining the outcome of infection is poorly understood, particularly for Herpes simplex virus, which is an important pathogen. We have validated a novel approach involving generating recombinant viruses, determining the sequence of their genomes, and using novel statistical methods to map viral genes that affect the severity of the infection. In order to extend the analysis to neurovirulence (encephalitis), we need to isolate more neurovirulent recombinants. The goal of this application is to isolate additional HSV-1 recombinants so we can identify genetic drivers of encephalitis in the HSV-1 genome. The project ultimately has the potential to identify novel therapeutic targets for drug or vaccine development.",Neurovirulent HSV-1 Recombinants for vQTL Analysis,9817679,R21AI137280,"['Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Ataxia', 'Automobile Driving', 'Blepharitis', 'Blindness', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Brain', 'Central Nervous System Infections', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Corneal Neovascularization', 'Corneal Ulcer', 'Data', 'Digestion', 'Disease', 'Encephalitis', 'Eye Infections', 'Female', 'Focal Infection', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Epistasis', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Herpesvirus 1', 'Infection', 'Keratitis', 'Limb structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Paralysed', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Probability', 'Publishing', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Reagent', 'Recombinants', 'Role', 'Severities', 'Simplexvirus', 'Statistical Methods', 'Testing', 'Vero Cells', 'Viral Genes', 'Viral Physiology', 'Virulence', 'Virus', 'Work', 'disease phenotype', 'drug development', 'human pathogen', 'innovation', 'male', 'mortality', 'neurovirulence', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'pathogen', 'recombinant virus', 'vaccine development']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R21,2020,229500,0.0004818130506394393
"Investigating the clinical ontologies of loss-of-function and gain-of-function human gene variants PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This proposal is for an MD/PhD student’s individual pre-doctoral fellowship application. Joseph Park, the applicant under consideration, proposes a research training plan with the long-term goal of developing into an independent physician-scientist studying the genetic mechanisms underlying cardiometabolic and other complex diseases using computational, experimental, and translational approaches. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have successfully described the roles of common genetic variation on human diseases by analyzing large populations with shared disease traits, but the clinical ontologies of numerous genes remain incompletely described through these phenotype-based methodologies. Additionally, a fundamental problem of genetic association studies remains to be the difficulty of describing the functional consequences of disease- associated variants to their respective gene products (i.e. loss- vs. gain-of-function). The Penn Medicine Biobank, a healthcare system-based database of genotype, whole-exome sequencing, and electronic health record (EHR) data, allows for an unbiased, genotype-first approach to describing the relationships between dysfunctional genes and human disease traits captured in the clinical setting through phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS). Through gene-burden PheWAS tests, the proposed study aims to characterize the clinical manifestations of disease caused by rare, loss-of-function mutations in each gene on a genome- wide scale. Our analyses will enable clinicians to more effectively identify genetic diseases among their patients in the clinical setting. Furthermore, in addition to our interrogation of loss-of-function mutations, our proposed project has the potential to define the roles of known gain-of-function mutations in human disease and identify novel gain-of-function variants relevant to disease, offering a direction for investigators to design follow-up experimental studies in the basic sciences as well as a platform promoting more efficient therapeutic discoveries. And importantly, while conducting the proposed study, Joseph will receive rigorous training in computational biology and statistical genetics during the funding period, promoting his maturation into a successful, independent physician-scientist thoroughly prepared for a clinical career involving the analysis of “omics” and “big data”. These goals will be accomplished through the extensive fellowship training plan jointly developed by him and his sponsor, Daniel Rader. Through the mentorship of numerous senior investigators, regular attendance at seminars, conferences, and other opportunities for presentation and interaction with renowned scientists at the University of Pennsylvania, and the collaborative research environment that the Rader laboratory and its physically surrounding organizations promote, Joseph is well-equipped to achieve his career goals through his guaranteed development during the proposed training. PROJECT NARRATIVE Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have successfully described the roles of many human genes by analyzing large populations with shared traits, but these phenotype-based methodologies have incompletely described the clinical implications of numerous genes. I propose to address this knowledge gap by taking an unbiased, genotype-first approach to describing the relationships between dysfunctional genes and human disease traits through gene-burden phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS), essentially intersecting data from our healthcare system-based biobank database comprised of genotype data, whole-exome sequencing, and electronic health records (EHR). In addition to capturing the disease implications of rare, loss-of-function mutations on a genome-wide scale, my proposed project has the potential to define the roles of known and novel gain-of-function mutations in human disease, offering a direction for follow-up functional studies as well as a platform for more efficient therapeutic discoveries.",Investigating the clinical ontologies of loss-of-function and gain-of-function human gene variants,9916631,F30HG010442,"['Address', 'African American', 'Animal Model', 'Authorization documentation', 'Basic Science', 'Big Data', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Fellowship', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Models', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Literature', 'Measurement', 'Medicine', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mutation', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Ontology', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Population', 'Population Analysis', 'Privatization', 'Recontacts', 'Records', 'Regression Analysis', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Serum', 'Structure', 'Suggestion', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissue Model', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Veterans', 'Work', 'base', 'biobank', 'cardiometabolism', 'career', 'design', 'disease phenotype', 'doctoral student', 'exome sequencing', 'experimental study', 'follow-up', 'gain of function', 'gain of function mutation', 'gene discovery', 'gene product', 'genetic association', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'human disease', 'human tissue', 'loss of function', 'loss of function mutation', 'medical schools', 'novel', 'phenome', 'pre-doctoral', 'precision medicine', 'programs', 'quantitative imaging', 'rare variant', 'recruit', 'symposium', 'text searching', 'tool', 'trait', 'translational approach']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,F30,2020,50520,-0.06275458108693074
"Automated, high-throughput identification of genetic structural variants for gene editing and undiagnosed genetic diseases screening ABSTRACT A simple method to comprehensively discover, characterize and identify structural variants arising from normal metabolic processes, as well as cell manipulations, would have great utility for gene editing, oncology, and rare disease research, among other applications. De Novo Directional Genomic Hybridization (dGH™) has been developed to efficiently screen thousands of cells for the presence of simple, complex, and heterogenous structural variants. In this project, Automated, High-Throughput Identification of Genetic Structural Variants for Gene Editing and Undiagnosed Genetic Diseases Screening, we propose K-Band™ dGH, an expanded dGH method. K-Band dGH is an in-situ hybridization method that utilizes high-density chromatid paints with bands of distinct spectra. A normal chromosome has a definitive pattern of bands, spectra and probe density. Structural variants are detected and identified via changes to the signal pattern. The proposed K-Band™ dGH method will provide the means for de novo discovery of balanced allelic translocations involving breakpoints at the same loci, inversions, and sister chromatid recombination and exchange events that are invisible to existing methods such as sequencing and aCGH. K-Band dGH will additionally characterize deletions, duplications, translocations, aneuploidy, polyploidy and more complex rearrangements. Structural variations cause a wide range of disorders, from rare diseases to cancers, and can be precise and definitive biomarkers. Also, because variations arise from the mis-repair of DNA double-strand breaks, unintended structural damage is an inevitable and potentially high-risk byproduct of genome editing. The potential of genome editing approaches such as CRISPR-Cas9 in the treatment of diseases is widely recognized and the realization of the promise of such therapeutic approaches will rely on accurate confirmation of the presence and absence of potentially risky structural variants. For these reasons, comprehensive detection and characterization of structural variations is a necessary step toward understanding, diagnosing and ultimately precisely treating genetic diseases. From a homogeneous or heterogenous population of cells, and in a single experiment, K-Band dGH will identify cells with a structurally normal phenotype, detect all classes of structural variants, and locate the breakpoints of all simple and complex structural variants in each cell. With a limit of detection below 5Kb, K-Band dGH is an ideal method for determining the outcomes of gene editing, discovering the causes of undiagnosed rare diseases, profiling genomic structural instability and variability, and discovering and validating previously unknown structural genetic drivers of disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE Modern genomics, driven by the demands of personalized medicine, needs higher throughput, higher integrity, and improved resolution to enable the discovery of new disease drivers and in the development of safer gene therapies. Rapid, accurate, efficient characterization of structural variants and their associated risks is critical to the discovery of potential therapeutic avenues for undiagnosed and rare diseases, and to the development of engineered cellular therapies, including stem cells, CAR-T and other gene therapies leveraging gene-editing tools such as CRISPR. K-Band™ dGH, proposed in Automated, High-Throughput Identification of Genetic Structural Variants for Gene Editing and Undiagnosed Genetic Diseases Screening, will enable single-cell, single-experiment identification of clinically important structural variants that cannot be discovered or identified by NGS or other available methods with broad applicability in genome engineering R&D, target discovery and personalized therapy development.","Automated, high-throughput identification of genetic structural variants for gene editing and undiagnosed genetic diseases screening",10080433,R44HG011442,"['Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Aneuploidy', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomedical Research', 'CRISPR screen', 'CRISPR therapeutics', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Therapy', 'Cells', 'Chromatids', 'Chromosomal Rearrangement', 'Chromosome Structures', 'Chromosomes', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Color', 'Complex', 'DNA', 'DNA Double Strand Break', 'DNA Repair', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Double Strand Break Repair', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Fingerprint', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Recombination', 'Genetic Structures', 'Genome engineering', 'Genomic Hybridizations', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Location', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Marketing', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Oncology', 'Outcome', 'Paint', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Polyploidy', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Radiation', 'Rare Diseases', 'Reciprocal Translocation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sister Chromatid', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Solid', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'automated image analysis', 'base', 'cellular engineering', 'clinically relevant', 'commercial application', 'comparative genomic hybridization', 'density', 'experimental study', 'fluorophore', 'gene therapy', 'genetic variant', 'genome editing', 'genomic profiles', 'genotoxicity', 'high risk', 'improved', 'intelligent algorithm', 'new therapeutic target', 'personalized medicine', 'reconstruction', 'research and development', 'screening', 'stem cells', 'structural genomics', 'technological innovation', 'therapeutic gene', 'therapeutic target', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'whole genome']",NHGRI,"KROMATID, INC.",R44,2020,1088162,0.0015632725063472594
"Biomedical Computing and Informatics Strategies for Infectious Disease Research ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): An important goal of infectious disease research is to develop genetic predictors of susceptibility. Our success in this endeavor will depend critically on the informatics methods and software that are available for making sense of high-dimensional genetic and genomic data. The goal of this research program is to develop, evaluate, distribute and support new and novel biomedical computing algorithms and open-source software for identifying combinations of genetic predictors of clinically important infectious disease outcomes. This application will target the growing body of rare genetic variants identified by high-throughput DNA sequencing. Our clinical application will focus on the prediction of antiretroviral response in clinical trials for HIV/AIDS. We propose here a highly innovative Hierarchical Rare Variant Collapsing Machine (HRVCM) algorithm for identifying and collapsing combinations of rare variants across gene regions (AIM 1). We will then integrate these new collapsed HRVCM variables into our popular Multifactor Dimensionality Reduction (MDR) method that will assess them in combination with common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from genome-wide association studies or GWAS (AIM 2). Our novel HRVCM-MDR approach will, for the first time, make it possible to assess non-additive interactions among sets of rare and common variants simultaneously in genetic studies of infectious diseases. We will apply these new and novel methods to approximately 13 million rare and common variants from nearly 3000 subjects that participated in an AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) study to evaluate risk for virologic failure with efavirenz-containing antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimens (AIM 3). Finally, we will release all methods as open source to the biomedical research community through our freely available MDR software package (AIM 4). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The overall goal of this application is to develop innovative new computational methods for the genetic analysis of infectious diseases. We will focus on the development of methods that are able to detect synergistic effects of multiple genetic variants regardless of whether they are rare of common in human populations. We will apply these methods to the study of HIV/AIDS vaccination response.",Biomedical Computing and Informatics Strategies for Infectious Disease Research,9869806,R01AI116794,"['AIDS clinical trial group', 'AIDS/HIV problem', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Anti-Retroviral Agents', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biomedical Computing', 'Biomedical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Dimensions', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Failure', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Models', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Genomic Segment', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'High-Throughput DNA Sequencing', 'Human', 'Infectious Diseases Research', 'Informatics', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Time', 'Vaccination', 'Variant', 'antiretroviral therapy', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'clinical application', 'clinical predictors', 'design', 'efavirenz', 'gene interaction', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic association', 'genetic predictors', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'high dimensionality', 'innovation', 'method development', 'novel', 'open source', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'rare variant', 'response', 'simulation', 'success', 'virology']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2020,463248,0.00206584365735589
"Modulation of Lung Disease by Genetic/Epigenetic Profiling Project Summary/Abstract Therapeutic management of lung disorders hallmarked by the loss-of-function of the Cystic Fibrosis (CF) Transmembrane conductance Regulator (CFTR) leading to CF are challenged by genetic and epigenetic diversity found in the CF population. Given the Precision Medicine Initiative (All of Us for You (https://allofus.nih.gov/) and the large amount of genomic and phenomic diversity found in patients, it is now generally recognized that we must find new approaches to address the complexity in CF presentation in the clinic. This will require an understanding of fundamental principles dictating disease onset at birth, defined by familial genetic variation, and its progression, influenced by epigenetic programs, both unique to the individual. This proposal is about understanding the role of genetic and epigenetic diversity in CF in response to Histone DeACetylase (HDAC) activity. We have shown these relationships to be responsive to the activity of HDACs, proteins that manage the acetylation/deacetylation balance of the genome and the proteome (the epigenome) to integrate the complex functions linking the genome to the proteome and phenome. Based on the premise that the genome and epigenome are sensitive to manipulation(s) that will favor increased functionality of the CFTR variant fold, the objective of this proposal is to mechanistically define the impact of HDAC modulation on CFTR function observed at the bench and the bedside. We hypothesize that CF can be best understood based on the rationale that disease can be defined by the collective of variation found in the CF population that alters CFTR sequence-to-function-to-structure relationships in the individual as now described using Variation Spatial Profiling (VSP) and the new principle of Spatial CoVariance (SCV) (Wang and Balch, 2018, In press). It is the objective of this proposal to apply VSP/SCV to analysis of the role of the epigenome in CF. Key goals to be achieved in this proposal are to 1) define molecular, cellular and physiological states that 2) describe the role of genetic/epigenetic/proteomic diversity in the CF population to 3) provide a sequence-to-function-to-structure characterization of disease in the individual. Aim 1 will explore the impact of HDAC inhibitors (HDACi) to define, from a biochemical/genetic diversity perspective, how variation across the entire CF population will respond to rebalancing of acetylation/deacetylation dynamics. Aim 2 will focus on the role of HDAC7 in the management of CF genetic diversity using molecular, biochemical and cellular approaches. Aim 3 will analyze the role of select HDAC7-sensitive CFTR interactors to address their role in the management of CF variation from an epigenetic perspective. We hypothesize that the completion of these Aims will describe relationships in the population that define the epigenome-linked genome features that impact progression of CF in the individual. Our integrated genome/epigenome/proteome platform will advance our understanding of the contribution of genetic diversity in the progression and management of CF as a complex disease. Project Narrative CF is a complex loss-of-function disease caused by genetic and epigenetic variation in the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane conductance Regulator (CFTR). We will focus on understanding spatial relationships defined by genetic diversity across the CF population that are sensitive to Histone DeACetylase (HDAC) activity to understand the role of the acetylation/deacetylation balance in facilitating function in the individual. We will use a combination of genomic/epigenomic/proteomic approaches based on the principles of Variation Spatial Profiling (VSP) and Spatial CoVariance (SCV) to dissect the role of HDAC in integrated pathways that affect CFTR variant synthesis, folding, trafficking and stability/function at the cell surface that may be responsive to chemical and/or biological manipulation of the epigenome.",Modulation of Lung Disease by Genetic/Epigenetic Profiling,9928091,R01HL095524,"['Acetylation', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Amino Acids', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Genetics', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Birth', 'Cell Death', 'Cell surface', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Cystic Fibrosis', 'Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator', 'Deacetylation', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Environment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Equilibrium', 'Fibrosis', 'Funding', 'Gaussian model', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'HDAC7 histone deacetylase', 'Health', 'Histone Deacetylase', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitor', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Membrane', 'Mendelian disorder', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Mucous body substance', 'Onset of illness', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Publications', 'Role', 'Structure', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Variant', 'base', 'bench to bedside', 'cystic fibrosis patients', 'epigenetic profiling', 'epigenetic variation', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'genomic platform', 'healthspan', 'insight', 'loss of function', 'novel strategies', 'phenome', 'phenomics', 'programs', 'response', 'spatial relationship', 'success', 'trafficking', 'transcription factor']",NHLBI,SCRIPPS RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2020,483750,-0.013291853667922172
"Systems Biology Analysis of Cardiac Electrical Activity and Arrhythmias. Cardiac arrhythmias are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. Abnormalities in heart rate, cardiac conduction (PR and QRS) and repolarization (QT) measured on the ECG predispose to the clinically important cardiac arrhythmias of atrial fibrillation (AF) and ventricular fibrillation (VF) / sudden cardiac death (SCD). We examine the genomic basis of these ECG endophenotypes in order to deconstruct arrhythmias into more proximate traits and discrete components, allowing us to better understand underlying mechanisms, provide insight into arrhythmia generation, and help target development of novel therapies.  The molecular architecture of cardiac electrical activity and arrhythmias is not fully understood, but likely involves genomic, epigenomic, and environmental influences. Over the past 10 years, we have identified numerous common loci associated with cardiac electrical activity and arrhythmias, yet these common variants account for only a portion of the heritability of electrophysiologic and arrhythmic phenotypes. The agnostic examination of genotype-phenotype associations employed in genome- wide association studies (GWAS) does not incorporate knowledge of functional genomic regions or important biologic relationships. Additionally, we currently lack an understanding of the molecular mechanisms connecting mostly intergenic and intronic GWAS signals to phenotype. We therefore hypothesize that a systems biology approach integrating genetic sequence variation with omic data (epigenomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data) will uncover novel associations and elucidate biologic mechanisms associated with arrhythmia-related phenotypes. We further hypothesize that examining the simultaneous association between sequence variation and multiple cardiac electrophysiologic phenotypes will help uncover additional novel mechanisms associated with cardiac electrical activity and arrhythmias.  TOPMed's combination of rich phenotype data, with whole genome sequence (WGS), epigenomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data, provides a unique opportunity to more comprehensively explore these hypotheses. We leverage sequence, omic, and phenotype data from multiple cohort studies to efficiently and cost-effectively examine and dissect association of omic factors with cardiac electrophysiology and arrhythmia risk. Our application is an ambitious yet eminently feasible effort that integrates clinical, genetic, and systems biology expertise. We aim to discover associations using omics data (Aims 1 and 2) and elucidate specific genes and biologic pathways underlying these associations (Aims 3 and 4). Our ultimate goal is to identify pathways, genes, and genetic variation that are clinically relevant, and therefore potentially the target of new therapies, diagnostics, or risk predictions. Narrative Cardiac arrhythmias are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. This proposal aims to use genomic, epigenomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data, combined with complex systems biology and pleiotropic analyses, to better understand the underlying pathways and genes involved in normal electrophysiology and arrhythmia formation.

The applicant has previously completed a Master's Degree in Mathematics, and has had extensive instruction in general computational biology. This unique melding of high-level computational expertise and interest in applied genomics has led to the development of this innovative project. He is now being co-mentored by Drs. Barash and Bhoj to gain complementary practical training in predictive algorithm development and molecular genetics. In both his clinical and research interests he is dedicated to improving the rate of molecular diagnosis for children with rare Mendelian disorders. His short-term goals include developing and refining his skills in RNA splicing prediction and human genetic variation analysis in exome and genome data. In addition, he will gain new insight into experimental design, data interpretation, and scientific communication skills to ensure his successful post-doctoral transition. His co-mentors for the proposal are Drs. Yoseph Barash and Elizabeth Bhoj, international leaders in computational genomics and molecular genetics. In addition he will be supported by outstanding resources of the MSTP at Penn, which has an extensive proven track record of successful previous awardees.  The applicant has been pursuing work in creating an improved computational pipeline for the analysis of variants from exome and genome data. Specifically he is capturing the intronic and synonymous variants that are generally removed from the analysis pipeline because of the difficulty in determining the pathogenicity of such variants. As there are many intronic and synonymous variants that are known to cause Mendelain disorders, this clearly leads to missed diagnoses. In Aim 1 he will generate an interpretable algorithm for prioritizing general splicing variants that guides functional validation. In Aim 2 he will identify novel variants and genes for mechanistic evaluation in the pathogenesis of congenital anomalies. This algorithm will be generally applicable, significantly enhancing our ability to provide molecular diagnoses for all patients with suspected Mendelian disorders. In addition, this proposal will allow the candidate to gain experience, knowledge, and new skills to successfully lay the foundation as a physician-scientist in computational genomics. Many children who are born with multiple medical issues have a genetic cause for their differences, but even the best tests cannot identify the genetic cause. This project will develop new computer technology to do a more complete analysis of their genetic testing information to help diagnose more of these children.",Enhancing molecular diagnosis in children with multiple congenital anomalies using clinically focused splicing prediction algorithms,9907858,F30HD098803,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Benchmarking', 'Cells', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'ClinVar', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Computational Biology', 'Computational Molecular Biology', 'Computers', 'Critical Thinking', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Exhibits', 'Exons', 'Experimental Designs', 'Foundations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype-Tissue Expression Project', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Instruction', 'International', 'Introns', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Libraries', 'Manuals', 'Master&apos', 's Degree', 'Mathematics', 'Medical', 'Mendelian disorder', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Messenger RNA', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Diagnosis', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Protein Isoforms', 'RNA Splicing', 'Regulation', 'Resources', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Syndrome', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'algorithm development', 'analysis pipeline', 'career', 'causal variant', 'clinical application', 'cohort', 'computational pipelines', 'congenital anomaly', 'deep learning', 'exome', 'exome sequencing', 'experience', 'genetic testing', 'genetic variant', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'novel', 'prediction algorithm', 'reference genome', 'skills', 'standard of care', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,F30,2020,50520,0.0011759256031527148
"Integrate gene expression data to characterize the contribution of rare genetic risk factors to structural birth defects Project Summary  We aim to maximize discovery of new risk genes and elucidate the genetic architecture of structural birth defects. To achieve that, we propose cross-disease genetic analysis of both protein-coding and noncoding variants and integration of gene expression data to prioritize candidate risk genes.  Better understanding of the genetic basis of structural birth defects will lead to new insights into human developmental biology and will provide targets for medical intervention and treatment. Recent large-scale genome and exome sequencing studies of birth defects have identified new risk genes, especially through the analysis of de novo variants in protein coding regions. However, we are still far from complete understanding of the genetic causes of birth defects. Estimates are that there are 400- 800 risk genes of large effect size for birth defects such as congenital heart disease, and the vast majority of these genes are unknown. This is primarily due to the lack of statistical power. While increasing sample size is essential and is part of the core deliverables of the Gabriella Miller Kids First (GMKF) programs, we also need to develop and apply new analytical methods that improve power and maximize the utility of the available genetic data by using other types of data and biological knowledge. In addition, in most prior studies, the analysis of rare genetic variation has been focused on small variants in the coding regions or large copy number variants (CNV). The data and methods to interrogate the contribution of rare noncoding variants is rudimentary, limiting our understanding of genetic architecture of these diseases. In this study, we propose two aims to address these questions by leverage GMKF cross-disease whole genome sequencing data sets: Specific Aim 1. Elucidate genetic architecture by cross-disease analysis of rare coding and non-coding variants. Specific Aim 2. Integrate gene expression with genome sequencing data to improve discovery and biological interpretation of risk genes of structural birth defects.  The proposed study will maximize the genetic discovery potential of the GMKF WGS data sets for birth defects and improve our understanding of the pleiotropic effects and tissue specificity of risk genes and variants. The analytical approaches developed in this study will be applicable to genetic data of birth defects and developmental disorders from future GMKF cohorts and other programs. Project Narrative We propose to analyze whole genome sequencing data from the Gabriella Miller Kids First cohorts using new computational approaches that maximize the risk gene discovery and improve interpretation of candidate genes.

"Next-generation, pathway-specific, polygenic risk scores PROJECT SUMMARY The key appeal of polygenic risk scores (PRS) is the provision of individual-level estimates of genetic liability to complex disease. These proxies of genetic liability enable a raft of applications across clinical and basic research settings. However, while PRS are set to play a pivotal role in the future of biomedical research, their present formulation is suboptimal since it fails to directly account for substructure in genetic disease risk. The overarching goal of our proposal is to introduce a new generation of pathway-specific PRS, informed by biological function. Rather a single genome-wide PRS for each individual, they will have a set of k PRS over k pathways. Pathways will be defined according to multiscale integration of ‘omics data, exploiting co-expression networks, the transcriptome and the epigenome. The key deliverable from this project will be the production of a powerful and comprehensive pathway-specific PRS computational tool, PRSet, informed by biological function. The rationale is that PRS calculated for individuals by aggregating the effects of all risk variants genome-wide, results in a loss of vital individual-level information. Providing pathway-specific estimates of genetic liability, computed in a scalable, statistically rigorous way, informed by latest multi-omic data, could enable researchers to better decompose heterogenous complex disease, identify key pathways that explain overlap or differences among disorders, and explain problems of portability of PRS between and within populations. Applying our pathway-specific PRS tool, we seek to stratify patients into more homogenous subgroups by their liability over key pathways. We will use PRSet for stratification in three ways: (i) stratifying within SCZ/BiP, testing if liability over different pathways forms multiple routes to disease, (ii) differentiating between SCZ and BiP, testing if key pathways differentiate these highly overlapping disorders, (iii) testing whether variation in treatment response can be explained by pathway liability. Such stratification could help explain past successes, failures and adverse-effects in clinical trials, and provide new therapeutic targets tailored to subsets of patients. Our proposal is significant because the burgeoning application of PRS means that any advance in the PRS approach will have immediate, high impact across psychiatric research. Pathway-specific PRS could open-up routes to hypotheses that cannot be answered by genome-wide PRS. If PRSet reveals that genetic liability is more stratified than presently modelled, then this would call for a focus on pathways and their multi-omic integration, paving a new path towards precision medicine. Our proposal is innovative because we develop the first pathway-specific, function-informed, PRS tool, we propose that disease risk may be influenced by multiple genetic liabilities, and we stratify patients according to pathway-specific genetic risk for the first time. In conclusion, our proposal delivers a tool for the field to perform powerful pathway PRS analyses, better understand genetic liability to disease, and which may offer a more direct route to precision medicine. PROJECT NARRATIVE Polygenic risk scores (PRS) are set to play a key role in advancing our understanding of the etiology and treatment of disease. While the application of genome-wide PRS is burgeoning across biomedical research, we propose that pathway-specific PRS have even greater potential to provide etiological insights and will help pave the way to precision medicine. Here we introduce a new generation of pathway-specific polygenic risk scores, informed by biological function, and deliver a comprehensive computational tool for their analysis, applying it to perform patient stratification in schizophrenia and bipolar disorders.","Next-generation, pathway-specific, polygenic risk scores",9947403,R01MH122866,"['Address', 'Adverse effects', 'Basic Science', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biomedical Research', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Environment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Etiology', 'Failure', 'Formulation', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genomics', 'Genotype-Tissue Expression Project', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Intuition', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Location', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Multiomic Data', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Production', 'Proxy', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Route', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Stratification', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Variant', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'disorder risk', 'epigenome', 'functional genomics', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'high risk', 'individualized prevention', 'innovation', 'insight', 'multiple omics', 'new therapeutic target', 'next generation', 'novel strategies', 'patient stratification', 'patient subsets', 'personalized medicine', 'personalized therapeutic', 'polygenic risk score', 'portability', 'precision medicine', 'prototype', 'rare variant', 'risk variant', 'statistical and machine learning', 'success', 'tool', 'trait', 'transcriptome', 'treatment response', 'user-friendly']",NIMH,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2020,545648,0.0052611005632804434
"Genetic neuroscience: How human genes and alleles shape neuronal phenotypes Genetic studies have identified many specific loci with significant associations to psychiatric disorders. However, unless we can develop useful approaches for systematically turning genetic information into neurobiological insights about brain disorders, there is a danger that costly and hard-won genetic findings will not be exploitable to understand pathophysiology and generate important therapeutic hypotheses. The goal of our collaborative, interdisciplinary effort is to develop powerful, generalizable approaches for discovering how risk variants for psychiatric disorders shape neurobiological processes at multiple levels of analysis, and to identify the processes whose dysregulation underlies disease. To do this, we propose to develop new experimental and inferential systems to bridge a longstanding gap between human genetics and experimental biology. We aim to identify biological causes and effects that span the genetic, molecular, and cellular levels of the nervous system. Our interdisciplinary team will develop new experimental systems that measure genetic influences across levels of analysis (RNA, proteins, and cellular function including physiology) in precise, scalable, well- controlled ways. We will make use of emerging cellular systems including three-dimensional cortical spheroids and organoids, and radically novel “population in a dish” experimental systems that collect data on cells from hundreds of donors in a shared environment, inferring donor identity at the time of phenotypic readout. The analysis of such systems in turn requires sophisticated inferential strategies and new ideas from computer science. We propose to develop and widely share experimental and computational resources, including cell lines, methods, datasets, and analytic tools. The successful completion of this work will identify key neurobiological processes for multiple psychiatric disorders, and fortify many other scientists in making such connections in their own work. We hope in so doing to create a new kind of interdisciplinary science that – by combining the strengths of data-driven, unbiased human genetics with the power of emerging experimental systems – transforms the rate at which human- genetic leads lead to insights about disease mechanisms. To better understand common, severe psychiatric illnesses and develop improved treatments for them, we need to understand what specific aspects of brain biology give rise to each disorder. Here a team of scientists with diverse areas of expertise – from neuroscience to computer science to psychiatry to human genetics to stem cell biology – come together to develop a set of next-generation scientific approaches to this important problem, and to generate new methods and data sets that we will widely share. Our team will work to understand how aspects of brain biology at many levels – genes, molecules, and cells – act upon one another to create vulnerability to psychiatric illness.",Genetic neuroscience: How human genes and alleles shape neuronal phenotypes,9989904,U01MH115727,"['3-Dimensional', 'Affect', 'Alleles', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Awareness', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'California', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell Line', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Communities', 'Computer Analysis', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Experimental Models', 'Functional disorder', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic study', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Investments', 'Ion Channel', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Microglia', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Mutation', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Organoids', 'Penetrance', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Psychiatry', 'RNA', 'Regenerative Medicine', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Shapes', 'System', 'Technology', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'cell type', 'computer science', 'computing resources', 'cost', 'cytokine', 'excitatory neuron', 'experimental study', 'genetic information', 'human data', 'improved', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'inhibitory neuron', 'innovation', 'insight', 'loss of function mutation', 'multidimensional data', 'neurophysiology', 'next generation', 'novel', 'protein expression', 'protein function', 'rare variant', 'response', 'risk variant', 'stem cell biology', 'translational neuroscience', 'whole genome']",NIMH,"BROAD INSTITUTE, INC.",U01,2020,4125261,0.019422575516076096
"Molecular Characterization of Joubert Syndrome Project Summary Congenital ataxia presents in early childhood with non-progressive hypotonia, gross motor, fine motor and cognitive delays. These disorders are distinct from the progressive ataxias because of the presence of congenital cerebellar malformations and because they are typically inherited recessively. Joubert Syndrome and Related Disorders (JSRD) constitute a major subset of these conditions, consisting of a cerebellar midline (vermis) malformation, a nearly pathognomonic Molar Tooth sign on brain Imaging (MTI) and co-existent oculomotor apraxia and episodic breathing dysrhythmias. In our published data, we have: 1] Identified ten unique genetic causes of JSRD (nearly half of the published causes), 2] Generated genotype-phenotype correlations involving cerebellar, retinal, renal, hepatic, digit, and cerebral manifestations. 3] Identified common founder mutations that allow for population-based screening. 4] Discovered that JSRD encoded proteins frequently localize to the cilium. 5] Identified ciliary transition zone (TZ) defects in cells with JSRD mutations. 6] Performed siRNA cell-based screens for defective ciliogenesis to prioritize candidate JSRD genes. 7] Generated and characterized multiple zebrafish, mouse and human cell culture models for JSRD. 8] Defined the concept of ‘Ciliary localization’ model, in which one JSRD gene is required for ciliary localization of other JSRD proteins. In our unpublished data we have: 1] Recruited an additional 200 JSRD patients without molecular diagnosis. 2] Performed whole exome (WES) and whole genome sequencing (WGS) on an additional 100 JSRD families. 3] Identified an additional 12 novel likely JSRD candidate genes. 4] Generated IPSCs and cerebellar organoids from mutation-positive and negative families to aid in functional analysis and gene discovery using RNAseq. 5] Begun functional validation of the putative mutations. 6] Developed methods to interrogate ciliary structure in a high-throughput fashion with electron microscopy (EM). The goal of this competing renewal is to identify the remaining ‘discoverable’ genes that lead to JSRD when lost, functionally validate mutations within the pathogenetic framework, and test the hypothesis that mutations in JSRD genes lead to collapse of the ciliary TZ. Because the majority of patients still have unknown cause of disease, this renewal aims to advance knowledge through molecular characterization of new genes, using newly evolving high-throughput techniques, integrated bioinformatics, and a unique resource of consanguineous families recruited world-wide. We further aim to validate these mutations in patient cells, within a mechanistic framework that JSRD genes are required for essential ciliary structural components during cerebellar development. Project Narrative Joubert syndrome is a genetically and phenotypically heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorder unified by defects of the cellular primary cilium.

"Center for Genetic Studies of Drug Abuse in Outbred Rats Project Summary (Overall)  The purpose of this renewal application is to continue the successful activities of our center, which uses quantitative genetic techniques to study the genetic basis of drug abuse-related behaviors in outbred rats. When our center was initially funded in June 2014, our goal was to develop outbred N/NIH heterogeneous stock (HS) rats as a platform for genetic studies of behaviors that were difficult or impossible to study in mice. The first four years of funding have allowed us to establish a vibrant community of investigators using HS rats to study drug abuse and other traits, which we refer to as an ecosystem. This ecosystem includes both the investigators who are directly involved in this renewal application and many others who have obtained separate funding, some from NIDA, and some from other sources. The growth of this ecosystem reflects one of the ways that our center has served as national resource. We are proposing three projects that involved phenotyping HS rats for a variety of traits, including intravenous cocaine and nicotine self-administration, response to novelty, social behavior, reaction time, and delay discounting. Two of those projects are continuations from the prior funding period and are designed to increase our sample size from 1,600 to 3,200 rats per phenotype. We present data showing that such an increase produces an exponential increase in the number of significant findings. This approach parallels human genetics studies of SUD, which have also benefited tremendously from larger sample sizes. We will use these data to conduct genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and a suite of related techniques. In addition, we will measure gene expression in behaviorally naïve rats using RNASeq and use those data to identify expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs). We will then integrate GWAS and eQTL data in an effort to identify specific genes that influence the behavioral phenotypes. Many of the behavioral domains being studied are known to be sexually dimorphic; our study will use both male and female rats, which will allow us to identify sex differences and sex by genotype interactions. We will also study genetic correlations, perform phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS), transcriptome wide association studies (TWAS) and explore a novel strategy called polygenic transcriptomic risk scores (PTRS), that is intended to allow translation of polygenic signals across species. Project 4 will use a network-based approach to extend our GWAS to account for known biological networks. This proposed renewal also includes a pilot project core to support new directions and take advantage of unforeseen opportunities. Finally we propose an administrative core that supports many activities of the center, including educational, career development and public outreach. The results of these studies will enhance our understanding of the role of genes in a range of psychologically complex behaviors and will provide novel biological insights that may support future efforts at preventing or treating drug abuse. Project Narrative (Overall)  Using powerful genetic, molecular and statistical techniques, we will study the genetic basis of traits that have well-established relevance to drug abuse. We expect that these studies will enhance our understanding of drug abuse and lead to the identification of specific genes and pathways. These discoveries will improve our understanding of genetic susceptibility to drug abuse in humans and may identify new opportunities to treat psychiatric disorders including but not limited to addiction.",Center for Genetic Studies of Drug Abuse in Outbred Rats,9971494,P50DA037844,"['Adolescent', 'Animal Model', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Brain region', 'Breeding', 'Cancer Grant Supplements (P30)', 'Cessation of life', 'Cocaine', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Crime', 'Cues', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Drug abuse', 'Ecosystem', 'Education', 'Esthesia', 'Female', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Recombination', 'Genetic Techniques', 'Genetic study', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Healthcare', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Human Genome', 'Impulsivity', 'Inbred Strains Rats', 'Individual', 'Intravenous', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Network-based', 'Nicotine', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Productivity', 'Quantitative Genetics', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Rattus', 'Reaction Time', 'Regulation', 'Relapse', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Self Administration', 'Sex Differences', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Reinforcement', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Translations', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'addiction', 'behavior influence', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'behavioral study', 'career development', 'cocaine use', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'design', 'discounting', 'drug abuse related behavior', 'effective therapy', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic approach', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'insight', 'male', 'nicotine use', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'outreach', 'phenome', 'phenotypic data', 'premature', 'preservation', 'prevent', 'psychologic', 'response', 'sex', 'sexual dimorphism', 'success', 'sustained attention', 'tool', 'trait', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'virtual', 'web site']",NIDA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",P50,2020,2985563,-0.042316647242394055
"Dissecting the pathogenesis and outcomes of PSC using multi-omics by studying the exposome and genome PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The major goal of this RC2 proposal is to generate the first, multi-omics translational study capturing the sum of environmental exposures (i.e. the exposome) and comprehensive data resource for Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC), a chronic, progressive liver disease without effective medical therapy. PSC shortens survival, is associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and strongly predisposes to cholangiocarcinoma (i.e. bile duct cancer) and colon cancer. Our recent genome wide association studies (GWAS) revealed the significant role of genetic variation in PSC, while also re-emphasizing the importance of environmental factors and gene-environment interactions in PSC pathogenesis. To further elucidate the role of exposures from our external environment and lifestyle (e.g., diet, stress, toxins, drugs, microbes), we have assembled a world-class, multi-disciplinary team that synergizes expertise and resources across four institutions: Mayo Clinic, Emory University, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), and University of Oslo, Norway. Our collaborative team will leverage large clinical databases and biorepositories, as well as expertise in PSC and related conditions, exposomics, metabolomics, methylomics, transcriptomics, metagenomics, genomics, and data analytics to develop the PSC Scientific Community Resource for hypothesis-generating science and simultaneously uncover factors contributing to PSC.  We now seek to define the bigger-picture cellular networks, rather than individual genes, driving disease processes. To do so, we will use unbiased network-based approaches designed to integrate multiple layers of omics data. Our proposal is predicated on the hypothesis that multi-omics analyses of data capturing environmental exposures and the associated biological responses, including the effect on the genome, will reveal networks or pathways influencing PSC pathogenesis and outcomes. To test this hypothesis, we will perform a series of sophisticated analyses to identify PSC-associated changes in and across the exposome, metabolome, methylome, and transcriptome in blood as well as the gut metagenome, exposome and metabolome.  Our collaboration and data generation are already underway with pilot studies demonstrating differences in blood exposomes and metabolomes and stool metagenomes between PSC patients and controls. Using a suite of bioinformatic tools and available genetic variation data, we aim to discover stable, detectable, omics-based disease signatures in blood (Aim 1) and stool (Aim 2) that when integrated with clinical data (Aim 3) will reveal biological pathways driving disease pathogenesis and outcomes. All data, residual specimens, and analytical details will be made freely available to the research community in accordance with NIDDK's mission. Furthermore, this effort responds to the NIDDK's call “to better understand the role of the microbiome, genetics, and exposome.” PROJECT NARRATIVE We seek to generate the first, multi-omics translational study and comprehensive data resource for Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC), a chronic, progressive liver disease without medical therapy. We will define the bigger-picture cellular networks and gene-environment interactions driving PSC by integrating multiple layers of -omics data. In so doing, we will identify molecular disease signatures, including environmental toxins, metabolism-related chemicals and gut bacteria, unique to PSC patients.",Dissecting the pathogenesis and outcomes of PSC using multi-omics by studying the exposome and genome,9986790,RC2DK118619,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Age', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bile duct carcinoma', 'Biological', 'Blood', 'Chemical Exposure', 'Chemicals', 'Childhood', 'Cholangiocarcinoma', 'Cholestasis', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collaborations', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Communities', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Feces', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'High Performance Computing', 'Illinois', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Institution', 'Life Style', 'Light', 'Link', 'Liver diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Medical', 'Metagenomics', 'Microbe', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Disease', 'Multiomic Data', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Network-based', 'Norway', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pesticides', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Research', 'Residual state', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Science', 'Series', 'Shotguns', 'Specimen', 'Stress', 'Sum', 'Systems Biology', 'Taxonomy', 'Testing', 'Toxic Environmental Substances', 'Toxin', 'Universities', 'base', 'biobank', 'bioinformatics tool', 'clinical database', 'data integration', 'data resource', 'design', 'gene environment interaction', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic data', 'gut bacteria', 'gut metagenome', 'gut microbiota', 'improved', 'inflammatory disease of the intestine', 'innovation', 'liver transplantation', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'metagenome', 'methylation pattern', 'methylome', 'methylomics', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple omics', 'novel', 'patient population', 'peripheral blood', 'personalized approach', 'pollutant', 'primary outcome', 'primary sclerosing cholangitis', 'programs', 'response', 'sex', 'toxin metabolism', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'translational study']",NIDDK,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,RC2,2020,1547338,-0.015080428358440992
"Gene-Environment Interactions in Glaucoma Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is the leading cause of chronic optic neuropathy and a major source of ocular morbidity worldwide. Understanding preclinical events, early phase disease and disease heterogeneity represent key objectives in early disease detection, prevention and treatment of POAG. In this study, we propose 4 specific aims. 1) We will perform both targeted and untargeted metabolome-wide association studies (MWAS) for POAG using pre-clinical serum from a large case-control group (500 cases and 500 controls) nested within ongoing prospective studies of the Nurses' Health Study (NHS), NHS2, and Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS) to advance our understanding of the biochemical events that precede POAG diagnosis (blood was collected ~ 10 years prior to disease diagnosis). Prior studies suggest that nitric oxide metabolites represent genetically informed markers and will form the basis for targeted profiling. 2) While considerable discoveries have been made of POAG genes, more work is needed to leverage genome-wide information to inform POAG etiology. Thus, we will create a genome-wide genetic correlation matrix between POAG and complex traits previously linked to POAG, using data from the NEIGHBORHOOD (National Eye Institute Glaucoma Human Genetics Collaboration Heritable Overall Operational Database; 3800 POAG cases) consortium and publicly available summary genome-wide association study data. An assessment of the shared heritability between POAG and these traits as well as the relation between the genetic risk scores for these traits and POAG will lead to new etiologic insights. 3) New-onset POAG is clinically heterogeneous with variable visual field (VF) loss patterns that may reflect different etiologies. We will apply archetype analysis, which objectively quantifies a patient's VF loss pattern to 16 existing clinically validated archetypes (ATs), 9 of which are glaucomatous in nature. Each POAG case (n=1250 from NHS, NHS2 and HPFS) and10 matched controls will be assigned 16 weighted coefficients that add up to 1, with each value representing how consistent his / her VF loss pattern is with each glaucomatous AT. We will evaluate the differential relation between established POAG risk factors and the values on the 16 ATs, to identify unique risk factors for homogeneous incident POAG subtypes. 4) A carbohydrate-restricted diet may meet the energy requirement in the non-myelinated retinal ganglion cell axon segment of the optic nerve and reduce risk of POAG. We will conduct a prospective evaluation of this exposure in relation to POAG and POAG subtypes in the 3 cohorts (n=2100 cases). By integrating MWAS, genomics with prospective environmental exposure data and AT analysis, this proposal addresses a number of important knowledge gaps—in particular, it will shed light on how genetic and pre-diagnostic risk factors influence POAG and POAG heterogeneity. Linking specific exposures with POAG subtypes will provide important mechanistic understanding as well as evidence of causality, which will contribute to discovering precision medicine approaches for this condition. Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is an intraocular pressure-related chronic optic nerve disease that produces characteristic visual loss patterns. In this proposal we will study a host of genes, plasma metabolites and environmental factors in relation to POAG overall as well as it's objectively determined subtypes based on visual loss pattern. Understanding how these various exposures relate to POAG and it's subtypes will highlight disease prevention strategies and precision medical treatment options for this potentially blinding disease that requires lifetime management.",Gene-Environment Interactions in Glaucoma,9933925,R01EY015473,"['Acetyl Coenzyme A', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Archives', 'Arginine', 'Axon', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biogenesis', 'Blindness', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Carbohydrates', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Citrulline', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Family', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genomics', 'Glaucoma', 'Health Professional', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human Genetics', 'Impairment', 'Knowledge', 'Life Style', 'Light', 'Link', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Metabolism', 'Mitochondria', 'Modification', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Eye Institute', 'Nature', 'Neighborhoods', 'Nested Case-Control Study', 'Nitric Oxide', 'Nitric Oxide Pathway', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Nurses&apos', ' Health Study', 'Optic Nerve', 'Ornithine', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral', 'Phase', 'Physiologic Intraocular Pressure', 'Plasma', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive', 'Primary Open Angle Glaucoma', 'Prospective Studies', 'Prospective cohort', 'Recording of previous events', 'Retinal Ganglion Cells', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Thinness', 'Visual', 'Visual Fields', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'beta-Hydroxybutyrate', 'case control', 'cohort', 'common treatment', 'dietary restriction', 'disability', 'disease diagnosis', 'disease heterogeneity', 'disorder prevention', 'follow-up', 'gene environment interaction', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'insight', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'mitochondrial dysfunction', 'novel', 'optic nerve disorder', 'pre-clinical', 'precision medicine', 'prospective', 'secondary analysis', 'targeted treatment', 'time interval', 'trait']",NEI,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2020,546195,0.0007110439357201051
"Tinnitus: Audiological measures and genetic susceptibility PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Tinnitus, the phantom perception of sound in absence of an external sound source, is a prevalent hearing disorder. To date, the exact neural and molecular mechanisms underlying tinnitus are not known. Tinnitus is associated with a number of otological diseases and clinical conditions; however, almost 50% of tinnitus cases are not attributable to any known cause (Stouffer & Tyler, 1990). There is likely a genetic component to tinnitus (Sand et al, 2007). A critical gap in the knowledge base is how to clinically identify those who are genetically predisposed to tinnitus well before they acquire this hearing health issue. The short-term goal of this R21 Early Career Research PAR 16-057 application, entitled “Tinnitus: Audiological measures and genetic susceptibility,” is to identify detailed phenotypic and genotypic profiles of chronic tinnitus in young adults. The application is proposed by a team of researchers: The PI is Ishan Bhatt, Ph.D. in audiology (CCC-A, FAAA), who is working with Co-PI’s Jason Wilder, Ph.D. in genetics, Jin Wang, Ph.D. in statistics, and Raquel Dias, Ph.D. in Bioinformatics. This project will fill the gap in knowledge by identifying the critical variables associated with a genetic predisposition to CT. This investigation will include college-aged young participants to control for age- related confounding variables such as systemic diseases and hearing loss. According to the PI’s pilot study (Bhatt, 2017a), the estimated prevalence of chronic tinnitus (CT), acute tinnitus (AT) and no tinnitus (NT) is around 8%, 13% and 79%, respectively. To accomplish our short-term goal, we will conduct a case-control- control exonic genome-wide association study (GWAS) (N = 300) in which subjects will be divided into three groups: those with (1) CT (tinnitus for > 1 year; n=100), (2) AT (tinnitus for ≤ 1 year, presumably due to acute environmental exposure; n=100); and (3) NT (no experience of tinnitus in a lifetime; n=100). The Specific Aims are: (1) to identify associations between exonic Single Nucleotide Polymorhisms (SNPs) and tinnitus phenotype. Based on the criteria laid out in the preliminary studies (Bhatt, 2017a; Bhatt et al., 2016; Phillip et al., 2015), our working hypothesis is that causal SNPs will exhibit a higher frequency of a specific genotype for subjects with CT compared to subjects with AT and NT. (2) To identify association between selected SNPs in a candidate set of genes and audiologic measures among subjects with CT, AT and NT, Based on our preliminary studies (Bhatt et al., 2016, Phillips et al., 2015), our working hypothesis is that subjects with causal alleles for CT will exhibit pathophysiological variation in the audiometric measures. Significance: Successful completion of this project will enable us to identify phenotypic and genotypic profiles of CT. This will help us to achieve our long term goal, which is to develop a genetic Risk Profile that can be used by health-care providers, and educators (e.g., health professionals, music and industrial arts teachers) to identify individuals genetically at risk for CT.
